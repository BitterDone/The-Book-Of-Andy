    You’ve got two main ways to clear out Meilisearch and start completely fresh:

    ---

    ### 1. **Delete just the `transcripts` index**

    This wipes only your index + docs, but leaves the database and config intact:

    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer MASTER_KEY" \
    http://localhost:7700/indexes/transcripts
    ```

    After that, your `embed_new.py` will automatically recreate the index the next time it runs.

    ---

    ### 2. **Delete *all* indexes at once**

    Loop through them with curl:

    ```bash
    curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer MASTER_KEY" http://localhost:7700/indexes \
    | jq -r '.results[].uid' \
    | xargs -I {} curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer MASTER_KEY" http://localhost:7700/indexes/{}
    ```

    (Needs `jq` installed, otherwise you can just copy/paste the `uid`s from the `/indexes` response.)

    ---

    ### 3. **Nuke the database completely**

    If you want a truly fresh Meilisearch (no leftover indexes, tasks, or settings), stop the container and **remove the volume** where the DB is stored.
    In your setup that’s probably `./meili_data`:

    ```bash
    podman-compose down
    rm -rf ./meili_data/*
    podman-compose up -d
    ```

    This is the “factory reset” option.

    ---

    ⚡ I’d suggest you try **#1 first** (delete just the `transcripts` index) since it’s the least destructive and will let your pipeline rebuild cleanly.

    Do you want me to modify `embed_new.py` so it can optionally **force-reset the index** itself (delete + recreate), instead of you having to run `curl` each time?
----------------------
    How do I test if documents were successfully loaded into meilisearch
----------------------
    Great question 👍 Once you’ve run `embed_new.py` or `preload_meili.py`, you can confirm the documents actually landed in Meilisearch with a few simple `curl` calls:

    ---

    ### 1. Check index metadata

    See if the index exists and how many docs it reports:

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer MASTER_KEY" http://localhost:7700/indexes/transcripts
    ```

    You should see something like:

    ```json
    {
    "uid": "transcripts",
    "createdAt": "...",
    "updatedAt": "...",
    "primaryKey": "id",
    "numberOfDocuments": 394
    }
    ```

    👉 `numberOfDocuments` tells you how many docs are stored.

    ---

    ### 2. Retrieve some documents

    Fetch the first 5 documents:

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer MASTER_KEY" \
    "http://localhost:7700/indexes/transcripts/documents?limit=5"
    ```

    If things are working, you’ll get back JSON with your transcript text and embeddings:

    ```json
    {
    "results": [
        {
        "id": "001-podcast-episode-1.txt",
        "text": "Transcript content...",
        "embedding": [0.12, -0.34, ...]
        },
        ...
    ],
    "limit": 5,
    "total": 394
    }
    ```

    ---

    ### 3. Search for text in transcripts

    Test a real query:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer MASTER_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    "http://localhost:7700/indexes/transcripts/search" \
    --data '{"q": "Biden"}'
    ```

    This should return any transcripts containing “Biden”.

    ---

    ### 4. Check for failed tasks (if docs aren’t showing up)

    Sometimes documents are rejected (e.g. invalid IDs). Check task status:

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer MASTER_KEY" \
    "http://localhost:7700/tasks?limit=5"
    ```

    ---

    ⚡ If `numberOfDocuments` is **0**, it means the docs weren’t accepted (maybe bad IDs, invalid JSON, etc.), even if your script thought it loaded them.

    Do you want me to give you a **minimal Python snippet** (instead of curl) so you can quickly check inside the `embedder` container whether the docs are really there?
----------------------
    I'm confused. I used the factory reset option by stopping the containers and rm -rf meili_data/*, but I see this log message:
    [embedder]    | [✓] Preloaded 1182 transcript documents into Meilisearch.
    I only have 394 text files, which is 1/3 of 1182
----------------------
    Ah! That makes sense — the mismatch comes from **how `embed_new.py` builds `precomputed_transcripts.json`**.

    Even if you cleared `meili_data`, your `precomputed_transcripts.json` file **still exists** in the `/search-app/data` volume. The script does this:

    ```python
    if os.path.exists(PRECOMPUTED_FILE) and os.path.getsize(PRECOMPUTED_FILE) > 0:
        precomputed = json.load(f)  # loads old entries
    else:
        precomputed = []
    ```

    Then it loops over the transcript files, **skipping any files already in `precomputed`**, and appends new ones. Finally, it writes **all entries back** to the same JSON file and loads them into Meilisearch.

    So if your JSON still had old entries from previous runs (e.g., old transcripts or duplicates), the script will preload them all again — which explains why you saw **1182 documents** instead of 394.

    ---

    ### ✅ How to truly start fresh

    1. Stop containers:

    ```bash
    podman-compose down
    ```

    2. Clear Meilisearch data:

    ```bash
    rm -rf ./meili_data/*
    ```

    3. Clear the precomputed transcripts JSON:

    ```bash
    > ./search-app/data/precomputed_transcripts.json
    ```

    or delete it entirely:

    ```bash
    rm ./search-app/data/precomputed_transcripts.json
    ```

    4. Start containers again:

    ```bash
    podman-compose up --build
    ```

    Now `embed_new.py` will regenerate `precomputed_transcripts.json` from scratch, and Meilisearch will get exactly **394 documents** (your actual text files).

    ---

    If you want, I can also show a **safe way to make `embed_new.py` always start fresh**, so you don’t have to manually delete the JSON every time. This avoids these inflated counts. Do you want me to do that?
----------------------
    It looks like there's a problem with the vectors:
    [embedder]    | [✓] Preloaded 394 transcript documents into Meilisearch.
    [meilisearch] | 2025-09-07T19:39:24.434771Z  WARN index_scheduler::scheduler: Batch failed while doing: {"steps":[{"currentStep":"processing tasks","finished":0,"total":2},{"currentStep":"indexing","finished":2,"total":3},{"currentStep":"waiting for extractors","finished":11,"total":16}],"percentage":44.791668}
    [meilisearch] | 2025-09-07T19:39:24.434908Z ERROR index_scheduler::scheduler: Batch failed Index `transcripts`: While embedding documents for embedder `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`: no vectors provided for document `653__Andy___DJ_CTI__Media_Admits_Biden_Was_Involve___9937dc45a97f_` and at least 99 other document(s)
    [meilisearch] | - Note: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` has `source: userProvided`, so documents must provide embeddings as an array in `_vectors.all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
----------------------

    Ah — this explains the issue. Meilisearch **v1.15+** now expects **user-provided embeddings** to live in a **special `_vectors` field** inside each document. Simply putting the embedding under `"embedding"` (as you currently do in `embed_new.py`) won’t work.

    For example, each document should look like this for the `"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"` embedder:

    ```json
    {
    "id": "653__Andy___DJ_CTI__Media_Admits_Biden_Was_Involve___9937dc45a97f_",
    "text": "full transcript text...",
    "_vectors": {
        "all-MiniLM-L6-v2": [0.012, -0.034, 0.45, ...]  // your 384-dim vector
    }
    }
    ```

    ### How to fix `embed_new.py`

    1. Change the line where you append documents:

    ```python
    precomputed.append({
        "id": file,
        "text": text,
        "_vectors": {"all-MiniLM-L6-v2": embedding}
    })
    ```

    instead of:

    ```python
    precomputed.append({"id": file, "text": text, "embedding": embedding})
    ```

    2. That’s it — you don’t need to modify the index settings; the user-provided embedder `"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"` already exists.

    ---

    After that:

    * Clear Meilisearch (delete `meili_data/*`)
    * Clear `precomputed_transcripts.json`
    * Restart your containers (`podman-compose up --build`)

    You should then see all documents successfully indexed with embeddings.

    ---

    I can rewrite the full `embed_new.py` with this fix applied so it’s ready to go. Do you want me to do that?
----------------------
    I added the change, cleared meilisearch data, and deleted precomputed_transcripts.json, but I don't see a numberOfDocuments key / value when I run 
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer MASTER_KEY" http://localhost:7700/indexes/transcripts

    Also, this command
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer MASTER_KEY" "http://localhost:7700/indexes/transcripts/documents?limit=5"

    returns {"results":[],"offset":0,"limit":5,"total":0}
----------------------

    Ah — that makes sense given Meilisearch v1.15+’s behavior with **user-provided embeddings**. Here’s what’s likely happening:

    1. You updated `embed_new.py` to use `_vectors` correctly. ✅
    2. However, **the `_vectors` field is only used if the embedder is correctly registered in the index settings**. If the index is newly created, you need to **explicitly add the embedder configuration** before indexing documents. Otherwise, Meilisearch ignores the `_vectors` field, resulting in 0 documents being stored.

    With v1.15+:

    * When using `source: userProvided` embedder, you must include the embedder in index settings **before adding documents**.
    * Each document must have `_vectors["<embedder_name>"]`.

    So the correct workflow is:

    ```python
    index.update_settings({
        "embedders": {
            "all-MiniLM-L6-v2": {
                "source": "userProvided",
                "dimensions": 384
            }
        }
    })
    ```

    Then add your documents with `_vectors["all-MiniLM-L6-v2"]`.

    Without the `embedders` setting, Meilisearch silently ignores `_vectors`, and the documents never appear, which explains why `numberOfDocuments` is 0 and why `documents?limit=5` returns an empty list.

    ---

    If you want, I can provide a **full corrected `embed_new.py`** that:

    1. Creates the index if it doesn’t exist.
    2. Configures the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedder properly.
    3. Saves documents with `_vectors`.
    4. Handles precomputed JSON safely.

    It should work end-to-end with Meilisearch v1.15+.

    Do you want me to do that?
