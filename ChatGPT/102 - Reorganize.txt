--------------------------------
    Let's continue with the podcast transcription and storing transcripts line-by-line in Meilisearch.

    Before storing transcripts, I want to ensure they're as accurate as possible. 

    First, I noticed gaps in the timestamps. Some gaps were small, 0 to 4 seconds, but others were as large as 26 or 35 seconds.

    Second, I noticed some transcribed words and phrases are close, but not exactly what was said. For example, "smoke and mirrors" was transcribed as "smoking mirrors". "Jewelry box" in the outro song was transcribed as "jury box", and "booty swole" was transcribed as "booted slow". I understand music and lyrics can be more difficult, but can any improvements be made by model configuration, cloud GPU instance selection, or code optimization?

    Third, I noticed the first timestamp only starts at 16 seconds into the audio. It missed the first few sentences of the introduction. How can we make sure the entire audio file is transcribed?
--------------------------------
    Great — you’re already spotting the kinds of issues that matter before pushing text into Meilisearch. Let’s address each of your three concerns:

    ---

    ### 1. **Gaps in timestamps (0–35s)**

    These usually come from the transcription model’s **chunking strategy**:

    * Most ASR (automatic speech recognition) pipelines don’t run on the entire file at once — they split the audio into windows (e.g., 30s–60s segments).
    * If the segmenter isn’t overlapping slightly, or if voice activity detection (VAD) is cutting too aggressively, you’ll see gaps.

    **Fixes:**

    * **Use overlapping windows:** When splitting, overlap each window by \~5s so words at the boundary aren’t dropped.
    * **Use VAD-aware segmentation:** Tools like [pyannote.audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) or WebRTC VAD can cut on actual speech, not arbitrary windows.
    * **Force-align timestamps after transcription:** Libraries like [`aeneas`](https://github.com/readbeyond/aeneas) or [`whisperx`](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) can re-align text with audio at word-level, tightening gaps.

    ---

    ### 2. **Misheard phrases (“smoking mirrors”, “jury box”, “booted slow”)**

    This is a classic **acoustic + language model** problem:

    * **Music/lyrics:** ASR models struggle more because the acoustics differ from normal speech.
    * **Rare phrases:** If the LM doesn’t expect a phrase, it substitutes with the closest phonetic/semantic match.

    **Ways to improve accuracy:**

    * **Model choice:**

    * Larger Whisper models (e.g., *large-v3*) handle nuance better than *small/base*.
    * If you’re GPU-limited, you could transcribe with *medium* and post-correct with a lightweight LM.
    * **GPU instance:** Faster GPUs (A100/H100) don’t improve raw accuracy — but they let you run *larger models* within reasonable time. That’s where accuracy gain comes from.
    * **Custom language biasing:** Some frameworks allow “hotwords” or a custom vocabulary (e.g., giving extra weight to words like “smoke and mirrors”).
    * **Post-processing correction:** Run a correction pass using something like `symspellpy` or even a fine-tuned LM that “snaps” likely mishearings to known idioms.

    ---

    ### 3. **Missing the first 16s**

    This usually means the **preprocessing skipped silence** or the **decoder delayed output**:

    * Whisper and similar models sometimes discard leading silence automatically. If the intro was quiet with soft music + talking, VAD might have cut it.
    * Another possibility: the script you used didn’t start transcription at `t=0`, maybe because of a buffering offset.

    **Fixes:**

    * Double-check the audio loading function — ensure you’re not trimming silence (`ffmpeg` often normalizes start times).
    * Force transcription to begin at 0. Even if the first seconds are “empty”, you’ll capture anything spoken.
    * If you’re using Whisper, add `--no-silence-trim` (or equivalent flag depending on the wrapper).

    ---

    ✅ **Recommended approach for you before storing in Meilisearch:**

    1. Use **WhisperX** (it handles word-level alignment, reduces gaps, and gives better timestamps).
    2. Run with a **medium or large model** if GPU budget allows.
    3. Add a **post-processing correction pass** (dictionary of idioms, brand names, guest names, etc.).
    4. Segment line-by-line after word alignment → perfect for search indexing.

    ---

    Would you like me to draft a **pipeline design** that shows how to go from raw audio → WhisperX alignment → correction → line-by-line storage in Meilisearch? That way you’ll see exactly where to handle gaps, mishearings, and intro trimming.

--------------------------------

    Thanks for sharing the script — this helps a lot. I’ll break my review into the **three issues you identified** and show exactly where and how the script could be improved.

    ---

    ## 🔎 Analysis of Current Script

    * Uses `whisper.transcribe()` with `word_timestamps=True` for segmentation. This gives you timestamps, but Whisper’s built-in alignment isn’t super tight, which explains **gaps**.
    * Misheard phrases come from:

    * Using the `base` model → weaker language modeling.
    * No hotwording / custom LM post-processing.
    * Missing the first 16s is probably because `ffmpeg` conversion is fine, but Whisper sometimes trims leading silence by default and diarization starts later.

    ---

    ## ✅ Suggested Changes

    ### 1. Fix **timestamp gaps**

    * Instead of raw Whisper timestamps, run **WhisperX** after transcription. WhisperX re-aligns words against audio → no missing chunks.
    * If you want to stay in Whisper only:

    * Add `condition_on_previous_text=True` in `transcribe()` to keep context across segments.
    * Add **sliding window overlap** (e.g., 5s) when splitting audio.
    * Your `fill_gaps` logic with diarization is good, but it’s only patching after the fact.

    **Code change inside `transcribe_with_speakers`:**

    ```python
    result = model.transcribe(
        audio_file,
        word_timestamps=True,
        condition_on_previous_text=True,   # keeps context
        no_speech_threshold=0.2,           # reduce false "gaps"
        logprob_threshold=-1.0             # more aggressive decoding
    )
    ```

    ---

    ### 2. Improve **phrase accuracy**

    * **Upgrade model** from `"base"` → `"medium"` or `"large"`. This will cost more GPU, but accuracy increases a lot.
    * Add a **post-processing correction pass**:

    * Example: build a dictionary of likely phrases (`{"smoking mirrors": "smoke and mirrors", "jury box": "jewelry box"}`).
    * Use regex substitution or a library like `symspellpy` for common corrections.

    **New helper function:**

    ```python
    COMMON_FIXES = {
        "smoking mirrors": "smoke and mirrors",
        "jury box": "jewelry box",
        "booted slow": "booty swole",
    }

    def apply_corrections(text: str) -> str:
        for wrong, right in COMMON_FIXES.items():
            text = text.replace(wrong, right)
        return text
    ```

    Then call this before writing transcript:

    ```python
    transcript = apply_corrections(transcript)
    ```

    ---

    ### 3. Capture **the first seconds**

    * Whisper sometimes skips initial silence. You can disable that with `initial_prompt` and flags:

    ```python
    result = model.transcribe(
        audio_file,
        word_timestamps=True,
        condition_on_previous_text=True,
        suppress_blank=False  # <-- keep even low-energy start
    )
    ```

    * Also, ensure ffmpeg isn’t trimming:

    ```bash
    ffmpeg -y -i infile -ac 1 -ar 16000 -af "apad=pad_dur=2" outfile.wav
    ```

    The `apad` filter guarantees at least a 2s buffer at start/end.

    ---

    ### 4. Minor script adjustments

    * In `main()`, your diarization on/off print messages are swapped:

    ```python
    if args.diarize.lower() == "on":
        print(f"[*] Transcribing with speakers...")   # not "without speakers"
        transcript = transcribe_with_speakers(...)
    else:
        print(f"[*] Transcribing without speakers...")
        transcript = transcribe(...)
    ```

    ---

    ## 🚀 Pipeline Upgrade Recommendation

    If you’re open to external packages:

    1. Replace Whisper with **WhisperX** → better alignment, no timestamp gaps.
    2. Add **post-correction dictionary** for misheard phrases.
    3. Use `"medium"` or `"large-v3"` Whisper model on a stronger GPU → much better phrase accuracy.
    4. Add `suppress_blank=False` + ffmpeg `apad` to keep the intro.

    ---

    Do you want me to **rewrite your `run-transcription.py` script** with these fixes (WhisperX optional, phrase correction, intro capture, gap-filling), so you have a ready-to-run improved version?
--------------------------------
    Yes, but let's move through each on individually. Start with #1 by replacing whisper with whisperx
--------------------------------
    Perfect — let’s start with **Step 1: Replacing Whisper with WhisperX**.

    WhisperX is a wrapper around Whisper + forced alignment. It uses Whisper to get the text, then realigns at word-level with [MFA (Montreal Forced Aligner)](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/) models. This eliminates timestamp gaps.

    ---

    ## 🔧 Installation

    Make sure you have WhisperX installed (different from OpenAI Whisper):

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/m-bain/whisperx.git
    ```

    And also `ffmpeg` (you already use it).

    ---

    ## 📝 Script Changes

    ### 1. Imports

    Replace:

    ```python
    import whisper
    ```

    with:

    ```python
    import whisperx
    ```

    ---

    ### 2. Load Model

    Replace:

    ```python
    model = whisper.load_model(WHISPER_MODEL)
    ```

    with:

    ```python
    device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
    model = whisperx.load_model(WHISPER_MODEL, device)
    ```

    ---

    ### 3. Transcribe

    Replace:

    ```python
    result = model.transcribe(audio_file, word_timestamps=True)
    ```

    with:

    ```python
    # Step 1: Transcribe with WhisperX
    result = model.transcribe(audio_file)

    # Step 2: Load alignment model (language-specific)
    align_model, metadata = whisperx.load_align_model(
        language_code=result["language"], device=device
    )

    # Step 3: Perform alignment for accurate word-level timestamps
    result_aligned = whisperx.align(
        result["segments"], align_model, metadata, audio_file, device
    )
    ```

    Now you’ll have `result_aligned["segments"]` and `result_aligned["word_segments"]` — the latter fixes your gap issue.

    ---

    ### 4. Use Aligned Segments

    In your `transcribe_with_speakers` function, replace:

    ```python
    for seg in result["segments"]:
        start = seg["start"]
        end = seg["end"]
        text = seg["text"].strip()
    ```

    with:

    ```python
    for seg in result_aligned["segments"]:
        start = seg["start"]
        end = seg["end"]
        text = seg["text"].strip()
    ```

    Everything else (speaker diarization, sorting) can stay the same.

    ---

    ## ✅ Benefit

    * Word-level timestamps → no gaps between phrases.
    * More precise segment boundaries → better speaker alignment too.
    * Still integrates with your diarization pipeline.

    ---

    👉 Do you want me to show you the **full updated `transcribe_with_speakers` function** rewritten with WhisperX so you can drop it straight into your script?
--------------------------------
    In # Step 2 of the 3. Transcribe portion, do I need to customize "language" in this line:
    language_code=result["language"], device=device
--------------------------------
    Good catch — in that line you normally **don’t need to customize** the `language_code`.

    Here’s why:

    * `result["language"]` comes from the WhisperX transcription step.
    * WhisperX detects the spoken language automatically and passes the correct ISO code (e.g. `"en"`, `"es"`, `"fr"`).
    * That’s what `load_align_model()` needs to know which phoneme model to load.

    So this works fine for your podcasts without modification:

    ```python
    align_model, metadata = whisperx.load_align_model(
        language_code=result["language"], device=device
    )
    ```

    ---

    ### When would you override it?

    * If you **know the audio is always English** and want to skip detection:

    ```python
    align_model, metadata = whisperx.load_align_model("en", device=device)
    ```
    * If Whisper misdetects language (rare in podcasts, but possible if there’s background music, mixed speech, or short intros).

    ---

    👉 Do you want me to rewrite your `transcribe_with_speakers` function now using WhisperX, so you can just drop it in?
--------------------------------
    No, I made the changes. We can review the entire file if we get errors when running it. 

    Let's move on to #2 Add post-correction dictionary for misheard phrases.
--------------------------------
    Perfect — let’s add **Step 2: post-correction dictionary** to catch those “smoking mirrors” → “smoke and mirrors” type errors before the transcript is saved.

    ---

    ## 🔧 Implementation

    ### 1. Define a dictionary

    At the top of your script (near config), add something like:

    ```python
    # Common misheard phrase corrections
    COMMON_FIXES = {
        "smoking mirrors": "smoke and mirrors",
        "jury box": "jewelry box",
        "booted slow": "booty swole",
        # add more as you encounter them
    }
    ```

    ---

    ### 2. Add a helper function

    ```python
    def apply_corrections(text: str) -> str:
        """Apply common misheard phrase corrections to transcript text"""
        for wrong, right in COMMON_FIXES.items():
            # case-insensitive replace
            text = text.replace(wrong, right)
            text = text.replace(wrong.capitalize(), right.capitalize())
        return text
    ```

    ---

    ### 3. Apply before saving

    In **both** transcription paths (`transcribe_with_speakers` and `transcribe`), wrap the final text:

    For diarization path:

    ```python
    return apply_corrections("\n".join(lines))
    ```

    For plain transcription:

    ```python
    return apply_corrections(result["text"])
    ```

    ## 🚀 Optional Enhancements

    * Instead of hard-coding, you could keep corrections in a JSON or YAML file and load dynamically.
    * If you want fuzzy correction (like catching “smokin mirrors” too), integrate [`symspellpy`](https://github.com/mammothb/symspellpy) or spaCy with a custom vocabulary.

    ---

    👉 Do you want me to extend this beyond a **static dictionary** and show you how to set up a lightweight **fuzzy matcher** so you don’t have to manually add every mishearing?
--------------------------------
    Maybe in the future. For now, let's move on to #3 Use "medium" or "large-v3" Whisper model on a stronger GPU
--------------------------------
    Great — let’s tackle **Step 3: Upgrading to a stronger Whisper model (`medium` or `large-v3`)**.

    ---

    ## 🔎 Why this matters

    * The **model size** is the single biggest factor in improving accuracy (especially for tricky phrases, slang, or fast talk).
    * GPU type doesn’t change accuracy, but a stronger GPU lets you run bigger models **within practical time and memory limits**.

    For example:

    * `base` → fast, lightweight, but weaker language modeling.
    * `medium` → \~4× bigger, noticeably more accurate.
    * `large-v3` → SOTA accuracy, but heavy (\~10–12 GB VRAM needed).

    ---

    ## 🔧 Script Changes

    ### 1. Config change

    Right now your script has:

    ```python
    WHISPER_MODEL = "base"  # tiny, base, small, medium, large
    ```

    Change it to:

    ```python
    WHISPER_MODEL = "large-v3"  # or "medium" if you want a balance
    ```

    WhisperX supports `"large-v3"` directly.

    ---

    ### 2. GPU selection

    In the WhisperX initialization, we already set:

    ```python
    device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
    model = whisperx.load_model(WHISPER_MODEL, device)
    ```

    This is fine — if you run on a cloud GPU with enough VRAM, it’ll automatically use it.

    ---

    ### 3. Memory considerations

    * `large-v3` requires \~10 GB VRAM minimum. An A100 (40GB) or H100 is safe.
    * `medium` requires \~5 GB VRAM. Runs fine on cheaper GPUs like T4.
    * If you hit out-of-memory errors:

    * Fall back to `medium`.
    * Or enable `compute_type="int8"` for quantization:

        ```python
        model = whisperx.load_model(WHISPER_MODEL, device, compute_type="int8")
        ```

    ---

    ## ✅ Outcome

    * Accuracy on conversational podcasts will improve a lot.
    * Misheard idioms and phrases (your earlier examples) should drop significantly even before correction dictionary is applied.
    * Diarization alignment also works better with higher-quality segments.

    ---

    👉 Do you want me to also recommend **specific GPU instances** (e.g., A100 vs T4 vs H100) for best cost/performance when running `large-v3` vs `medium`?
--------------------------------
    Let's continue with #4 Add suppress_blank=False + ffmpeg apad to keep the intro.
--------------------------------
    Perfect — let’s tackle **Step 4: capturing the very beginning of the audio**, which fixes the “first 16 seconds missing” problem. We’ll handle it on **two fronts**: WhisperX transcription options and audio preprocessing with `ffmpeg`.

    ---

    ## 1️⃣ WhisperX / Whisper Fix: `suppress_blank=False`

    By default, Whisper suppresses low-confidence segments, which can cut off quiet intros. Setting `suppress_blank=False` prevents this:

    ```python
    result = model.transcribe(
        audio_file,
        word_timestamps=True,
        condition_on_previous_text=True,
        suppress_blank=False  # <-- keep even low-energy start
    )
    ```

    * `condition_on_previous_text=True` → ensures context is preserved across segments.
    * `suppress_blank=False` → ensures Whisper doesn’t drop the first seconds of quiet speech or soft music.

    ---

    ## 2️⃣ ffmpeg Fix: `apad` filter

    Sometimes, the very start of audio is silent or soft, and Whisper/X alignment fails. We can **pad the audio** so that even a short intro is processed:

    ```python
    def clean_audio(infile: str, outfile: str):
        """Convert audio to mono 16kHz WAV for Whisper, pad start/end to keep intro/outro"""
        subprocess.run([
            "ffmpeg", "-y", "-i", infile,
            "-ac", "1", "-ar", "16000",
            "-af", "apad=pad_dur=2",  # pad 2 seconds of silence at start and end
            outfile
        ], check=True, stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    ```

    * `apad=pad_dur=2` → ensures at least 2 seconds of audio padding at start/end.
    * This prevents Whisper from missing the very first few words due to soft volume.
    * You can increase `pad_dur` if intros are longer or quieter.

    ---

    ### ✅ How it fits together

    1. `ffmpeg` pads the audio → guarantees some buffer at the start.
    2. WhisperX with `suppress_blank=False` → ensures transcription captures even quiet speech.
    3. Alignment → gives word-level timestamps including the intro.

    ---

    This should completely fix the issue of missing the first \~16 seconds.

    ---

    If you want, I can now **draft a final “all-in-one” snippet** showing the combined changes: WhisperX, post-corrections, large model, suppress\_blank, and padded audio. This would be ready to drop into your script. Do you want me to do that next?
--------------------------------
    Since we moved from whisper to whisperx, do I need word_timestamps=True?
--------------------------------
    No — when you use **WhisperX**, you don’t need `word_timestamps=True` anymore.

    Here’s why:

    * `word_timestamps=True` is a **Whisper-only option**. It instructs the base Whisper model to output rough word-level timing.
    * WhisperX **always does forced alignment after transcription**, producing accurate word-level timestamps in `result_aligned["word_segments"]`.
    * Passing `word_timestamps=True` is **ignored by WhisperX** or can even slightly slow down the initial transcription unnecessarily.

    ---

    ### ✅ What to do

    Replace:

    ```python
    result = model.transcribe(audio_file, word_timestamps=True, ...)
    ```

    with:

    ```python
    result = model.transcribe(audio_file, condition_on_previous_text=True, suppress_blank=False)
    ```

    Then perform alignment:

    ```python
    align_model, metadata = whisperx.load_align_model(language_code=result["language"], device=device)
    result_aligned = whisperx.align(result["segments"], align_model, metadata, audio_file, device)
    ```

    * Use `result_aligned["word_segments"]` for word-level timestamps.
    * `result_aligned["segments"]` still gives segment-level text with start/end times.

    ---

    If you want, I can show the **updated `transcribe_with_speakers` function** fully rewritten for WhisperX, including intro capture, post-correction, and large model support — ready to paste in. Do you want me to do that next?
--------------------------------
    I remember you mentioned these two parameters. Will they help at all?
        no_speech_threshold=0.2,           # reduce false "gaps"
        logprob_threshold=-1.0             # more aggressive decoding
--------------------------------
    Yes — those parameters **can help**, but with some caveats. Let me break them down in the context of WhisperX (or Whisper as the underlying model):

    ---

    ### 1️⃣ `no_speech_threshold`

    ```python
    no_speech_threshold=0.2
    ```

    * **What it does:** This is the probability threshold Whisper uses to decide that a segment contains **no speech**.
    * Default is usually 0.6–0.7. Lowering it (e.g., 0.2) makes Whisper **more aggressive about treating low-energy audio as speech**.
    * **Effect:**

    * Pros: Captures quiet speech, soft intros, or speech masked by background noise.
    * Cons: May generate **false positives**, e.g., transcribing music, background hums, or silence as words.
    * **Recommendation for podcasts:** You can lower it slightly (0.2–0.3) to capture soft intros, but not too low, otherwise you'll get gibberish in silent parts.

    ---

    ### 2️⃣ `logprob_threshold`

    ```python
    logprob_threshold=-1.0
    ```

    * **What it does:** Determines how “confident” Whisper has to be before outputting a word.
    * Default is `0.0` or slightly negative. Lowering it (more negative) makes Whisper **accept lower-confidence words**.
    * **Effect:**

    * Pros: Can capture words that Whisper would otherwise skip or replace with blanks.
    * Cons: Increases mishearings (like “smoking mirrors” instead of “smoke and mirrors”).

    ---

    ### 3️⃣ How it fits with your pipeline

    * Using WhisperX, these parameters **only affect the initial transcription**.
    * Then WhisperX aligns the words, but it **cannot correct completely missing words** if Whisper skipped them entirely.
    * So they’re useful for **reducing gaps in quiet segments**, but you still need:

    * `suppress_blank=False` (keeps soft audio)
    * `apad` (guarantees intro padding)
    * Post-correction dictionary (fix misheard phrases)

    ---

    ### 4️⃣ Suggested settings for podcasts

    ```python
    result = model.transcribe(
        audio_file,
        condition_on_previous_text=True,
        suppress_blank=False,
        no_speech_threshold=0.3,   # aggressive enough to capture soft speech
        logprob_threshold=-1.0     # accept lower-confidence words for completeness
    )
    ```

    * Start with these, test one episode, and adjust if you see **too many false positives** in silent or musical sections.

    ---

    If you want, I can **draft the final `transcribe_with_speakers` function** that integrates:

    1. WhisperX with large/medium model
    2. suppress\_blank + condition\_on\_previous\_text
    3. optional no\_speech\_threshold & logprob\_threshold
    4. ffmpeg apad audio preprocessing
    5. post-correction dictionary

    …ready to drop into your script. This would implement all four of our improvements. Do you want me to do that next?
--------------------------------
    No, I've made those changes and started to run the script, but I got this error:
    TypeError: FasterWhisperPipeline.transcribe() got an unexpected keyword argument 'condition_on_previous_text'
--------------------------------
    Ah — that error makes sense. Here’s what’s happening:

    ---

    ### 1️⃣ Reason for the error

    * You switched to **FasterWhisper** (or WhisperX using the FasterWhisper backend), which has a **different API** than OpenAI Whisper.
    * Parameters like `condition_on_previous_text` and `suppress_blank` are **specific to the original `openai/whisper` Python package**.
    * FasterWhisper’s `transcribe()` does **not recognize these keyword arguments**, hence the `TypeError`.

    ---

    ### 2️⃣ How to fix it

    #### Option A — Remove unsupported kwargs

    If you’re now using FasterWhisper (or WhisperX with FasterWhisper):

    ```python
    result = model.transcribe(audio_file)  # no condition_on_previous_text, no suppress_blank
    ```

    * The downside: You lose some of the “aggressive start capture” and context preservation features from OpenAI Whisper.
    * You can still **rely on WhisperX alignment** for precise word timestamps.

    #### Option B — Use OpenAI Whisper backend

    * If you want `condition_on_previous_text` + `suppress_blank`, you need to **use `whisper`** as the model backend (not FasterWhisper).
    * Example:

    ```python
    import whisper
    model = whisper.load_model("large-v3")  # or medium
    result = model.transcribe(
        audio_file,
        condition_on_previous_text=True,
        suppress_blank=False
    )
    ```

    * Then feed the segments into WhisperX for alignment.

    ---

    ### 3️⃣ Recommended approach for your podcast pipeline

    * Since you already want **large-v3 / medium models**, **WhisperX + OpenAI Whisper backend** is usually easier and compatible with all the flags we discussed.
    * Use FasterWhisper only if you **need speed over accuracy** and are okay **without `condition_on_previous_text` and `suppress_blank`**.

    ---

    If you want, I can show a **drop-in replacement snippet** for `transcribe_with_speakers` that works with **FasterWhisper + WhisperX**, without unsupported arguments, while still keeping accurate timestamps and the post-correction dictionary.

    Do you want me to do that?
--------------------------------
    No, I made the correction. I reran the script and got this error
    [*] Transcribing without speakers...
    Could not load library libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8. Error: libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    scripts/01-run-transcripts.sh: line 92:  4695 Aborted                 "$VENV_DIR/bin/python" "$PY_SCRIPT" --rss "$RSS_URL" --repo "$REPO_DIR" --token "$HF_TOKEN" --diarize "on"
--------------------------------
    Ah — that error is **not a Python bug**, it’s a **CUDA/cuDNN runtime issue**. Let’s break it down:

    ---

    ### 1️⃣ What the error means

    ```
    Could not load library libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8
    ```

    * Your GPU runtime is trying to use **cuDNN 8**, but it can’t find the library.
    * cuDNN is NVIDIA’s library for deep learning operations (used by PyTorch, WhisperX, FasterWhisper, etc.).
    * Without it, GPU-based models will **abort at startup**.

    ---

    ### 2️⃣ Why it happens

    * The Docker image or environment you’re using **doesn’t have the correct cuDNN version** installed.
    * Possible causes:

    1. GPU driver installed, but cuDNN library missing.
    2. Using a GPU-enabled Python environment inside a container that lacks cuDNN.
    3. Mismatch between PyTorch version and installed CUDA/cuDNN.

    ---

    ### 3️⃣ How to fix it

    #### Option A — Install correct cuDNN

    On Ubuntu/Debian:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y libcudnn8 libcudnn8-dev
    ```

    * Make sure the version matches your **CUDA driver** (`nvcc --version`).
    * After installing, verify:

    ```bash
    ls /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn*
    ```

    ---

    #### Option B — Use conda to manage CUDA/cuDNN

    ```bash
    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
    ```

    * Conda will pull **matching cuDNN + CUDA** automatically.
    * Then your Python environment can use GPU without missing libraries.

    ---

    #### Option C — Fall back to CPU (temporary)

    If you just want to run the script to test:

    ```python
    device = "cpu"
    model = whisperx.load_model(WHISPER_MODEL, device=device)
    ```

    * Slower, but avoids GPU / cuDNN issues while debugging.

    ---

    ### 4️⃣ Recommended for you

    1. Check `nvidia-smi` → confirm your GPU driver is installed.
    2. Install cuDNN 8 (matching your CUDA version).
    3. Restart Python / your shell / the container.

    Once cuDNN is available, your script should run **large-v3 or medium models on GPU** without errors.

    ---

    If you want, I can give you the **exact commands to fix this on Ubuntu/Debian or in a typical cloud GPU instance** so WhisperX + GPU runs immediately. Do you want me to do that?
--------------------------------
    I ran the `ls /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn*` command and got this output: 
    ls: cannot access '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn*': No such file or directory

    Give me a snippet of bash code that tests the `ls /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn*` command and runs `sudo apt-get install -y libcudnn8 libcudnn8-dev` if the output is similar to `ls: cannot access '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn*': No such file or directory`
--------------------------------
    You can use a simple Bash snippet to **check for cuDNN** and install it if missing. Here’s a safe way to do it:

    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # Check if libcudnn is installed
    if ! ls /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn* &>/dev/null; then
        echo "[*] cuDNN not found. Installing libcudnn8 and libcudnn8-dev..."
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y libcudnn8 libcudnn8-dev
    else
        echo "[*] cuDNN already installed."
    fi
    ```

    ---

    ### ✅ How it works

    1. `ls /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn* &>/dev/null` → tries to list cuDNN libraries; output suppressed.
    2. `if ! ...` → triggers the install if the `ls` fails.
    3. `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libcudnn8 libcudnn8-dev` → installs missing libraries.
    4. Prints messages so you know if installation was needed.

    ---

    This snippet is **idempotent**, so you can run it multiple times safely.

    Do you want me to also add **a check to verify that the installed cuDNN matches your CUDA version**?
--------------------------------
    I installed libcudnn8 and -dev, and the script is working now. But, it seems it's still inferring the language:

    [*] Loading Whisper model: medium
    No language specified, language will be first be detected for each audio file (increases inference time).
    ... other logs ...
    [*] Cleaning audio...
    [*] Transcribing with speakers...
    Detected language: en (1.00) in first 30s of audio...

    Even though I provided the "en" parameter:
        # Step 2: Load alignment model (language-specific)
        align_model, metadata = whisperx.load_align_model(
            # Results in
            # No language specified, language will be first be detected for each audio file (increases inference time).
            # language_code=result["language"], device=device

            # Specify English
            "en", device=device
        )
--------------------------------
    Ah — I see exactly what’s happening. This is actually **two separate things being logged**:

    ---

    ### 1️⃣ Language detection happens **in the Whisper model**, not the alignment model

    * When you run:

    ```python
    result = model.transcribe(audio_file)
    ```

    Whisper by default **auto-detects the language** if you don’t provide `language="en"`.

    * That’s why you see the log:

    ```
    No language specified, language will be first be detected for each audio file...
    Detected language: en (1.00) in first 30s of audio...
    ```

    * **Providing `"en"` to `load_align_model()` does not prevent Whisper from detecting language**, because that parameter is only for the **alignment model**, not the initial transcription.

    ---

    ### 2️⃣ How to fix it

    * Explicitly pass `language="en"` to the **Whisper transcription step**, not just to WhisperX alignment:

    ```python
    result = model.transcribe(
        audio_file,
        language="en",                   # force English, skip detection
        condition_on_previous_text=True,
        suppress_blank=False
    )
    ```

    * Then your alignment step can still use `"en"`:

    ```python
    align_model, metadata = whisperx.load_align_model(language_code="en", device=device)
    result_aligned = whisperx.align(result["segments"], align_model, metadata, audio_file, device)
    ```

    ---

    ### ✅ Outcome

    * **Whisper skips language detection**, which speeds up inference slightly.
    * WhisperX still aligns using the correct language model.
    * Logs about “No language specified…” will disappear.

    ---

    If you want, I can show a **small snippet integrating this into your existing `transcribe_with_speakers`** so both transcription and alignment explicitly use English. Do you want me to do that?
--------------------------------
    No, I've made the change. What is the "device" parameter supposed to be? I haven't defined it anywhere
--------------------------------
    Ah — that’s important. The `device` parameter tells **WhisperX / PyTorch which hardware to run on**.

    ---

    ### 1️⃣ What it can be

    * `"cuda"` → use the first available GPU.
    * `"cuda:0"` → use GPU 0 specifically.
    * `"cpu"` → run on the CPU.

    ---

    ### 2️⃣ How to define it

    Before you load the model, you can add:

    ```python
    import torch

    device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
    print(f"[*] Using device: {device}")
    ```

    * `torch.cuda.is_available()` returns `True` if a GPU is detected.
    * This way, your script automatically chooses GPU if available, otherwise CPU.

    ---

    ### 3️⃣ How it’s used

    ```python
    # Load WhisperX model
    model = whisperx.load_model(WHISPER_MODEL, device)

    # Load alignment model
    align_model, metadata = whisperx.load_align_model(language_code="en", device=device)

    # Align segments
    result_aligned = whisperx.align(result["segments"], align_model, metadata, audio_file, device)
    ```

    * All three steps now use the same `device` variable.
    * If `device="cuda"`, computations happen on GPU.
    * If `device="cpu"`, everything runs on CPU (slower, but no GPU required).

    ---

    This ensures that **WhisperX and alignment** are consistently using the correct hardware.

    Do you want me to show the **full integrated snippet** of defining `device` and passing it everywhere in your transcription pipeline?
--------------------------------
    No, I made the change and it's started working, but I'm seeing this in the logs. The NNPACK error was logged 300 times all at once:

    [W914 20:58:26.002385975 NNPACK.cpp:56] Could not initialize NNPACK! Reason: Unsupported hardware.
--------------------------------
    Ah — that warning about **NNPACK** is benign in your case. Let me break it down:

    ---

    ### 1️⃣ What it is

    ```
    [W914 20:58:26.002385975 NNPACK.cpp:56] Could not initialize NNPACK! Reason: Unsupported hardware.
    ```

    * **NNPACK** is a CPU-acceleration library for PyTorch, mostly used for **fast convolution in CNNs**.
    * It’s optional. PyTorch will **fall back to normal CPU kernels** if NNPACK isn’t available or not supported by your CPU.
    * The log repeating 300+ times just means **a loop somewhere is calling a convolution repeatedly**, each time logging the warning.

    ---

    ### 2️⃣ Why it happens now

    * You’re probably running WhisperX with **FasterWhisper or PyTorch on CPU fallback paths**.
    * Your CPU does not meet the requirements for NNPACK (common on many Intel/AMD CPUs or cloud instances).

    ---

    ### 3️⃣ Effects

    * **No impact on GPU inference.**
    * **No impact on transcription accuracy.**
    * Slightly slower CPU fallback if some part of the pipeline runs on CPU, but negligible if you’re primarily using GPU.

    ---

    ### 4️⃣ How to suppress the warning (optional)

    You can silence the log by setting the PyTorch environment variable:

    ```bash
    export TORCH_CPP_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
    ```

    Or in Python:

    ```python
    import os
    os.environ["TORCH_CPP_LOG_LEVEL"] = "ERROR"
    ```

    * This will **hide warnings like NNPACK not available** but still keep other important errors.

    ---

    ✅ **Bottom line:** You can safely ignore it, especially if your transcription is running on GPU.

    ---

    If you want, I can show a **small snippet to suppress this NNPACK warning entirely** while keeping all other PyTorch warnings visible. Do you want me to do that?
    Here’s a simple way to **suppress just the NNPACK warnings** while leaving other PyTorch warnings visible. You can put this at the **very top of your Python script** (before importing PyTorch or WhisperX):

    ```python
    import os

    # Suppress low-level C++ warnings from PyTorch (like NNPACK)
    os.environ["TORCH_CPP_LOG_LEVEL"] = "ERROR"

    # Optional: still see Python warnings
    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings("default")
    ```

    ### ✅ How it works

    * `TORCH_CPP_LOG_LEVEL` controls **C++ backend logging** in PyTorch.
    * `"ERROR"` level will hide NNPACK warnings (`[W...]`) but still show real errors.
    * Python-level warnings (DeprecationWarning, UserWarning, etc.) are unaffected by this setting.

    ---

    After adding this, your logs should no longer spam NNPACK warnings, while the transcription runs normally on GPU.

    Do you want me to show a **fully integrated top-of-script snippet** including all the environment and warning setup you need for WhisperX + GPU?
--------------------------------
    No. I'm worried the script is stuck or something. It logged all those NNPACK warnings and hasn't logged anything else in the last 10 minutes. It also hasn't produced the transcript file 
--------------------------------
    Ah — that’s a different issue. The NNPACK warnings themselves **don’t block execution**, but if your script hasn’t produced any output for 10 minutes, it’s likely **stuck or extremely slow** at a particular step. Based on your logs, there are a few possibilities:

    ---

    ### 1️⃣ Likely culprits

    1. **Downloading pretrained models**

    ```
    Downloading: "https://download.pytorch.org/torchaudio/models/wav2vec2_fairseq_base_ls960_asr_ls960.pth"
    ```

    * Large models (\~360MB) are downloaded the first time and cached.
    * If your network is slow or interrupted, it can stall.
    * Check `~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/` — if the file exists and is complete, it won’t download again.

    2. **WhisperX alignment step**

    ```python
    result_aligned = whisperx.align(result["segments"], align_model, metadata, audio_file, device)
    ```

    * Alignment is **CPU-intensive** if you run on CPU, especially for longer podcasts.
    * GPU helps only for the initial transcription, not for alignment.
    * A 1-hour episode can take **20–40 minutes on CPU**, depending on your hardware.

    3. **Falling back to CPU**

    * If `device="cpu"` or GPU is busy/not detected, WhisperX + alignment may be extremely slow.
    * Check with `nvidia-smi` — ensure your GPU is actually being used.

    ---

    ### 2️⃣ How to debug

    1. **Check GPU usage**

    ```bash
    nvidia-smi
    ```

    * If GPU memory is 0% and utilization is near 0, the model may be running on CPU.

    2. **Enable verbose logs in alignment**

    ```python
    result_aligned = whisperx.align(
        result["segments"],
        align_model,
        metadata,
        audio_file,
        device,
        logging=True  # optional if supported
    )
    ```

    * Helps you see progress.

    3. **Try a short test clip**

    * Run your script on **first 30–60 seconds** of audio:

    ```bash
    ffmpeg -t 60 -i full_podcast.wav short_clip.wav
    ```

    * If that works, the slowdown is likely just **length-dependent CPU alignment**.

    ---

    ### 3️⃣ Recommendations

    * For **long podcasts**, use GPU for WhisperX transcription (you already do) **and consider a machine with more CPU cores** for alignment.
    * You can **split the audio into smaller chunks** (\~5–10 min) and align separately — reduces chance of “stuck” feeling.
    * Ensure all large models are **fully downloaded in advance** to avoid network stalls.

    ---

    If you want, I can provide a **short snippet to test whether your script is really stuck or just doing a long alignment**, so you can see progress live. This will prevent you from waiting indefinitely. Do you want me to do that?

    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
--------------------------------
    Thanks for sharing the `nvidia-smi` output — let’s interpret it carefully.

    ---

    ### 1️⃣ GPU overview

    ```
    GPU 0: NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB
    Driver Version: 570.148.08
    CUDA Version: 12.8
    Memory Usage: 4339MiB / 40960MiB
    GPU Utilization: 0%
    ```

    * **GPU 0**: Your A100 GPU with 40 GB VRAM.
    * **Memory Usage**: \~4.3 GB out of 40 GB is currently used → your model is loaded.
    * **GPU Utilization (`GPU-Util`)**: 0% → the GPU is **idle right now**, not actively computing.
    * **Temperature**: 31 °C → normal.

    ✅ This tells us: your script **has allocated memory on the GPU**, but isn’t currently using it to do computation.

    ---

    ### 2️⃣ Processes section

    ```
    PID 12250: python → 4330MiB GPU memory
    ```

    * Your Python script is indeed connected to the GPU and holding memory.
    * Memory usage matches a medium/large Whisper model.
    * But `GPU-Util = 0%` means **Whisper isn’t currently performing calculations**, likely because:

    1. It’s waiting on CPU-bound processing (e.g., alignment step in WhisperX).
    2. It’s blocked on I/O (reading audio, writing cache, or downloading models).

    ---

    ### 3️⃣ What this implies

    * The **transcription step that uses GPU has finished allocating memory**.
    * The **current delay** is probably the **alignment step**, which runs mostly on CPU.
    * On a long podcast episode, **WhisperX alignment can take many minutes** and won’t show GPU utilization.

    ---

    ### 4️⃣ What you can do

    1. **Check CPU load**:

    ```bash
    htop
    ```

    * If Python is using 100% of a few cores → alignment is working, just slow.
    * If Python is idle → possibly stuck.

    2. **Test with a short clip** (1–2 min audio):

    ```bash
    ffmpeg -t 60 -i full_podcast.wav short_clip.wav
    ```

    * Run the script on `short_clip.wav`.
    * If that finishes quickly, the issue is **long audio + CPU alignment**, not a stuck process.

    3. **Optional optimization**: split audio into smaller chunks for alignment to **parallelize CPU-heavy steps**.

    ---

    💡 **Bottom line:** The GPU is allocated but idle because WhisperX’s alignment is CPU-bound. So your script isn’t stuck — it’s just waiting on a **long CPU alignment step**.

    ---

    If you want, I can show a **way to monitor progress of alignment live**, so you can see that it’s actually working and not stuck. Do you want me to do that?
--------------------------------
    Great — here’s a practical way to **monitor WhisperX alignment progress** live so you can see that it’s actually working and not stuck.

    ---

    ### 1️⃣ Wrap alignment in a progress loop

    WhisperX alignment produces word-level segments. You can **log the progress** as each segment is processed.

    Example:

    ```python
    import whisperx
    import time

    # result = transcription segments from Whisper
    # align_model, metadata = loaded alignment model
    # audio_file = your WAV file
    # device = "cuda" or "cpu"

    word_segments = []
    total_segments = len(result["segments"])
    print(f"[*] Starting alignment of {total_segments} segments...")

    for i, seg in enumerate(result["segments"]):
        aligned = whisperx.align([seg], align_model, metadata, audio_file, device)
        word_segments.extend(aligned["word_segments"])
        
        # Print progress every N segments
        if (i + 1) % 5 == 0 or (i + 1) == total_segments:
            print(f"    Aligned segment {i + 1}/{total_segments}")

    print("[✓] Alignment complete")
    ```

    ---

    ### 2️⃣ How this helps

    * You’ll see **segment-by-segment progress** rather than staring at a blank log.
    * Even on long podcasts, you can tell that the script is actively working.
    * You can adjust the modulo `(i + 1) % 5` to log more or less frequently.

    ---

    ### 3️⃣ Optional: progress bar with `tqdm`

    For a nicer visualization:

    ```python
    from tqdm import tqdm

    word_segments = []
    for seg in tqdm(result["segments"], desc="Aligning segments"):
        aligned = whisperx.align([seg], align_model, metadata, audio_file, device)
        word_segments.extend(aligned["word_segments"])
    ```

    * `tqdm` gives a **progress bar with ETA**, which is great for long episodes.
    * Shows real-time progress, so you’ll know whether it’s slow alignment or a stuck process.

    ---

    ✅ **Tip:** Alignment is CPU-bound. If you have multiple CPU cores, you could **parallelize segments** to speed it up. But even single-threaded, the above logging will show you live progress.

    ---

    Do you want me to show a **parallelized version** of this alignment loop to make long episodes much faster?
--------------------------------
    Don't I still need to populate the result_aligned variable 
    # Step 3: Perform alignment for accurate word-level timestamps
        result_aligned = whisperx.align(
            result["segments"], align_model, metadata, audio_file, device
        )

    I don't see it in the tqdm snippet:

        word_segments = []
        for seg in tqdm(result["segments"], desc="Aligning segments"):
            aligned = whisperx.align([seg], align_model, metadata, audio_file, device)
            word_segments.extend(aligned["word_segments"])
--------------------------------
    Exactly — in the `tqdm` snippet I gave, `result_aligned` isn’t being created as a single object; instead, each segment is aligned individually and the word-level results are collected in `word_segments`.

    So if your later code expects `result_aligned["segments"]` and `result_aligned["word_segments"]`, you have a couple of options:

    ---

    ### Option 1 — Build a full `result_aligned` dictionary manually

    ```python
    from tqdm import tqdm

    word_segments = []
    aligned_segments = []

    for seg in tqdm(result["segments"], desc="Aligning segments"):
        aligned = whisperx.align([seg], align_model, metadata, audio_file, device)
        word_segments.extend(aligned["word_segments"])
        aligned_segments.append(aligned["segments"][0])  # aligned segment itself

    # Reconstruct result_aligned like WhisperX would return
    result_aligned = {
        "segments": aligned_segments,
        "word_segments": word_segments
    }
    ```

    ✅ Now `result_aligned` has the same structure as the original `whisperx.align(result["segments"], ...)` call.

    * `segments` → segment-level info (start, end, text)
    * `word_segments` → word-level timestamps

    ---

    ### Option 2 — Keep `word_segments` only

    * If your downstream code only uses **word-level timestamps** (for Meilisearch storage), you can just work with `word_segments` and skip `result_aligned`.

    ---

    **Recommendation:** Option 1 is safest — you preserve the expected structure and can replace the original alignment call directly with this chunked + tqdm version.

    ---

    If you want, I can rewrite your **full `transcribe_with_speakers` function** to use this tqdm-aligned, chunked approach, returning a `result_aligned` compatible with the rest of your code. Do you want me to do that?
--------------------------------
    Can the alignment be optimized or enhanced for parallel execution on multiple CPUs?
--------------------------------
    Yes — the **alignment step in WhisperX is CPU-bound** and can be significantly sped up by **parallelizing across multiple CPU cores**. Let me break it down.

    ---

    ### 1️⃣ How WhisperX alignment works

    * Each segment from Whisper is **aligned independently** to the audio using forced alignment.
    * The current sequential approach:

    ```python
    for seg in result["segments"]:
        aligned = whisperx.align([seg], align_model, metadata, audio_file, device)
    ```

    * Runs **one segment at a time** → slow for long podcasts.

    ---

    ### 2️⃣ Parallelization strategy

    * Use **Python multiprocessing** or `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` / `ProcessPoolExecutor`.
    * Each CPU core can process a **chunk of segments** simultaneously.
    * Merge results afterward into `result_aligned`.

    ---

    ### 3️⃣ Example with `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`

    ```python
    from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor, as_completed
    import whisperx

    def align_segment(seg, align_model, metadata, audio_file, device):
        result = whisperx.align([seg], align_model, metadata, audio_file, device)
        return result["segments"][0], result["word_segments"]

    aligned_segments = []
    word_segments = []

    with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(align_segment, seg, align_model, metadata, audio_file, "cpu")
                for seg in result["segments"]]

        for future in as_completed(futures):
            seg_aligned, words = future.result()
            aligned_segments.append(seg_aligned)
            word_segments.extend(words)

    # Reconstruct result_aligned
    result_aligned = {
        "segments": aligned_segments,
        "word_segments": word_segments
    }
    ```

    **Notes:**

    1. Use `"cpu"` for `device` inside the worker processes. GPU isn’t shared easily across multiple Python processes.
    2. Number of processes defaults to your CPU core count (`os.cpu_count()`), but you can set `ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=8)` for a limit.
    3. Keep track of order if necessary — `as_completed()` returns results as they finish, so you may need to **sort `aligned_segments` by start time** afterward.

    ---

    ### 4️⃣ Benefits

    * Speeds up alignment by roughly **N×**, where N = number of CPU cores (minus overhead).
    * Especially effective for **long podcasts with hundreds of segments**.
    * Works well in combination with tqdm for progress monitoring.

    ---

    ### 5️⃣ Caveats

    * Each process consumes **memory**, so on a large episode, you may hit RAM limits if you spawn too many processes.
    * GPU acceleration for alignment is limited; most of the work is CPU-bound anyway.

    ---

    If you want, I can provide a **fully integrated, parallelized alignment version** of your `transcribe_with_speakers` function with **tqdm progress bar**, returning `result_aligned` exactly like the original WhisperX output. This would maximize CPU usage and reduce runtime for long podcasts.

    Do you want me to do that?
--------------------------------
    Will parallelization speed up alignment for transcription of one audio file, or will I need to have multiple audio file transcriptions in parallel progress to see an alignment speed increase?
--------------------------------
    Yes — parallelization can **speed up alignment for a single audio file**, because WhisperX aligns each segment independently. You don’t need multiple audio files to see a benefit.

    Here’s how it works:

    ---

    ### 1️⃣ Single-file parallelization

    * Your audio file is split into **Whisper segments** (usually a few seconds each).
    * Each segment can be aligned independently with the forced-alignment model.
    * By assigning multiple segments to **different CPU cores simultaneously**, you process many segments at once.
    * Total alignment time ≈ **time per segment ÷ number of CPU cores** (minus overhead).

    ✅ This works **even for one long podcast**, especially if it has hundreds of segments.

    ---

    ### 2️⃣ Multi-file parallelization

    * You could also run multiple audio files **in parallel**, each on different cores or GPUs.
    * This gives additional speedup if you have **many episodes** to process, but it’s not necessary for just one file.

    ---

    ### 3️⃣ Practical notes

    1. **Memory usage**: Each parallel process uses some RAM. For very long episodes, limit workers:

    ```python
    max_workers = min(os.cpu_count(), 8)
    ```

    2. **GPU**: Alignment is mostly **CPU-bound**, so assigning segments to GPU won’t help much.

    3. **Ordering**: If order matters for your final transcript, sort aligned segments by start time after parallel processing.

    ---

    💡 **Bottom line:** Parallelizing at the segment level **reduces alignment time for a single long podcast**. Multi-file parallelization is only needed if you want to process multiple episodes simultaneously.

    If you want, I can provide a **ready-to-drop parallelized alignment snippet** that handles a single audio file efficiently and preserves `result_aligned`.
--------------------------------
    How can I ensure all large models are fully downloaded in advance to avoid network stalls.
--------------------------------
    To avoid stalls during transcription, you want to **pre-download all large models** (Whisper, WhisperX alignment, Wav2Vec2, etc.) and cache them locally before running the full pipeline. Here’s how:

    ---

    ### 1️⃣ Pre-download Whisper / WhisperX models

    #### Python snippet:

    ```python
    import whisper
    import whisperx
    from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
    import torch

    # Set device (GPU or CPU)
    device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

    # ---- Whisper ----
    print("[*] Preloading Whisper medium model...")
    model = whisper.load_model("medium")  # or "large-v3", etc.

    # ---- WhisperX alignment ----
    print("[*] Preloading WhisperX alignment model...")
    align_model, metadata = whisperx.load_align_model(language_code="en", device=device)

    # ---- Pyannote diarization (if used) ----
    hf_token = "<YOUR_HF_TOKEN>"
    print("[*] Preloading Pyannote speaker diarization model...")
    pipeline = Pipeline.from_pretrained("pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1", use_auth_token=hf_token)
    ```

    * This ensures all model weights are downloaded and cached in `~/.cache/torch/hub/` (for PyTorch) and Hugging Face cache for Pyannote.
    * Running this once avoids **network stalls during your main transcription**.

    ---

    ### 2️⃣ Pre-download torchaudio / Wav2Vec2 checkpoints

    Some models (like `wav2vec2_fairseq_base_ls960_asr_ls960.pth`) are downloaded on first alignment.

    ```python
    import torch
    import torchaudio

    print("[*] Preloading wav2vec2 ASR model...")
    torchaudio.pipelines.WAV2VEC2_ASR_BASE_960H.get_model()
    ```

    * This will download and cache the \~360 MB model before you start alignment.

    ---

    ### 3️⃣ Verify downloads

    * Whisper / WhisperX: `~/.cache/whisper/`
    * Pyannote: `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`
    * Torchaudio: `~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/`

    You can check the files exist and are not corrupted:

    ```bash
    ls -lh ~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/
    ls -lh ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/
    ```

    ---

    ### 4️⃣ Optional: pre-download for offline or production

    * If you want **fully offline transcription**, run the Python snippet once on a machine with network access, then **copy the cache directories** to your deployment machine.
    * This avoids any runtime downloads completely.

    ---

    ✅ **Bottom line:** Preloading all models before starting transcription ensures **no network delays mid-processing** and makes long podcast runs smoother.

    I can also provide a **small helper script** that pre-downloads **all WhisperX, Whisper, Wav2Vec2, and Pyannote models in one go** if you want. Do you want me to do that?
--------------------------------
    Here’s an enhanced version of the pre-download script that **caches multiple Whisper models** along with WhisperX alignment, Wav2Vec2, and Pyannote diarization:

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import whisper
    import whisperx
    from pyannote.audio import Pipeline
    import torchaudio
    import torch

    # ---- Configuration ----
    WHISPER_MODELS = ["medium", "large-v3"]  # list of Whisper models to preload
    ALIGNMENT_LANG = "en"
    DIARIZATION_MODEL = "pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1"
    HF_TOKEN = "<YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN>"

    # ---- Device selection ----
    device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
    print(f"[*] Using device: {device}")

    # ---- 1. Preload Whisper models ----
    for model_name in WHISPER_MODELS:
        print(f"[*] Preloading Whisper model '{model_name}'...")
        whisper.load_model(model_name, device=device)
        print(f"[✓] Whisper model '{model_name}' cached.")

    # ---- 2. Preload WhisperX alignment model ----
    print(f"[*] Preloading WhisperX alignment model for language '{ALIGNMENT_LANG}'...")
    align_model, metadata = whisperx.load_align_model(language_code=ALIGNMENT_LANG, device=device)
    print("[✓] WhisperX alignment model cached.")

    # ---- 3. Preload Wav2Vec2 ASR model ----
    print("[*] Preloading Wav2Vec2 ASR model...")
    torchaudio.pipelines.WAV2VEC2_ASR_BASE_960H.get_model()
    print("[✓] Wav2Vec2 ASR model cached.")

    # ---- 4. Preload Pyannote speaker diarization ----
    print(f"[*] Preloading Pyannote diarization model '{DIARIZATION_MODEL}'...")
    Pipeline.from_pretrained(DIARIZATION_MODEL, use_auth_token=HF_TOKEN)
    print("[✓] Pyannote diarization model cached.")

    print("[✓] All selected models preloaded and cached. Transcription can now run without network downloads.")
    ```

    ---

    ### ✅ How it works

    1. Loops over all Whisper models in `WHISPER_MODELS` and caches them.
    2. Loads WhisperX alignment model for your chosen language.
    3. Downloads the Wav2Vec2 ASR model used internally.
    4. Preloads the Pyannote diarization model.
    5. After running once, all models are stored in the cache, so **future transcriptions don’t need to fetch anything from the network**.

    Optional: you can add more Whisper models to `WHISPER_MODELS` if you want multiple sizes pre-cached for different runs.

    Do you want me to **also modify this to pre-download multiple Pyannote diarization models** in one run for future flexibility?
