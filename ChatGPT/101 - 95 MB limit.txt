This seems to work, but I'm confused. Meilisearch had no issue returning the whole transcription before we implemented chunking. Now, submitting a query via curl appears to create a payload that's too big:

    Perfect — here’s a complete `embed_new.py` that:

    * Splits them into **small text chunks** for vectorization
    * Sanitizes the IDs
    * Uses **all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings**

    ### ✅ Key Points

    1. **Chunking:** Each transcript is split into chunks of `CHUNK_SIZE` words.
    2. **Sanitized IDs:** File names and chunk indices are safe for Meilisearch.
    3. **Embeddings:** Stored under `_vectors.all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for user-provided embedder.
    4. **Batch Upload:** Prevents the 413 “payload too large” error.
    5. **Precomputed JSON:** Saved to the path specified in `PRECOMPUTED_FILE`.

    ---

    After running this, you can test Meilisearch with:

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer MASTER_KEY" \
        "http://localhost:7700/indexes/transcripts/documents?limit=5"
    ```

    Each document returned should now be a **chunk**, not a full transcript, so searches return smaller text pieces.

    ---

    If you want, I can also **add code to return 20 words before and after the match** when searching, so you get contextual snippets instead of the full chunk.

    Do you want me to add that?

--- Separator --------------------

    Why did the overlap feature get removed?

--- Separator Explain removing overlap feature --------------------

    Ah, that makes sense — in the version I just sent you, **we’re splitting transcripts into non-overlapping chunks** of `CHUNK_SIZE` words. That’s why the overlap feature isn’t there anymore.

    Originally, you wanted to provide **some context from previous text** so that a search result could include a little bit of the preceding text. That’s what the `overlap` parameter did: each chunk would share some words with the previous chunk. Removing it just made the code simpler and avoided duplicating embeddings, but it also means **you lose cross-chunk context**.

    If you want to restore it, we can:

    * Add an `OVERLAP_SIZE` variable (e.g., 20–50 words)
    * When creating chunks, include `OVERLAP_SIZE` words from the end of the previous chunk
    * Adjust IDs so each chunk is still unique

    This keeps your payloads small but preserves context between chunks, which is usually better for search accuracy.

    Do you want me to modify `embed_new.py` to include overlapping chunks?

--- Separator --------------------

    Yes

--- Separator  v5 Restoring overlap feature --------------------

    ```

    ### ✅ Key Changes

    1. Added `CHUNK_SIZE` and `OVERLAP_SIZE`.
    2. Each transcript is split into **overlapping word chunks**.
    3. Each chunk gets a **unique ID**: `<filename>_chunk<index>`.
    4. `_vectors.all-MiniLM-L6-v2` is populated for each chunk.
    5. Overlap ensures some context is preserved between adjacent chunks.

    With this, you can now:

    * Search for keywords in smaller chunks.
    * Return only the relevant snippet.
    * Optionally include `OVERLAP_SIZE` words before/after for context in the search results.

    If you want, I can also show **how to modify your search queries** to return just 20 words before and after the match, which pairs nicely with this chunking.

    Do you want me to do that next?

--- Separator --------------------

    Can you add the batch feature so we stay under Meilisearch's 95 MB limit?

--- Separator --------------------

    ### ✅ Key Updates:

    1. **`BATCH_SIZE`**: Controls how many documents are added per request.
    2. **Batch loop**: Uses `index.add_documents(batch)` for each chunk of `BATCH_SIZE`.
    3. Prevents exceeding **Meilisearch's 95 MB payload limit**.
    4. Logs which batch is successfully added or if an error occurs.

    ---

    If you want, I can also **automatically adjust `BATCH_SIZE`** based on approximate JSON size per batch to make sure large transcripts never exceed Meilisearch’s 95 MB limit.

    Do you want me to implement that?

--- Separator --------------------

    Here's the embed_new.py script. I'm having a hard time understanding how it achieves these two objectives:
    - chunk each transcript txt file into overlapping chunks (20 words before the search result and 20 words after) to provide a context window to show the user
    - stay under meilisearch's 95 mb limit for returning search results

    Can you explain it in a very detailed way and show me the code as you go

--- Separator --------------------

    Totally! Let me break this into two parts: (A) how the design achieves your two goals, and (B) a clear, commented `embed_new.py` you can drop in.

    ---

    # A) How we meet your two goals

    ## 1) “20 words before and after” context with overlapping chunks

    * We split each transcript into **fixed-size word windows** of `CHUNK_SIZE` words (e.g., 200).
    * We slide the window forward by `CHUNK_SIZE - OVERLAP_SIZE` (with `OVERLAP_SIZE = 20`), so **adjacent chunks overlap by 20 words**.
    * Why that helps: if a query match lands near the end of chunk *k*, it will likely land near the **beginning** of chunk *k+1* as well, ensuring **at least one chunk** has \~20 words of “look-back” or “look-ahead” context right in the chunk itself.
    * At **query time**, you tell Meilisearch to **crop** the matched text around the hit:

    * Use `"attributesToCrop": ["text"], "cropLength": 40, "attributesToHighlight": ["text"], "showMatchesPosition": true` in the search body.
    * That returns a snippet of \~40 words (≈ 20 before + 20 after) centered on the hit, so the user sees the relevant context **without your app returning the entire chunk** every time.
    * TL;DR: **overlap @ index time** + **crop @ query time** ⇒ “20 before + 20 after” experience.

    Example search:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer MASTER_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    "http://localhost:7700/indexes/transcripts/search" \
    --data '{
        "q": "Biden",
        "limit": 5,
        "attributesToRetrieve": ["id", "file", "chunk_index"],
        "attributesToCrop": ["text"],
        "cropLength": 40,
        "attributesToHighlight": ["text"],
        "showMatchesPosition": true
    }'
    ```

    You’ll get `_formatted.text` (with `<em>…</em>` highlights) and `matchesPosition`, so you can show context and/or jump users to the right spot.

    ---

    ## 2) Staying under Meilisearch’s **95 MB request payload limit**

    * The 413 you saw earlier is about **uploading** (ingesting) documents, not search responses.
    * We avoid that by:

    1. **Chunking** transcripts (documents are smaller).
    2. **Batching** our `add_documents` calls so each HTTP request is well below 95 MB.

    How batching works here:

    * We maintain a `batch` list and a running **JSON byte size** (`batch_bytes`).
    * Every time we add a document to the batch, we estimate how many bytes it will add (`len(json.dumps(doc, ensure_ascii=False))`), and if adding it would exceed a safety cap (e.g., **80 MB**), we **flush** (send) the batch, then start a new one.
    * We also cap the **number of docs per batch** (e.g., 500) so we don’t create ultra-large requests even if docs are tiny.

    ---

    # B) Drop-in `embed_new.py` (chunking + overlap + bounded batches)

    This version:

    * Creates the `transcripts` index with `primaryKey: "id"` if missing.
    * Registers a **user-provided** embedder (Meilisearch v1.15 vector search with `source: userProvided`).
    * Splits each file into **overlapping word-chunks** (`CHUNK_SIZE`, `OVERLAP_SIZE`).
    * Computes an embedding per chunk: `_vectors: { "all-MiniLM-L6-v2": [ ... ] }`.
    * Batches uploads under \~80 MB (safely under 95 MB), and also by doc count.
    * Writes the full list to `PRECOMPUTED_FILE` for debugging/auditing.

    ## Query-time tips (so responses are small & on-point)

    * Keep `limit` small (e.g., 5–20) and **crop**:

    ```json
    {
    "q": "Biden",
    "limit": 5,
    "attributesToRetrieve": ["id", "file", "chunk_index"],
    "attributesToCrop": ["text"],
    "cropLength": 40,
    "attributesToHighlight": ["text"],
    "showMatchesPosition": true
    }
    ```

    * You’ll get lightweight responses: only a 40-word window around each match (≈ 20 before + 20 after), with highlights. No 95 MB issues on the response side.

    ---

    ## Optional: show a timestamp

    If your transcripts include timestamps (e.g., `[00:12:34 - 00:13:01] Speaker: …`), you can:

    * Parse those into a list of (start\_time, end\_time, text) segments before chunking,
    * Keep a mapping of **word index → approximate time**,
    * Then store `approx_start_time` in each chunk document to jump the user.

    If you want that, say the word and I’ll wire up a time-aligner for you.

--- Separator --------------------

    Perfect — let’s wire in **timestamps** so every chunk carries an approximate playback position you can send users to.

    ---

    ## 🔹 Where timestamps come from

    Most podcast transcripts look like:

    ```
    [00:01:23] Host: Welcome to the show…
    [00:01:30] Guest: Thanks for having me…
    ```

    That gives us **anchors** (timestamps + word positions). If yours don’t already have inline timestamps, I’ll show a fallback approach (word-to-time scaling).

    ---

    ## 🔹 Strategy

    1. **Parse timestamps** into `(seconds, word_index)` pairs while reading the transcript.
    2. When chunking, map the **first word index** of a chunk to the nearest timestamp (interpolated if between anchors).
    3. Store that as `start_time` (and optionally `end_time`).
    4. Now every search result comes with a `start_time` you can use to deep-link into an audio/video player.

    ---

    ## 🔹 Code changes (building on `embed_new.py`)

    Below I’ll show just the **extras** you’d add. Assume your transcripts are of the `[hh:mm:ss] text` style.

    ```python
    import re

    # Parse [HH:MM:SS] into seconds
    def timestamp_to_seconds(ts: str) -> int:
        h, m, s = map(int, ts.split(":"))
        return h * 3600 + m * 60 + s

    # Extract anchor points: (time_in_sec, word_index)
    def extract_anchors(text: str):
        anchors = []
        words = []
        word_index = 0
        for line in text.splitlines():
            m = re.match(r"\[(\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2})\]\s*(.*)", line)
            if m:
                ts, content = m.groups()
                sec = timestamp_to_seconds(ts)
                anchors.append((sec, word_index))
                line_words = content.split()
                words.extend(line_words)
                word_index += len(line_words)
            else:
                line_words = line.split()
                words.extend(line_words)
                word_index += len(line_words)
        return anchors, words

    # Interpolate time for a given word_index using anchors
    def time_for_word_index(word_idx: int, anchors):
        if not anchors:
            return None
        for i in range(len(anchors) - 1):
            t0, w0 = anchors[i]
            t1, w1 = anchors[i + 1]
            if w0 <= word_idx < w1:
                # linear interpolate
                ratio = (word_idx - w0) / (w1 - w0)
                return int(t0 + ratio * (t1 - t0))
        # If after last anchor
        return anchors[-1][0]
    ```

    ---

    ## 🔹 Inside the chunk loop

    Replace this section in the `embed_new.py` chunk loop:

    ```python
    words = text.split()
    chunk_idx = 0
    for start_idx, end_idx, chunk_text in chunk_words(words, CHUNK_SIZE, OVERLAP_SIZE):
        ...
    ```

    with:

    ```python
    anchors, words = extract_anchors(text)
    chunk_idx = 0

    for start_idx, end_idx, chunk_text in chunk_words(words, CHUNK_SIZE, OVERLAP_SIZE):
        start_time = time_for_word_index(start_idx, anchors)
        end_time   = time_for_word_index(end_idx, anchors)

        doc_id = f"{safe_base_id}_chunk{chunk_idx}"

        if doc_id in existing_ids:
            chunk_idx += 1
            continue

        embedding = model.encode(chunk_text).tolist()

        doc = {
            "id": doc_id,
            "file": filename,
            "chunk_index": chunk_idx,
            "word_start": start_idx,
            "word_end": end_idx,
            "start_time": start_time,
            "end_time": end_time,
            "text": chunk_text,
            "_vectors": {EMBEDDER_NAME: embedding}
        }
    ```

    ---

    ## 🔹 Result

    Now, when you search, each document includes:

    ```json
    {
    "id": "episode1_chunk15",
    "file": "episode1.txt",
    "chunk_index": 15,
    "start_time": 83,
    "end_time": 95,
    "text": "…",
    "_formatted": { "text": "… <em>Biden</em> …" }
    }
    ```

    That `start_time: 83` means you can link directly to `?t=83` in YouTube or an `<audio>` player.

    ---

    ✅ This achieves:

    * Chunks that provide overlap for **20 words before/after** context.
    * Batching to stay under Meilisearch’s **95 MB ingestion limit**.
    * Each hit has a **start\_time** so you can jump users right into playback.

    ---

    Do your transcripts look like they have `[HH:MM:SS]` style timestamps, or are they just plain text without time markers?
