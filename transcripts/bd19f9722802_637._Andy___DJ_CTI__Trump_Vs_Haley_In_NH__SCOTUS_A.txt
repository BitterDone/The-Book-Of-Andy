What is up guys it's Andy for Sella and this is the show for the realist say goodbye to the lies, the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys today we have Andy and DJ Hey, who's the motherfucking internet that's what we're gonna do that's what CTI stands for stands for crews the internet I'm still working on getting my voice back guys for those of you that don't know I've been very sick. I caught the flu which derailed my 75 hard was able to keep my wreck streak going because still finished that out for the year but I had to start 75 hard over again. I plan on starting it yesterday, but I still wasn't healthy enough to start it. So we're gonna skip all the intro shit. I'm gonna let my voice heal up as much as possible and we're just gonna get right into it. I am starting 75 hard over today though which for those of you listening right now is yesterday. So you're listening on Wednesday. That's right. Yeah. Oh man. Yeah, fuck almost. That flu is no joke bro. And I'll bro it listen. WF brother trying. Yeah, that was a direct mail in by a lot of mail in biological attack from Klaus Schwab. This is a pretty good bro. We had a we had like a shit. I'm a deep percent. Is it really? How do you how do you find that out? Kara 70% of our office got it. Dude, you know how much worse that is than whenever COVID came through like when COVID came through we had a few people get sick. Yeah. And we had 70% of our office gets sick with the flu. And like it was bad week. Yeah. Yeah. So. And like we're talking about one of the healthiest places on earth. You know what I'm saying? Like people here are fit. I mean I'm gonna tell you this dude. Whatever that flu. What did they tell you it was a flu A dude. It's serious bro. Just held up white power. Huh? No, he didn't. That's it. That says you're correct. Yeah. So what's up man? Well, I got you. Yeah. You watch out. Okay. Leave me out the party bro. You're bro. You're the one that knows all the codes. What's going on man? Oh, not much. You know something interesting. I saw while we were cruising. I forget W. Oh. Yeah. Sure. She'll know be host. But something interesting. I saw when I was cruising. And this is I think this is just an important thing for people to realize like, you know how fucked up these like everybody knows they're fucked up right. But like what they choose to go after and what they choose not to go after. Okay. This headline reads and when I saw this I'm like, oh, you know, finally some people about to get in trouble or something. You know, a hell on read Nancy Pelosi. AOC accused of abusing official government resources and watchdog complaint. Right. So I'm like, oh shit. You know, fuckers. Like what they finally got him. You know, but then you dive into the article and this is a daily wire article that reads the foundation of accountability and civic trust or fact. File the complaint to the office of congressional ethics against representatives Corey Bush, Jamal Bowman, Sean Casting, Greg Kazar, Maxwell Frost, Ted Lou, Alexandria, Oscar, Cortez, Elon Omar, and Richie Torres. They are all accused of linking official government resources to their campaign accounts of violation of federal law and house ethics rules regulating the social media activity of Congress. So they made a fucking social media post. And they're making this all a big deal. My issue is, what about all the insider trading of these motherfuckers do? Like how Nancy Pelosi just destroyed the disclose that she made a seven figure bet on this envy in video. Huh? Yeah. On a set up seven figure bet on a video. I'm just over the Christmas holiday. All right. These motherfuckers are stealing our money and using using their power and Congress is still money. But yeah, let's hit them on a fucking social media post. I think that's a great idea. I think that's typical. You know, that's what it's no different than you know, them trying to pretend like they're going to, you know, prosecute Hunter Biden on a gun violation. Right. You know what I'm saying? Like they they know people want accountability. So they give them accountability on something that's like a slap on the wrist. And then, you know, they act like that's all the big will. The other stuff didn't happen. I mean, of the iceberg, right? Where you see the tip that's above water and it's a mass like bro, that's what it like bro. And like nobody's going to like do anything in Congress because they all do that. They all inside trade. Yeah. Like all these motherfuckers. They get way worth nothing to come out worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Yeah, just well, you know, I mean, that's what happens when you are allowed to take money from lobby interests to make regulations and laws. And you know ahead of time what rulings are going to be happening. And you are able to invest along the lines of what those rulings are going to be. And you know, that's highly corrupt. And I believe it's illegal. You can't do that. No, I can't do that. Yeah, if you and I did that, we go to jail. But they're allowed to do it because they're, you know, elites and we're peasants. And this is reality of what we live in. And this is the reason that most of these people want to get into Washington. You know, I think this is a big problem with our with our system in general is we don't have people that go to Washington, DC to serve us or or do anything for America or American people, you know, most of these people don't have real careers outside of politics. They've never made real money outside of politics. So this is their golden goose. This is their career. And you know, this is reflective also with a lot of the influencers who are who have become relevant since 2020 because of all the social disruption going on in the world. You know, not that they're inside or trading, but these people were not relevant before this. And at first they cared at first they got on to these topics of what's going on in the world because they care, but now they figured out that it's an avenue for them to make money, you know, the more views, the more clicks, the more shares they get, the more shit that they sell, the more money they make and it's become a career. And a lot of these people, unfortunately, and even some of them that I really like or like the lot as a person they've become very selfish driven individuals and have forgotten the purpose of what. Why they started doing this in the first place and it's it's very frustrating. Yeah, because we're not going to be able to ever solve the problems of what's going on in this country with people like that serving in our government or bringing attention to what's going on in the world, you know, how many of these influencers out here just. Just sensationalize and just try to scream at the top of their lungs or try to put the most graphic image up or create the most common engagement. You know, they do that because then a lot of people don't understand this either. You know, they do that because their sponsors will then look at their engagement and look at their views and look at their shares and the personality will be able to demand more money from them on those situations or they'll actually sell more of their own stuff. And the average person has a hard time identifying that because the average person is just kind of out here like wanting things to be better and they're like, why is nothing getting better. Well, the reason that nothing is getting better guys is because a lot of people in our government, most people in our government. I mean, there's a few that are in their genuinely in my opinion, but it's very, very few. I would say like probably less than 20 out of the five or 600 that are up there. And to a certain degree, they have to play the game. Yeah, yeah, it's it's the unfortunate thing. We have a misalignment of intent when it comes to the people who are capable of actually changing things in this country. You know, there's very few people who don't eventually end up making it about themselves. And what's the saying about power and corruption? Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Yeah. And unfortunately, that seems to be the case, especially for a lot of these people. This is why like people who are independently wealthy and already have things when they speak. I think it carries more weight because they're not necessarily trying to gain more wealth. They're trying to make a difference. That's one of that's one of the reasons I always believe in Trump. You know, but like as these things start to unravel more and more, you know, I, I, I don't want to sound like an asshole, but like I'm just losing faith in all of these people. Yeah, it just sucks, man, because like I think about like, you know, our constitution and what, what this country was supposed to look like, right? The whole point of Congress, right? Like you go back to the 1776, we won't go back too far. But you know, you really think about it. Like the our constitution, the way our Congress is set up, it was designed for, you know, the farmer who saw an issue in his little community, right? He go in and he'd be the voice of his little local farmer community, right? Yeah. And he'd go in and make a voice. That's not the case no more. And then once he made, you know, when he went in and made his difference, he goes back to fucking farming. Yeah. And you take somebody like AOC who was a fucking bartender or waitress. Yeah. Right. And a little bit of diner. Right. And you take somebody like that. And I'm sure she see she felt like she had really issues and, and you know, gripes and stuff. But she goes in and she realized, oh, this is just a cash cow. Yeah. Right. And make zero changes. In fact, makes makes like she votes on things to continue to make problems as she continued to try to promise the show fix. Right. She has no, like you think she'll ever go back to be in a, or you know, waitress. No, it won't happen. Well, I mean, I don't think it's fair to say that she should. I mean, look, dude, I'm not an AOC fan. All right. Like it's not fair to say that you should go back to being, I mean, the goal is to move up, right? The goal is to progress your career and everybody that's okay. I understand that. But it shouldn't be through corruption and insider information that other people don't have access to do that. Or shuffling the interests of the people to the end of the line while you get wealthy off of, you know, things that are happening that only you can benefit from. I mean, the idea of our government as a whole is that it's for the people of the people by the people. And that's we're not for the people. And we're not of the people. And then they pick a few of them to make it appear like that. Correct. They picked the AOCs. They picked the Corey Bushes. They pick a few to make it appear. Yeah. As if that's the truth. But I mean, how many of those are there? Not many, man. Most of these people are, most of these people are what you would call like blue blood people. They come from wealth. They come from long generational lines of money. Or the Ivy League. Right. And this is, yeah. And that's what we're dealing with. We're dealing with it. We're dealing with an out of touch. Uninterested, malintent group of people who do not serve the rest of us on in any fashion. And, you know, if you, if you have an entire government that's built off of service and ideals of service that we are representative, we're supposed to be a representative government. And the people that, you know, go from, let's say here in Missouri to Washington, DC, they are to speak for the people here in Missouri. That doesn't happen at all anymore. I mean, that's not like, do you really believe the Nancy Pelosi speaks for the people in her neighborhood where she comes from. Go to her neighborhood in San Francisco and look at it. It's a shithole. I mean, if she speaks for those people, you know, I'm Santa Claus. Right. Like it's absurd. It's an absurd statement at this point in time. These people don't even pretend to serve these people anymore. You know, Cory Bush doesn't even pretend to serve the people from her neighborhood in St. Louis anymore. Like when some sort of racial event happens. I mean, yeah, she'll open her mouth and start screaming about it. That's just a secure that that's just to appear. You know, most of the time she's not worried about what's going on here. You know what I mean? None of these people are. And I think that's becoming very obvious to every single human who's observing what's going on. You know, people don't pay attention until they start feeling the pain themselves. And there's enough pain being felt in our culture right now to where people are starting to pay attention. You know, people who I would say things to and like, you know, people in my family, people in real life, who I would say things to two or three years ago. And they'd be like, oh, that sounds crazy. That sounds like the boogeyman. You're you're insane, bro. blah blah blah. Come on, man. It's not really now. Those people are like, dude, are you sure? Like what you're saying is right because it does seem like that. You know what I'm saying? Like I'm getting a lot of that from like, especially from people who are what I would describe idealists. These are people who believe in the good of other people. They're leaving hard. Yeah, they're good people. And they might even vote Democrat, right? Like I actually believe that a lot of people who vote have traditionally voted Democrat. They're actually just people with big hearts that are easily misled on the basis of doing quote unquote the right thing. They don't believe that people would manipulate or lie to them because they wouldn't manipulate or lie to people, right? So and they believe that people should have equality and people should be not bullied and you know in real life and all of these things, which by the way, we all agree with except when the other side starts to become the bully, we're not just going to sit here and take it. Right. Right. And so what's happened here is very interesting because even the most progressive human beings, people who I know five, 10 years ago thought that I was insane for just having what I call realist viewpoints. Those people have now this, this culture of except my way or I'm going to bully you or you're a bigot or you're a racist or you're a this or you're a that. And I'm going to cancel you and I'm going to mob you and I'm going to post you and I'm going to dox you. This has been going on long enough to where every single person has had an experience with one of these people in reality. Okay. So even the most progressive people that I know have had personal experiences with these people who are legitimately insane. Okay. And so we're seeing it switch, but it just took such a long time because a lot of people thought, well, if I'm on their team, they're not going to bully me. But then the first time that they've come up now where they've disagreed and they say, wait a minute. And then they got canceled by their own people now they're realizing, oh, shit, this is a problem. And this creates a dangerous situation for this far left minority of people because these people for the last 10 to 15 years have been proud. By social media and media to believe that they have the numbers and they have the power which they do not. All right. And they haven't ever had it by the way. This is what the Twitter files were about when it showed that social media was using bot networks to prop up the opinions of those progressive left and suppress the opinions of everybody else at the direction of our federal government. That's correct. And so these people are now filled with a false sense of power and they don't have the numbers. And what's happening right now is something that I've described on the show many for many years is that everybody else, the 80 to 90% of common sense people are waking up that they have the numbers. And these people are going to try to like go punch those people some more and they're going to get fucking destroyed. So like and bro, unfortunately that needs to happen at some level. But it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out and we're seeing it right like these people are no longer in control of cancel culture. And I think cancel the comments off. I think cancel culture is ridiculous anyway. And like the thing now we have is we have these people over here on the on the right in the in the far right who are ultra conservative people who now have power socially who are also abusing that power the opposite way now. So if you don't go to church every Sunday and you don't say you believe in everything they believe they're using the same power, which is unfortunate because this cancel culture weapon that that swings back and forth is what's eliminating the opportunity for us to come together and compromise on what would be a reasonable existence here in America. You know what I mean. So it's it's I don't like it either way. You know, I don't I think it's we need we need people if we're going to get out of the what's going on in fixes country without a whole bunch of people getting killed. We need people to fucking come together under some common sense guidelines and say hey look this is our country we all share it. All right, the rules can't be your way that can't be their way we got to find some happy medium here that we can all live with and we can leave each other alone. You can live your way. You can live this way. Don't mess with the kids, you know, we need to establish some real baseline rules that are unacceptable and you know, we move forward as a as a unit and you know, just like business. We you can't be successful in business. We're just you know one standard of ideas. You know what I'm saying like if I'm sitting in a room with a bunch of business people and there's a problem to be solved and everybody thinks the same way. And they all see the problem the same way there can't really ever be a solution unless we're lucky enough to see it that way. Because there's a lack of different perspectives you know I'm we're all seeing it from the exact same position and that means that we can't think outside the box so like it really handicaps our country in a way. To solve problems and truly progress forward and become a powerhouse which is the intent by the way they the people in control of this they understand this. But we need to understand it as we the people we need to understand like hey man we got to we got to find we got to live common sense we can't we can't be over here way over here on the right. We can't be way over here on the left yes we have to have some structure and some ideals and some factual truth that we all agree upon you know and one of those truths that I stand my heels in tight is gender right like the reason I'm so outspoken on gender ideology. And it's not designed to be inclusive or to help people it's actually designed to a road truth to the point where nothing exists in actual reality it's all determined by someone's perspective and that's not that's you cannot operate. You can operate a business that way you can operate a life that way you can operate a country that way yeah so we have to you know that's my take on all this. Let's get into our headlines guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to any for seller.com you can find them. Like there that being said let's get right into headline number one. And then I'm going to read down on trump Nikki Haley battle in New Hampshire primaries as the two top Republicans left. So that's going on as we speak by the time you guys are listening it Donald Trump won. I mean it's like it's going to be kind of hard to hard to hard to pull that. I mean look man I'm I'm not going to go out there and say that you know we don't know what's going to happen dude. I mean listen the way that I mean like I mean yeah I mean we saw the same thing in 2020 I understand your point. You know I just like but with there with the way everything is going man it. I mean yeah I'm just saying it's a little bit we'll see dude I don't believe anything I don't believe anything in terms of. I'm putting taking things for granted I feel like there's a lot of overconfidence with people right now especially with. The non Biden people that you know and by the way yes there is a shit ton of people a shit ton who voted for Biden in 2020 who are now going to vote for Trump. And they they come across all demographic. I don't know what they're capable of doing in terms of. Fudging the numbers or I'm of the opinion and I think a lot of people share this opinion that the 2020 election was tampered with. And potentially stolen and I know there's people that disagreed with me on that but and they say well that's never been proven and there's been all these cases that have come up. Man but have we looked at what's going on in the legal system right now right like do people who are literally murdering people are being let out of jail the next day like the legal system cannot be trusted in terms of. What is actually happening in my opinion now I can't they can't man. I guess we'll see you know I guess we'll see right now the polls average as of right now is time to recording Trump's at 53.9% Nikki Haley's at 36.3. Apparently there's a lot of there's a lot there's like ten of them but of hardcore Biden voters in New Hampshire. So you know the the DNC primaries was supposed to kick off in New Hampshire but then they moved that to South Carolina and that pissed off a lot of the New Hampshire voters expressing some content one lady saying quote I'm kind of angry about it one voter said and some people have said why should we write his name in and he won't even give us the time of day. So he hasn't even he's not even trying to care about New Hampshire on the blue side. I continue another person said quote we're disappointed this year not to have the democratic primary and that's why we're doing this because it's not meaningless like the DNC says another voter said it really is meaningful. Nikki Haley did kick it off last night she she got some votes right at midnight in this little city called Dicksville notch. A total of six people unanimously that's all that's in the little town six people and she got all six so it's off to a great start. It's actually what she said a great start to a great day in New Hampshire Nikki Haley said response to the tally thank you Dicksville notch. And last little thing on the the updates it's going around apparently there is this there's a robo spam call going around Biden. Did you see that no. Yeah so so this is from NBC News fake Joe Biden robo call tells New Hampshire Democrats not to vote Tuesday. So the New Hampshire new Hampshire attorney general's office says it is investigating what appears to be an unlawful attempt at voter suppression after NBC news reported on a robo call impersonating president Joe Biden. The told recipients not to vote in Tuesday's presidential primary. And it's pretty convincing so so they continue the article continues says quote although the voice in the robo call sounds like the voice of president Biden. This message appears to be artificially generated based on initial indications the attorney general's office said in a statement quote these messages appeared to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire presidential primary election. And to suppress New Hampshire voters. New Hampshire voters should disregard the content of this message entirely here's the here's the robo call. The other bunch of Milwaukee. You know the value of voting democratic on our votes count it's important that you save your vote in a November election will need your help in electing Democrats up and down the ticket voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again. Your vote makes a difference in November not this Tuesday if you would like to be removed from future calls please press to now. And actually found out that actually was president Joe Biden calling people they just forgot that he forgot. I mean you think he knows how to use a phone fuck now man that phone's not even though he's not even on a call right now. Yeah just a blank screen. Yeah well that's what your phone looks like when you hold it to your ear too. Is it? Yeah it knows blank it doesn't just show the shit. It doesn't? Let me see. You're not on a call. Call me. I'm not. Anyway. Yeah man so we'll see so you so. That's not surprising with the Robo cog running. Yeah I mean look dude they're using these AI things to like extort money from people now. Yeah. You know it's very it's very weird that this technology is just. But they're using that shit in the legal system. I know man I know it's we're entering a legit stage of reality where it's. You know people can use AI to mimic people's voices and even video and we don't know what's real what's not and do that creates a level of paranoia and insanity that you know and mental health problems which is all I believe intentional. Yeah because it's adding to that fog of truth. Yeah adding to the fog of reality. Dude the whole point is lack of transparency. Total confusion and it adds to that. Yeah like when you don't know what the fuck to trust. Yeah and it's only going to get worse. Yeah man bro the internet has really fucked up humanity dude. Like it really has. It really has. Yeah man. Guys jumping on this conversation down the. It's not I don't care what anybody says. It's not worth the juice has not been worth the squeeze. We are in a situation like I don't care how much money you made and dude I've done very well with the technology of the internet and I know a lot of you guys have as well. None of that stuff's worth what what is happening now the cost of humanity. Yeah because it's creating total manipulation total censorship fake narratives division now we're able to you know manipulate lie and accused people of things that aren't even true with. You know AI and fucking Photoshop and like dude it's just it's gross dude like the whole thing's gross it's hard. It's it's becoming harder and harder for me. To really want to participate in that world you know what I mean like. I think very long and hard a lot of times about stopping even just doing all of this stuff that I do. And just walking away and turning my phone off and fucking. Same fucking yeah you know what I mean like I. Well here's the scariest part bro is like we have not even began to see. The the results of this like I mean like the the true. Like the true results that that technology this AI stuff we won't even see that into another well what's scary. Yeah dude and you know people don't what's scary is people are not connecting the dots and nobody with the power to change it is even talking about these things. You know people say well AI is so amazing and AI is this great thing and AI and AI and AI and AI and blah blah blah blah blah blah. So AI is being pushed for a very specific reason that nobody's talking about. And that reason is to make the actual middle class work or obsolete and remove them from the workforce to create a dependent class so that they can introduce a universal basic income where people accept a certain amount of money a month to sit around and do nothing contribute nothing build nothing. And that sounds like utopia to a lot of people because a lot of people say well man I'd love to not work I'd love to not have a job but would you love to be as dirt poor where you're standing in a breadline and you can only get government approved food and basically you have no options in your life and you have no freedom in your life. And you have to take what you can get does that sound appealing to you because the picture they paint of what this universal basic income looks like is far different from reality. You know they paint it to be like we're going to redistribute the wealth redistributing of wealth it make it doesn't make everyone wealthy it makes everyone equally impoverished. And so we're not understanding that and what's scary to me is that nobody's even talking about this like no senators are talking about this no no Congress people are talking about this and these are people that can make rules and regulations around this technology and nobody's talking about it. And people are like well how's that how's that going to create this communist what do you what do you mean bro they're putting economic pressure on businesses right now to adopt this technology right like look at look at what's going on with inflation look at cost of goods look at all the expenses it takes to run a business you know a lot of people think the businesses are price gouging that's not what's happening what's happening is the cost of operating the businesses going so far up the businesses are being forced to adopt this technology. That is not human capital and that means human capital is going to have to go sit at home all right there so they're forcing the businesses to stay competitive by using the technology which creates a situation where there's no there's no real jobs for people anymore and the businesses that don't adopt it like we try to resist it here but the reality is is that if you resist it holy you're going to go out of fucking business at some point so because of the economic pressures they put on the business if it was proud of price can be a lot of money. It was price gouging it would just be a few businesses doing it. Dude when every one of you talk about it. People that say that they I understand why people could believe that because I believe there is companies that are doing that. All right there's always companies in hard economic situations that will take advantage and raise their prices but I'm telling you right now this is not one of those times what's happening now is they are telling you that's what's happening to disguise the fact of what's really going on which is forcing companies to do it. Forcing companies to adopt technology that takes away jobs from people and forces them into a universal basic income situation that's what's actually happening now and the companies that don't adopt will eventually be put out of business by companies that do what what do you Amazon runs I mean we've got Amazon center next to us bro they have drivers but what they don't have people working in that in that building it's robots robots. Yeah the parking lots okay what what happens when Tesla who has you know the you know I would say the greatest advantage from a technology standpoint what happens to Tesla as a company when they start creating robots that can work 24 hours a day and they have the ability to control the supply of the robots. All right so like think about this you you create you create robots all right that's what you do who are artificially intelligent ran and they can do the jobs of all these humans and you're the company that makes him. All right do you sell those robots to the other companies or do you use the robots to put the other companies out of business and absorb all the business yourself. There you do that no shit so that's why Tesla stock like if you're an investor Tesla stock is probably like the fucking main stock in my opinion because that's what Elon's going to do I mean I don't the I don't agree with with I do it's just it's scary as fuck and people aren't talking about it and they're not thinking about it and you know the the companies like Amazon and Tesla they're going to end up owning everything like they're going to put every other couple. Yes and here's the thing about Amazon to bro is like a lot of a lot of companies will sell their products on Amazon but then Amazon will just make a mere product and put you out of business so they're legitimately like these people are running around voting for socialism and voting for the left while they're executing an irresponsible capitalism which that whole movement is actually against that makes sense there's there's responsible. There's a responsible ethical capitalism you know as a business owner which I own a number of businesses I take it as a personal responsibility to employ human beings in my community and that's what we should all be doing and human beings have to adjust their buying behavior to shop with companies that actually use human beings unless they want to be completely replaced and they say well you know that's not going to replace me I work construction bro you're you know Spain attention but that's 3D printing houses right now like these you if you're a carpenter in five years they're going to have robots that can make beautiful hand car staircases from a thousand years ago in the time that you in one day like you these we're not understanding what's happening and it's very dangerous no one's talking about it. Yeah, fuck me guys jump it on this conversation let us know what you guys think. Let me comment speaking of comments let's go cruise some hope. This comment comes from it comes from at Dustin band dot video 2082 ready. I drive truck everyone everywhere is getting sick I think the vaccinated are shit known as pure bloods. I mean. I mean Dustin bro you know it's real thing Dustin bro you should listen to what I just said the last 10 minutes dude two more years three more years they ain't going to have truck drivers. They're going to have a truck driver and a robot unloader on loader and like you know the truck drivers that pull up and they're like I'm not it's not my job to touch that load your people got to do it. The robots going to get out and fucking do it no problem yeah and he's going to ride in the back and the truck's going to drive itself. Oh, didn't we watch that what was I robot yeah, but it's really just something listen it's really going to be that way real soon. And it makes me very concerned like and the only way to stop it is if we the American citizens adjust our buying habits to reflect supporting companies that employ real people. And I say this over and over again and people are like oh well you know you're just trying to promote your own yeah you're right I am promote my own company because I got all these people are responsible for bro and it matters to me people. That's right people just like you we should be shopping with companies that are using the minimal amount of technology to fucking exist that's the truth and all these kids on the internet that are promoting AI they are too ignorant to understand what they're actually doing. It's highly highly highly dangerous and but as far as the vaccine is shedding I don't know about all that dude like I don't know what's going on with that I think you know we got a real bad flu I can tell you that but I can yeah no shit. I don't know about the vaccine shedding and I've heard about that and we talked about it before but I can tell you this the the all caused death data is very shocking when you take a really good look at it and people like to deny it and pretend like it's not existing but we have a major problem that's getting covered up and there's a lot of doctors just like during. COVID that are saying you know hey look at this look at this look at this and it's being completely ignored by the talking about yeah well nobody everybody still they were abused so hard they were afraid to talk about it you know and I talk to somebody the other day and they say well we're just ready to move on from COVID bro what are you talking about the COVID is actually created all the problems that we're dealing with right now like the exact quote I was told was the economy is too bad we we're not going to talk about it. We need to quit talking about COVID and start talking about the economy well the economy is bad because of what they did with COVID like the reason that you're your shit is fucked up you're just not connecting all the dots so it's I don't know Dustin but you know I think all of us need to take it seriously to start shopping with people who employ real people going out of our way to inconvenience ourselves to shop with people who employ real people and stop. So I'm just supporting these brands. Unconvenience you know stop supporting these brands because they get you the product the same day be a little bit inconvenience shop you know go pick it up yeah dude otherwise we're going to fucking lose bro I mean dude I'm going to tell you this like companies aren't going like it's going to be dictated by consumer behavior you know there's going to be a lot of consumer behavior that's going to say you know well I'm only shopping with these companies right but unless enough people do it companies are going to do it. They're going to be forced to adopt this technology that's what people don't understand because not enough people are correct and there's no company on the planet that's going to ride this into the dirt and go out of business because they're that principle that's not going to happen. Eventually they're going to have to make moves and dude unless we as Americans change our cultural standards about what we buy and who we shop with. There's a big problem and that's that's the ultimate weapon that we have is being smart about where we put our dollars yeah yeah. We got to keep this cruise moving let's head over to headline number two. I don't know if it reads Supreme Court allows federal agents to cut razor wire Texas installed on US Mexico border. Gotta talk about it this is a bright bar article reading a divided Supreme Court on Monday allowed border patrol agents to cut razor wire that Texas installed on the US Mexico border while a lawsuit over the wire continues. The justices by a five four vote granted an emergency appeal from the Biden administration which has been in an escalating standoff at the border with Texas and had objected to an appellate ruling in favor of the state. The concertina wire along roughly 30 miles of the Rio Grande near the border city of E.C. Texas is part of Texas governor Greg Abbott's broader fight with the administration over immigration enforcement. Abbott also has authorized and solving floating barriers in the Rio Grande near equal pass and allowed troopers to arrest and jail thousands of migrants on trespassing charges. The administration also is challenging those actions in federal court. Federal bill court last month forced federal agents to stop cutting the concertina wire large numbers of migrants have crossed at equal pass in recent months. In court papers the administration said the wire and peds border patrol agents from reaching migrants as they crossed the river and that that in any case federal immigration law Trump's Texas is own efforts to stem the flow of migrants into the country. Texas officials have argued that federal agents cut the wire to help groups crossing illegally through the river before taking them in for processing. Now on the vote count you got chief justice John Roberts justices Amy Coney Barrett Kataji Brow Brown Jackson Elena Kagan and Sonya Sotomayor cited with the administration. Justice Samuel Alito no gorsuch Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas voted with Texas but not one of the justices provided any explanation for their vote. Now ACB Amy Coney Barrett a Trump judge she was the deciding vote to flip on each side. But it was shocking to even see I mean it makes no sense make zero sense unless you think about it in certain ways where it makes perfect sense right and I thought there's been a lot of talk I've been seeing talks on social media you know that I mean listen is it is our country that corrupt does the corruption run that deep that it's been able to reach our highest court in this country. And it's hard to say. Uh well look man I think it's pretty clear that top to bottom we have an issue with our federal government not standing for the interest of the American people and this is just the latest thing that shows that. It's disturbing that this went that way and I don't understand I don't understand why they would vote this way I can't understand like normally I try to like think like okay well why what's the other side of the story and I don't understand that and. Right now I believe I saw I've been busy with like my real life and also trying not to die because I was so sick the. Abbott said well fuck you right oh he absolutely didn't have got you brought that up so just for little context right now the Biden administration they have admitted okay that around 6.2 illegal migrants have entered the US and. 6.2 million which if if you look at that that's actually like 12.4 yeah military age males for the most part okay how many how many do you know how many without looking it up do you know how many soldiers are in the United States military. Cycle what to 2 to 3 million no 1.4 million 1.4 so so there's. 3 3 of them 3 of them for every one of our active military. 3 to 1 yeah. Yeah and they're putting all these people in the big cities they're putting them in New York they're putting in Chicago they're putting them in LA they're putting in a San Francisco they're putting them in Phoenix. Yeah and all these places yeah across the country. Now here is I guess you could you could say the good news Greg Abbott he is standing up yeah it's not over says Texas governor following Scotus border razor wire order so he tweeted this out it is over it is over they've already allowed that many people here there Most people are already here yeah not to mention listen we I don't listen not to mention governor Abbott you bust a lot of these people up into further into this country. Yeah so let's not act like you're the fucking hero here bro right you should have stopped this a long time ago. Let's be very really honestly dude like real talk the the man of the United States of America should should have stopped this. I mean you got a national guard down there it's a combined effort between Texas National Guard I believe some Florida National Guard's been also there down at the border. But Greg Abbott tweeted this out this is not over Texas's razor wire is an effective deterrent to the illegal crossings Biden encourages I will continue to defend Texas's constitutional authority to secure the border and prevent the Biden admin from destroying our property. And just before we started recording there was a video that just got leaked the Texas National Guard are currently setting up razor wire in Eagle Pass to repel legal crossers despite the Supreme Court's order to remove the wire. And almost a sense of like like sovereign state rights like they're just saying hey listen fuck you we're doing what we do here's clip. So they're right back at it continue to set it up. It's great to see. I mean. And here's the thing I said when you when you look at it. Okay they're staying six point you that's what they're willing to admit. It's way more than that right. I think we don't know who these people are right like this video has been served. I think I speak for most people's position on this okay. Our country is made up of immigrants all right my family came here your family came here and I'm going to make a joke. I already know where to come from now what's what both they come on. I don't know you're going to say some I would even go to you are two motherfucker I can see on your face. But we got to be serious about this okay we've all come here one way or another all right. None of us for the most part were born here unless you're a Native American and you know I think they have a gripe all right let's be fucking real. Yeah and and and you know. But outside of that this is a nation of multicultural immigrants. And we've done okay we've done really good. But the reality of. Our nation right now is that all of those immigrants that came here before. Came here through a process that came here with an understanding they came here with an understanding that they were. Going to join our culture and build a great America and they left their culture of where they came from. Where they came from and they come here and they work hard and they pursue the American dream and we work collectively regardless of race culture. You know and differences of opinion to create the best possible land for ourselves and our families. Together and you know when I think of America I don't think of America as a you know people like to say you know oh well you're a colonizer you're a this or you're that. Bro when you think of an American what's an American look like I don't think of any particular like look like America looks so many different ways you know what I mean. So and we've done great like we have created this country that's amazing we've created this country that has produced so much success and and wealth and freedom for you as much as I bitch. Okay we've done pretty good this is never existed anywhere. No not with multiple religious cultures and backgrounds that's never really what usually happens is one group kills the other group right like where you came from. Okay which is Bosnia all right or where. Sired came from which is India you know like seven seven. It's like seven I'm trying to figure it out but yeah well the point is is that we all. Left those places to come here and pursue something better. And I think. People who are idealists look at these people and they say well this is the country this may what are you talking they say and you're saying exactly what. What this is about and you're telling us we need to deport these people yes we do because they didn't come here with our culture joining our mission or what our country is supposed to be about. In mind they came here to get free shit and to fucking yes pursue a dream but not adopt the American culture and these people are bringing their families. They're not they're not coming with their wives and their daughters and their children they're coming as military age males and where do you think they plan on getting their women. Where do you think they plan on what do you think they plan on doing here like these people are not coming here to. Escape something and bring their families bro there's a saying you know when men escape a war they take their families when men go to war they leave their families behind. Yeah alright and we're dealing with this is very dangerous what's happening and a lot of people who are idealist mindset do not understand it. And furthermore those of you who know better shame on you for not speaking up because you knew this the whole time but you let aOC shame you into thinking that you're a big it or you're a racist or kids kids and cages which wasn't even fucking true. Alright and now you're dealing with it I had a conversation with a guy I've known for a long time last night who's typically disagreed with everything I said. And he made a post in his social media that said I am done with this woke bullshit you guys are unpleasable I've tried to be nice to you and fuck you and I've asked you to make sense about time dude. You know and he yeah he's like and I start explaining to him what's going on and he's he's like bro that sounds crazy that sounds that sounds a little bit boogie man you know I don't know he was respectful and he's always been respectful. And he's an idealist which I can appreciate people who who have good hearts and think the best of other people but we have to face reality here bro and these people are coming to take your shit they're not coming to fucking. With their families to. Come by no bro they are coming to take your shit and the first opportunity they get they will do it and we can see this because this is happening in Europe and it's been happening for a decade go ask the men and women of Ireland. What they think about this go ask the men and women of Belgium and Holland what they think about this or of Germany or a France. Okay they will tell you very straight up this is a big fucking problem and if they listen to what I'm saying if you play them clips of what I'm telling they would say that man is telling the truth you should listen to him. Okay but a lot of you guys are so fucking up your own ass with what's going on in social media or the chiefs games or whatever's going on right that you don't you don't pay attention what's happening dude and this is going to get very dangerous do you think people. I think people traveled across the world and they're they're not serious about what they came here to get. You're not serious dude and let me ask you this if things get hard and the power goes out and shit happens and we get some civil unrest. Who's going to be more capable is it going to be third world people who have lived without comfort without power in a lot of cases who've had to like survive their whole lives who are hardened people or soft Americans who give a fuck about football on Sunday. Who's going to win that. Okay you're going to come home from work one day and these motherfuckers going to be in your house and you're not going to know what to do and then you're going to call the cops and they're going to say we can't do anything because of the law and they're going to and then you're you're out and they're in. Okay and it could go a lot of different ways it could go more different ways than that it could go they offer these people citizenship for joining the military which is what they're doing in Germany right now. Okay so they can arm and train these people and then you know we decide to protest it and they turn these motherfuckers on us that could happen. Okay they could create George Floyd style riots over the summer anti deportation riots and they could these Democrats and these progressive communist people who are always leading you know the act blue campaigns the same people behind the George Floyd destruction these people are going to be they could be saying well. You know we can't deport these people blah blah blah and get these people and then you have you have 10 million military age males writing instead of a bunch of blue hair malnourished nerds with their fucking trash can lids okay now you got a real problem and you say well the military will stop it no they won't because they're on the other side. The military has shown that they are on the side of the corrupt government the police have also shown that they you know they're going to kind of follow orders man it's my job okay we we are under a delusion if we think that the military is going to stand with the American people in a situation like that so we got a big problem here that's what I'm saying dude we got a big problem here man it's a big problem it's a big problem and people are not taking it serious enough. They're not speaking out they're not making demands men are not standing up and guys I've been telling you this for years and years and years and years and years and years okay like I'm in Missouri dude like these motherfuckers ain't nobody comes to Missouri that's one of the great things about Missouri nobody comes here alright but wherever you the fuck you are I come in your neighborhood to save you bro. You know I'm saying like you guys think like what do you guys think I got some army here I'm going to bring it to your neighborhood and we're going to fucking do this you got to do that in your own neighborhood you got to organize with your own people you got to create systems and networks and you know a plan with your own fucking communities and you're not doing it you're just sitting there waiting for someone to do something nobody's coming I'm not coming Trump's not coming nobody's coming so what the fuck are you going to do and then you make fun of me for having a fucking APC and a fucking MRAP and a bunch of guns and shit. You see what I'm saying a lot of people are not prepared bro and men are not prepared they are men are failing their obligation to protect this country that's a fact and I'm sorry to say that and if that hurts your feelings and makes you sad it makes you mad at me you're what we're talking about well sometimes it fucking truth hurts bro we got to look ourselves in the mirror and be like man are we really going to be the judge. We're going to be the judge of the generation of American men that loses this country because right now that's what it appears that's going to happen at least to me. Guys let's keep this cruise moving we got a third and final headline headline number three we got a W on the table Andy. Would you? Yeah let's talk about it speaking of cancel culture. Headline number three reads newly elected school board in Pennsylvania reclaims indigenous mascot rejects cancel culture. This story is pretty awesome pretty cool. This is a fox news that's that is that is that's a big deal. It's a big deal. That's a big deal dude this should be happening everywhere big deal. Go ahead I'm not going to wrap maybe a little fox news article reading a Pennsylvania community reclaimed its local indigenous history and a school's popular tribesman mascot last week just two months after five new school committee members. One elections and ran on pro native American platforms the southern York County school district or s y c s d school board voted seven to on Thursday to allow Suschahannick high school to bring back its traditional warriors logo. Quote this vote was the Lexington and Concord moment in the effort to defeat cancel culture native American activists and historian Andre billed out. Toll Fox News digital after lobbying on behalf of the traditional image that pays homage to the indigenous Suschahannick people all seven votes in favor of the logo came from members who were elected since a previous board voted to remove the logo back in 2021. The s y c s d school board stands as a role model and blueprint for other communities fighting for their native names and imagery. The North Dakota based Native American Guardians Association or Naga. Set in the statement after presented its case last week at the board meeting five of the newcomers were elected in November after the set of removal of the popular image in 2021. In an effort to rewrite the region's Native American history spurred community anger and action quote this movement was about erasing Native American culture and I wasn't about to stand for Jennifer. The North Dakota's mother, a mother of three children and one of the new school board members told Fox News digital. She and the other four new school board members including her husband Nathan Henkel have never before ran for elected office. These are just community members who again saw problem and go into fix it. The first time I was in the school board meeting was about to have a however is apparently not welcomed by everybody in the community quote. They came into their new positions with provato to push their personal agendas and not with humility to learn their jobs wrote Deborah Collina a former member of the school board and a recent guest editorial that appeared in the York Daily record quote to put the mask out of way is respect for the past for the present and for the future. Identified as a school alumna mother and Native American also told the same local outlet after the vote last week. Henkel said that Henkel said she was moved to political action by the negative impact on the community of the COVID-19 lockdowns and school closures and by a cancel culture. The effort to rewrite local history to stir public sentiment against the warriors image the outrage instead fueled the community's effort to save its local history. Now here's the thing so that school board they hired in this fucking. Like a research company right to come in and do the history of the area in the school right and listen to this okay quote current research findings demonstrate that there is no evidence that the Susquehannick indies. Susquehannick indians lived in or around the municipalities that comprise the southern York County school district the board's diversity committee wrote in a 2021 study. Yet that diversity committee report appears to conflict with centuries of known local history European explorers wrote about the Susquehannick people who lived along the Susquehanna River as early as 1608. While while historians believe that they lived in the area centuries earlier so they completely falsified and lied on this fucking report that they use to justify the removal of this mascot their own diversity committee a lot about it. Like the history is actually there yeah been there for centuries yeah. So Susquehannick communities were located along the Susquehanna River especially in Cumberland Doplin Lancaster in York counties reports the website of the Susquehanna national heritage area citing several historical sources the native peoples the website also said lived in large fortified towns the large of which may have had a population of nearly 3000 people. And of course that I versus reported apparently relied heavily on information provided by the national Congress of American indians or NCAI to stoke opposition to the Susquehannick warriors mascot the powerful DC based lobbying group is supported by taxpayer dollars and by left wing activist group. So here's a picture of the five new members there's the logo up on the school school mascots coming back and they did it. Cool. I think I think that's a good common sense move. You know we've talked about this a number of times on the show. How does it make sense to remove and Chimima from syrup as one of the only African American or black American icons that has that type of brand. What the fuck are we talking about bro that's insulting you know like we remove. This was a real person. Yeah like dude that's like it's these woke woke white progressive people who are offended for everybody else. You need to mind your own business bro and let people speak for themselves you know the Washington redskins changing the commanders that makes no sense. Let's let's take an honor an honorable mascot that in Native American culture is renowned to be badass fucking warrior. Okay. From one of the most iconic NFL brands ever let's remove that and let's replace them with the commanders the people who fucking killed them and say that it's for their honor and like dude that's bullshit. Okay and but like that it's kind of like I know dude it's insane and we could say the same thing about the Cleveland Indians okay and the guardians and we could fucking why is Quaker Oats still Quaker Oats and but Uncle Ben can't be Uncle Ben you know what I'm saying like what do we mind. Yeah so basically do this but see if you really break it down these people these people are the racists okay. They are the people who are pretending to care about these people but then removing them from these iconic brand images that actually honor that culture and a part of American culture. Okay we should be celebrating those things we should be celebrating the Native American warriors we should be celebrating them we should be celebrating black Americans who you know are branded as part of cultural iconic brands like these. But these white progressive liberals are removing these things from society under the guys that they are offensive when only people that are really offended by that are them and they're white and they're fucking liberal and they live in a mick mansion and fucking suburbs and they want to have something to talk about it brunch with their pinkies up and shit like they're doing something good when in reality bro they're just eliminating some of the only culture iconic brands that are most important in these communities like it's not really good. We should be looking at these communities like it's insane dude it's totally insane it's totally backwards and you know we do need to go back like the like the red skin should go back to the red skins the Indians should go back to the Indians the the and we should be looking at those as like very positive moves for the cultures you know what I'm saying like. Yeah bro what so so so I mean dude that's it man like we this is we need to put our foot down and say no more of this shit yeah this is a search yes of W man congratulations to you guys up there way to fight man like this is what we talk about like these regular people they've never even ran for anything they never know didn't he off yeah and look how look that they can make change changes happen man bro how many high schools out here have done some shit like yeah fuck. And dude people they had jobs I know I had fucking families to take care of so hold on why do they do this we mean why do they remove these these icons from these products national identity bro okay is destroying that all right well people most people don't get this most people don't understand that this is part of the demoralization process America if people can't find things if cultures can't find things that they like for example they want the black community to believe that America is not for them they want the black community to believe that America is evil towards them they want the the American Indian community to believe that America is evil towards them and that you know there's some arguments to be made about the history of those things 100% but moving forward bro those are like points of pride for those cultures in what in the American culture okay so if you remove the points of pride because really think about this bro you people like well why do they leave quicker votes because they want you to believe that everybody else thinks that America is for only white quicker people okay and they want to remove black people from every product and remove Native Americans from every product and remove Indian Indians from products or any sort of minority so that they can be convinced because I'll never see they can be convinced in culture that America has no place for them you understand and then the bro the fucked up what's fucked up about it is that these will be the same people who try to yell at us and say that we're trying to burn books and delete history when they're doing it they're actually doing but dude people aren't paying attention or don't understand why it's happening they think it's just some crazy woke people and they are it's the useful idiots yawning the drums around this right but here's the thing it's not just because they want to they are being pushed to do it saying oh look how offensive that is there are no but the people calling the play up at the top the communist all right they are they understand what's happening they understand it if we turn the useful idiots the drunk wine moms who have no concept of what's really going on so they're not going to say that's what we've been there are no saying this is offensive and this is this, that they will remove these particular items of identity for these cultures and then the communists that the top can convince the cultures that they don't have a place in America because look at, there's no brands of represent you. There's no, there's no teams that represent you. All the teams represent white people, quicker oats. Blah, blah, blah, guardians, commanders. You see what I'm saying? This is about painting the picture that America is not a place for these minorities under the guise that this is offensive to minorities. It makes no sense. It's a communist legit operation. It's happening that people are not waking up to. You know, let's remove all the identity for all these groups and let's leave it only for the white people and then we'll convince them that America is evil. It's crazy, man. Crazy. Guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. That was our third and final headline with that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. As always, thumbs up or dumbest fuck. This is where we bring a headline up. We talk about it. It'll get one of those two options. So with that being said, our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline is, you remember you said a couple of weeks ago, or maybe a week ago, you were like, guys, we'll do anything for pussy. Conquer countries. Okay, just keep that in mind. Hell on roots. Boyfriend busted for dressing and drag to take career exam for girlfriend. Well, at least he's not fucking shaking his dick and fucking kids. It's allowed. Yeah, was he taking the ACT, thought copying someone else's test answers was extreme. A 26 year old man named Andre's Singh has been arrested after allegedly masquerading as his girlfriend so he could take an exam in her stead, as seen in photos blowing up online. He tried to enter the examination hall by changing his appearance, police spokesperson, Manur Kamur Kamar told Jam Press of the soulmate Cosplay. Singh had been attempting to take a recruitment test for his girlfriend, Perra Mejit, Kuhr, who's 34, at the DAV public school in Koutop, Pura Poonjob, earlier this month, the Indian Express reported. Kuhr had previously failed the exam and prerequisite to becoming a healthcare worker. To deceive test officials, the undercover lover shaved his facial hair, applied makeup, and got gussied up in women's clothes before entering the exam room. The meticulous impersonator even went so far as the Forch's girlfriend's voter card, ID card, and and a hard card, a 12 digit unique identity number to make the illusion iron clad. These photos depicted the human chameleon allegedly disguised as his other half at the Bobo Farid University of Health Sciences in Poonjob. Unfortunately, Singh failed the sex exam. Exam officials reportedly grew suspicious after noticing that his face didn't match the picture of Kuhr on the application form, according to the Fair to Cot police superintendent, Arjeet Singh, his uncle. Authorities subsequently ran Singh's biometrics and discovered that they didn't match the ones kept on record, records Kumar reported. So we got arrested for his bizarre cheating tactic. Police also accused Kuhr, the girlfriend of conspiring with her boyfriend, as they believe he wouldn't have been able to enact the deception without her consent and possible assistance. All right, now let's show the girlfriend first. Okay, so this is a picture of the girlfriend. And boyfriend. Come on, go back. Come on, dude. Bro, that's pretty funny. Bro, it is. That's the ID card. That's him. Oh, man. Bro, one day this guy's gonna be like an older dude and he's gonna be like, like, they're gonna be sitting around telling stories and shit and he's, they're gonna be like, what's your craziest story? Oh, listen, here you'll never know. Bro, that's so weird. That was some sitting in class, bro. Yeah, that's not gonna cut it, bro. Wait until you dump some. Yeah, she can dump them because he failed the exam, bro. Yeah, well, study a little harder, man. I mean, listen, let's just go show. We will literally do anything. Yeah, yeah, where's some? Never mind. Yeah, for some, for some curry. What? I'm just saying she probably has some good curry. What's some buddy, buddy? This, we can't do the jokes of Z-Shawng's out there. No, man. It's not, he's not listening. He's gonna, I'm sure he'll watch this. No, we need Z-Shawng here if we're gonna make jokes. He probably knows this guy. Okay. Yeah, this is thumbs down, bro. Yeah, dumbass fuck. Yeah. All right, sorry, man. Very rare that we just, we drink the hatred here on the show, but that's pretty bad. You could have did better. Make it more convincing this time. Cut it off. All right, you guys see, Andy. That's all I got. All right, guys, hey, don't forget, don't be a hoe. Show the show. Yeah. We're from sleeping on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck a boat, fuck a stove. Counting millions in a coke. Bad bitch, booty, slow. Got a own bankroll, can't fold. Just a note here, shot case, clothe, clothe.
