make some people better that's that's the plan that's that's uh I say this I know the people are rooting for you to get your shit together in your training yeah yeah a lot of love that's uh yeah I get did I'm getting DMs about it people are pumped yeah a lot of love and uh yeah all we're doing they want to see the ribs and dick but they don't know that's on your own show them one of them it's on your only fan okay show both show you one which wouldn't ain't the ribs all right let's do something guys Andy question number one let's dive into these uh question number one Andy uh what's going on Andy I'm currently 23 yeah hey I'm currently 24 years old uh and I work at a machine shop I also do side work at a farm for extra cash and other miscellaneous side gigs I can get so he sells drugs on the side this is what's that miscellaneous that means drug dealer straight to jail oh he says I will be attending trade school to become an electrician in the fall for the next two years I have zero debt and I try to diversify and allocate my money into the right spots to not only preserve what I have but to also multiply it and build wealth my question is I feel like I have a lot going on and I constantly have new ideas that I want to pursue just because I'm a curious person and I would like to be the jack of wall trades how would you handle the fact that you want to try so many new things and become more valuable and can't tie down to one thing sometimes I feel like I'm wasting my time thinking about so many different ideas um I love all that you guys do I will keep supporting uh and watching the show all right so I really appreciate the hustle I appreciate the willingness to do all these things I think that's a great thing to have that ambition and have that drive and be willing to be curious and learn and if you're going to do those things in your 20s is the right time so I'm not going to sit here and say that that's a bad thing but I want you to keep something in mind the reason most people don't succeed is because they can't pick something all right and because they can't pick something they are unable to invest the time and the energy and the effort to become a master of it right uh jack of all trades but a master of none that's the saying and that's true and so you have to consider that you will be competing against people who have chosen one of those things as their main thing and it's a very arrogant thought and a misguided thought to believe that you can beat someone even if they're not as skilled as you with only a percentage of your work ethic and your energy if they're going all in so I think it's okay that you're kind of exploring and I think it's okay that you are curious and you want to know because like dude you don't want to make a decision then hate it right um and by the way if that does happen it's not a total waste not a total waste because you're going to learn right you're going to learn skill sets and you can take those skill sets and apply them somewhere else like for example if you're making fucking hamburgers right now or you're making fries right now you should be making the best hamburgers out of everybody else that you work with and you should be making the best fucking fries and why that matters is because you're cultivating the mentality and the habit forming of creating things at a high level and doing whatever task it is at a high level so if you happen to be sweeping the floors right now sweep the fuck out of those floors and make them perfect because that skill of doing things the right way will follow you to whatever it is that you go to but with that being said we want to try and waste as little time as possible into things that aren't going to be our thing and most people at 24 years old don't necessarily know exactly what they're going to do I didn't know at 24 years old even though I was already five years into my business that this was going to be the thing that I did forever but as I accumulated more knowledge and more experience it made sense for me to continue and there were things that I really enjoyed for example one of the things that I really love that I get to do every single day is I get to legitimately help people change their bodies change their minds change their lives and that's very rewarding outside of the money made from it so I got sort of lucky and that and I use that term very loosely because when a lot of people hear luck they they start to make excuses well you didn't get he got lucky no I didn't have an option and that was the lucky part of it I had to keep going and that allowed me to become a master of what I do so my advice to you would be to try to figure out what it is you want to do as quickly as possible and then go all in on that and remove the rest of the shit okay because you don't want to be a jack of all trades and a master of none because what that equates to is you not being competitive in the field that you're in and that equates to you not having very much money in your bank account all right so and if you're older if you're 30 or if you're in your 40s it's very important that you get that solved quickly because you have less time than the 24 year old or 19 year old to sort of discover right so choosing what we want to do is a hard decision but if we make an educated guess about where we want to be and what we want to do and what we want our life to look like and we consider the fact of what we enjoy and what has the potential to actually become a very profitable lucrative career now we're in a situation to make an educated guess at what we want to do and and so you start down this path and you're able to be competitive because you're putting all your energy in that and you know you're able to maybe beat some of the other people that because you're better you're putting more experience or you're putting in more work or you're learning more if you got a better coach or a better mentor that's actually done what it is that you want to do not one of these fucking dumb fucks out here that lies about everything they'll those people can collapse your time frame on becoming an expert you the point is you want to make your choices quickly as possible you want to go all in as quickly as possible because it's going to take that all in effort to be competitive in the marketplace so that would be my advice to a 24 year old now if I were to give this advice to a 34 year old or a 44 year old it would maybe be hey motherfucker you need stop fucking around and pick the thing you're going to do or you can have the fucking time to do it yeah you see what I'm saying yeah so there's as you go and by the way if you're 34 or you're 44 and you're just getting started that's okay too but you better find someone who's done what the fuck it is you're trying to do so that they can collapse your time frame and get you on the path as quick as possible so as you age the pressure to make the decision to go all in becomes more and more crucial because of the lack of time that we have on the back end so that that would be my answer to that young man I love that I mean a couple of these on this you know people always say you know that saying of jack fall trades is a master of none but like there's a second part of that that says but a master of one is still better than a master of none right and so like to your point like you're still going to get beat out by somebody who who went all in yeah bro look you can't look to it is it's impossible there's very fucking few people so here's this is the fallacy of the internet right you see all these fucking coaches who've never built a mother fucking thing all these guys wanting to be podcasters and speakers and entrepreneurial authorities and they sell courses on shit they never did they they they're not effective entrepreneurs their whole income stream is to sell other people shit that you know they didn't actually do right so a lot of these sayings go around the internet that are that are highly misleading and one of them is the average entrepreneur has seven screen or the average millionaire has seven streams of income yeah after they've already mastered the one thing that's made them a millionaire then they would do something called diversification and you would apply the skill sets that you know as being an entrepreneur being successful in one thing to parallel things okay so like when you hear the average millionaire has seven streams of income they didn't get to the millionaire by having seven streams at the beginning they got there because they mastered one thing and then they were making money so they diversified into other things and usually when you go and look at these people's multiple income streams they are very parallel to what they did the first time because those skill sets are applicable to each category so for example my skill set is brand building and and fulfillment and selling CPG goods direct to the consumer now I do that with cannabis I do that with tequila I do that with you know I help with all these other things that are all the skill sets all aligned right like you don't ever find these entrepreneurs who are like you know they did one thing and then all this like they didn't just do a CPG brand and then all of a sudden they're a restaurant tour right or they're a fucking I don't know they own a some sort of concrete company like usually yeah usually you take the skill sets that you have and you apply them to parallel type situations which allows you to scale very quickly in these other brands but this this whole idea of I'm going to you know have seven streams of income when I'm 19 years old and that's what's no because you're gonna lose that way because your competing against people who are putting all their energy in the one thing and you're not so it's impossible to compete like that does that make sense so like when I look at businesses like I was talking to Mosy about this just the other day and I was like but I want to fucking starts I got the issue to like start something up again like I love the startup phase I love going from zero to like you know eight figures like that's I really love that part of the process and him and I were chatting back and forth and and he was like well what do you think and I'm like I don't know if something that fits in my range of skill set right yeah and you have to be aware enough of what that skill set is so as you develop your first thing you're going to figure out what is my strong points and what do I know and what am I good at what am I better than everybody else at and then you take those things and you apply them to this next thing and that next thing that next thing or you vertically integrate off of the things that you're already doing like a lot of the stuff I do is vertical integration offshoots of what we do as our main thing right so but this idea that you're going to read this meme is says average millionaire has seven streams of income but they don't have that until they've already made it in one thing because to make it in one thing the first thing requires everything you have so if you read that the wrong way you know we see a lot of these younger guys on the internet saying I do this I got seven businesses I got 10 businesses yeah but you ain't making it none of them you know what I mean right so having a business having an LLC having a you know that's not that that's not that that doesn't matter it's how much money are you fucking making you know what I mean so so yeah dude it's it's very easy for me to see this where I'm at right at Ford I'm 44 years old now 25 years in business since I was 19 in the same business not in fucking business like I started a bunch and they failed right right I haven't had a business fail since I was 19 years old all of them a fucking one so when we when we look at actually that's not true I did have one that's failed we'll talk about that another time but the point is is that it's very easy for me to see how this works and it's very hard for the young person to see how it works so you know go back and listen to this question a few times if you just getting started but just remember you're not going to be able to get great at the one thing that's going to make you all the money if you're spreading your effort across multiple things where this person's already learned the main things that they need to do so that's like competing against someone who spends all their time playing basketball and you think you're going to be as good as them but you're also bowling and you're playing baseball and you're playing hockey and you're you're wrestling and you're playing football and you're practicing all this shit I mean I think it's pretty safe to say that the guy who practices all of this time of basketball is going to beat your ass and that's the same in business so you need to think about it like that I love it I love it man what guy's any question number two Andy I graduate high school in two weeks that's a lot of my friends are talking about taking a gap year which is basically they take a year off from work or take a year off from going to college and find themselves in other words they live off the parents and party and don't do shit I'm good let them yeah until you can get ahead of them now I'm definitely going to college I want to be a lawyer these friends do listen to the show not as much as I do but can you give them some real advice on why this gap year would be a bad idea or as bad as I think it would be for them appreciate your big dog oh yeah I'll give you a bunch of ideas one you're you're gonna be lazy as fuck so you're gonna get out of the habits of doing the work every day which most people never get back into to by not paying attention to what's going on business and the society and everything that's going on in terms of having a career is changing so fast that when you come back and you start paying attention again you're gonna be way behind three the people who don't take a gap year automatically you're ahead of you automatically and I know you think what doesn't matter if they're actually a year ahead of me no it actually does okay so there's three reasons now are the benefits taken to gap year I don't know maybe like you could go to Europe like I went to Europe when I graduated high school I went I went but I didn't take a whole year off it was a fucking yeah I just went for you know a few weeks and it was awesome but I think the most dangerous thing about this gap year is that it breaks the routine of you having to be productive which is a habit which is very very important especially if you're gonna go on to build a career now a lot of people aren't going to college but clearly you know if you're gonna be a lawyer you know some states they let you take the bar without it but it's probably a good idea to go to college right if you're gonna be a lawyer but if you're not gonna be something that requires a professional degree like that you you should automatically go into the workforce because most companies aren't even looking for degrees anymore they're not looking for indoctrinated employees like honestly like when people apply here with their college degree I almost don't want to hire them because I know they've been fed a bunch of fucking bullshit so I'm not saying this because you don't want to take the gap year so that you can go to college right away I'm saying this is that it's that's a valuable year for you to get ahead of all your peers if you choose to go hard right away I started my business at 19 years old all right I went to one year of college and I was like man this ain't for me and then I kept going to college when I first started my business and I got three years in I'm like not fuck this these people are stupid I learned it for myself but it just depends on what you want to do if you want to be a doctor you got to go to school if you want to be a lawyer it's pretty good idea to go to school you want to be an engineer you probably got to go to school but if you're just going to school to go to school yeah don't don't get yourself in that situation well I think there's something to about putting off the reality of the world right like there's something to be said that like I mean I feel like you know people are leaving high school you're in the real world now right like your decisions like that's when your decisions start having real consequences in the real world your view doesn't adult right and to try to put that off and delay that it's like you're slowly ripping the band aid off it's like no just rip the shit off and get out I you know I'm saying yeah well I mean I know it was that way for you because you didn't have you didn't have a I bet you were right out on your own oh it's 17 yeah yeah not everybody's like that you know people do have parents that take care of them like the guy said in the question yeah if you were my kid I would tell you this I would say hey it's okay to go see the world take a trip for two weeks do whatever you got to do but let's fucking get after it right now because your peers and the people you're competing against they're gonna be not only taking a year off they're gonna be fucking off for four more years in college and then they're gonna try to figure out what they do I would say hey let's get to work building something right now and that way we've got a four or five year head start on all these other fuckers and it's a valuable head it's a valuable time because you can't get that head start really any other time in life yeah so that's my take on it if you were my son that's what I would say um but you ain't so yeah yeah I love it all right well guys Andy our third and final question uh Andy I want to start by saying I hate the victimhood mentality just as much as the next person it's low hanging fruit in my opinion I feel like people with real struggles and real hardships don't really speak on those things publicly or not I know that life happens to everyone things happen death sicknesses etc my question is when you have found yourself in those dark times in your life what have you found to be the best way to get through them I feel like a lot of people suffer in silence and don't know how to get out of the suffering without feeling like they are a part of the victim mentality bullshit how how do we handle this look man you're gonna have bad times you're gonna have hard times everybody has them okay it's called fucking life here's the thing when hard times come when bad shit happens most people lay down and they stop trying they go and they curl up in a little ball in the shower and they fucking cry and they boo who about their life and a lot of times that's justified all right your your child could die you could lose a sibling you could your parents could who knows you know lots of shit okay and it's okay to be upset that's not what I'm saying but what I am saying is if you wallow in that for the next fucking five years and you concentrate on just that and you always talk about that and you always focus on that you can't move through it effectively so the way to move through hard times which are gonna happen bro nobody is immune to them and you're correct people who go through really hard shit usually don't bitch about it they just fucking eat it and the way that those people get through it is that they control the things they can control okay what can you control you can control the most important things that affects your daily life every single day you can't control your environment you can't control what's gonna happen you can't control what God's gonna do you can't control these tragedies these are gonna happen you can't control a bad economy you can't control a fire burning down your house you can't control these things but what you can't control is that you can control what you eat you control how you move your body you control what you put in your mind you control how you treat people you control your attitude you control all of these things and those things are the most important things to your daily state of mind and your daily state of being okay if you're eating well and you're drinking water and you're putting good things in your mind and you're continuing to make progress you're gonna feel much better than the person who's just wallowing in their hardship all right and not only that and this is the most important thing most people get paralyzed in terms of progress of their life when hard things happen and if you have developed the ability to control the controllables and move through and continue to progress when everybody else quits you're you've got a big gap there you create a big advantage for yourself because most people can't do that all right so and I know it's hard but sometimes the best way to get through things is to actually just keep pushing through and that way when you do start feeling better you don't look back and you say fuck I let all my progress die I let my business die I let my career die I got fat I got this and you don't have this huge mountain that you have to climb now to get back where you were because you were disciplined enough and smart enough to control those things through the hardship okay so now instead of being in this bad mental spot you've kind of worked your way out of it and you're like fuck all right I'm starting to feel better and you look back you're like well fuck I didn't really even get off track because I was controlling the controllables so I'm in a really good spot okay and so not only is it good for you mentally but it's also good for you in the terms of how much progress you're making against your peers and a lot of people will say this fucking no such thing as competition I'm just competing with myself bullshit okay there's very little spots at the top of higher under potential and that's what we talk about here we talk about earning potential making money kicking ass and business in life there are very few spots at the top it is a limited fucking placing okay that's why there are so few of them and then below that the level of pretty good that's more of those and then there's average where by definition there's the most of those that's why it's called average all right so most people end up in average because a like we talked about beginning they don't pick the thing b they spread their efforts across multiple things c when bad things happen they have to they paralyze themselves and they don't make that progress and all the while the people who the people who do all of those things continue to move forward which creates a huge gap and the results that are produced and dude the reality is is the world rewards results it doesn't care if you're fucking sad it doesn't care if you don't feel good it doesn't care if you're going through bullshit the world doesn't give a fuck and you have to understand this and you can argue about it you could cry about it you could say it's not there but that is the way it is so if you can build yourself into someone who can move through the hard times effectively maybe not at top level but at least effectively so that we're not having to climb this big mountain that you created by pausing and just wallowing bro you you got a really good chance of beating everybody else out so that's the way to look at it my opinion yeah let me actually I'm gonna get real real quick because I want to I want to I really would like to see your take on this right you got stabbed you were 20 22 23 years old and you were stabbed and you said that was about a two-year time period in your life right it shit was dark yeah right now fast forward to 2021 you tear your shoulder yeah fucking the blizzard blinner rate yeah I wasn't just tears total destruction yeah you know I'm saying that was about a two-year yeah what what would you say the differences between the differences when they're when I got stabbed I fucking sat around I drank I didn't do shit I felt sorry for myself I didn't go out in public I was embarrassed I wallowed and it made me into a suicidal fucking literal nightmare of a human being this time and by the way it's a different thing okay there's different levels of severity here and as bad as my shoulder was it's still a bad thing but it wasn't as bad as getting stabbed in the fucking face right those are the results I said I look at them to say well it's less traumatic yeah I'll say that so but the amount of mental impact that it had was very similar that's what I mean because I wasn't able I was at first while I was at the best shape my life I had all the momentum and it completely derailed all of that but what I did instead of wallowing I did with the fuck I could I come in here I fucking train with one arm I I would do everything I could I eat good I train with one arm I I didn't put on a bunch of weight I didn't get fucking fat again I kept my weight off I kept my fitness close to in check and I think that made it so like I was able to continue moving forward in all areas of my life so I didn't miss two years of my life I just sitting around crying feel sorry for myself and by the way it was one of the better best like just like getting stabbed I say it was the best thing that ever happened to me because it changed my perspective you know having my shoulder reconstructed when I'm at the peak of my physicality and and mental being and then having to go back and then working through that was a huge mental test that I fucking passed so now I look back and I'm like yeah that's suck but fuck that I didn't beat me it didn't break me and now I have that much more confidence because of that so you know if you keep moving things are going to work out much better than if you don't and so you know that it's just reality dude it's not my opinion it's just reality well I think a lot of people too they get stuck in those times like when that storm comes and they wallow in it and before you know it it's life here comes another storm yeah the shit like and so I think there's also like a universal aspect to this too right because the more you wallow in it and you're not doing anything to fix or adjust or change the universe somehow gives you a little bit more of that man because like that's what you're asking it's almost like that's what you're asking bro when you focus this is why I talk about therapy the way I do because when you focus on the same problems day in and day out day in and day out day in and day out pour me I'm fucked up I got this wrong me I got that wrong me I can't do this because of that you're actually putting all of your focus on all these things that are bad in your life and when you put your focus on all these things that are bad in your life do you know what the universe gives you more bad okay and this is why you know while I think therapy may be beneficial for some people I think it's totally overblown I think it's highly predatory for a lot of these therapists because these therapists have no incentive to actually get you better because you're paying them to continue to be fucked up all right so they want you to talk about your shit they want you to focus on your shit because they know that if you focus on your shit and talk about your shit you can't get through shit all right now I'm not saying that you shouldn't talk to someone that is not what I'm saying I'm saying that it is way overblown in terms of how appropriate it is and if you actually want to get better you need to start focusing on what you're trying to create and who you're trying to become again just like you did before and not focusing on how bad sheet is and how hard you have it all right that is a absolutely for sure recipe to stay in that exact same place if you always focus on what your problems are and you always focus on what's wrong if you're in a down spot and you're in a spot where you're you know you know you're not want to be you have to just make the plan like you have never made the plan before right you have to start out at ground zero and say okay yeah fucking I got derailed all right I still want to be that motherfucker over there so what does that guy do he does this he does this he does this he does this and then start doing those things right away controlling the controllables and you push yourself out of that fucking place so yeah that's why liveharps such a valuable program for people because it forces them to push through you can't do the program if you're not willing to work through adversity because it's a year-long program and you know it takes up 40% of your year you're bound to have adversity during that program so if you if you can learn to work through the adversity and stay on the program you learn a new skill set which is very valuable which is how to move forward when everybody else gets paralyzed does that make sense absolutely do I actually remember I think it might have been like the second day or or third day after your surgery um you were like what we're about to see what I'm made of yeah with my fucker I need cardio fucking 30 minutes after my surgery just to prove a point to myself yeah yeah so I think that I think that that's uh that's that's some real shit man yeah um yeah man I love it was that three that was three we got four we got another one we'll do another one yeah let's uh pour some sauce extra sauce a sauce sauce sauce I think that's actually something really nasty south south south is like fucking like you know a head cheeses hot cheese no what what it's real head cheese like some stuff you got on your little p there no that's dick cheese well that's that's head cheese oh no it's south no south was like a real thing you got a cheesy you got a cheesy pee no I thought you got to be like you know not snipped I don't know what the fuck you are aren't I'm snipped okay see you got the mushroom tip mm-hmm they did a great job actually yeah I feel good about mine too yeah I mean like I'm yeah yeah solid dog you got one of those mushrooms too yep all right what'd you say all right that's why he likes you get to you so much keep rubbing on everybody all right let's do it like guys stay focused yeah maybe pour the bell on this is very serious stop it this is serious we're serious here this is a fucking serious show all right back to make people better yeah um it questioned number four guys Andy uh Andy how do you tame your nervous system in moments of high stress or perceived conflict I am 24 years old I've been in business I've been a business owner for four years tough conversations and perceived conflict sends my body into fight or flight even even though I logically know there's no real imminent danger I have been working on addressing these situations head on and talking to myself through them however I still feel my heart rate increase palms get sweaty and feeling like I can't get my words out or address the situation in the moment like I need to often freeze uh do you have any tricks for calming your nervous system or the fight or flight response uh so you can address conversations and situations effectively absolutely first of all if you're a young entrepreneur this is not abnormal to feel nervous when you have to have conversations that there may be some contention in them okay uh that's a normal thing and the way that you ultimately get through that is by having them over and over and over again to the point where it's just natural to have them and I could promise you if you will just commit to working through this process you will get to a point where you could have these conversations and your heartbeat will not even change at all it would just be a conversation and so the first thing you have to do to get to that point is you have to be willing to do them you have to be willing to do the reps and that goes for anything any skillset you're trying to build this is a skill set having conversations that are direct that's a skill set so you have to be willing to have them if you ever want to get better secondly you have to frame the conversation the proper way if you go into it saying this is a conflict conversation or this is a this is a hard conversation it's going to be conflicting and it's going to be hard because you've already decided that so instead just say I got to have a conversation all right don't put the burden on yourself that this is going to be hard and and you start imagining all these unlikely scenarios about what they could say and usually don't even say that shit usually you sit down you say hey this is what I need and they say okay cool yeah and so yeah so understand that people aren't going to automatically like flip the fuck out because you have to tell them something a lot of young entrepreneurs and I don't mean young and age I just mean young in the game they really struggle with this because they've never been a position where they have to like tell someone what they need or direct someone right so they're very uncomfortable with it and they feel like fuck I don't want to tell somebody what it what this means or I don't want to have this conversation or I don't want to be direct because I don't want them to think that I'm better than them no dude it's not that you're better than them and this is point number three you have to realize that that's your role your role on the team is to direct the boat on the right course and you can't get the boat on the right course unless you're talking to the people who are rowing the boat right and you might be rowing the boat too so you might have to talk while you're rowing and you might have to say to the guys hey you guys over there on the right you're rowing a little too slow we got to pick it up so we can go straight and we don't go in a circle you see what I'm saying that's not a hard conversation because they want to go straight to so you have to remember they have an interest in getting this problem corrected as well and most people that are reasonable want to correct those things so all of that aside you have to remember dude you have chosen a path that you have not gone down before and there's going to be lots of things that are difficult for you and one of them for most people is to have a direct conversation but if you can't learn to have a direct conversation you are not valuable that is it and that goes for you're not effective and you're not valuable and that doesn't just go for the person who's directing the boat on what direction that goes for the motherfucker who's also a rowing aka an employee right if an employee like if you're back on the back of the boat and you're you're back there and no one can really see you rowing you're fucking or is fucked up and you don't tell anybody and you're rowing as hard as you can and you still can't row with the team because you're or is fucked up and you don't want to go say something because you're afraid of what they're going to say you're invaluable and ineffective to the team and a lot of people who are in like entrepreneurs they don't understand this concept they don't understand that they have to give feedback they have to be willing to say hey here's where I'm having an issue because that's valuable shit to the leadership and leadership will value someone a hundred times more that will come to them and say hey here's a problem I see without abusing that conversation okay because there's two kinds of people here there's people who will come and give you the exact feedback you need that is valuable who is a team player and they say hey this is what I notice I think it needs to get fixed here what can we do to fix this and then people there's the other kind of person who will disguise their their feedback as a complaint or as a way to get something more for them all right and that always usually everything that usually sounds like bitching okay so there's a big difference between bitching and giving constructive feedback if you just go to your leadership and bitch all the time because you hear Andy say it's important to give feedback or you're invaluable you're gonna get fired because people don't like that they don't like getting bitched at they don't like hearing gossip they don't the there's there's important shit and then there's not important shit and your job and giving feedback is to keep all the not important shit off the plate of your leader and make their job easier and then bring the important shit to them so that they can fix it and the team can move forward so this ability to directly communicate is a massive asset not just for the leadership but also the people who are on the team that aren't necessarily the main leader you can be a leader peer to peer to that's a whole another thing like if you're on a team and you're in the boat and I'm just giving you some free game on how to be more valuable and you're you're back there and you hear the other guy and he's like fuck fuck this this is stupid this is blah blah blah that's where you go to the guy be like hey that motherfucker ain't on the team bro we need someone else rowing right and what most people will do is they'll do this fucking pussy shit well some people are upset because who people well I don't want to name names well then bro you're not valuable to me because I can't fix the problem if you won't name the fucking name I gotta play guess who to do it's so it's a most annoying shit in the world and the reason it happens is because there isn't trust between the leadership and the team okay the leadership has to earn trust of the team to know that they have the team's best interests in mind and then the team will be more likely to communicate directly to you and that's what you want you want direct communication both ways hey guys I need you to roll a little harder the guy in the back so hey my horse fucked up I need to fucking do this okay all right good and that guy over there that guy ain't fucking he don't want to be here let's throw him off the fucking boat right let's get someone on here that does that's all valuable shit but what's not valuable is going to the front of the boat and saying man I'm fucking tired I don't I don't like this I don't like the way the horse are hurting my hands you know like I don't I don't like the way I don't like the tone you use when you tell us to row that shit get the fuck out you know what I'm saying we're here to fucking win we're here to kick ass we're here to be productive we're here to win as a team and that that requires open conversation direct conversation honest feedback without all the trash okay so hopefully that helps some of you guys no 100% man I love it guys Andy that was four yeah try not to be a war
