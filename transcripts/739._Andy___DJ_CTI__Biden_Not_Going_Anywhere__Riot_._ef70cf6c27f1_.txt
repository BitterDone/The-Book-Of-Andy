all right so what are we gonna talk about on the show hey listen we got there's there's actually some really crazy shit happening in the world guys of course you know if you want to see any of these pictures these articles these links these videos you can find them all at anyforcelad.com we link them up there for you but there's some interesting stuff happening um I think let's first we gotta do a little little update with uh with the Biden camp and specifically we'll be Goldberg mm-hmm and it has to do with shitty pants well this could go a number of different ways let's dive into a guys headline number one headline number one reads a Biden calls into morning Joe remains defiant about staying in the race I am not going anywhere um so this is an interesting uh little talk he did um which he completely failed president Biden called into msnbc's morning Joe on Monday and defiantly proclaimed that he would be staying in the 2024 presidential race quote the bottom line here is that we're not going anywhere I am not going anywhere Biden told host mecha brazinski and Joe Scarborough both avid white house supporters quote I wouldn't be running if I absent if I didn't absolutely believe that I am the best candidate to beat Donald Trump in 2024 he said quote we have a democratic nominating process where the voters spoke clearly I won 14 million of those votes um after uh brazinski introduced Biden as the presumptive democratic nominee uh the president laughed and boldly stated quote I am more than the presumptive I'm going to be the nominee he actually ends up getting a little pissed which I thought was interesting uh let's let's check out to the slip now mind you again this this is Biden calling in this is on a telephone line he's calling him let's check this out I mean it's not an ad it's not an ad but if we were to run ad it did do that's such a like that I don't feel like other cans open like that listen it's all the freedom I have the products got to be perfect talk about everything the can you got some nice cans Andy all I know is that if I were to run ads it would definitely be for this amazing first form energy drink get yours yeah today yeah yeah all right he almost tasted man it should is good it is good it's good um but yeah so jump out and get to a little piss so let's let's let's let's hear this let's see what we got going on here the American public is not going to move away from me as the average voter and again I'm here for two reasons pal one for rebuilding economy for hardworking middle class people give everybody a shot that's a straight shot everybody gets a fair chance number one number two number always talk about how I don't have the black support come on give me a break come with me watch watch I'm getting so frustrated but by the least now I'm not talking about you guys but by the least in the party who they know so much more but then these guys don't think I should run against me good announce through an after president challenge man to convention yeah that was I'm not that was real oh that's where see bro listen now we talk about this AI shit that didn't sound I mean that sounds good it sounds like he's having one of those Alzheimer's like anger attacks oh people are angry no due to especially when they start to get Alzheimer's they get pissed off for like for no reason yeah that's what it sounds like that's what it sounds like that like that and row he's sitting here talking about the middle class like why don't you go ask the middle class what they think right now right because I'm pretty sure those are all the people that are saying ah I fucked up in 2020 voting for this dumbass no for sure and that like that wasn't his only only hiccup check this one out how can how can you assure the American people that you won't have another night like the one you did in Atlanta look at my career I'm not had many of those nights with a terrible night and I really regret it happened but the fact of the matter is how how can you assure you're gonna be out on you know faith that can enter me on your way to go to you know work tomorrow what it's not funny it's not fucking funny but but you know you know what you know dude you go ahead you know what pisses me off is the people that will listen to that and stills try to support this man you know what pisses me off is how the media's lied about this dude for four or five fucking years and then they act like they didn't know that this was the way he was and now all of a sudden they're pretending to be surprised right they're pretending like they're shocked and they're pretending like his mental acuity has taken a nose dive this is what's been going on for years and years and years and most people just haven't been paying attention you know most people dude if you ask them about certain issues I'm talking about most people if you ask them about what the issues are and why they're voting for each candidate they cannot tell you it's a popularity contest amongst most people and the democrats have really figured this out in the past where they get the Hollywood celebrities they get the media they get the radio hosts they get the popular athletes or the you know but that doesn't work anymore because nobody believes them because of what happened during COVID right the the entire influence structure that these people have typically leaned upon has crumbled and people don't find credibility in it anymore nobody's voting for Joe Biden because Taylor Swift says so right nobody's voting for Joe Biden because you know fucking whoever it's it's not happening people are looking at their lives they're saying holy shit they see this dude up on stage and it scares them and they're realizing that we're in deep trouble they also realize that we're not being run by this guy we're being run by a behind the scenes group of people who are clearly making every decision possible to make our country more vulnerable and weaker and harder for the american people to survive which is why people right now who are in uh what you would call the middle class feel like they're in poverty and that's just reality if you go ask any of them ask them talk to them ask them what their household is like now versus what it was like four years ago you know when gas is up food prices are up everything's up uh inflation's up so the value of your dollar doesn't go as far all of these things create an equation that doesn't balance for the the average american household and you know consumer debt is at the highest it's ever been because credit card debts at the highest it's ever been about yeah 70% of americans are not being able to go from an entire pay period without running out of money that's insane dude that's not the american dream so this guy has a lot of nerve to go on television and say he's fighting for the middle class when he's effectively destroyed the middle class intentionally over the last four years yeah and speaking of your influencer you know you talk about this influencer campaign that they run you know I feel like they're at a point where they know it doesn't work anymore but they still use it well what else are they gonna do right and like I mean and here's here's whoopie goldberg and I want you to really pay attention to these first like 30 seconds of this clip listen to what whoopie has to say I don't care if he's pooped his pants I don't care if he can't put a sentence together show me he can't do the job and then I'll say okay maybe it's time to go now he had a bad night the first time that he went out and debated with um camel Harris and everybody wanted him to quit then so you can't talk to women like this or you're doing this right you're doing that wrong he came back said you know what I got it and gave four years so yeah I have poopy days all the time all the I stepping so much poo you can't even imagine now I'm not running the world but I don't know anybody who doesn't step in stuff at some point so I'm just simply saying yeah there are two debates and if he can't do what he needs to do for the second debate I'll join any crew that says get rid of him but loyalty to me if you are doing the job I might not like everything you're doing I don't like it all but I'm gonna stand behind you like those guys stand behind the guy who should have been the person people were talking about saying yeah by not a bad day but this guy couldn't tell the truth if it split his lip what what is she talking about she's dude it's like we're reading two different fucking books here you know what I'm saying there's the mainstream narrative book that all of these people are a part of or are reading and a few people are still left watching it at home right and then we have this other book called our lived experiences of what's going on in America and it doesn't matter right now if these people go on here and say the economy is wonderful everything's great crime is down people know it the economy is not good because they know it because they look at their own life feel it they know that crime's not good because they go out in public and there's criminals and their cars getting broken into and their shootings everywhere that you can't lie to people and convince them that what they're seeing isn't happening it's already it's happening now and these people continue to go on and gaslight the Americans in a way that's really insulting dude it's and it's shrinking the group is shrinking you know a lot of people are jumping off board they're like dude this is crazy it started with the big tech CEOs you know a year ago where they're like dude this guy's destroying the economy he's destroying business people don't understand how the economy works bro if you take a working class average American who works a regular job and they can't get their paycheck to last between two pay periods that means they're buying less shit that means they're they're buying way less shit when the price of everything is up okay that means there's not as much business that means companies are going to suffer that means the economy is going to suffer and you can't look at the Dow Jones or the the index and say well that represents the economy no that represents the biggest companies in the world who are artificially propped up by foreign money because the United States economy is still barely a safer place than most other economies okay so we have an abnormally high uh you know rating with our Dow Jones and the typical economic factors but then everybody else is hurting right okay so how are you going to convince those people that that's not happening you know all crime is down the crime is bull no they're not reporting it for the first time ever in history crime is not being reported Latino crime is being reported as white crime okay there's all these little things that are happening that they're manipulating wrote and the average person is not able to identify what's happening because they're too busy trying to figure out how to survive and this is all by design okay if they can keep the people in a state of hate anger rage division and financial hardship how could they pay attention to the details of what's actually being done they can't all right and to your point earlier when she says I don't care if he shit his pants I don't care if he does this that is the problem the problem is the people who are willing to stand by someone that they know is ruining the country because they want to vote Democrat or they want to be a Democrat or they want to stand on the side of this rights or that's right and they don't even know what they're talking about dude they don't even know and you know she says she's loyal to him what about being loyal to the country there these people don't think like that you know what I'm saying like like that that's the part that gets me now she doesn't even think it's her country bro she thinks she's a fucking black woman millionaire who's been famous her whole fucking life and she gets up there every day and talks about how America is the most impressive place in the world where else could she have done that nowhere nowhere literally nowhere now now here here is some good news for you so Biden tried this little stick apparently he's like on a on a campaign trail right now of like going to these different radio shows trying to do all of these talks right to kind of recover his image I'm in a backfire form this hell I reached radio station parts ways with hosts after admitting White House gave her questions before Biden interview so W U R D a Philadelphia based black owned radio station has parted ways with this host after she revealed that the White House provided her with a list of predetermined questions prior to her interview with President Biden last week so she signs up you know they they they agree to do this interview the White House gives her eight predetermined questions that she has to stick to okay she chose four of them Andrea lawful Sanders admitted during a CNN interview Saturday that Biden's team sent her eight questions to ask ahead of his interview on the source last Wednesday she said she approved four of those questions and used them during her sit down with the president the questions they kind of these were all super softball questions right talked about his debate performance his accomplishments his progress in both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin I mean what's at stake at the election but when she admitted this the radio station owners fired her for doing that I'm on Sunday W U R D's president and CEO Sarah M. Lowmax announced that lawful Sanders and W U R D have quote mutually agreed to part ways emphasizing the W U R D radio is not a mouthpiece for the Biden or any other ad oh yeah so I thought she got fired for disclosing right that it was on the on the you know on the table right but she got fired for doing it exactly that's good tell me this just change it hey that's good man and and so the statement statement wrote quote on July 3rd the first post debate interview with president Joe Biden was arranged and negotiated independently by W U R D radio host Andrea lawful Sanders without knowledge consultation or collaboration with W U R D management low max at an a statement on Sunday quote the interview featured predetermined questions provided by the White House with violates our practice of remaining an independent media outlet accountable to our listeners as a result miss lawful Sanders and W U R D radio have mutually agreed to part ways effective immediately this is something we take very seriously and it continues on by saying the practice quote the practice of delegitimizing black voices continues today W U R D radio is not a mouthpiece for the Biden or any other administration internally we will commit to reviewing our policies procedures and practices to reinforce words independence and trust with our listeners I love that I do too I love it you know what I don't love though where to love how the radio station is black voices hmm what if there was a white voices radio station hmm that'd be a problem wouldn't it maybe yeah I think we need to stop this hypocrisy of racial identifying every single little group and television show and everything what I was about I mean there's a NASCAR NASCAR has got Bubba Wallace bro we don't want no one to claim him he lied about the news thing didn't he I don't know yeah I don't know if he lied or not I seems like he lied and I've never met a black man named Bubba force go actually I guess that works I I feel like I feel like it you know I think they did a good job I just think that if we're gonna have a harmonious civil racial relations in this country which I think we need to have we need to stop with the double standards all the way across the board that's all I agree I think we need Americans being American voice you're not a black voice you're an American voice that's just my opinion I like it yeah what do you got there you right you can't need an office uh-huh yeah yeah strawberry is OGs remember we talked about these yeah we're OGs I got I got the better scotch ones too man those better scotch ones are good you want one no I do want I do want one but I'm on it I'm on it we need I feel like we need like a crystal like a little bowl yeah don't do that why cuz they'll get eaten that's where that I feel like that's where they go yeah which one you want of course you want wait so we go straight we're going straight from serious race talk to candy candy unites this is true I mean listen that's fair I feel like there there is a you're gonna suck on the one piece and give it to Joe and vice versa you guys like swap it out probably need me since the 1980s man come on you sure yeah yeah these things are iconic though yeah I wonder if they still taste the same five is it gay fuck yeah yeah yeah they're like that deep Joe they're the same it's pretty good yeah that's pretty good yeah hey there's big will yeah oh yeah right what I had a wave to them what's up will he listens to the show I'll tell you he's always the first one to share his own will no what's the fucking dude anyway fuck this shit mm-hmm yeah I'm with it 100% I'm glad to see that man like I said I mean we can get away from the way the race shit for sure but it is good to see that it is nice these tactics are yes yes they're not and like no matter how often he says he has a black vote no matter how much he tries it like it's not the truth no it's not the truth no more well who knows if it's true or not but I mean I think it's it's definitely different than it has been yeah you know guys jump it on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think I was that

DJ fucking gets into one of his zones be in a diabetic coma let's just get them um all right let's keep this show moving man um headline number two we gotta go cross the water cross the oceans enough about our elections let's go foreshadow what we think is gonna happen because they are already doing it headline number two reads french elections riots erupt after left wing coalition projected to win plurality of seats now didn't we just cover this we did and didn't the opposite party like wipe them the fuck out they did hmm they did that's interesting and then overnight all the sudden they lost something happened now listen that's gonna happen here too people better be ready for it I I dove into this and man I'll start looking into this and it's bullshit yeah they don't care anymore bro that's the thing the mask is off it's still they're gonna steal your country right in front of you and dare you to do something about it yeah so let's let's start diving to this where France is right now what exactly happened this past weekend um so crowds of protesters and celebrators flooded the streets of Paris as French election results began pouring in on Sunday on Sunday French Prime Minister Gabriel Atal announced his intent to resign after a far left political coalition was posed to win a plurality of French parliamentary seats coalition had unexpectedly assembled before the snap elections began tens of thousands of left wing demonstrators gathered in Paris's place deliver public on Sunday night to celebrate the news president Emmanuel Macron's centrist coalition is projected to take second place the results were a huge upset for conservatives in France who had hoped that marine lapins national rally would take power um and the streets were wild in France looks peaceful yeah mostly peace mostly peace mostly peaceful um but dude it's hot over there right now so the left this the the left wing coalition okay it's called the popular front all right it's made up of France's socialist party the French Communist Party a green political party called the ecologist and France uh unbound so it's a it's like a mix of these different parties it all came into one right so the blockets pledged to institute a number of measures that selected including scrapping Macron's pension reform and working towards establishing a right to retire at 60 years old now that's just some of the bullshit oh but how do we get there well did you see that they're going to increase taxes to 90 percent um 90 percent income tax this is full blown communism it's they're not full blown the French Communist Party they don't have the shouldn't they're not dude um now now what exactly happened because like you said Andy we did cover this just a few days ago man and lapim was winning yeah not winning crushing everybody and by double remember by double and technically she's still won by votes this is where this is where the bullshit comes into place so let's let's let's walk through this okay so according to the French and Terry ministry uh marina pens national rally or the rn party they won the most votes of any party during sundays second round of the snap legislative elections at over 8.7 million votes that was good for 32 percent of the vote at 32 percent of the seats right now when combined with their electoral alliance partners uh from disputed less republicans president erick cady who earned nearly 1.4 million that was good for 5 percent of the vote that would take the right wing to over 10 million 10 million votes okay um that's a nice little chart here right but but here's but here's what happened all right in comparison the far left the new popular front or their abbreviation is n f p um alliance of communist socialist and environmentalist led by radical leftist john luke malanchand only received around 7 million votes or 25 percent and a manual macron's neoliberal central coalition received 6.3 million votes so what happened macron and these communists got together and because apparently you can do this in French elections and they decided to basically combine and say okay hey we will be one now which is part of the mentry system which is what threw them over it so um that's what that's what happened um and there was actually this like secret decision now this whole this this communist party right like where they come from right well it's interesting because a month ago they didn't even exist they were not even on paper anywhere they had no representation and all the sudden a month ago they come into play and now they're going to have the majority of the house i wonder who makes up that communist party so it was funny you say that because uh this guy john malachand this guy here um let's see what some of his policies are um he one of his things he said just a couple of days ago was was that native frinch pose serious problems for social cohesion says far left leader malachand because france is dealing with the enormous migrant crisis just like we have here and he's saying that native born frinch people are in are basically a massive hiccup or bump in the road to achieving what they plan to achieve yeah which is wiping out any type of sense of national identity yeah and you're running so what i tell you the next step frinch what i what i'm telling you the next step after that is for the last four years you mean when they come in no when they start saying that the native population is disturbing and becoming a serious problem for social cohesion and that group of people that believes that has taken full control of the government what is the next step that i've been saying they would do do the same that's right the next step will be for them to round up the frinch people and fucking kill them yeah and so frinch people however many of you listen you better figure it to fuck out yeah right now all of that you also said a dead cop is one less vote for lapin violent hard left rhetoric flies as france snap election looms like they're not even trying to hide it anymore no they're not hiding you know it is the mask is fully off the mask the the mask is fully off so the yeah there was an agreement between macron and this guy who leads that super far left communist party they made a deal they basically said hey we we got to do whatever we have to do to keep this keep keep why the right from winning why because the they know that the accountability for all of their actions that they're complicit in is death that's right it's that simple now put this in americans terms this would be like a month out from the election a new independent communist some other third party comes in the election right and starts running gains all of this team out of nowhere from the migrants from the migrants right a voice of the people from that side the election gets called they get you know a decent chunk 25% of the vote and they said oh we'll just give it to the other side and that's how they automatically one that's bullshit it's complete bullshit but that's exactly what they did there it's exactly what they did well franch people better figured out dude because these people aren't playing games and you say and i can't believe they did this so clear they're doing it they're doing it bro and they intend to do it all the way and they will remove the native populations to create a one race world race world government that is what they intend to do they intend to eliminate the native populations of all of these places where all of these migrants are being imported into and they're wanting to do so to create a unified race that has no nationalist pride and that is okay with a one world government that's that's the goal here and it's happening and uh you know it's weird that people don't care or think that it's going to somehow stop nobody's coming to stop this nobody's coming to stop this from happening it's your citizens that need to stop this from happening french people need to wake the fuck up and realize that if they don't stand up now they're going to be fucking gone forever that's exactly what's going on here so they're handing the country over to fucking third world migrants and saying french people don't have a right to exist in their own country and they're going to do the same thing here in america that's why they're pumping so many migrants into our system they're they are they are just at the beginning of the migrant surge if Biden stays in power it's going to get a hundred times worse and in four years we'll be there you know did you see that uh there was this this bill that they they've been trying to get passed called the safe act which like you know basically like it kind of reassures like re ensures the fact that no non-american citizen can vote in our federal elections yeah yeah Biden just said no I'm not even going to look at it of course why would he he's like oh well we already have laws in place to protect that okay well why would he why why not just let's do here's the problem I'm gonna cheat their asses off no listen man these people the problem is us the problem is the people the problem is the people believing that these people are not serious in their goals and that someone is going to walk away from this and that they're just gonna say oh you know what it's politics is usual let us go away that is not what's going to happen it's not going to happen there it's not going to happen here I'm actually glad this happened because if Americans are paying attention they they can get a really good understanding of what's going to happen here which is anything required to stay in power okay and they just blatantly acted contrary to the interest of the native population of that country and said hey French people fuck you we're taking this bitch and you're not going to do anything about it and that's what they're trying to do here that's what they've already done in England that's what they're doing everywhere and everybody thinks that someone's coming along to stop it these people need to rise the fuck up and stop this real talk because they're at a point now where if they don't they will face severe violence economic turmoil in the ruining of lives and probably eventually their own death based upon removing these people who are a serious problem according to the fucking leader of France now think imagine a leader of France saying native born French people are a serious problem that is the same thing they say here when they say patriotic Americans are a threat you know when they did J6 and they tried to make everybody afraid of what you know the patriotic American after for 230 years they were praised as the life blood of America and brought up to be the life blood of America now all of a sudden we are on some sort of domestic terrorist this is the point and it's going to get worse and worse and worse and worse until people wake the fuck up and I highly anticipate the similar situation happening here in in 2020 we went to bad Trump was dominating when we woke up there was a vertical curve a vertical spike of votes and they said we won and nobody did anything about it nothing happened all right and regardless of what you say about Trump or this or that bro I don't know it makes me think he was somehow involved in it or something because dude why wouldn't you just arrest these fuckers for cheating you see what I'm saying yeah like you don't have a straight up curve in the middle of the night that goes you don't get any votes and they get fucking me love yeah it doesn't happen and everybody here knew it even the people who voted for Biden knew it they just wanted them to win so bad they didn't care they were willing to look the other way and this is the same thing that's happening with the vaccine these people that took the vaccine pretending like people aren't getting sick people like people aren't dying no they are okay and people look the other way because it was their decision it's a decision that they have to defend so they're willing to defend it right like if you attack someone for buying a certain kind of car they're gonna defend that because it's their ego it's the decision these people made a decision to stand on the left side of the aisle with the Democrats I don't know probably because their parents were Democrats and they make that a pillar of their own social identity and because that's a pillar of their own social identity you can't get them to just say oh I was wrong that's not what they're gonna do they're gonna fucking fight for that no matter what and if something is wrong over there they're gonna look the other way it's like having you know a best friend who is doing some fucked up shit and you're like well fuck that's my friend I'm not gonna say anything right that's a lot of people do and that's what's happening here in America and it's happening globally and if people don't rise up and take their countries back bro there aren't gonna be any other countries you know it's fucking crazy it's crazy to me that there are people I did it's just crazy me this is even happening yeah I mean like I try to look at this in a different like you know even if like this this this quote that this guy fucking put about the native French people right like I try to like at the end of the day when you have people coming into a country right they want to become French they want to become American it is not the responsibility of the native citizens to get social cohesion with the newcomers right they are supposed to assimilate to our culture when I supposed to bend our culture and change for them yeah I'm supposed to go yeah right but I'm a problem because I don't want to you know do their cultural norms from wherever the fuck they were yeah I'm the problem yes no yes you are according to them yeah like we gotta like that's the thing man like this this is we're seeing what's gonna happen here a few months ahead yeah that's exactly what what what is going on here yeah we're gonna fucking Trump's gonna dominate for the rest of the fucking race unless something drastic happens which I still think they're gonna do and then we're gonna wake up you know the next day after the election they're gonna say a pipe burst they're gonna say holy shit Joe Biden shocked the world and they're gonna come up with this fucking crazy shit that Biden got a hundred million votes and they're gonna say we won and that's what the fuck they're gonna do do something yeah and dude anybody who thinks otherwise is fucking delusional you know the part they're kind of that also pissed me off about this when I was going through we can look at CNN look at New York Times right they're all acting like oh so shocked so shocked that no they fucking cheated is what they did yeah they cheat you tell them east this party comes out of nowhere less than four weeks ago and is now the main the main Chabang here yeah that nobody in the actual country I don't know sides with it I mean I don't think they have second amendment over there do they no well no it's extremely difficult to get get pistolas over there yeah well it's not here no you guys jumping on this conversation let's know down in the comments what you guys think I think people better fucking get ready to fucking vote like they've never voted before for the simple reason that even if we believe that the elections are compromised we have to vote so the evidence is there of our votes so that it can be proven that the election was stolen there's a big push about how your vote means nothing and it really anger is me when I see people that no better say that I think it's stupid as fuck okay because while we understand that they do have the ability to cheat we don't know do they have the ability to cheat a little do they have the ability to cheat a lot do they have the ability to do what they just did here in France and and completely do we don't know but the thing is is there more people that vote the more we can prove that they stole it which gives us better chances at actually having a regular country again and you know when it comes to it's interesting because there in every single state in this country there is hundreds of thousands of registered hunters that are not registered to vote and you would think that's weird you yeah you would think that all of these country boys and all these people that are registered to hunt and they go out and hunt you would think that they will register to vote recognizing what's happening but that's not happening the rural communities are not voting the way that they're supposed to vote okay they're thinking that fuck it if it comes to my door I'll do something bro you guys better get out and fucking vote okay because it will come to your fucking door I know you think because you live 40 miles outside of the city or 100 miles outside the city it's never coming your way the government will come for you dude they will tax you they will take your shit they'll take your fucking farm they'll fuck up your whole lives and you'll you say oh I'm gonna you know I'll shoot them but they won't ever show up at your door they'll make life so hard that you go broke and you're homeless and you don't have your family farm or your family property or your grandpa's land that's been in the family for 150 years that's gonna be fucking gone okay because they're gonna do exactly what they're doing in Canada and exactly what they're doing in another lands which is increasing the prices of all of the farming chemicals all of the cost of living fuel they're taxing people differently they're making it so people who live in ag areas cannot fucking produce food if you cannot produce food you cannot produce money to pay for the farm if you cannot produce money to pay for the farm and or we own the farm it doesn't matter okay well how are you gonna pay the taxes on the farm you see what I'm saying and then all the sudden they get all the land back and that's how communism operates and communism is targeting right now the rural community and the rural community is completely oblivious to it they're completely oblivious how how is there 250,000 registered hunters in Missouri that are not registered to vote how is there 200,000 people in fucking Kansas that are registered hunters how how is that yeah that's why you know people have to get to they you guys have to come to an understanding like we have a duty to vote the way that we want to vote and you may believe that the elections are compromised I do as well but I'm still going to vote and I'm still going to try to get everybody else to vote because I realized that if they steal and everybody votes it's going to be hard for them to actually prove they didn't steal which allows for us to at least have a card to play okay so like I don't want to hear this shit from all you dumb fucks about how voting doesn't change anything or this or that okay maybe you're right but the point is are you gonna ride up and you're fucking tank and start shooting people no we need motherfuckers to vote so we can figure out what the fuck is going on yeah well at least old election what did you vote no yeah that didn't steal it they just fucking want that's right and that's why all broke and all these people keep saying that it's like dude it's almost like I think it's bots on the internet trying to scourge people from voting I think that's real yeah I think that's a lot of that too man dude not only should you vote you should be bringing four or five people that you know weren't gonna vote to vote with you you should make a day out of it make a caravan out of it get them together get some fucking cold beers go vote then go drink beer like fuck dude take a day off who cares but it's it's important shit and all of you guys who keep going around on the internet saying your votes worthless okay well what are you gonna do you see what I'm saying they want you to think they're they're not doing shit no that's what they want you to think they want you to think and if the if everybody votes and they still steal what do you think's going to happen there will be a fucking revolt okay so go fucking vote holy shit yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three this one's interesting uh headline reads uh man who was constantly told he looks like a teenager reveals secrets of staying young how do you think this dude is I don't know I mean he looks like he's about 16 okay yeah all right sick man dot um 30 I mean

I'm saying I got the salt and pepper shit going it's fucking good shit I'm saying dude you're gonna look like this your whole life you're not gonna be able to you know people are gonna think you got a little bit of pre-pube weener you know I'm saying like well I get a hog cute cute cute nice the NS sausage you say you say a hog I'm just saying man this was their goal this is what they wanted everybody to look like I think this is what they did their job yeah yeah just a product of that yeah I mean yeah he definitely sounds like you got that a clip too um but yeah 35 year old man has revealed his anti-aging secrets after being told by strangers they think he looks like a teenager uh secrets are to stay out of the sun and avoid alcohol um so Brandon Miles mage sounds like no fun that sounds terrible yeah um Brandon Miles may wear sunscreen daily covers up his skin when he goes outside and has never touched a drop of alcohol in his life or seen boobies you know we're seeing any tips yeah we also eat a diet of fresh fruit plant-based food and fish which he says helps him feel just as young as he did 10 years ago uh he said quote I attribute not drinking to my youthful appearance really embodying the feeling of youth I think it has helped I think and see myself as young I've been staying out of sunlight my whole life I wear a hoodie to block the sun and use physical coverings on the back of my hands Brandon has been looking after his skin since he was 13 uh it made an effort to maintain his healthy lifestyle uh quote I was really into nutrition at that stage and keeping my body young Brandon also feels that it's important to exercise but doesn't do anything too heavy to avoid straining his body uh he says quote I don't go heavy on exercise too much exercise can cause stress on the body and it can age the body here do you do you think he has the capability of going heavy it's more fun it looks like a walking milk allergy haha fucking does bro Danny hmm let's see what you allergic to milk yes or no yes sir a hundred percent bro I'm I mean take oh well listen that's cause you're black he's in the sun right now that's a black thing that's true isn't like 80 percent or something 90 percent of black people are lactose to those of the serious thing that affects many people more so black people though more black people yeah but but I guarantee he's almost allergic to milk because of this motherfucker is that what you're saying I would I want I want you to hear the clip because I think this will explain a lot I already know what I already know what you know maybe you don't want to see no boobies am I wrong right you're right I'm 35 and here is an anti-aging secret for younger looking skin my whole life I've been super sensitive to the sun I can't really go out in the sun without sunglasses and a hat just because I start sneezing and I can't really like function in the sunlight so my whole life I stayed out of direct sun because not only could I not handle it I'd always suspected that the direct sunlight hitting your skin ages the skin and lo and behold it does not think about getting you have a terrible state is that yeah you definitely want to protect your skin from the sun I mean he's really wearing that bro oh boy this is real that looks like a fucking four-year-old branch woman oh a 60-year-old you can't park there that's what it looks like hold on the outside is that yeah you definitely want to protect your skin from the sun but when it comes to anti-aging getting outside you're very beneficial for just uplifting your mood and helping you feel more connected to the natural world which is great for stress reduction and emotional health and regulation we have a role in healthy aging including skin aging because any stress and emotional stress is going to show up on the skin so okay first of all dude you're willing to rub chemicals into your skin that you have no idea what the fuck they do nobody does and we've been indoctrinated in believing it's the most healthy thing for us if you don't want to get a fucking bad sunburn let me tell you a little hack don't wear sunglasses because when you don't wear sunglasses your skin doesn't burn his back all right there's a lot of people to talk about this and by the way why is every single fucking animal on the planet do anything they can to lay in the sun it's because the sun has magical powers that make you feel healthy and alive and happy it's one of the main producers of vitamin D into your body so this guy he's full shit he's saying vitamin D this is yeah he gets enough D the fucking thing is dude here's the thing this this is this is what the internet's about the internet's about someone who's taking their personal preference and trying to become some sort of scientific fucking doctor about it so this is just another one of these fucking internet PhDs who happens to have genetically you know look like a boy at an older age who's now turn it into a thing my question is why do you want to look like a little boy so bad that's weird and his teeth don't look too healthy either bro you know like I'm just saying man these people come on here and they talk all this shit and it's just not true bro your body supposed to be in the fucking sun it's supposed to be eat some meat bro like some real people these people are insane these this does not look healthy there's nothing about this little looks healthy until your point I did see a study on sunscreen did you know that there's a direct correlate how do we know he's 35 yeah I don't I mean that's just where he's claiming he is he's claiming he's 35 yeah whatever dude does he look healthy to you no like if he was my friend I'd be like bro you need to fucking eat something you don't look good dude like let's go eat haha haha haha haha that's just it's sad dude and I just I don't know like I get tired of these people giving out this advice like you're you stay out of the sun yes I've never been in the sun my whole life okay well is that a good you think that's a good no it's not a good thing it's not good when we fill it here bro like you know whenever we get depressed here look bro I'm telling you if you start to look into this shit a lot of this is bullshit okay sunscreen is bullshit all right I'll be real with you dude real talk I'll never put sunscreen on my life ever again when you think about what it is in that bottle and you think about spreading that all over your skin over no if I get burnt I just won't go outside that day you know I'm saying oh well dude that you notice how I don't do cardio with my sunglasses anymore yeah remember that do you know why because it's because I don't get burnt yeah I turn I get crispy and dark chocolatey and mochi out that's right yeah like a nice delicious that's right yeah well like bro it's it's real shit I had my buddy tell me that a couple years ago and out first time I heard it I was like yeah whatever dude you're crazy so I tried it and I'm like holy shit I'm not getting burned at all and I turn red but like I don't get burnt I don't feel like it doesn't burn because even sunglasses are blocking those you the use right not bad dude I don't know the science behind it so I'm not going to pretend I know but what I remember reading about it or being told about it as well was that somehow when the sun gets into your eyes you know Huberman probably talks about this somehow when the sun gets in your eyes it releases some sort of like enzyme or hormone that keeps you from getting burnt okay so when you wear sunglasses and then you don't releasing that you get burnt I have a lot of that yeah well I put sunglasses on when I was stupid when I put sunglasses on it's usually after I've already got like a deep dark base tan yeah like I just started wearing sunglasses this summer like it's July the middle of July right so I don't know I mean no fence man but like he might live to be a thousand but I'd rather live fucking 50 years of my life in a thousand of that yeah oh shit I'm just saying yeah I mean what's he really gonna live he's gonna live it to a hundred okay let's just say he lives to a hundred let's say I lived to 65 I would take my 65 over his 100 all fucking day oh yeah all day the goal like bro what do you want to do you want to fucking live like here's what I never understood I understood you I understand you want quality of life when you're older you want to be able to move you want to be healthy you want to be coherent but like this sacrificing of all and I listen your quality of life when you're young when you're in shape is much better than when you're out of shape I've been out of shape I've been in shape it's much more fun when you're in shape you have there's way more shit to do people include you way more like there's just a lot of benefits from being physically in shape than nobody really talks about I mean dude really real talk you're just more desirable as a fucking human and I didn't make the rules it's just the truth and I know this because I've been 350 fucking pounds a couple times and I've been in shape you know what I'm saying like I know the difference people treat you different and you know a lot of these people who are young when I say young I mean like under 50 on the first side of 50 right these people do all of these things that make their life suck right I stay out of the sun I don't drink this I don't do this I hide my basement in the lights out and I look my skin looks good no shit but you didn't fucking live any life and you're trying to preserve your life to go as long as possible and you're giving up your best years to do so that does not make any sense so you're gonna you're gonna live like a hermit now and you're just gonna fucking like sitting inside your house and put all this shit on your to live to 100 where your last 30 years are gonna be you as an old person are those gonna be your best years like when are your best years gonna be right you see what I'm saying right it makes zero so like why are you sacrificing everything to have some mediocre years when you're old that makes sense it doesn't make any sense now I don't want to fucking live till I'm a thousand a hundred years old I want to get like a good 70 years you know good 70 fun kick ass take some names yeah yeah fuck bro and it's cool you know like I don't want to be one of those old people you do it's about quality man it's about quality of life and like do this like staying inside all day and putting the sun on and putting sunscreen on four times a day bro you're obsessive yeah that's real that's real yeah guys tell us what you guys think jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know well that being said man let's get to our final segment of the show thumbs up or dumb as fuck because we're gonna bring a headline and we talk about it to get one of those two

mad all right so what happened yeah so a teenager jumped onto a runaway boat that was going in circles on lake lake winna sapa kassapa after the captain fell overboard the unmanned boat was in Smith's co on lake winna sapa kassapa on Wednesday I was sitting on the porch and my dad yelled there was an out of control boat in the wake zones at Brady procon 17 he and his father Jeremy said the boat was part of a local sailing association the operator a sailing instructor was mid-lesson teaching children how to sail when he reached for the tennis ball used to teach turning um apparently fell off here's a clip well certainly not a situation that you see every day yesterday an unmanned runaway boat right here in smith's cove the situation could have been much worse if it wasn't for a 17 year old kid here's oh and I looked up and I could see this boat circling and then of course looked at the boat and there's nobody in it rich bono says that smith cove is usually a quiet place it's a no-wake zone so when he heard a boat making waves he knew something was up the procon saw it too and say they jumped into action telling us it all started with a kid sailing lesson in the cove before things went wrong they told us the instructor was operating the boat and used a tennis ball to teach the kids how to turn as he was reaching for the ball one of the kid's sailboats tipped over and the mast hit the instructor's boats throttle sending him off the boat into the water and causing the boat to start spiraling so he jumped on his boat told me to get on the jet ski to go get the kids out of the way after getting the kids out of harm's way Brady jumped on the back of their neighbor Justin King's jet ski King brought Brady close enough to the boat to jump on the back of it landing on the boat and stopping it before anyone got hurt the dangers of the jump never even crossing his mind uh i don't know i just came to me i didn't really think i just did it 24 hours later those who call the cove home are happy with how things ended knowing without Brady's bravery things could have been much worse if that boat was circling like that it could have hit somebody i'm a little realizing
