We're from sleeping on the floor, now my jury box froze, fuck up, fuck up, fuck up, stole, counted millions in a coke, bad bitch, booted, swole, got a own bank, broke, can't fold, doesn't know, hit shot, case, clothe, clothe, clothe. What is up guys, it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real and second body of the lies, the thickness and delusions of my society, welcome to the fuck reality guys, today we have Q and A F, that's where you submit the questions, we give you the answers. Now you could submit your questions a few different ways, the first way is guys email these questions into ask Andy at Andy for sell.com or you go on YouTube on the Q and A F episodes, there's a link there, you click on submit your question there and you can call in live on the show and ask your question, all right. Without the week, this is your first time listening, we're going to have shows within the show, we're going to have cruise the internet, we call it CTI, that's where we put topics up on the screen here, we talk about what's going on in the world, we speculate, and then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on in the world. Other times we're going to have real talk, real talk is just five to 20 minutes of me giving you some real talk and then we have 75 hard versus occasionally, that's where someone who has completed the 75 hard program comes on the show, they talk about how their life was before, how their life is now, and how they used the 75 hard program to get their shit together. If you're unfamiliar with 75 hard, it is the initial phase of the live hard program, okay, which is available for free at episode 208 on the audio feed. It's not on YouTube, it's only audio. You weren't on YouTube when that came out, all right. So if you're unfamiliar with live hard, it's the world's most famous mental transformation program and it is free. Again, episode 208 on the audio feed, there's a book on my website called the book on mental toughness, that website is Andy for cella.com, it's not necessary, you don't have to buy it, but it's got the entire program plus a whole bunch of other chapters on mental toughness, right? It's important how to cultivate it and how to use it in your life, all right. With that being said, we don't run ads on the show. We ask very simply that you help us grow the show by sharing it, all right. So if the show makes you think, if it makes you laugh, it gives you a new perspective, but something you think is worth sharing, don't be a hoe. Sure, the show. All right. What's up? Greetings, salutations. Yeah. How's it going? Good. Yeah. Yeah. Fourth of July. Mm-hmm. Yeah, coming to the show's released on Monday, so I mean, we'll have to, but it's one of my favorite holidays. Is it? Yeah, it is. Like, is it what's like your holiday rank? I don't know, man. He's giving it for me. They're all the same, me. Yeah. You missed an opportunity, you think? What? What? What? What? Was I supposed to say quanta? What? Was I supposed to say quanta? Was I supposed to say? No, I said mine used to be Thanksgiving. Oh, you know, I tried to tee you up there, but yeah, the concert was equally impressive. That was good. Oh, that was good, man. Yeah, I don't want to leave you out, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, no, it's fine. Yeah. Did you know, did you know, fun fact, about Fourth of July, did you know that the Declaration of Independence wasn't actually signed on the Fourth of July? No, when was it signed? I don't know, but it was not on it. It was approved on Fourth of July, but it was signed like I think a day later or something like that. Fun fact. Cool. Cool. It teaches you that in quants or clats. Yeah. It's right after the chapter on F*** America. Yeah. I don't read that chapter. Exactly. Yeah, I don't know. No, it's Q and A, though, man. This is one of my favorite episodes. Yeah, me too. It's awesome to hear some stuff. I think we should just switch and say no more CTIs and only calling Q and A's. We should have pissing people off. I actually think we should do two of these a week. Two Q and A's? Yeah. Yeah, that's what I think. I think it's a totally different audience. Well, I know it is. And I think the show would be much more valuable if we did two and not just one. I was going to talk to you guys about it later, but since we're talking about it, it's on the open. Yeah. I don't know how that would work. Yeah, the same. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Man, if only I was a professional podcaster, not just a fucking idiot with a microphone. Who do you think that would be? Yeah, that's right. All day long, man. Yeah. You know, I could get one of those microphones like all these dudes get and just sticking in my face and record 700 videos in a row. And you know, I could produce content all day long. Yeah, read quotes and then interpret them. You know, like let's do that. We'll just read all these quotes and then we'll interpret them. And you know, we want to talk about any actual lived experience. We'll just talk hypotheticals. You know, what's this mean to you? What's your truth? You know, truth. Yeah. Yeah. I could move up from, you know, 20 rank of 22. That's actually globally. That is impressive. No, it's not. We fuck out with number one with MSCEO for a long time, bro. Overall. Yeah. Okay. I mean, we were up there, dude. Who got some work to do? Well, you know what it is, dude, is like the podcasting has, you know, back then there was not nearly as many podcasts. And now there's just a ton. And now big businesses got involved in the podcast. So there's these big networks that run massive amounts of advertising. That's why sharing the show is so important, you know, for us. We don't take corporate sponsors. We're not signed up with some network. It's an independent show that we finance ourselves. And we hang in there with, you know, the people who are spending millions and millions and millions of dollars to promote the show. So, you know, it's, it's cool. It's, it's really good. I know we're the only organic show that's ranked that high for sure. And probably the only unaffiliated show that doesn't, it isn't on a network besides Rogan. I think Rogan doesn't, oh no, he's with Spotify. He's with Spotify, yeah. Yeah. But I mean, let's just, let's be real. Rogan's fucking Rogan. Yeah. It's a different level. It's 4.42 million pocket. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. That's crazy. Yep. That is crazy. Yeah. Well, sweet man, let's get into it. Let's make some people better today. Yeah. Let's start off with the, let's start off with the call in. Let's get our home, homey Kristen. Kristen. Kristen on the phone. Let's give her a call. Hello. This is Kristen. Hey, Kristen, greeting. Salutation. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. How are you doing today? We are calling from India. You owe us money. You owe us. Whatever. Whatever. You, we send me money. You're winning. It's nice to talk to you. Your rich uncle passed away and he left you a billion dollars. I just need two more gift cards. Yeah. What I have to do is give you all of my account information and you'll just make sure that that hits. Yeah. I've been listening to you guys too long to be that stupid. So thank you guys. So let's go on all Kristen. I mean, I really appreciate the call. I'm so excited about this. This is fantastic. So I've been a big fan. Thank you guys for everything that you do. My boyfriend is actually the one who paid to see and turned me on to y'all. So we can all thank him for all of those growth personally and professionally that I've done. Listening to you guys and thanking you. But I think kind of where I'm at right now is I'm wanting to keep keeping, keep achieving and keep succeeding, you know, in my self and my career and in my relationship. But at what point I think can I start to take more ownership of that and set the boundaries in place so that I'm basically just telling the world no, get on my schedule or get the fuck out of my face. I really don't have time for your bullshit and I just need, I know what I need to do. So I also am trying to do this with a partner. And I want him to get his, meet his goals. And I want to support him in that. And I do think that we have a good thing going and that we are both very supportive of each other. But there's still these kind of growing pains and learning curves where I don't want to keep them from achieving his goals, but I got to go to sleep. So if you're going to the gym at 11 p.m., I'm not going with you because I already did my workout this morning, you know. So setting boundaries for yourself to other people. Yeah, like setting the boundary, I want to support you in your goals. You're supporting me in mine. You like, at some point, something's got to give. And I'm not always going to go to the gym with you because I, because we're on different schedules now, because I did my shit. You have your other shit too. And that's a, is this a current point of contention where you guys are like disagreeing here or? It has been, it absolutely has been. I, I, I've done the sleep deprivation thing. I've got small kids. I got to go to bed to be my best self. So it has been, I think when I first said this, question in, it was after a recent, a recent fight about this very topic. And that's kind of, kind of led to it. Well, I mean, you know, I, that's a hard question for me to answer because the answer is so obvious. You say, Hey, I'm fucking tired. I'm not going to the fucking gym at 11 and see you later. Like what? Right. Yeah, what, what does, I mean, you know, if you guys are in a good relationship, that should be automatic and it should be understood. Like, Hey, we both have a role to play. This is my role. This is what I'm working on. This is your role. This is what you're working on. I mean, if that's a problem, you know, try waking him up at three o'clock in the morning a few times and see how he likes it. So, yeah. I mean, you know, I, I don't, that, that, these are very fundamental automatic things that should be pretty easy to overcome. Because, dude, if you have a problem, and I'm just going to be real, that's why you called, if you have a problem setting boundaries about shit like this, you're going to have big problems achieving big goals because this is a very simple, a very simple boundary setting exercise that to me, and I realize that, you know, to you, it may be different, but to me, that's just super basic shit. And if we can't have a direct conversation with the person that we live with, you know, that's going to be a problem. Because as you go, as you go down the road of building anything, it's going to get harder and harder and harder and there's going to be periods of time where there is no time. And that has to be understood for a relationship to survive that kind of growth. And, you know, sometimes they don't survive. And sometimes people aren't aligned. And sometimes you don't find out that you're not aligned until later. You know, everybody wants the big prize. Everybody wants to be proud of what they're doing. Everybody wants to say they want it. You know, the aesthetic of hunger is very appealing, but nobody wants to fucking starve. You know what I'm saying? And like, dude, when you're talking about building shit, it's starving. And it's hard. And it takes massive amounts of sacrifice of time. And, you know, that has to be understood by both parties or it's going to be a constant, you know, problem. And, dude, I can tell you, you know, I've been in a number of relationships over the last 26 years. And every time I was in a relationship where it wasn't complimentary, I made zero progress in my business and my goals because a lot of my attention was put towards appeasing the other person. And, you know, not getting what I needed to get done, done. And the reality of that looks. And we don't want to do that to each other, right? What's that? I said, we don't want to do that to each other. It's like we both know that we want to support each other towards reaching our goals. Yeah, but sometimes we do that with the different routine. But what I'm telling you is, is that for saying, hey, what I'm telling you is, is it sounds good until it's fucking real. And everybody says they want to support. Everybody says they want, you know, to help. But when it gets real and there's not enough time and, you know, there's priorities that have to be taken care of. That's where you find out really if people are actually about it. So I think you guys need to have some real conversations about what that actually means. Because as you grow and as you progress, these things are going to get more difficult. And if they're already difficult, you know, there needs to be a realignment at a minimum. Does that make sense? It does make sense. And I hear that. And I do think that it is about kind of aligning the routines about it. Because I don't want to be the person that pulled him back either. No, I mean, look, man, it's, it's, first of all, let me be real, dude. I don't know anybody who has built anything relevant by themselves, meaning. Anybody who's built anything, they either built it while they were with the supportive partner and then maybe separated. But I don't know anybody who built it when they were single because dude, the amount of work and the amount of effort and the amount of, of. Just straight up, as beating that you're going to take. You'd have to have someone there that can help you with things. And I don't know anybody who is what I would consider massively successful who didn't have a supportive partner, even if they were single. So, you know, that's my honest experience. I can't name one person. I know who's built anything real that wasn't with a partner that was supportive. I know a lot of guys who maybe they built something and then got divorced. And now they're single. I know a lot of guys, you know, who were single in the beginning, got married, had a supportive partner, then, you know, broke up and lost their shit. But like, there's just a lot of things that people don't consider. And I actually believe that the dynamic between men and women, especially in building a life, I think is very skewed in the way culture and society presents it because I personally believe that it takes both people. And so I think, you know, this whole identity of, you know, I could do things on my own. I, you know, maybe I don't know anybody who has, you know what I'm saying, not anything real. So I think it's just conversations. I think it's getting aligned, having some conversations and, you know, being real about what it's going to take. You know what I mean? Like, there's going to be times where it's going to be really fucking hard. And, you know what, when those times get really fucking hard, I don't want to hear you fucking cry about it. I don't, you know what I'm saying? Like, not you, but you're part of, you know, so what do you think? Well, I'm just that I don't, so I'm like, you know, just you know, in this relationship, right? But I don't want to be the one who's backburnering my goals and my need. I think I'm trying to achieve. Well, I'm trying to like make a high salary and reach that and have investment opportunities through those goals. And I'm on my way. I'm making a lot of progress. But I don't want to do it by myself either. But I don't want, I don't, it's like I want to be able to find this balance. That is, that is inserting boundaries. And so we're both able to work towards our independent goals, but doing that together so that we can have a together goal. Yeah. But I don't, I have my needs that need to be met. And I don't, and some of that is through the route like our actual relationship. Yeah. And I don't want to be the one. Because I am the worst. So I don't want to go down that fucking road again. Yeah, he needs, he has needs too. So it's not just decided. Yeah. Absolutely. Listen, lots of people do what you're trying to do. It happens every day. I don't think this is overly complicated. It's just about having some honest communication and keep in communication open without being emotional about it. Right. You know, it's. I don't, I don't think anything that you're trying to do is, is so abnormal that it, it, it's, I mean, this is the way millions of people operate. And by the way, this is something for everybody else too, not, not just you. This relationship dynamic that you are sold as normal is not that normal. Okay. The perfectly happy married couple with the white picket fence that we're all told represents what life is supposed to be. How many motherfuckers do you know actually have that? Because I don't know many. And I certainly don't know many that have a big life, meaning they've built a lot of things. They make a lot of money. They have the freedom to go spend money and do vacation. None of those people have this traditional life. And we all, and this is all of us, spend our time judging our lives against this ideal that nobody fucking has. Nobody has it. So when you think of like what you're trying to build, understand that you are free to design that. Any way that works for you and what you're trying to accomplish. And none of the ways that you can design are wrong. There's all kinds of ways to live a relationship. And just because in the movies, they make it seem this way doesn't mean that if we're not that way that there's something wrong with what we do. You know, so be careful of that too, because a lot of people live against a standard that is very imaginary in my opinion. I just don't know many people that live that. And theory or application. Yeah, I mean, do you? No, I don't. I don't. And do sometimes the happiest people have completely nontraditional relationships. You know, they understand like, hey, this is what works for us. Like, bro, I know dude who's married who lives in a fucking completely different house than his wife. They're happiest fuck. Yeah. You know, and everybody looks at him. We're like, what's wrong with you? That's right. That's right. Well, dude, it works for them. So it gives a fuck. Yeah. You know, so. You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're not, you're not, you're not, you're not, there's, there's, there's mystery there. Like, bro, it's kind of hard to have mystery when you're taking a shit in front of your wife. 20 years. You know what I'm saying? Like, they're, that dude for real. So like, people dog the dude, but the reality is, he's got a healthy relationship. You see what I'm saying? You see what I'm saying? So we got to be careful not to judge everybody just because it looks different. And I guess what I'm saying to you, Kristen, is get like, get that in your mind, you know, like, dude, there's, there's no right or wrong way here. It's about being effective towards what you're trying to do. And that's just going to require communication. It sounds like you're with a good dude. You know, he did, he did, he did put you on the show. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like, you know, you, it's honestly, it sounds like you just want confirmation. And, and the truth of the matter is, it's like, dude, there's no right or wrong way to do this. Just communicate openly. And it sounds like he's driven and he's, he wants to do his thing. And you guys will figure it out, man. Lots of people do. Lots and lots of people do. And I would say, I just want to say this again, the happiest people I know do their own thing. And they don't measure against what everybody else is doing. Love it. Yeah. Love it. I like that. Yeah. Sweet. Well, thanks for, thanks for taking the call. Yeah, you're welcome. Yeah. Yeah. You're the moral goal. I thought this was you can hear. Am I getting out of here? You're a bad dude. I'm just being my boyfriend. He's, he's, he's very excited. And this is, he's like, big fan. Thank you guys for doing so, we appreciate it. Alright. See you guys. Yeah, man, I think a lot of people do that, bro. Yeah. Like a lot of people measure their lives and their success and where they are not against necessarily other people, but against this ideal that they believe is what everybody else has. When really do nobody has it and they've never seen it, bro. I don't know anybody that fucking has it. No. You know, you got all these rules in society, bro. You're supposed to be married by the time you're 30 or 25. You're supposed to have kids. You got to do it like this. You got to do it like that. You got to do it, bro. That's total bullshit. You get to do whatever the fuck you want to do. Like reality. You know, like, but you know what I was thinking of too. It's like, it's like, you know, you see like those old movies were like the old Mary couple. They don't even sleep in the same bed or they had like the two twin beds. And I'm like, man, that's fucking weird. But again, like, it works. My grandparents are sleeping the same bed. Bro, there was a lot of rules from the old ways that happened. I'm not going to be a bad guy. I'm not going to be a bad guy. So there was a lot of rules from the old ways that actually made for better long term relationships. You know what I'm saying? I love the point too though. Like, you know, we just like, because again, this is an entrepreneur show. But just trying to build anything, you got to have some type of support there with you. Like, it's important. Yeah. Bro, listen. I think the male female dynamic is so fucking fucked up. And the way that it's presented in the world, you know, we have all these dudes screaming about, I don't need, I don't need bitch. I'm fucking, you know, I got 10 fucking hose and yeah, that sounds kind of cool, right? Like when you're 20. I just, I think there's, I think we try to put so much pressure to do things a certain way. When in reality, dude, that there is no certain way, you know, and then when we don't, when we don't go that way, you know, we judge ourselves harshly, you know, and what I was saying about the male female dynamic, I got off the track there for a second, you know, and we got women because of the feminism movement, you know, saying, I don't need no man and men are saying, I don't need no woman. And then both of them are fucking miserable because they're both lying. Yeah, both lying. Yeah, both lying. Dude, they are both lying. And they're both trying to posture and wrote, you know, it's, the truth of the matter is, is I personally think that's another weaponization of culture against people because the reality to build something great takes, it takes a partnership, dude. Yeah, that's real, man. That's real. Let's keep moving. I got another question for you. Question number two. Guys, what's up? What's up? Andy, I'm about to turn 40 in a few weeks. And it's causing me to have some really deep reflection. I've done things I'm not proud of. I've heard people waste at time, broke promises to myself. Even though I've grown since then, I still carry some shame of those versions of me. I know holding on to guilt isn't helping, but it feels like I deserve to be reminded. How do I give myself grace without letting myself off the hook? I guess is what I'm asking. Well, I mean you and everybody else, you think everybody else hasn't had those same regrets? You think everybody else hasn't done shit that they wish to hadn't? You think everybody else? So you just don't see everybody else as shit. This goes back to fucking what we were just talking about. Every single person you know, bro, has these same feelings. Every single person looks back on their life and says, fuck, I should have done that different. Or I was mean there. I didn't treat that person right. And they feel bad about it. Every single person out there looks back and they analyze their life. Because dude, hindsight is 2020. You can clearly see the moves looking backwards. And they say, fuck, I wasted time here. I shouldn't have done that or I shouldn't have done this. And there's two parts to this. One, yeah, that's called life, dude. The only perfect person that's ever existed in the history of humankind is named Jesus Christ. Is that your name? Are you Jesus? Jesus don't count. Yeah, Jesus don't count. Bro, you're supposed to sin. You're supposed to fuck up. That's the whole point. The better question for you to be learning or to for you to ask yourself is what you learned. And the fact that you feel shame and the fact that you feel guilty tells me that you probably learned quite a bit, which is a great thing. Okay. So how do you apply those lessons to the next 40 years and you keep moving. And finally, I would say this, how would you treat your friend? If I was your friend and I came to you with a guy's name, what do you have name? Steve fucking whatever. I came to you. I say, hey, Steve. I'm Steve. Listen, man, I feel really guilty about some things I did 10 years ago. And I carry a lot of shame. Well, what are those? Andy, well, you know, I could have done this and, you know, I was mean to this person and this and that. You're going to fucking look at me and be like, yeah, the exact same thing I'm telling you. I was 10 years ago. Yes. Like bro, there is an expiration date to your negative deeds. And you have to understand that. And for you to say, not let myself off the hook, the way you're not let yourself off the hook is by changing your mother fucking behavior, moving forward. Okay. So what would you tell that friend? I would tell that friend, hey, that's what Steve. Everybody has the same feelings you have. Everybody's name mistakes. Everybody has skeletons in their closet. You just aren't privy to seeing those. So you assume that you're the only one that feels that way when literally every mother fucker out there feels that way in some way shape or form. Some more than others. Okay. And yes, there are some people 30% of people have no inner dialogue. Those people probably never reflect on anything and they go through life. But here's the problem. They never develop either. They never grow. They never change. They never progress. And you have the opportunity to by just acknowledging like, yeah, that's not the person I am anymore. And I don't do those things and change the behavior. And that's how you that's how you do it. You know, like you, would you forgive your friend for for for doing things like that? I would say, hey, bro, don't do that anymore. It's all good. You know, and that's how you should talk to yourself. Yeah. Is it something about because I feel like a lot of people once they get up into that age that like that's when the they want to start reflecting. Well, yeah, because you have enough life to reflect on. You know, like when you're fucking twenth when you're 30, bro, you're looking ahead. You're like, I'm still young. I have all this time. You know, even though I know a lot of people get 30 and they're like, oh, dude, I'm so old. That's not real, bro. When you turn 40 and you're in your mid 40s, you start to realize, well, this is probably close to at least half my life. How have I lived it? And it's a different thing. A lot of people call it a mid life crisis. It's just a mid life assessment of how you're doing. And I don't know anybody who hasn't become, I don't know anybody of quality who hasn't gone through that. That's normal. You're going to go through periods of reflection in your life many times. And I think what makes the one when you're about 40 or, you know, mid 40s more powerful is because you actually can do the math. You're like, well, fuck, if I'm double my age, I'm 80. So this is kind of probably half my life. How do I do? Right. And it's heavy because you're like, fuck, dude. You know, because I think everybody has this internal thing where they're like, man, you know, once I get this age, I'll improve. I'll get better. I'll become the person I want to be in. And then when they don't, they're like, fuck, I'm not even that person yet. You know, and it becomes a real thing. So you got to stop telling yourself the bullshit story and you got to stop. You got to start living how you know you should live. How do you balance that? You know, because you also say to like, bro, like you're one of your biggest critics. Yeah, absolutely. And so like, how do you, I guess, how do you work through that of like making sure that you're not, you know, taking it too fucking easy on yourself? Well, listen, I'm probably the wrong person to ask that too. Because like, I'm extremely, I'm extremely hard on myself. Anybody who's close to me knows that. Like to the point where it's like probably not good for me mentally. But it also is the reason why I am who I am. So I have to look at my life and say. Am I happy with the result that I've produced so far? The answer is yes. How did I get here? Why did I get here? What made me get here? One of those things was being very critical and aware of myself. But what I have learned is that you can just adjust that way of living to be your baseline standard. And you don't have to be that critical. You don't have to be angry. You don't have to tell yourself you're a piece of shit. You know, but doesn't that get harder though when you have more proof in the puttin if you will? Right. Like now you're doing stuff. You have less people doubting you. You know what I'm saying? So like, how do you, I guess like, how do you work that when you're not like. People believe like they know, okay, yeah, you're doing some shit. You've done some shit, right? Like, and so like, how do you, I guess just keep yourself in check? I guess in that they're like, no, I still got some shit to do. So I said bigger goals. Your goals got to be like the goals I have the amount of progress I've made in my life from where I started to where I am now is not even close to the amount of progress I actually want to make. So when I look at how do I stay hungry driven, you know, sharp, which I think is what you're asking. My goals are so big that I still feel behind from where I'm at. And I think where people get really messed up is they get to a certain point where they're comfortable. And then they start saying, I've got it made. I can relax. They abandon all the habits that got them to where they are. And then they end up losing because they you are in a competition. Okay, and there's other people playing the game. And a lot of people will say, well, no, no, no, it's not a competition. No, that fucking is. It absolutely is. If you're in business, it's totally competitive. And the minute you get complacent, you're going to get beat. And so I think the way to trick yourself into not being complacent is to continue to expand your goals. To something that will take your whole life to achieve. You know, and then they will say, well, well, then you'll never achieve it. That's right. Because the achieving is not the point. It's the person you become along the way. And it's the process and the standard that you live in line with. And a lot of people don't get that, you know, a lot of people will say, well, I'm just in it for the money. You'll fucking lose, bro. You'll lose because you're competing as people like me that love the fucking war, bro. Like I fucking love it. Every day I wake up, I'm like, I might be like fuck this sucks. But the minute I get out there, I'm fucking trying to kill you. And you know, it's either a for it or you're not for it. I can tell you this every single badass entrepreneur I've ever met, they're fucking straight killers, dude. Like they do not fucking give a fuck about feel entire. They don't complain. They don't bitch. And the minute someone else bitches about being tired, they get excited because they're like, I got this motherfucker. It's not blood. Yeah, bro. And like, dude, this is the problem with the internet. The internet has created this fucking thing where everybody thinks they're an entrepreneur. And like the truth of the matter is, most people just are not fucking wired for it, dude. They're not. And you will have all these coaches out there say, oh, that's bullshit. They're wired for no, they're doing that to take your fucking money. Okay. If you can't show up day in and day out, hungry to win on your own without having to be fucking motivated or excited or told you won't make it long term, dude. You just won't make it. You got to have the fire inside of you. And that's it. I don't know how to explain this to you. I try to explain to him, but you know, the statistics back at two, bro. You know, eight percent of the people are entrepreneurs. It's like closer to 10 because of the internet, but like how many of those people stay in the same thing as an entrepreneur for more than fucking 12 months, right? Entrepreneurship is not, you know, running a fucking, you know, coaching scheme. That's how entrepreneurship, bro. That's easy money that people make by pretending to be something they aren't. You know, we're talking about actually building a product that benefits people that has long term potential. There's not many people that can do that, dude. And there's not many people that can do it for years and years and years. And by the way, there's not many people that want to do it for years and years and years. It's fucking hard, bro. But there is a segment of people who love that it's that hard and they're fucking insane. I don't know what I tell you about my school when you tell what I text you. I'm insane. You the hell is that? I'm fucking insane, bro. Like in every other motherfucker that I know that operates at a high level, they're insane too. They might hide it better than me. They might like, they might like be really proper, you know, but I promise you, when you get a couple drinks in them and you sit down at the fucking table in my, in my cigar lounge, what the fuck do they say? I'm fucking insane. Say the same shit, bro. They're fucking insane. So are you insane? Probably not. Can you make some money? Yes. Do you have a good grasp of how hard it's going to be? I think so. And so that's why I try to tell people the truth, bro, because like there's so many people out here telling all these people the wrong shit that it's going to be easy and you just got to do this and that and this. And you know, it's you could just be an entrepreneur and fucking kick your feet up and all this bullshit. And dude, what happens is is that people try and then they fail and then they think, well, how come everybody else is doing this so easily. And then they think it's them when reality been lied to you. This is the same thing in the fucking weight loss industry. Okay. In the weight loss industry, there's all these products that have come around for years and years and years and years and years to say, take this and you'll get in shape. Okay. Every motherfucker knows that that's not true. Everyone. All right. But they buy the shit anyway because they're looking for a workaround. They're looking for a hack. They hope that maybe this is the one thing and these companies know that. Okay. So they know that if they promise someone easy results, they will get the money and that the person will actually blame themselves for their lack of results. Okay. They're not going to blame the product because they already knew the product wasn't going to work and they also knew that they ate like shit while they were taking the product. When reality, bro, it's just fucking hard, man. It's boring. It's monotonous. It's. It's the hardest thing you could ever do for for work. And it's not for everybody. So I, you know, it frustrates me because I see a lot of really good people who are really good at what they do fail at being an entrepreneur. When in reality, they should never been one in the first place. Yeah. You don't have a high tolerance for pain, bro. And you don't have, now you can build that. Yeah. Okay. That's the point of fucking living the live hard and 75 hard lifestyle. But if you don't have a high tolerance for for literal pain and frustration. And you can't be fueled by fucking anger and hate. You're not going to make it, dude. I'm sorry. You're not, you're not. I love him. Because you, that's all you get. Yeah. All you get is resistance from every fucking direction. All you get. I'm in the supply. Yes. That's all you get. You get told your stupid. You get told you're going to lose. You get told your unrealistic. You get told your materialistic. You get told that your priorities are fucked up. You're greedy. You forgot where you came from. You're not humble, etc. It goes on and on and on. The list never stops. And then on top of it, you're going to get hit with bullsh**. Okay. You're going to have people steal from you. You're going to have people scam you. You're going to have problems with, you know, regulations and taxes and people fucking sabotaging your business from the inside. You're going to have your competitors do fucked up shit, bro. It never ends. It never fucking ends. And if you can't tolerate that, you cannot win. It's impossible. So you have to be someone who is willing to take all of the negativity, all of the pain, all of the frustration and swallow it and then turn it into things that actually are productive as opposed to sitting down and pouting or pretending you're some sort of fucking victim. That's the game. The game is pain. You swallow the pain. You turn it into productive action and you win when everybody else sits on the sideline and cries. That's the fucking game. Okay. So let's be fucking honest about it. It's hardest fuck period. If you're not wired for hardest fuck, you shouldn't fucking do it. That's real, man. That's real. We got one more question for you. Got another call in here. It's going to our guy, Christian. Christian. Christian on the line. And that what we just had? Christian. Okay. This is Christian. Yeah. Got it. I'm gonna make him a call. Christian. What's up, man? What is up, man? How you doing? Oh, man, you know, I'm all right. Thank you for asking. Nobody ever had. Thank you. That's because no one cares. Oh, gosh. Yeah. What's up, bro? How you doing, man? It's a pleasure to speak with you guys. Yeah, man. What's going on? We're yet. I'm out of hurtland, Maryland. Maryland. Maryland. All right. All right. That's some good life. I'm going to be a little bit more patient. Maryland. Maryland. All right. All right. That's some good lobster up there. Yeah, man. We went to Maryland one time on LaCross Trip. Got our fucking asses kicked. 27 to fucking three by a school. A school is called Calvert Hall. I'll never forget it, bro. Oh, yeah. Straight up ass beating. Wait, is it one point to score? Yeah. They scored that many goals. Yes. I'd leave. Yes. It was an ass beating. That's what I think of when I think of Maryland. I mean, I think of the way that I was like 25 fucking years ago. You're bringing up the asses again. This is serious trauma. So anyway. How can we help? Yeah. Thanks for bringing up my PTSD, bro. Here you go. All we got here is blue crabs and that's about it. Yeah. Fucking LaCross. Really is a pretty good LaCross. Yeah. All right. So what's up, man? How can we help you today? Yeah. So just some contact. Me and a good friend of mine. We started a t-shirt printing company last summer. June, actually, while it was doing 75 hard for the first time. And we've kind of grown as a year's progress. And now we're making a big financial jump. And we've invested in some big equipment, you know, like large format printer. Just big equipment so we can get into commercial signage and vehicle wraps and stuff like that. Like higher ticket stuff. And when I'm at home and, you know, I'm away from the office. Like sometimes I get to be like, dude, you're wasting time. Like watching a movie with the family or like, you know, you guys are going to do this. And you just waste time. Go home and go work. Like now it's like real. Like you have a financial investment in the company. Like you need to go work. And it's pretty hard to like be present or like try to calm down. And all I can do is like visualize what I want the company. You know, like, I want the branding to be this. And I want the culture to be like this. And it just makes it really hard. That makes sense. So yeah. Makes a lot of sense. We were just talking about this. I was just talking about this before we called you regarding something else. So yeah, it makes a whole lot of sense, bro. I was just talking about this before we called you regarding something else. And it makes a whole lot of sense, bro. But keep going. Yeah. Now, I mean, my main question is like, how do you grow the skill of patience? Because I know, I know what we, what we want in the business and what it's going to look like in 10 years. But I know it's going to take work and time to get there. But like, how do I not like completely break down until we get there? Like, what I just get this burning feeling in my stomach every time I visualize this stuff. And, you know, maybe it's a good thing, but it's hard to just be present and come to chill out. Well, welcome to being an entrepreneur. Okay. You are a real entrepreneur. You are understanding exactly what I was just talking about, which was this shit is not for everybody. It's very, very difficult. And it takes up everything. Now, I'll answer your question here in a second. Christian is telling you guys what we just talked about on the show. What that really feels like. Okay. That is what a fucking feels like. It is fucking all encompassing. It is an anxious feeling in your stomach 24 hours a day. You can't really figure out why and you can't get rid of it. All right. And if you can't live that way 24 hours a day for a fucking decade. Or do you can't do it. It's that that's the truth. So to you, Christian, that's exactly normal. So first of all, you're not abnormal for feeling that way. I still feel that way. I feel that way every single day. Now, how do you get more patients? I had a guitar instructor for about 10 years ago. And he said to me one day, you know, I get pretty frustrated when I'm not good at things. And I'm not very good at guitar. And he's like, Andy, well across. Yeah, he's, you know, I'm pretty good. I'll try other motherfuckers, bro. Shit. It would have been 40 to fucking three. That's right. Yeah. So I was working off pure intimidation. Bross, hacking these motherfuckers in the ears and shit, just trying to get them to stay away. They're apparently people are pretty tough in Maryland. Yeah. So anyway, he said to me, he said, hey, man, he said, you're not very patient. And I said, yes, I'm aware. And he said, do you know how you develop patients? And I said, no, he says by doing things that require patients. And I'm like, huh, no shit. And but that stuck with me, right? It was something I remembered. So we're going to give you a little hack here. All right. You can't just ignore your family while you build your business. Okay. Nor do you need to. Now, let me give you some, some advice from someone who's been in this for 26 years. I felt exactly like you. And I do feel exactly like you. But what I can tell you from looking back is that I didn't have to feel like you. I didn't have to feel that way the entire time. I have passed on many events. I have passed on many vacations. I have canceled vacations the day before I was supposed to go. Many times I have done all of these things. And the truth of the matter is, bro, I would have ended up here anyway. I would have ended up here anyway. So my advice to you as a young man is to do it. The best that you can to understand that if you are effective day in and day out, you can still be present with your family. And it will save you regret later. Okay. You don't want to miss these times with your, your family. And it's very easy for us as entrepreneurs to tell ourselves. You know, hey, if I, if I, I've got to sacrifice this for this. If you don't want to ruin that part of your life when you don't have to. So right. Yeah, bro. So Ed, my business partner in Arte, Ed, my let. He has a really good method for this. And I'm going to share it with you. This is his method, not my method. But what he actually does is he schedules time with his family. And I know that sounds like kind of cold. They don't know that it's scheduled, but he knows it's scheduled. He actually puts the time in to his phone. Hey, these three hours are for my family. And he turns his fucking phone off during that time. And, uh, yeah. And, and dude, you know, I don't really have to do that because I don't have kids. But it seems to work for him. And from a lot of the people in Arte, they've started to do the same thing. And they all report that that's very helpful. So when we talk about, you know, what it's like to be an entrepreneur. Yes, it's very hard. Yes, it takes everything. But just because you're competitive and you want to be in the game more, doesn't necessarily mean you won't be where you want to be. If you still do other things. Remember, dude, one day we're going to be fucking dead. And it's very important for you to realize that like. Yes, it's exciting. Yes, you want to win. Yes, you've got your ass on the line. I understand all of those things. But also, you don't want to be alone when you're 70 years old because you fucking punked out on your family right now. You don't have to. You don't have to. You don't have to. You don't have to. I have a lot of regrets. And one of my regrets is that I missed a lot of things thinking that I had to when I really didn't have to. And I've talked to a lot of entrepreneurs who feel that same way. So take it for me, you know, someone who's been down the path that you're on. You know, you don't have to do that, bro. I could hear it in your voice. You're committed. I can you guys are already making the financial investments. You're thinking about it nonstop, which means this is not a side project to you. This is a fucking main priority. I can hear it in everything that you said. So you being aware you being aware of those things and thinking that way gives you a massive advantage over everybody else because what we were just talking about before you called in was basically the idea that everybody thinks that entrepreneurship is just something. They think of it as like they can just do it. And it's going to be easy and everybody does it. And I can already tell that you're obsessed and obsession is what the fucking takes, bro. So you are going to have to learn and trust that this time with your family is not only important, but it's going to contribute to what you're trying to do because it's going to remind you consistently of why you do it. So that's my take on it, bro. I think it's very, very important for you to realize that you know, you're going to get there either way, dude. I can hear it in your voice. I appreciate that. Yeah. Anything else? Well, I mean, I don't want to take up your guys. No, you're good. We're here for you, bro. I just want to say thank you, man. You know, big shout out to Montaill, Cauchman and Marcus D. Laun. They last year out 350 pounds and they pushed me to do 75 hard drops like 40 pounds during 75 hard and drop another 20. And my wife just completed 75 hard and I have other family members saying they want to do it now. So, you know, I always go back to you saying leading by example, like, you know, you turn the page and everybody else will kind of start turning with you. That's true. So I just want to say thank you for that. Now, bro, I mean, that's, that's what it's about. That's what being a leader is about. That's what being a man is about. That's exactly what this country needs is men like you who are going to set an example for other people to follow. And when we talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion, it's going to come from the individual level. If we want things to change, we have to change. And if we change other people, see it, they change. And it flows down, you know, from there. So that's exactly the point, bro. So like, don't, don't thank us, man. I'm thanking you. Like, thank you for taking that obligation serious because it's going to be men like you that change the entire fucking country. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate what you guys do. And, you know, it's important. So thank you. And all that shit makes sense that we're talking about here on your question. No, it did. Yeah, no, yeah, 100%. I know it's normal. Well, I don't think it's, I mean, it's not normal between everybody. I know obviously the few people that I do know that are in business share the same feeling. But it's just that that's probably the biggest thing I struggle with. It's just it never leaves my head. Yeah, I won't. So they never will. That's, but that's okay. It never will, bro. You're never going to be the same as you were before. You're never going to be mindlessly going through life. And like you're. The piece you had an ignorance of entrepreneurship will never return. It will never return. Yeah. You will never be standing by the pond with the wind blowing through your hair, being like, fuck, this is great. You'll never, it'll never be that way again. Dude, you're changed. You're different. And maybe after you exit the business one day, maybe that will come back. But once you enter into this game and once you get like a taste for it and you realize it's for you, your life will never be the same. Dude, you'll never see things the same. You'll never feel the same. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just completely different. And we as entrepreneurs also have to recognize that all of the shit that we see on the internet, all of these memes, all of these recommendations, all of this advice, all of these rules, all of these things that we are inundated with are not meant for us. These are meant for regular people doing regular life. We live by a different code, a different set of rules. And if we consume all of that information and we take it to heart and we try to live at those standards, that everybody else tells us that we're supposed to live at, we will go fucking crazy because it's not in line with what the reality of our lives are as entrepreneurs. So keep that in mind because you're going to look out on the internet and you're going to see everybody doing things a certain way. They're going to be judging you for doing something different. And it'll drive us crazy, dude, if we don't recognize that we have chosen a completely different path in life. So keep that in mind, dude. You're mental being obsessed the way that you are already. If you don't balance it out with awareness in terms of that we're just built different and we accept that, it's going to really fucking drive you crazy. So that goes for everybody out there building something like dude, their rules and your rules are completely different. And it's something that we have to accept it took me a long time to accept that. You know, I'm reading all this shit all the time and hearing people talk about this and balance and this and that and this and I'm like, fuck, I can't do that. And then I finally realized there is no there is no balance. Fuck no, bro, it's a fucking fallacy, dude. And you know, trust me, man. You know, you're people and your friends and they can all still be your friends and they can all still you can all still hang out with them, but they're never going to get it. It's never they're never going to fucking get it. And as long as you get it, you're going to be able to keep those relationships. As long as you can look at them and say, hey, it's cool. They just don't get it and just kind of accept it. Not take a person. Yeah, right, exactly. Like that's how I look at it. Like, you know, I have people say things to me still and they're like, oh, you know, and I'm like, yeah, it's cool. They don't fucking get it. Still a good dude. You know what I mean? Just a little bit tired. Yeah. You know, I didn't say that, but you know what I'm saying? Look, dude, it's just different paths. Yeah. It's just different paths, man. And that's what we were talking about before you called in, brother, was how the entrepreneurship path has been presented as if it's some sort of easy path to create freedom. When reality, it's like running the mother fucking gauntlet over and over and over again for your whole life. You know, and I don't know. I wouldn't change it, but it's just not for everybody. You know, I love it, man. Now, in the, in like, I'm only 27, so I'm relatively young, but like my whole time growing up, I obviously had social media all the time. And you guys talk about it, but like people just taking pictures with private jets and luxury cars and, hey, I do insider stock trading. Like, you know, but they're full of the S, but you know, the regular people out there, me included. I mean, I believe it for a long time. It's like, what am I doing wrong? Like what? You know what I mean? And so I totally see that. Bro, these people are full of shit, dude. There are services that allow you to rent cars and rent jets to take pictures for your fucking Instagram. Okay? A lot of these people are financing their cars for 10 fucking years. Like, it's so fake, dude. You, look, unless you can order their product, see it on shelves, you know, see a building or some sort of actual organization or they have, they got to have the fucking receipts, bro. And that's just like the nice shit. Okay. But where's your employees? Where's your product? Can I order your product? How long have you been doing it? Where do you, where's your offices? What, you know, like, bro, a lot, most of these people are total fucking liars. So you just got to keep that in mind. And by the way, their day will come. Okay? The day when their car gets repossessed and they look and they get embarrassed on the internet or they get caught scamming or whatever, man. Like, their fucking day will come. And it's irrelevant. It's totally irrelevant. You got to show up every single day. And like you said, you know, you got to show up. You got to do everything you can. And you still have to have patience for the long game. You know, every single day has to be executed with urgency with tasks that are critical, that movie forward. And you still have to understand that it's going to take five, 10 years to really get it. Move in the way you want. So we call that aggressive patience. If you've been listening to show, you know that. Yep. But dude, look, man. Don't sacrifice your family for this. Okay? You don't need to. That's, that's the biggest thing I need you to take away. Like you don't need to make that sacrifice. Schedule that time. Be present. Put your phone away. The world is not going to burn the fuck down. While you're going to a movie or having dinner or even going on a vacation. And the truth of the matter is the reason I know that is because I fucked all that shit up. So. Take it for me. Love it. Yeah. Well, thank you guys so much. I appreciate it. Our brother. You wrote. I'm good. Yeah, you too. Yeah, man. I think a lot of people fucking, you know. They think they think they think they got a fucking give up everything. You don't have to give up everything, bro. You just got to, you can't coast. Yeah. You know, you got to show up every day and give it everything you fucking got. And, and you know, part of success is having good relationships and friends that's. Success is not just a financial thing. Yeah. You know what I mean? 100% dude. But it definitely includes finances because there's a lot of people who look walls. I'm wealthy. No, you're not. You got good friends. You got a family. You're poor. Right. I'm being honest. That's a real. That's a real thing. That's real. Like this whole fucking thing. All the money in the world. I have nobody. You can. That's right. There's a thing. And you want, you don't, you don't want to be poor either way. Yeah. But the point of the matter is, I get tired of seeing this shit on the internet where it's like, this is the new wealth. No, fucking, those numbers in your bank account or your investment portfolio is your fucking wealth. Still wealth. That's not because all that is is people letting themselves off the hook for their financial misfortunes, right? The lack of execution. Yeah. Like, oh, this is the new rich. No, rich is rich, motherfucker. Like, I don't know what the fuck I tell you. You know, you know what I'm saying? I did it. Yeah. It's really shit. Oh, yeah. Fucking, you know, feeling good is. I'm so rich. Yeah. Hard to climb. Yes. Yes. You've been a little. You're moving. Oh, it all matters, bro. And you don't get to say it like just like I don't get to say, oh, I've got a lot of success financially. You know, this over here is great too. I'm not, you can't pretend. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like now I'm, but I'm aware of that. And I do have great relationships and all those things. But I'm not saying I don't, but I'm saying just because you're fucking poor, you don't get to say you're rich. And, you know, I'm rich in other ways. Okay. You got some good friends and good family, but your bank account says that you're poor. Yeah. Let's be honest. That's real. Okay. And by the way, if you would like to live that way and you're happy, there's nothing wrong with that. If you're really happy. Yes. But don't pretend you're happy just so you can sound cool on the internet. I love it, man. Yeah. I love it, man. Well, guys, Andy, that was three, man. All right, guys. Well, we'll see you tomorrow for CTI. Never sleep in on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck up, fuck up, fuck up, stole. Counting millions in a coke. Bad bitch, booted slow. Got a own bankroll. Can't fold. Dusset, no. Hit shot. Case, clothe, clothe.
