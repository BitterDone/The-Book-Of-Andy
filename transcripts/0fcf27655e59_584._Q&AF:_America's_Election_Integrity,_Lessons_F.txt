Yeah, some nicer shit. Yeah, right 100% yeah, I mean look, bro, and It's reality it's not that they're bad people. No, it's that they're low awareness people and by the way That's by design. Mm-hmm. These people that you see that you get frustrated with remember dude most of these people are Struggling so hard to just keep it together in any way shape or form, but they don't have the ability to like look Below the surface in anything. Yeah, that's real man. That's all it's fucking real man. Yeah, man But no, so Costco got a burrito. Yeah, so they got these breakfast burritos, bro All right, the macros are fucking great. There's like 18 Turkey, too, right? So it's like turkey breakfast burritos. It's like 18 grams of protein, bro I popped that shit in the air fryer in the mornings. Yeah, not every morning, but most like most mornings. Yeah Bro, they're good they change your life. Yeah, well look me on change your life. I love some breakfast burritos I like chicken burritos are like shrimp burritos Out with bro. Yeah, bro. That's fucking good. It's like shrimp rice some guac a little bit of queso Okay, if you're getting fancy a couple crunched up tortilla chips in there. That's real fancy. I know bro I'm fat. I know what the fuck's good Okay, like I know fat kid delights a hot sauce in there. Yes, Frank's. Yes, I'm with you on that Yes, if you can get your hands on some Taco Bell fire sauce though. That's even better Let me push it up Taco Bell fire sauce is the best thing about Taco Bell comes in and goes out. Yeah I don't know about that. I just think it's a good hot sauce. Yeah, but you know the The burrito thing man like it's the ultimate like I mean, it's just so convenient bro. You could make like Thanksgiving burritos Like you can put turkey and and mashed potatoes and corn and like all this stuff in a burrito and it's still fucking good Like you really can't fuck a burrito up like you could even make a peanut butter and jelly burrito I've done those that I've done those was again. Okay, so that's what I'm saying So like when I get heat for putting slim gems in burrito with some sprinkle cheese and throwing that shit in a microwave I feel like that's unjustified. I feel like that's a little different. I That's a little different. You want me to make you one? No Listen, you can have your candy corn or you can have your slim gem. I'm just telling you it's really hard to fuck up a burrito Yeah, now there are better burritos. It just goes with anything. I get that well. There's better burritos What's the better? Well, I mean like you know an actual authentic good like burrito chicken, you know But I mean, but even the worst burritos American thing though bro Listen, even real like Hispanic thing even the worst burritos still pretty fucking good.

It's great Yeah, well, listen, yeah, I just just sent me off of this can mess it up I didn't have my burrito this morning. So it's just like I'm like fine like that. Yeah burritos are good. Yeah, yeah, well listen I got some good ones for you. All right Let's knock these out man guys. Andy question number one Andy You've talked about the possibility of Trump not being allowed to run or Them possibly still in the election if this does happen What does that mean for us and what does that mean for America? You know, I don't know what it means. I think this is very uncertain times. I think that they're I think a lot You know, I think there's a lot of people you know, I think Trump's making a lot of mistakes with his messaging. I'll just say that I don't think there's any arguing over his policies and the things that he put into play That we were in the best economic position that we'd ever been in in this country in our lifetimes And then the good economic position really flows down to all the areas of our life, right? I was just having this discussion with a buddy of mine You know, he was talking about pro life pro choice and you know people care about pro life and pro choice When times are good, but when times are bad and they have trouble surviving that issue goes way down the list Right and even for people who are on the left it still goes way down the list I mean these people got to eat they got to survive they got to do these things and so you know a lot of these Identity politics Social issue voting points. I think are losing favor and I think the main thing is is people are scared that A couple things I think the migration issue is scaring people that we're actually going to be overrun by migrants and crime and You know, that's a united Issue that both sides of the aisle are scared about and nervous about and pissed off about No, the economy is another issue, right? People want more money in their pockets They want to pay less for their groceries and for their gas They want inflation to be low. They want interest rates to be low We want to go out here and win and achieve and Live the best life that we can economically and these are real concerns on both sides of the aisle and I see those two things along with the crime Being the top things because those are the things that touch people right those are the things that people have to deal with and so whether it's Trump or Could be DeSantis or Ramaswami or whatever right or whether it's Biden or Obama Michelle or Newsom Really it doesn't matter because what we're dealing with in my opinion is A communist revolution that I believe we're right in the middle of and if we pay attention to communist revolutions of the past Everything that's been happening over the course of the last 15 to 20 years and if we really dig deep It's been going on for almost a hundred years Has been geared towards the precipice of what these globalists the Klaus Schwab World Economic Forum globalist types are calling agenda 2030, right and We saw this accelerated with COVID We saw that we're seeing our rights being trampled on we're seeing people in other countries get sentenced to actual jail for misgendering people or Speaking out and these are all things that weren't happening just even five years ago And so we have this big shift of these globalists towards this communist Revolution that's happening here in America so like in my opinion You know, it's less important about who the candidate is because we only have certain choices right like yeah We could sit here and criticize Trump and we could say I fucking don't like this and that in this or we can criticize DeSantis I don't like this and that in this or we could say Ramaswami. Oh, he's this or that right or we can go over here and talk to Biden But at the end of the day we have to make a choice and the choices we're either gonna go this way or we're gonna go this way We're either gonna go the way of more censorship more big government more control over us less freedom for us More stress financially more stress economically higher costs of goods more pressure Our kids being manipulated and taught things that we don't necessarily want them to do as parents Or we're gonna go this other way and this other way is You know more towards the traditional way that America has been over the history of America And if I'm being honest I think that That way the the way of the conservative because I'm neither can people mistake this a lot of times They say I'm I'm conservative. I'm not a conservative. I'm I'm a libertarian moderate in the middle who happens to lean conservative Because I'm not a communist when they push so far the other way correct So like I'm against communism and I'm against progressivism and I'm against shit that doesn't make sense And so for that you know reason I look to the right And when I look to the right and I look at who the candidates are The only person that has a chance to be the nominee without some drastic Interferences Trump so that's the reality we're dealing with right? It's Trump or this other path whether that be Biden, Newsom or Michelle Obama and this other path is Elite tyrants oppressing the rest of us and getting the rest of us to hate each other for the rest of our lives taking everything from us in higher taxes A squeezed in economic, you know quote unquote free economy. That's not even free that's owned by the biggest conglomerates in the world where their culture is pushed down into our Communities through their business structure This is happening this happens, you know through ESG and DEI and and SEI and all these things that we talk about It's it's culture and so when we look at culture And what we want we have to decide do we want this new culture where like you know These people are bust in from these other countries that aren't American and don't share our values And it's in the sake and for the benefit of whom and what Because never have we been told ever what how that benefits us They say oh, it's just diversity. Well, this diversity for the sake of being diverse isn't necessarily a good thing All right, that doesn't diversity doesn't equal good All right, there's American culture and American culture doesn't have to do with skin tone. It has to do with a set of values that we all believe in All right, so it doesn't matter if you're black white Asian, you know Indian Uh, what doesn't matter right, but if you have this value system of being an American and you believe in the things like You know what America has traditionally stood for which is equal opportunity the pursuit of happiness the pursuit of a of a Of a higher level life better than our parents Uh, and leaving the country in a better place than it is You know making the most of our life the American dream all of these things that's America bro Treating your neighbor regardless of what their race is as a fellow American That's the culture of America and the left is destroying that intentionally and not giving us any reason as to why right? Okay, so So my inclination is to look over here and say okay, we definitely need to go down this path But here's how I feel about it I don't feel that any of these candidates on the right and by the way if the candidates are You know fucking whoever whoever I'm voting on the right because it's the opposite of what the fuck they got going on That's our choice, but how I actually feel about it Is that like we have a lot to fix and a lot to clean up and it's not It's not just you know Let's go to the conservative side like there's things there's major reformation that needs to happen in this country way before the election Bro, it's beforehand after the election, right? There's like we should not be taxed at a rate of higher than 50% When we add up all the tax that we pay over the course of the year Which is the case for every single person that pays taxes. It's not just income tax It's not just you're withholding tax. It's when you buy gas when you buy a car to personal property tax It's et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera all these things add up to more than 50% which makes you a fucking slave All right, you don't understand that most people don't get it You are a slave of the United States and the United States government is intended to serve us We are not intended to serve them. So it's backwards right now. We're serving them. They're not serving us And so like our taxes need to go now into a reasonable level the government needs to shrink to a reasonable level New reforms need to be made in terms of you know Term limits and you know old laws and over litigious society like there's so much change that needs to happen That I'm not sure that even the voting of the right can fix it But here's what I think I think voting of the right can stop The progress of this communist action which gives us a chance to maybe turn America into what it's supposed to be And that's how I feel about things you know like when I say I'm voting for Trump people say oh you're a Trump You know Loyalist actually. I'm not if you listen to my show I criticize him plenty There's a lot of things he does wrong. There's a lot of things he could do right now that if he came out and did The entire country where you night around him But he refuses to do it and doesn't do it the proper way and he's got bad people around him giving him bad advice Who are out of touch with the reality of the people on the street the pain they're feeling and what they actually want from a leader Okay, we don't want this shit where you come on TV and give us this fucking walk the line shit When someone asks you if a man is a man and a woman is a woman we want you to say fucking yes Not That makes people not trust you right when you take money from the vaccine companies and then promote a vaccine Where there's many people that I know and many people that you know and many people that these guys know who've gotten sick and fucked up And you continue to come on the fucking television and talk about how safe it is and how effective it is And how you did it that pisses people to fuck off bro And there's a lot of shit that fucking pisses me off about how they do things over there But at the end of the day do I want fucking American culture or do I want communist culture? I want American culture So I'm gonna ride that way and that's how I feel about it And so I do think they're gonna steal the election And I do think they're gonna fucking defraud the people And I do think they're going to do that because they understand that if culture goes back towards American Constitutional Republic style culture By the letter of the law traders are executed and imprisoned and they understand that that's who they are That's why they call people like me and other people who are just common sense Americans who want things to get better Domestic terrorists and put us on watch list and have our own government listen to our phone calls You know what I'm saying? Like bro, that's that's fucking wrong Okay, so when we think about what we're dealing with here we're dealing with the situation that if we don't fucking come out On the American culture side of things this next election I don't think America survives in the way that we've known it Yeah, and I think people don't understand what that means You know, we've seen how many examples of this in the last two weeks like how many of these far left progressive activists have literally gotten killed in the streets by crime by their own beliefs Correct Okay, they're wrong That the progressive ideology is wrong It's fucking wrong. It doesn't work. It's called idealism That's why this show is called real as fuck because we're realists here All right, there's thing there's way things work and there's way things don't work in this progressive ideology that criminals criminals in this country are just somehow disadvantaged And that's why they commit crimes not fucking true. There's such a thing as bad fucking people All right, and bad people come in all races and all all sizes and all backgrounds from all countries We have bad people and we have good people bad people are gonna have to be withdrawn from society They're gonna have to be in prison or executed or removed from this country That is a fucking reality that no one wants to say and we have all these bleeding heart people that want to say Well, they didn't grow up like we did Bro because they grew up in a mick mansion out in the suburbs somewhere All right, they've never touched real crime They've never been around real hardship and those people feel guilty for how they were raised not and making a massive mistake that these other people that they're sympathizing for will actually fucking kill them to take the shit Okay, so we have to get real about what's happening in this country and what's how the world works the world works like this natural order Kill or be killed the strongest survive strength through power All right, that's what that's the world. Okay, that's the world we live in high-level competition Good and bad these are these are things that are real and we have so many people in this country that still want to argue over nuance and And Ideology that's not real and I just don't I think that's a waste of time. I think that's a waste of argument I think that's a waste of our breath like what are we arguing over? Okay, you don't like this and this and this about Trump So you're gonna vote for Biden You see what I'm saying right like you did that last time how they're worked out for you Bro, I don't know like I don't know what's gonna happen. I I think people are I think they're gonna steal the election And I think America is gonna have a real gut check because I think they're gonna steal right in our faces I think their goal they're they're not hiding any of this shit anymore They're not they're not like pretending like this is why all these social media influencers that come out and they keep saying Oh my god, can you believe this is happening dude? You're helping it happen You are helping it happen by saying that these social media influencers that come on the internet every day for Likes click shares and views to build their own brand so that they can sell some swag those people are perpetuating the problem by continuing to pretend like they're surprised that these people continue to do this These people are doing this it's intentional They're not gonna stop and they and if they get full power they will kill you That's reality. So that's how I feel about it When were you think bro? No 100% well So I'll say this too on the culture part right like and it's something I've been thinking about because the last couple of weeks We've seen what this migrant crisis has done to these other countries right We're not a week from being in those same position in my opinion and you know, I think that the argument of like you know that even with the diversity stuff It's like So how is the solution to fix if we're saying there's a problem with American culture right now How is bringing in an external culture going to fix that internal like they're not trying to fix That's not the point. They're trying to put the extra nail in the coffin right right They understand that American culture is weak. Yep Yeah, man, so I think I think we as Americans man. We got a lot of There those are gonna have to be a lot of reflection and but more importantly just understanding what the problem is That's one part of it. We have a lot of things that we have to fix in our own households and our own lives We got month before the election and if we don't do anything between now and that time Whoever wins election doesn't even fuck a matter because what wills to be fucked Yeah, that's why this is a cultural revolution that needs to take place This is why when I talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion It is the ultimate rebellion because their entire premise of conquering America is built upon the dependency of the American citizen on them And if we become independent of them they cease to have the power over us So if they want us to be unhealthy, we become healthy if they want us fat We don't become fat if they want us broke. We don't become broke if they want us stupid We consume things that make us less stupid All right, if they want us to hate each other We don't hate each other we help each other we love each other we pick each other up Like we're supposed to do in America all right We have to be the opposite of what they want because their entire power structure depends on dependency That's why when I say it's the ultimate rebellion. I mean literally it is the rebellion The rebellion starts with each individual in this country living to a higher standard and working to become independent of their system The more dependent you are on the system the more you take from them the more they own you that's reality And so if we want to fix this we have to look inside ourselves and ask what am I doing to fix this? What is my role in this and the role isn't just go on the internet and post the role isn't just show up at the school board meeting What you should do the role isn't get engaged in politics which you should do the role is to live a high standard That literally inspires every single person around you to be better And that's what's going to fix this country in the long term. It's not going to be a politician It's not going to be Trump. It's not going to be fucking. It's certainly not going to be Biden. Okay And it's not going to be Andy. It's not going to be the vague. It's not going to be anybody Nobody's going to come and fix your shit and until you fix your shit and your neighbor fixes his and his neighbor fixes his This is not going to change. This is this is this is this is the thing that people are missing do they're missing this okay Wanted to be somebody they wanted to be someone else because it's hard It's hard to take responsibility for your own life. It's hard to say hey, I'm not living To the standard of what the previous Americans before me died for I'm not taking advantage of the opportunity that I have as a free American I'm letting myself be taken advantage of by a rogue government that wants me to be fat unhealthy sick dependent Financially handicapped so that they can get everything from us when you Ask yourself What role you are playing and you can't say I'm taking care of those things Everything else you do on top of that is irrelevant So you have to be real with yourself when we all do are we living to the American standard Did my grandfather who was killed and never met his own fucking kid Die for nothing. That's how I feel about it Okay, and when I look at my life and I look at the mirror my life I might not be the best and anything I do But I try really hard. I try hard. I try hard to come in here and share a good message I try hard to live to a high standard. I try hard to you know build things that matter that help people that contribute I try really fucking hard and there's plenty of criticisms that could be made about me But I can tell you this when I look around at most people most people ain't trying this hard All right, and that's a reality and if we want to fucking change this you guys listening to this show just by stepping up And trying a little bit fucking harder we can change a whole lot of shit Yeah, absolutely man Guys any question number two and Hey Andy, what are three important lessons that you're dead taught you growing up that you still use to this day? Oh, man The big the big one well fuck there's a lot Make friends not enemies. That's that's a big lesson that that he always beat into our heads You know a lot of people especially nowadays with the contentious nature of society Love to hate other people right how many times can we even have a conversation about You know differing opinions and viewpoints without walking away being like I'm done with that person like everything has to be these Extreme I'm leaving. I'm breaking up with you fuck you. You're a piece of shit Over basic discussions that five ten fifteen years ago would have just been differences of opinion Okay, and so that lesson make friends not enemies has been a valuable lesson for me because The truth of the matter is there's been a whole lot of people that my first one or two run-ins with them We're not very good who ended up being great friends and great assets in my life, and I was a great asset to them You know, so so I think that's a big lesson, you know like when I met my business partner Chris We didn't like each other. We both played the same sport. We were both good. We were competitive and we we were not friends Okay, but we became friends and a lot of good came from it right and I can list down many relationships like that in my life where You know that's happened. So I think that that's a big lesson for my dad um, you know my dad used to always say this thing, you know Make a list call the list when Now that's what he always said make a list call the list when now all right and what he's saying is execute He's saying execute right now. He's saying what do you got to do? You should do that right now and and that's you know, it's it's a version a very simple version of my power list system Which is the ultimate productivity system which I give away for free which you can get in episode 16 on the audio feed It's it's a fail-safe system. It's the only way I know for sure that guarantees you to continue to move forward in life um And I think that's where that came from so that was a big thing and then you know The third lesson I probably got from my mom which is do the right thing Which I learned because I stole some cool aid from a grocery store when I was you know like eight years old So uh, I stole this cool aid I was mountain berry punch and we you know back then dude we weren't having cool aid. We were having like you know Full aid, you know what I'm saying right And uh, we were walking through the grocery store and I remember there was mountain berry punch I had seen a commercial for it on TV you know back then the cool aid man was bad-ass because he like bus through the wall fucked up your house and he's like oh, yeah, like dude. It was just bad-ass right and so the cool aid man Bust in he's mountain berry punch cool aid and I saw it at the store. I'm like dude mountain berry punch I gotta have it my mom's like no can't have it and uh and so like I put it in my pocket right and Yeah, I didn't think it through though So I went home I wanted the cool aid, but I know how to make cool aid So I had to ask my mom to make the cool aid, right? And you know I ended up getting my ass beat for that and then she made me take it back to the store And tell the tell the person that I stole it And that was a lesson I'm very thankful for that because that was a lesson stuck with me my whole life And you know, I made a lot of mistakes in my life. I've not always done the right thing I'm not always done what was right But I've always done my best to make it right after I've realized that I was you know Then I made a mistake or I fucked up And I think that's been a guiding principle in my life as well And I could go down the list from my mom and my dad Of different things that I learned but I think those three lessons are a good foundation to build upon I love that man make friends not any of these executing right now. Yeah, and I always do the right thing Yeah, those those three lessons have have have really Help guide me to a place where you know I'm doing okay. Yeah, I love that Well guys our third and final question and question number three And I connected with 99% of my customers and grew my business one customer at a time But two years ago I moved my store into a high traffic location And now I can't remember anyone that comes in resulting in every conversation feeling not genuine At this point I treat everyone the same like I know them But it doesn't feel right How do I connect with people when I can't remember them especially when they come in multiple times a week I feel like an idiot. No bro listen and and the bigger you get the harder that is it's really hard It's really really hard To grow from a small business when you really care about people into a big business When you're that person that built it And I can I can understand that because I'm in that scenario as well and like bro I meet thousands of people a week You know what I mean if I leave the if I leave here to go anywhere I mean, I'm meeting lots of people and so Yeah, of course I can't remember every single person dude right But but what I try to do is the best I can I try to I try to remember you know As much as I can if I remember them sometimes they'll say things and they'll be like oh we met here or there and I'll try I'll be like oh yeah, and I will remember right but I but here's what I've discovered most people are pretty cool And most people don't take it personal and if you if you are in a business environment especially dealing with customers And you can't remember them then they understand that because remember wherever they go nobody gives a fuck about him So the fact that you're doing 90% of it and you just can't keep up with it They're still walking out saying dude that guy cares. Yeah, and so What I try to do is just to be present in the conversation. I try to look them in the eye try to listen to what they're saying um And and dude that can get hard for me because uh You know the sure volume of it is is emotionally taxing because when I meet people Usually at this point they want to tell me about how they did 75 hard a lot right or they want to tell me how the MFC O project helped them build their business or they want to tell me how you know me sharing a story about you know Like how I'm going through hard times help them through hard times So when I recognize people or people recognize me in public. It's not It's not um. It's not like hey, I just want a picture. It's like hey I want to give you some gratitude, right? And when that happens at scale bro It drains you and it makes you like every time I do a meet and greet I feel like I fucked up. I walk away and I'm like fuck dude like I hope I gave him enough I hope I made you know what I mean because I understand how important that is and like I think about like you know like Sometimes the line is hours and hours and hours long, you know like Like sometimes like eight nine hours some places, okay? So like it's real shit like summer smash this year We expedited it was still three and a half fucking hours. You know what I mean? So like It's hard and I always feel like I didn't do a good job And and that's so I can relate to that feeling and my advice would be for you guys That are getting to that phase where you're really building something based upon how much you care To give yourself a little credit and just do the best that you can man make these people understand that there's people here at this place to care about them And what's cool is and like this has happened, you know with my businesses um Is that the culture and the business kind of starts to fill in and have your back on that So we're like, you know here like if you talk to someone from first form on the phone or in person Chances are broke they're gonna get they're gonna give a lot of fucks about you Okay, and the reason that they do is because they've watched us do that for many many years And they understand it's overwhelming and they do care and that attracts these people right like the people here at first form Are a product of the the culture of the business Bringing people to us right there's people here from all over the country Uh, they move here, you know these people have somehow been touched or affected by people in the brand at this point And so it kind of scales out Uh through your people so my advice to you would be Do the absolute best you can if you can't remember someone's name understand that you're human and there's only limited mental capacity Um, if you can't remember details and somehow you get embarrassed like you talked to someone before or you know And you don't remember a detail or something like like there's oftentimes where I met people And then I forget that I met him before because of fucking volume of people that I meet and I've always embarrassed like It's mortifying like because I fucking don't want to ever be that guy But it's just math right? It's just math yeah, and what I found here's what I found Most people are very fucking forgiving because they get it They understand I'm doing the best that I can like they see me doing the best that I can and so like when I fuck up They give me the benefit of the doubt and they're gonna give you the benefit of the doubt too as long as you're working the best that you can I love it. So it's a heart. I can relate to that bro I spend a lot of time feeling guilty about that like my favorite part of business is the customer my favorite part of what we do Was working in the retail stores back when when it was just s2 before first form ever existed right um Those are my favorite things. Unfortunately, I don't get to do those things anymore And so those of you who are in those positions who are owners and operators um, you should you should appreciate the time you're in because every time you scale up past the actual customer Relationship part if you actually care about the customers the business gets less fun Because you don't get to do that part anymore like I don't get to see people anymore like in my face or actually help them Like yes, there's a lot of you guys who are helped by 75 hard Yes, there's a lot of you guys that listen to the podcast and take the advice and go build things But like that's that's different for me because remember all I see is this All I see is what I'm seeing here in my life through my eyes I don't see out here in the world It's I can't see what's happening and when you're working with people directly You get to see that and it's very rewarding so You know, and there's a case to be made real talk that if you're operating a business and You know, you're thinking I just want to get the business as big as I can There's a case to be made that's that might not be the right move for your own happiness, right? In my case the reason that I'm working to grow our business as big as I can is because I understand the culture ramifications of what we're building here Right, I understand that the way that we operate our companies is actually the way that most companies should operate And I want other companies to look at me and start operating that way so that We could change the culture because I believe that entrepreneurship's controls the culture in the world Okay, so when I think of like the play that I'm running I don't think of it like oh, I'm just trying to run a business to make a whole bunch of money bro I've been over money for a long time I have every mother fucking thing you could ever have I got a fucking tank. I was just driving in an hour or two this morning, okay like Like Okay, and I don't say I have to brag. It's just fact. All right all the cool stuff I have Everything I do now is is purpose driven mission driven shit And so when I look at what I'm doing Even though I would prefer to spend my time in a store, right? That's not the best way for me to spend my time when I think about the big impact that can be made We changed people's lives here. We help people go from What they are where they're completely unhappy and we teach them how to do the work to get them where they want to go There's no magic in anything we do we provide very very very high quality products The best possible products that I know how to make and that we know how to make we provide and We give people the real game plan and we work with people to help them change their lives and and this is the play that I'm running My goal is to create a company That is so impactful and so big that it literally changes the culture of all the other companies and that culture change will change the culture of this country And that's that's what my mission is and if we change the culture of this country that changed the culture of the world So like when I legitimately like if you sat down with me and you said what do you think you're trying to do with your companies? I am legitimately trying to change the world with my companies I'm trying to change the way business is done. I'm trying to change the way customers are treated I'm trying to change the way business looks at customers I'm trying to change the way that your employees take home the core values and the culture that they live every single day I'm trying to change fucking everything and it's not about money It's about mission and it's about impact and while it may not be as fun and it may not be as enjoyable It matters a whole lot right now and I recognize that and I'm very aware of that So I could come on this podcast every single day and I can talk about you know What we need to do or I can bark orders and say what you need to do and those are all true But the reality is unless I go build it and it's so obnoxiously impactful and big that everybody else wants to be a part of that It's a fail You see what I'm saying? Yeah, so there's there's there's a lot of I don't know there's a lot to think about when you're thinking about Your own business and where you want it to be right if you're just someone you know and by the way You the guy who's just passed the point of you know being able to remember their customers names But still engaged with the customers you might be able to make a very deep impact with all of those customers And your employees at that scale and it might make a huge difference okay, but I happen to be in a position in my life Where I cannot have kids Okay, um I don't have that part of my life that most of you have and I feel like I'm here to do something that matters and that impacts and that changes things and I feel like that's done through entrepreneurship And so I feel that all the entrepreneurs out there have an obligation to set the culture that they believe should exist in America Inside of their own business and no matter what the internet says no matter what the fortune 100 companies do We have an obligation to build our companies exactly as we would like America to be all right And if we do that those employees will take that culture and live that culture and that culture begins to spread Into the community and this is how things change and so entrepreneurs in my opinion legitimately are in the driver's seat For changing and having the culture revolution that we talk about all the time on CTI episodes All right, and I'm trying to live that and it's not as fun. It's not it's not as cool as being able to work with people one on one It's not that it's not it's hard. It's fucking super hard, bro. It takes everything I got and But I think it matters you know and and and so like there's different ways to think about it and if you're a guy or a girl Who's running a company and you're in that middle size and you're you know relating with your customers and you're enjoying it And you don't want to get any bigger there's there's nothing wrong with that Just make sure that the people that you're dealing with are you're impacting and you're providing and you're creating careers and opportunities for the people who are helping you do this and You know that I don't know. I think it's a cultural I think it's a entrepreneurial cultural obligation for us to Put the right things into the world through our companies to build careers for our people to literally put the mother Fucking shit that's going on in the world on our fucking backs and carry it across the fucking goal on and that's what I'm trying to do I love that man. Yeah, guys any I'm three man. Yeah Well pay to see So Mam it's a
