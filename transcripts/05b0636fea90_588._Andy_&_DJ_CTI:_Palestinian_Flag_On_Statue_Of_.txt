What is up guys it's me and if we settle in this is the show for the real and sick about the lies, the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfucking reality. I said we have Andy and DJ crews the motherfucking in a minute. And that's what we're going to do. That's what CTI stands for stands for crews the internet. This is where we put up topics on the screen. We speculate on what's true on what's not true. And then we talk about how we the people can be the solution to these problems going on in the world. Other times you tune in this is an entrepreneurial success personal development based podcast. Okay. We have Q&A up. This is where you could submit your questions and we answer them. Questions can be submitted one of a couple of different ways. The first way is guys email those questions into ask Andy at Andy for solar.com or if you go to YouTube and you go in the comments section of the Q&A episode which is usually on Mondays and you ask your question down there in the comments will pick some from there as well. Other times we have real talk real talk is five to 20 minutes of me just giving you some real talk. Then we have full length full length is where we're joined by a guest and we have a conversation pretty much like I don't know every other podcast on the planet. And then we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus is where we bring people in who have completed the 75 hard program which is the initial phase of the live hard program which can be found for free at episode 208 on the audio feed. Now we bring people in who have completed the program who were shitty before and who are much better now and then we talk about what was wrong with them before and how they corrected these problems and how you could correct them too. That's the basis of 75 hard versus with all this information that we give out for free we have this thing we called the fee we say pay the fee that means to share the show all right one thing you're going to notice is we don't run ads on the show I don't take money from companies so that they can then leverage me for what I can and can't say I try to keep it real with you guys I try to bring the truth my honest perspective DJ's honest perspective and we don't want to be leverage so in exchange for that because this is not a cheap thing to do I take a large portion of my life and spend a lot of money to produce this show I just ask very simply that you share the show all right so don't be a hoe share the show all right very simple what's up man how you how's it going good yeah so with you she got there oh little chap sticks chapstick or flavor chapstick no chapsticks no so really well the fuck would I have cherry cherries a good one well but why would I you don't like the cherry chapstick bro we can hold on and he will wait a minute no let's talk about bro we can't minute you can oh there's only two good chapsticks one is the burnt bees burnt bees birds bees that's good all right they didn't pay me for that either no you know they're probably much lefties anyway let's be real they probably hate me that's the use of their shit don't use good yeah see I just shows you if you make a great product people gonna use it they don't give a fuck if you don't like it that's all the matter all right so you guys at birds bees you could hate me all you want still using your shit uh secondly um the cherry cherry chapstick the flavor guy you don't like that no what's wrong with you no I can't I just the flavors bro I can't give the flavor stuff now no not at all oh no what you got there uh this is the new screaming freedom mm-hmm first four minutes you drink it screams freedom it's about audio clip over there she's like put like a fucking speaker on every single one like those hallmark parts or every time you open it just fucking scream yeah so the battery dies fucking up my uh yeah quit fucking it up all right all right what's up man hey man listen so I think you know that's definitely not an ad by the way oh well we don't do ads here everybody knows that yeah people like well you're getting paid for it not yet right this is a new thing for us uh make sure you go in your local stores and tell them to carry our shit or fuck off yeah mm-hmm yeah no so dude you know being with you for uh for almost four years now um you know I try to always scour the internet right and uh there's a few conspiracy theories out there of you okay yeah like you know there's like free mason shit oh yeah I get that one hop right yeah um but I think I got to bring something up because this has probably been the most uh like how do I say this like a bro I mean the evidence is there like I mean the the dots do line up oh so it's a it's this conspiracy it's gonna be reality I mean listen it fucking makes sense bro I saw some ones I saw some bro I saw people pulling like old pictures from like fucking ten years ago of like certain hand things yeah they're like this guy's a plant he's free base it yeah dude it's like look how you shake it hands listen I'll let the people decide man but I think this one's pretty convincing okay all right let's hear it so so let's get into it so I think we got it we got to start it off okay because I this is what triggered this it was a headline I saw and I'm immediately like I like look through it I'm like oh shit like this is not good so the headline this is the headline for everybody okay most popular Halloween candies according to Instacart shopping data okay now it seems you know there's nothing too much there the screaming out right but we dive into this article uh and it says October is in full swing somehow many people are eagerly anticipating the spookiest season of the year and with it one of the tastiest two trick-a-treat time right here by loves that um so Instacart did uh did this top ten long they're talking about you in the article bro what they say they said the online grocery delivery and pickup service Instacart revealed top candy cravings among Americans and it definitely contains chocolatey dreams they mentioned you because you're the chocolatey dream yeah I'm fucking that's DJ the chocolatey dream over there I can't believe you brushed over your own that stop being so humble but uh now man I was I was going through this right so they got this top ten list and they calculated it based off the total weight of each type of candy sold on its platform in October 2022 all right now I thought it was a very non-biased list it made sense okay here's the list undefeated Reese's peanut butter cup that's number one right but you scroll down the number well let's just read the list you got yeah Reese's peanut uh Reese's peanut butter cups is number one peanut M&M's number two M&M's tootsie pops twizzlers I fucking love twizzlers twizzlers are good um sour patch kids at number seven but then I got to number eight I'm like man candy corns on the list there's a top ten damn right it is okay now now they took it a step further now this is where the conspiracy theory stuff come I need to put my new rag on okay yep because uh oh shit I think I put this together pretty successfully am I good Joe I think you look good all right now this this is where it gets wild okay oh there we go I shaved that's why it's not sticking yeah it's all that chocolate you drained but they put a map out of like which states you know have these top selections so here's the map okay now my conspiracy is eighties or Washington DC controlled opposition from Alabama because those are the only two places where candy corns well I don't know if you know but that's not Alabama that's Mississippi oh that is fucking Mississippi is that Mississippi the green is Georgia the orange is Alabama okay so Mississippi then the Louisiana so you're DC West Virginia Louisiana huh Mississippi yeah Mississippi yeah that's my conspiracy theory bro okay I'm putting it out there well here's my concern what the fuck is the red lines what is that what do you guys do not there in California never that just makes sense though what is yeah you're some weird-ass people man they're doing it for the environment let's see who like okay I would yeah oh shit yeah you know that you know that shit's terrible whatever nobody likes that shit no that's not like ten florida's got dumbdums that kind of makes sense florida man likes the dumbdums synonymous right uh no offense because I would that's where I belong too um I know where the north likes the the chocolate m&m's you know I think chocolate m&m I think chocolate m&m's are the superior m&m really yeah I like the peanuts yeah I think uh let's see what's New York except New York's got twizzlers there all right they know what's up up there candy corn yeah West Virginia well you know like that kind of makes sense that's what I'm saying yeah like that's where my conspiracy theories like leading me yeah it's not true no all right and even if it was it's still not true all right yeah I'm just saying just saying how do we get how do we get tootsie pops here in the museum I don't I didn't get that one is it tootsie pops uh like the sucker with the yeah yeah the tootsie role is superior to the tootsie pop see I I wouldn't agree with that statement I think both of them are like like below the line issue for me you know I'm saying like well let's be real the top of the list uh-huh Reese's peanut butter cups belong I think that's accurate that is it that is a that is a statement we can all be united in nobody's met of them we can unite against tyranny under the Reese's peanut butter cup bro put those bitches on some mores yeah just anyway man they're they're good as cups they're good as like the Easter ones like the Halloween all of them that matter those piss me off why a little minute it's too much work like all that fucking fool oh you're talking you're like a mini cup a little fuck yeah I can't stand those yeah let's piss you gotta eat like five minutes time that's what I'm saying bro like I'm rap five of them at a time just so that you're ready ready to go just candy corn though it's on the list for as much hate as it gets it gets equal love yeah I don't know man yeah dude it is surprising that it'd be the kind of candy corn flavor industry drink oh man there's a candy corn flavor to whiskey apparently I saw it everybody on the internet has been sent it to yeah like you you guys are sick I got my limits like who hurt you yeah I'm saying why would you do that I fucking love with just tell you the passion of for candy corn is a deep yeah passion yeah yeah it's like beanie babies yeah yeah it's just like people that are into it they're into it man bro do you not you know remember beanie babies no I remember I just didn't know people that were into those man they fucking go their whole they put their whole life savings into those fuckers it's true anyway yeah I just thought this was interesting man yeah it's also I also thought it weird that Hawaii is like forever O'Shea like that's just such a weird so is fucking Texas that's not true yeah like that's just weird this is this this is bullshit you all you call them bullshit on it yeah this whole chart this is bullshit you're gonna fact check this fucking sour patch kids that's trash oh easy hold on that's trash yeah sour patch kids that's trash candy all right now listen that's why I draw the goddamn line all right yeah well I just thought that was interesting man they put it out there I just you know yeah it's definitely natural yeah all right well you heard it here first connect those dots yeah all right well let's get into it man cuz listen we got a lot of shit going on in the world as always so let's make some sense of it for the people yeah guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to anyfacela.com you can find them there you can also drop down in the description below if you're watching on YouTube you can find them linked there as well so with that being said hold on we got breaking news all the dude dude dude dude dude dude dude dude dude dude dude dude dude dude dude what do we got breaking news DJ loses a thousand dollar bet at the fine hold on hold on now oh yeah because if if I recall so yes okay but then if I recall that was a double or nothing there no there wasn't because remember I said double or nothing and you said okay but then we didn't play for like two hours no we played ten minutes later no there was no handshake there oh man yeah oh okay all right I see how you do I give you a pass though okay I give you a pass we'll call it even just come a nice guy bro I was I remember that ship blew up I said fuck like fuck man you think you see I told you I was gonna hit that motherfucker yeah you guys only have to wait to see the video but it's good it's coming out it'll be it'll be good it'll be good yeah yeah so that uh that was a good time man yeah good time great time uh yeah headline number one guys let's get into it headline number one reads uh London is falling anti-Israel protesters raise Palestinian flag on statue of King Charles the first wave cafe how you say they would not because you're I thought you were he spies me in bro cafe and whatever yeah wave scarves around his head beat pro israeli protesters so thousands of Hamas supporters rally sunday and London England and support of Palestinian people after the historic blood bath in Israel less than 10 days ago Hamas supporters blame Israel for the bloody slaughter of Jews and Israel including nearly 300 kids and young adults at a music festival in the desert um the protesters raised the Palestinian flag on the statue of King Charles so I got the video for you and this is gonna make a little bit more sense because you got a long thing here right but here's a video of the clip let's me going around so these protests have been happening we actually have one uh here yesterday oh they yeah um downtown St. Louis um you know we had the the day of jihad this past Friday you know went around you know all the intelligence communities were kind of spinning up around that uh France in France they had to evacuate one of their schools days uh after the day of jihad for a bomb bomb threat but here's the interesting thing with the narratives that we're starting to see coming out of uh the these the leadership of these countries um macron calls for ruthless deportation of all migrants with ties with Islamic extremists from France you know so all these countries that were supposedly welcoming anybody and everyone are now called i thought i thought it was about diversity yeah inclusion let them bring them all i thought it was about escaping tyranny i thought it was about ref ref you jeez i thought it was humanitarian i thought this was asylum seekers start to see a flip hmm and i i think it was i just like the language that he ruthless who's that guy that you know that guy what was that guy's name that's fucking guy what's that guy oh my god with the big mouth he yells at shit on the internet candy corn yeah he loves candy corn what was that guy's name right rain yeah man your teeth look great dude holy shit those motherfucker god dang man that's a million that's a trillion dollar smile right there brother you look fucking great thank you man anyway what was that guy's name Randy he's nice guy any yeah he's it yeah yeah Randy could swell yeah Randy could swell a man could swell like you know he he i think he said i heard him say i thought a few times like hey these people are gonna have to be rounded up and set back where it came from you just didn't use their language so is macron listen to the show i think so i think so yeah shim somehow ruthless deportation like that's acceptable yeah it's acceptable now of five minutes ago when we were saying hey these people got to be deported i was a fucking racist right you know i'm saying i just think i listen we call it out now see it all right well when you guys just gonna start listening to me man i call this shit out three years in advance every single time the world dude you you guys elect me to run shit would be good all right i won't put on one none of this shit but here's cuz i don't give a fuck with anybody says don't care oh there he's the fucking boy yeah cool yeah cool man i'm a jack one too i don't give a shit but yeah man so all this stuff's going on we got uh FBI director Christopher ray as americans should stay vigilant have increased him off threats during the Saturday speech at International Association of Chief of Police conference in San Diego, California ray took time to offer quote heartfelt condolences to the people of Israel and share the outrage i know we all feel at the sheer brutality in disregard for innocent lives there uh Fox News reported um little apocracy too and this is gonna make sense very very shortly um so this head on resinister IDF blast Hamas for stopping gods and civilians from evacuating right i'm saying that quote Hamas is both issued warnings to their civilians not to evacuate and when people didn't listen to those warnings of Hamas they have actually stopped civilians having to stop convoy of gods and citizens trying to flee from the situation IDF spokesperson lieutenant Colonel Jonathan uh Siriccus explained in the daily briefing sure it's a social media this is the same guy that compared the israel Hamas situation to our 9-11 in pro harbory right now here's the interested thing a lot of people got upset about that yeah well they started they started trying to play the proportion game the name ratio yeah listen bro i don't give a shit about that i'm talking about actual human beings we're not doing fucking math half y'all don't even know how to do math you're over here telling me two plus two equals fucking five now so don't give a shit about your math we're talking about actual human deaths yeah well also the meaning too i'm just dude i'm tired of it like dude dude the hypocrisy to look past what's happening in our inner cities in terms of the murders that happen in this in our country on our soil and care about a few thousand people across the the earth but don't give two fucks about these people down the road i can't stand i can't i can't even take you serious like you want to know what racist is that's fucking racist because most of those people that are being murdered happen to be black now level march and you know support the burdensome shit up all right dude i'm yeah just whatever but here's the interesting so so you got israel saying that ossa's not letting people leave at the same time this report's coming out saying that gods a aid stuck as Egypt says israel not cooperating so all of the humanitarian aid that Egypt's trying to offer israel's not letting come in mm-hmm it's just a little weird now that's going to make sense here very very shortly but the more latest updates we got on the situation see i heard the other side of that too i've heard both that Gaza was stopping civilians from from leaving and depending on where you read i've also heard that the surrounding countries are closing the border not allowing it not allowed in the man yes i've heard both yeah it's hard to know what the truth is because it depends on who owns the media exactly exactly well i mean so the the report that uh israel's not cooperating that's roiders i mean they're they're typically pretty pretty spot on yeah when i don't know man but stuff i don't know man um but the latest updates is that the u.s uh this head on means us tells two thousand troops to be prepared to deploy to the middle east the second aircraft carrier strike groups steams for the eastern Mediterranean and that comes right as uh israel uh i'm sorry i ran just issued a very ominous threat to the united states and deadline warning to israel with their ira rand's foreign minister issued a threat on sunday said uh that the united states would see heavy losses and warned israel with the deadline to end its military actions towards gaza now this whole situation about you know hamas not letting people out israel not letting stuff in this article i had i had to dig for this right this headline and it read the headline for me watchdog groups sorrows foundation funds pro-homos organizations watchdog groups say sorrows foundation funds pro-homos organizations now does that make sense how does yes make sense to me wait so you're telling me because jord aren't they ju yes wow and they're supporting why how why would that be how does that why why do you think that is oh it's obviously intentional right it's intentional the all of this fight and see that's one of those people don't get understand like they see these things as this conflict where there's this one side and this one side right like they're both going they're not understanding that both sides like this is all intentional stuff that's being orchestrated by a few elite that are paying both sides to do this because the people who stand to benefit from both of these conflicts the amount of money the amount of resources the amount of power that that that stands to be benefited from these conflicts that we see all over the place man it all stems back to the same exact small group of tyrants they want this shit and that's how I see it yeah well what else you got yeah I mean I mean and the letter so this this came out of america's watchdog right so they they and they wrote this letter to open source foundations Alex sorrows the son who's now the chair of it but they found about seven or eight different organizations that open source is completely funding who has stand out and and and completely openly supported him us and saying that their donations have gone straight to the bloodstream of those who seek to exterminate Jews and push Israel into the sea so it seems like there's this almost like awakening within side of even the Jewish community are realizing like hey there's some interesting weird things that are happening how do they make sense of this I've seen a lot of Jewish people and a lot of Israeli people um comes speaking out against the state of Israel yeah obviously it's it's actually pretty bizarre and I think it's also important for us to delineate between like I said on last week's show if you didn't catch it there's a difference just like there's a difference here between the american people in the american government I think every single american listening to this show understands that our government's not representing us properly right now right like they're not doing our bidding they're not doing what is in our interests and we're all pissed off about it because we're all feeling pain over it yeah and we have to keep that in mind when we look at other countries when we look at Israel we have to understand that most of the Jewish population that lives in Israel is not represented by the Jew elite uh people who are in control of Israel you see what I'm saying absolutely so and and and same goes for the people of Iran the same goes for the people of Russia the same goes everywhere like we're dealing argument as universal yes we're dealing with humanity who is represented by some people who are not part of the same group and we have to keep that in mind when we talk about these people right like when we talk about Palestine and we talk about Palestinians most Palestinians are not Hamas okay when we talk about the um Zionist Jew elite class right that runs the world economic forum or you know is in control of Israel right now which by the way up until a week ago most of the citizens fucking hate it all right we're about to out there we have to understand that this is not as simple as just saying it's Jewish people or it's Palestinians or it's Russians or that's a generalization they want us to have so that we will buy into the efforts to destroy each other all right so it's just not true yeah okay now when we look at why soros what has the actions of George soros produced over the last 40 years destruction death chaos all right and for whatever reason we don't really know but the but the main point is anything this dude puts his hands on is bad for us and that's been proven over and over again so when I see this and I see that he's funding not as a speculation but I'm just connecting dots logically when I see this thing where he's funding Hamas all right Hamas attacks Israel Israel allowed the attacks to happen regardless of what you say they were allowed to do these attacks okay they have the highest surveillance capacity of any country in the history of earth at any time with the best technology the the most they are known for this this is what they are known for they're not about it they're not known for the most powerful army they're known for the best surveillance and they're known for sharing that surveillance with us and those techniques with us over the course of time that have helped make our cities safer okay so there's good and bad here all right but there's no fucking way that they didn't know this was happening it's impossible no all right so they allowed this to happen so the question becomes why did the Israeli government allow Hamas to attack Israel citizens these are three different groups of people right all right the reason is in my opinion is there's a few reasons but the main reason that I believe that that has caused this attack to be able to happen is that the this narrative that quote unquote elite Jewish people are controlling a lot of these mechanisms that are fucking up the world the banking system world economic form right and keep in mind this is not anti-semitism this is pointing out there are people who are criminals who happen to be Jewish who are all working together yeah to create this disruption yeah and that's being exposed and what's also been exposed is how the ADL has used quote unquote the term hate speech to deflect any criticism of these actions that was exposed for the three weeks leading up to this all right you have Netanyahu who was basically ready to be overthrown two weeks ago now people are supporting him so their their their their narrative was crumbling okay so what better way to garner support for what they're doing then to stage themselves as the victim of these attacks were real people their citizens that they're supposed to love and care about and be one with are actually killed okay that's the first reason the second reason is and we have to think a few steps ahead why would George Soros why would these people fund Hamas to attack their own people why would they do that well what has the what has the open society foundation typically what has been their mission across all in Europe and now in the United States is to diversify the population open borders and create a more united globe right globalization which is communist by the way and when we think about the destruction that's been done in France in Ireland all through Europe with the migrant crisis all right now to the point where Macron is like now I fucked out I'm done with this shit okay and he's been a supporter of that for years and years and years think how bad it's had to have gotten for him to be like no I'm not doing that anymore okay now we have all these things in play but ultimately over the course of the last you know 20 years we've seen things come into play we've seen things like political correctness don't say this even if it's true because it offends people okay we've seen things like participation trophy there's no no ability in actually being the best showing up is enough removes the ability and the understanding of competition the first part of political correctness is to remove the truth okay then we go into silent majority don't don't don't talk about politics because it's rude just be a part of the silent majority aka don't talk about it because if you talk about it other people will join you all right so be quiet all right then we have cancel culture cancel culture if someone says something out of line crush them take everything take their bank take their list take their that and all the while while they've implemented all of these societal weapons onto our culture they've started to create scenarios where crazy shit's happening that people are afraid to speak about right the borders are wide open the crime in the cities all of our money being sent to Ukraine our strategic oil being at zero our money being inflated etc etc etc etc we go down the list okay so in short the destruction of the American culture now let's think about the pure numbers here all right there's 14 million Jewish people in the world there's 1.8 billion Arab Muslims and then there's I think another billion non Arab Muslims all right so you have 14 million people verse 3 billion people okay that's 14 people verse 3,000 people and scale down numbers just so you can understand all right so Hamas attacks Israel Hamas won't allow the citizens to leave Israel invades the ground attack and by default kills a ton of citizens creates a Palestinian genocide all right now what do you think the rest of the Arab countries are going to think about that they're going to be upset okay and we're seeing this in the streets this is what we're seeing everywhere now do you think George Soros knows this or doesn't know this no I think you need this okay I agree yeah so what is this going to lead to well it's going to lead to Iran getting in like they're saying okay and then it's going to lead to all the other countries that Iran is aligned with Russia China the bricks alliance all of these people siding together on one side which a lot of those countries has already come out and said we support Palestine all right now America and America's government is very pro-Israel okay but America's people are starting to realize holy shit we're gonna get drug into this fucking world war and what's going to happen as a result of this is likely and not maybe maybe not likely but likely a worldwide conflict because of this all right while we're at our absolute weakest threat which is it which who was involved in that the same guys who were funding Hamas so we're talking about a chain of events that could potentially end up with America being conquer which I believe is the ultimate goal which is what I said for years and years and years okay and this doesn't have to do with the Jews or whatever to fuck you guys want to say this whole defense of anti-Semitic by calling people out is over okay it's over we're going to call you out if you're a fucking criminal we don't give a shit if you're black or you're white or you're Jewish or you're something else this identity politics game is done we are hurting here in America our economy is shit our crime is crazy all of these things that are going on that are destroying our way of life you're not going to continue to shame us into pointing out or into staying silent when things are fucked up we're going to point them out so when it comes to what's actually happening what I believe is actually happening that could be wrong I hope I am wrong but what I believe is actually happening is a setup for Israel to kill as many Palestinians as possible and then for the backlash to create almost a second holocaust situation that we have to get involved in that ends up destroying America in the long run yeah I don't think I don't think that any of these guys Klaus Schwab Soros any of these people I don't think they give two fucks about the average Jewish citizen they do not care and and Jewish citizens just like American citizens or Israel citizens are brainwashed into thinking that those people actually care about them just like we assume here a large majority of our country still assumes that the Biden administration is working in our interests they are not all right so you know it's very dangerous it's very complicated there's a lot to it and you can call people the names and you can say they're wrong and you could say this but ultimately everybody has to take a step back and ask how is this going to affect you how is this going to affect your family how is this going to affect your future and for the future of humanity if this continues this is not good for anyone no all this is doing a setting up the hate for our grandchildren you know I'm saying like like do our future grandkids will be fighting each other because of this yeah what's left of them you know yeah I mean whatever they're allowed to fucking whatever crumbs that are left for them and it's like you know my my thing is like okay so as an American citizen what what what actions should we be doing whether that's vocally whether that's coming because like here's a thing like you know I write a laugh and you know in the 1970s with like the anti-war hippie movement instead right but like that's kind of what we need right now bro like we we are we need more than that we're in no position we we need our entire military to do their job and uphold the constitution and stand with the people of America and stop doing the bidding of corrupt tyrants who are compromised by other countries and start doing the bidding of the American people that's what we need yeah we need the military leaders who sign an oath to represent the people of this country loyal to the constitution to fulfill that oath the mechanisms are already in place people just aren't following them you know that's what we need and do I think that'll happen I think if that were to happen I think if that was going to happen it would have already happened it would have happened with COVID it would have happened with the election I think our high level military leaders are compromised just like our president is and I think there's a ton of good men and women 99.9% of the people in the military are people that think they're doing the right thing and they think they're serving the American people by serving those people in Washington DC but they're actually going to end up getting us killed and so what needs to happen is our military leaders need to come together and say we're not fucking doing this we're not going to sacrifice any more American lives for the lives of people 50,000 miles away or how much a fuck far it is right we're not doing that like we have our own problems here and we're about to get our military decimated by all the militaries across the world and then what what's the next step after that that's the thing what happens after that what's the next step after that are you are you listeners going to send your kids to go die for this cause I don't think so and so now would be the time for you to stand up and be absolutely unshakably vocal and firm in your stance on this that we are not fucking going to war we're not fighting any wars for any motherfuckers over there or in Washington DC anymore it's mass non-compliance and needs to start with the military and he's to start with the sheriff's offices and the police and the and the fucking political leaders on the state level that shit starts to happen we might be able to fix this but if it doesn't we're going to see a war like we've never seen before and when they talk about what's left afterwards and ain't going to be much no and you're your whole dreams and all your dreams for your life and everything are fucking over and that's real shit and we're at the inflection point this is why I've done this show for so long this is why I continue to come on here and talk about these things because I've been trying to avoid this from happening and here we are it's on the fucking doorstep and you know when we think about what happened during not 2019 when did the drama of 2019 start up the start in October of 2019 well it's October of 2023 and this is going to be built into some lasting conflict that becomes this major thing I told you guys it was going to be a war or a pandemic the only part I fucked up is I thought they'd do it before midterms but they haven't now they're doing it before the actual election and this will be their reason to either steal the election again or not have it at all and dude if you're if you do not stand up and you do not stand firm and you do not fucking voice this you are going to have to live with the idea that you contributed a downfall and the conquering of America. Guys jump in on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments using hashtag ring leader and let us know what you guys think. The Jewish population is 16.1 million okay not 14. Alright I got it wrong it's 16 million not 14 million so it's 16 versus 3000. Alright thank you. Alright guys let's keep this cruise on the move we got uh before we get to hit line number two let's cruise from comments. Alright yeah cruise comment guys today is brought to you by at J Bulldog 104 they say quote can we take a moment to think about how organized and plan the Israel conflict really was the day after the attack there were pro-Palestinian protests with professionally made banners and signs how do they get those overnight that's one of the biggest things I've noticed in all of this. Uh oh you're noticing things you're not supposed to notice bro we're silent majority yeah yeah you're you're noticing things don't notice things otherwise you're you know a racist anti-Semite if you notice anything it's a great point yeah don't talk about it or you're fucking big it right join the current thing otherwise you're a piece of shit what side are you on oh no side you're a piece of shit yeah so uh dude it was a great observation by this person absolutely great it's the same thing they did with with the rest of you crane what right bro I think before it was about February of 2021 you know January of 2021 people could even tell you what the Ukrainian flag looked like bro listen we're being fucking flooded we're all being played over and over and over again and they're using these societal tools that I just mentioned in the last segment cancel culture political correct and silent majority censorship on the internet you know the removal of competition they destroyed American culture now they're actually trying to destroy America and if you guys don't fucking sack the fuck up and start being actual adults and realizing that it's you now it's not the forefathers it's not your grandpa it's not your dad it's you and it's your time to stand the fuck up unless our men do that we're fucking done and that's real shit your kids will not have the chances that you've had and you have to be honest with yourself you may be saying oh well I didn't have much of a chance real talk bro you fucked off most of your life okay your kids aren't gonna even have the chance they're gonna be slaves and bigger slaves and you could ever imagine if they're even allowed to survive so the atrocities that are going to come from what we're talking about are of biblical proportions we're talking about the mass slaughter and genocide of massive amounts of people on the earth for different reasons mostly because they were born a certain way Jewish Muslim Christian you see what I'm saying like we're dealing with shit yeah and it's all being spurred on and having gas poured on the fire by the global elite class that's our administration that's the administrations of all the NATO countries that's I mean bro it's it's the richest most powerful people in the world they're trying to kill the rest of us like when they get on stage and talk about depopulization you you understand they're not talking about them yeah so how do you do that yeah okay well you could do it through Bill Gates said it vaccines you can do it through pandemics or you could say fuck it and we'll just do it through a war every generation of American men gets sent to war why why is that it couldn't be because if we had powerful strong leaders and men here in this country our government that's so corrupt wouldn't be able to operate could it be could it be that because that's what I think it is and I don't think it's a coincidence that every single generation of men face some sort of high casualty conflict that has nothing to do with their freedom we get on a plane or a boat and we go over there and we get fucking killed and it's our strongest it's our best and it's our our our most healthy male population yes our page they use our own patriotism and our own love of each other and this country against us why it's because they know that if they don't remove the strongest men from society the strongest men from society will eventually revolt and take their country back and this is no different yeah yeah it's the it's like the annual checkup they just trim the bushes a little bit yeah just to keep everything in check man yeah so I know guys just want to take the time saying thank you thank you for being real last fans we see it we appreciate it and don't forget to

life yeah and you know maybe it'll give you some perspective about me actually doing the work that I do here you know what I'm saying like I would much rather be doing that other stuff and if we would all just get together and speak up and stand up together we could all go do the other stuff and stop worrying about this shit yeah absolutely man absolutely guys let's keep this cruise moving we got headlight number two headlight number two reads trump has narrow gag order imposed on them by federal judge overseeing 2020 elections the version case shocking shocking bro you know I think I'll say this real quick like you got to be a very conceited person a very like power struck person right to like actually use your position your position of authority to literally silence someone you're missing it if he was so full of shit and it was such bull shit let them talk why don't you just let them talk because it would expose himself for being a dumbass okay if you ever want to know who's in control look at who you can't criticize look at who you can't point at look at who you can't say you know people come out and say things and then you know they say oh while you can't say this or they'll take your bank account or they'll take your this or they'll take your that we don't do that the next day dudes bank accounts gone they don't have a job like what the fuck broke how can you guys not see what's going on here man man I mean like it's not shocking we don't control the the we don't control that what yeah you know next day yeah wall street black black list fucking Harvard students yeah right whoa yeah we don't do that kind of stuff we don't control the baby we don't we don't black list people we don't we know next day bank account gone we didn't do that yeah we have no control over dude here's we here's what's happening people are seeing it and it's dangerous trying to control it's dangerous which only exposes it even more yeah they're seeing they're seeing the communism for real people are seeing it yeah man it's no different than this but here's the thing so I mean okay cool gag order got it right but another shocking development in this Trump situation oh first let me quote the judge real quick and this is from CNN Trump this head language quote Trump does not have the right to say and do exactly what he pleases judge Chuchin says while issuing her gag order yeah I just like come on man yeah well that's a violation of the first amendment that is the reason for the first amendment we're not communist no don't criticize me but don't talk about us yeah yes free free America though democracy just don't say it out loud but did you see this though man I thought this was an interesting development I think this is actually gonna this this this is I don't know how big this is gonna be but for some I just is speaking to me for some reason did you see this this headline reads Trump sues ex British spy over dossier containing shocking and scandalous claims so he's actually he sue and steal yeah so a lawyer for Donald Trump told a London judge Monday the ex president plans approved that quote shocking and scandalous claims about him and a largely discredited report by a farmer British spy were false and harmed his reputation Trump has sued the company founded by Christopher steel who created a dossier in 2016 that contained rumors and uncorroborated allegations about Trump that he ruptured in a political storm just before he was inaugurated Trump is seeking damages from orbus business intelligence for allegedly violating British data protection laws um stills firm is seeking to have the case thrown out and the judge said she would rule at a later date after the hearing after hearing argument in London's high court I don't know what the implications of this is man but I just feel like it's bigger than what what I'm able to see right now do you I mean did you you got anything on this um yeah this dude should be hung well it's funny you say that because it's exactly what Trump said oh he did in Trump's way what do you say yeah so so Trump uh his quote uh Trump Trump this CNN no AP news article still um Trump it called for still to be extradited tried and thrown in jail yeah I was called and called him a low life and a sleaze by he shouldn't be thrown in jail he should be executed period no and so should everybody else who went along with this this whole thing people don't understand what happened here they needed something to attack him with okay so I just saw this clip on the internet today of of San Francisco billionaires basically admitting that they were wrong about the little teleconference yeah the zoom call thing yes yeah and they were talking about how they voted for Hillary and they bought the they bought the bullshit about Trump and they realized now that they're wrong and though why do you think they realize now they're wrong because they're getting crushed by economics right they're getting crushed financially okay and this man Christopher Steele and Hillary Clinton colluded together to make up a fake document that said that Donald Trump colluded with Russia and you could think whatever you want to think about Donald Trump but most of the reason you think the shit that you think about Donald Trump is because they set it on the news based on this document that that was authorized by the Obama administration so for what is that seven years now our country has been propagated with this fake shit about Donald Trump being some sort of Russian spy so for four years from 2016 to 2020 all we heard on the news every single day from the MSM talking heads was that Trump was a Russian asset that he was a trader that he was this he was that he was this he was that and our media shoved that down our fucking throats okay and because of that we've argued for seven years with our friends with our families with our neighbors our peace has been disrupted our quality of life has been stolen from us all because a few people the Clintons and fucking Christopher Steele and a few other people in the media who don't want someone from the outside coming into the political spectrum literally lied to the the world and the American people and created this contentious disruption that has legitimately torn America apart at the seams all right how many arguments have you had about Donald Trump how many of your those of you that support him how many of your family members have made fun of you talk shit said you're dumbass ripped you up and down refused to have you over etc etc etc all of that shit is from this document every bit of it every bit of it okay and because it was on the news it was true so these people don't deserve to go to jail they deserve to be killed all right because there was intent there there was intent and the intent was so damaging that we are literally our country is on life support now because of this whole thing these people deserve to be made an example of in the public eye for people for hundreds of years to understand you cannot do this shit okay that's my personal opinion not jail execution if I was elected president that would happen 100% okay which is probably ironically why I won't get elected but I'm sorry these people are evil these people are stealing see you have to look at the right way you a lot of you guys are in your 20s and in your 30s I'm in I'm 44 okay every year that goes by I start to realize holy shit it's actually happening right like I'm getting older like I'm starting to value my time for what it is and while a lot of young people don't realize is that your time that has been wasted on this and your your country that's been damaged by this this is time that you're not getting back you can't get it back so for the last seven years our entire country's been disrupted by this this is not jail this is execution this is the same thing with COVID COVID was a fucking total criminal play executed by a few key people who forced and intimidated and coerced and brad and blackmail people into going along with it all right that caused immense amounts of destruction immense amounts of death unnecessary suffering the biggest transfer of wealth from one class to the elite class that perpetrated these crimes this is not jail bro this is nerve burgl 2.0 this is unforgivable shit unforgivable unforgivable that's my personal take that's my take you could disagree you could say whatever you want that's what I think no I don't these people deserve death they deserve the death of a tyrant and the reason that we put tyrants to death this way is so that it ceases to happen again and again and again because a limited power corrupts in unlimited ways okay when these people go into power and they are not afraid that they could potentially get beheaded beheaded or hung or electrocuted or shot they do shit like this and so the fear of the people needs to be reinserted into the political class in a very real way that's my take oh man guys tell us what you guys think on this hashtag silence down in the comments let us know so that being said man let's get into our third and final headline headline number three has on number three reads Jordan flips key votes for speaker live coverage Jim Jordan's on the run man a house Republicans are aiming to hold a full house vote Tuesday that's today when you guys are listening on electing the speaker but their nominee house judiciary committee chairman Jim Jordan is still working to lock down support Jordan won the nomination with 124 votes within the GOP conference and then claimed 152 votes when members were asked if they were to support him on the house floor leave they come short of the 217 votes he needs to get the gaville but Jordan has been working to sway those skeptical of the fast talking hard line of high and Republican at the same time the crisis in Israel has not abated and the United States is barreling towards his next shutdown deadline all by the house closes in on two weeks without a speaker and apparently issued a statement to he's saying Jordan on Monday indicated that he would proceed to a house floor vote for speaker at noon on Tuesday regardless of whether he has the 217 votes he needs locked down quote we will go to the floor tomorrow Jordan to see in in on Monday quote is not about pressuring anybody it's just about we've got to have a speaker McCarthy's even chimed in saying he feels Jim Jordan will be a very good choice from a house speaker Kevin McCarthy said he is confident representative Jim Jordan out of Ohio will have the votes to become a successor he told Fox Fox News Brian kill me on Monday ahead of the crucial vote quote I feel very good about where Jim Jordan is at he has been an integral part of our team when we took the majority helping us get the majority quite you told I feel like this stuff's also being drug out for some reason yeah I don't get what what's so hard about what do you mean what do you mean without a speaker they can make no progress in a Republican control house it's very simple no no no nothing on the impeachment correct nothing on yeah that's what this is about okay you have a lot of people who are in the Republican party who are actually operatives from the Democrat party yep we call them rhinos yeah because they're Republican in name only yep there are republics and jeopardy bro republican in name only means exactly what it sounds like no it means they've run as republican but they hold viewpoints or connections politically financially with the the democratic party yeah all right which is basically what's called we call the unit party which is just the group of corrupt people who are in there to siphon off money from every single war and every single tragedy that is imposed upon us for their own wealth and benefit okay so you know like dude our whole our whole government is totally fucked it's totally fucked yeah so you know for far too long we looked away and they when we looked away they fucking did what they do and now we're dealing with it yeah do you are you hopeful about gym Jordan you think he's well I don't trust any of these people man at this point I don't trust anybody anymore I wrote like when I said that on the show last Monday yeah or last Tuesday I said dude I don't trust them all whatever I've said about them in the past I'm wiping the slate clean that goes for everybody it goes for Trump to it goes for everybody okay until we have some real leadership until we have a real bad motherfucker that comes in and actually fucking does shit not just talks a bunch of shit I don't believe any of them Trump should have put Hillary Clinton jail when he was in there first time all right that we shouldn't even be here this shit should have all came out it should have all been exposed COVID should have never happened and who's suffered we've suffered we've suffered so until we get someone from us in there I don't believe anybody I like what Jim Jordan says I think he says a lot of really good stuff but they're not getting anything done and so I don't I don't trust them dude I trust Eric Schmidt because I know Eric Schmidt I know him personally I've looked him in his eye I've shook his hand he's the only motherfucker up there I trust the only one period so that's how I feel I don't I don't believe that our current legislative group of politicians has has very much I would say 80% of the people up there are for themselves and there's a few people who have gotten in who care about the people but those people are the people that they make look like they're crazy or they're unintelligent or they're stupid or they're a redneck or they're just a dumbass right because the political elite class you have to understand they look their nose down at us they assume they're smarter than us they assume they're better than us they assume all these things but in reality these people are not that they are not our best they are not our brightest they are not our most intelligent if they were a most intelligent and a capitalistic society they would be out here making money as opposed to stealing it washing in DC it wouldn't have to be right so they were either born into it or they come from that you know blue blood Ivy League stock where it's an actual profession not a act of service and so we have a lot of realignment to do in the government in this country and it's not going to come until there's an actual cultural revolution this is why I talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion because politics is downstream of culture and till culture demands citizens to actually go in there and hold these people accountable it's not going to happen what do you think's going to happen you think they're going to hold themselves accountable right are they going to put themselves in jail sorry guys are they going to pull themselves out of these corrupt positions where they're making hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of their career no fucking way you wouldn't either okay that's why it takes a very special kind of person a person who actually really does care about their fellow man a person who actually understands that this is a position of service not a position of entitlement and greed and you know financial wealth so I don't trust any of them I think they're all full of shit and until I see someone go in there and actually make some real difference I mean they're all kind of the same to me at this point you know by Matt Gates does some good shit you know he's holding the line there's a couple others but these are the people that they make look crazy on the internet you know so I don't know yeah guys tell us what you guys think using hashtag and the winner is down in the comments let us know uh so that being said man that was all three headlines cool it's time yeah time for the final segment of the show as always thumbs up or dumb as fuck that's where we bring a headline up they'll get one of those two options so with that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads martial artists

rude dickulous okay new york post all right they probably just made this shit up anyway let's be real yeah it is them so they say that uh the former police officer who reportedly trains in brazilian jiu jitsu have reportedly been walking by the river when he noticed that one of his dogs hutchie was nowhere to be found surely thereafter both the reason for their strange behavior and hutchies were about simultaneously became crystal clear meloney reported reportedly look at the river and saw a seven foot tall kangaroo with its arms submerged in the water all of a sudden quote hutchie came up gasping for air water spilling out of his mouth and screaming his head off the ex copper counted i was uh quote i was like are you kidding me explain meloney who spring into action to rescue him from his deadly interspecies baptism however the rua appears to retaliate by striking striking back with its clawed paws knocking meloney's phone into the drink and causing the screen to go blurry and then black like in a found footage horror film um all the while the sounds of interspecies scuffle continue in the dark until the Aussie retrieves his phone which shows hutchie safely on the riverbank yeah i mean listen me those kind of ruse bro i would have punched him too bro no wool shay you don't fuck with my dogs dude he grabs odys what's happening i'll kill him yeah i'll fucking kill that thing

of killing things that that don't need to be killed it's just not yeah it's just not for me dude yeah my good you know now if that line were to come and it has to be crossed is what it is you know it's probably a good skill for me to learn how to do but i'm pretty sure if things were fucked up i'd figure it the fuck out i've watched enough of your mother fucking videos bro you shoot the mother fucker you take it skin off you cut the meat off you throw the fucking shit on a grill and you fucking eat it oh you missed a step drain the blood out nope what puts a salt and pepper yeah yeah
