It's podcast time daytime. You know what it is, bro You need some candy corn. We got you. You know, I'm out of respect for your place I'm not slapping that off the table right now. I really want to When you were talking about how much you loved it. I would never say that. Yeah, I would never admit to loving anything actually It's you're like candy car. No, I'm not actually a big sweet guy in general me neither I ate like eight expert breakfast and a bunch of avocado And shit. I don't know. I just what when you have when can you find time to even eat sweet shit anymore? I don't know what you like what you did when you eat it like Typically it's when My favorite like I'd like if I'm in Italy or something I'll go get pastries in the morning Just because it's made out of real food and not what Italy crack bullshit. Yeah, and I like Let's see what are like red velvet cake, I guess But just chocolate cake was that it's red. Yeah, cuz I can't if it's brown that you know my racism kicks in I can't like not get and do that right my still you're your biotic Stomach. Yeah, yeah, yeah, even my yeah, even my gut is racist can't help himself Mine too. I like that and like Canola like canola and chill like that. I like Italian desserts. Yeah, mostly it's just like gross bullshit these days Yeah, I bet if I lived in a country that made real food. I would like dessert more They definitely don't hear yeah, I mean get a good fucking pastry. No, you can't lie You get a pastry here. It's been frozen. It's been fucking comes out of a yeah, it goes in a Michael like it's not right gross Yeah, pre-manufactured bullshit. Yeah There's one place on the South side you go to where on Cherokee it's What's it called shot him out? It's a man. I don't know how to pronounce it to Mexican place Bibi Boppery. Oh Mexican. Yeah, it's Mexican like it's like Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada I'm not fluent so Who know L pastrio? Something like that, but like fuck they get going at like four in the morning. There's another play. No, there's a couple there We got a couple good places. Yeah, of course What's the one over in Sula by D.B.s. It's across the street from D.B.s I don't fucking know. I don't leave my house, bro. I know, but like I mean I feel like you would have known it We got we got some there's got to be a couple. Yeah, but it that's the thing right is we see exception that proves a rule You have to like really think hard about a place that serves actual food. That's fucked up. Yeah, it's real what do you think's gonna happen with this? If if Trump gets in and you know RFK starts deregulating the food industry. Oh fuck. That'd be pretty awesome. I'm into it. I'm into it. Yeah, I mean they're like It's very easy to answer this question Imagine DMV or TSA employees in charge of anything. Yeah, and then your food of Anything right like why would you ever want that? I don't think any reasonable person wants that all the TSA employees No offense, but they used to be working in McDonald's and shit and now they're in charge of national security like come on It's not protected anybody from anything. It's nonsense Like they're patting down little old ladies and shit. I'm like, oh, yeah, is that the threat? It look if little old ladies take our country down. We fucking deserve it. Yeah, no shit If it gets so bad that they're coming after us. It's like all right. I guess maybe we need to revisit some things Well, dude, it is crazy to think about like after 9-11 how much that changed It wasn't just 9-11 it was that what's his name Richard Reed? Yeah, Bob and mother and Detroit Yeah, he was in 2000. That was right after 9-11. It was 2002 or three. It was like a year later Yeah, or two years later. Yeah, he after that that's when you started having to take your fucking shoes off Yeah, like really you guys can't come up with some tech where I can keep my fucking clothes on and you see if I've got a bomb Well, they haven't now. Yeah, I got that Not now not now DC has had radiological detectors and bomb detectors on every Highway into DC for fucking 25 years now. That's existed for almost a decade. Yes. You know the worst. How do they how does that work? I have no I don't know I mean it's I don't know the tech I just know that it's been there and existed for a long-ass time so driving in there They would be able to detect if you had explosives. If it was a large enough signature Yeah, obviously if you just had like a fucking MAD in your pocket, it's not gonna pick that up. Yeah Where's part about the TSA? You can't if you put your hands Yeah, talk to Jason Paul Pierre or Pierre Paul whatever no shit, bro. He's got a fucking He blew his fucking fingers off by these still rich though, and he's still I mean, he's still playing I think it's actually or maybe he's my first year already in play. Yeah, he may have retired just this He's a stunt because he was definitely playing last year. Yeah, yeah, I mean he's a big ass dude fast too Where's part about the TSA shoe shit man? Is that like the area where you have to stay in once you take your shoes off It's always fucking dirty. Yeah, yeah, like it just feels like I could just it just feels fucking you know what you should do is just start clipping your toenails right there If they're gonna make it fucking uncomfortable or we can both play that game of the fucker You know what I can't stand about the fucking airports bro is how everybody that goes there thinks it's our living room Oh my god, bro get the fucking out of the way ever since they started doing that take your shoe off shit now You get like all these people wearing their pajamas as a fucking airport Like we used to be a country with pride like it used to be a big deal even when I was a kid like you go fly on an airplane It was a big fucking deal you wore nice clothes. You didn't you know now. It's like People wearing the fucking pajamas walk around barefoot. They got their own pillow and their little fucking rainbow Strawberry shortcake fucking blank like it's with with juicy on the fucking butt. Yeah, whatever the fuck and I like I have a shower in a fucking month Yeah, so you know it's real I think Trump should put me in charge of TSA and here's what's gonna happen one The pre-check line is now a soup Nazi line remember soup Nazi yeah back for you you make one fucking mistake You're done for a year. Yeah, you can fly you you like all you made somebody wait in line because you weren't prepared All the rules have been the same for about 10 years for each I could since it existed leave all your shit in your bag Don't take your shoes off just get the fuck out of the way. Yeah, if you can't handle those simple instructions You got to go to the peasant line get it fuck out. That's it right and also when you're walking in public Stay to the right for sure. Oh my just like the fucking freeway man What is it with people I don't I don't understand and people that are like walking slow two or three deep I Just think what we should change we should this is the 28th amendment to the Constitution. I get the fuck that dude up I'm walking the wrong way That's two different guys though. So you're talking about People walking the wrong way or people walking the right way either way So is that like it's a different level is that there's amendments right? This is what we call the the use of force continuum as he is aware If you're walking the wrong way, you're probably an immigrant right It's not it's it's never fucking white people doing that shit or Mexican people that live in America doing that shit It's always Indian dudes doing that shit. It is the fucking Indians get him Get him. What is that Z-sharn? The flat have you ever been to India or know anybody that's been to India? He's from India. Did you actually grow up there? So traffic laws that's not a thing right they don't use turn signal It's it's the Middle East is like this to they just like I'll kind of like hey, I'm going that way Bump bump bump and they'll just let that's it's not rude or anything Z-sharn how many how many tell truth What's the most people that you've had on a scooter? Six on one But it's not that's true But it's not rude like to cut somebody off and beep your horn. That's not rude. That's just how it's done Right so they come here and nobody tells them people to yell at them Why is this white dude yelling at how the fuck did you have six people on a scooter? Is that the real answer? I know you're not lying Just look at the video how many people you can put on a scooter and you can fight six no dogs I do like that when they have the dog on the front of the scooter That's pretty fun. I would do that too, but I don't have a scooter So what are you gonna do? How the fuck you gonna write six people on a fucking scooter? Hey, man, you got to get somewhere, you know, I don't know how it has the power to get my sister's gonna be fucked Hey, don't worry about that. Do the FBI's all over him already. Yeah, this sounds like her bad Like he's a domestic star of a pretty good. Yeah, so you what whatever. Yeah I did find out a couple weeks ago that I'm on the DOD's disinformation list. Oh really? You're you're definitely on it too. I didn't ask but I can I can pretty much guarantee you're on it Yeah, but see that's what happens when you tell the fucking real shit Yeah, there we go Is that how you guys did it? How do I like that? Hey That's seven people on that's pretty dope. That's impressive. I like that. See that's that's we don't do hard stuff in America And we talked when somebody comes here who's been doing hard shit They're all right by America way you fucking immigrant that Americans couldn't fucking do that because you're too fat That's true. Yeah, 38% of Americans are diabetic or in pre diabetes right now. Yeah, it's not great Which is back to the original question before we went full retard here I Don't know about Like the vaccine stuff is interesting to me the food stuff is pretty simple each shit that existed 200 years ago If it didn't exist 200 years ago and you eat it you're a fucking idiot the end right but The vaccine stuff is particularly interesting because The people who would consider themselves vaccine centrist I guess or reason bliss or whatever you want to call it they still carry water for the MMR vaccine for polio vaccine when it's been demonstrated I mean Rogan talks about the shit all the time not that he's the only source for this but the you can watch The and you can probably pull this up actually the amount of illness and death from polio was already flatlined way before that vaccine came Right and now the only Polio that ever happens anymore is from the fucking vaccine. Mm-hmm sounds familiar. Yeah. Yeah, yeah same thing with MMR The measles mumps and whatever the fuck what I can't remember the R1 thing. It's retarded measles mumps and what the fuck yeah, it's it's Merck and they've been sued 80 different times. It's the one of the biggest lawsuits in the history of the country And they've been fucking people up for years with that thing and those are the two that people typically defend Well, you got to get some vaccines. Okay. Well, do you know what I mean? Yeah If if they're endemic at this point, do you really need a vaccine to maintain herd immunity? I'm not sure that that's true. You don't so I you know Look, I don't want to be a lotite. I don't want to be anti-tacker anti-medicine because we've done quite a bit to keep people alive, right? with modern medicine for example chemo therapy and leukemia in the 1950s that has that is saved probably 15 to 20 million children's lives Mm-hmm So I don't want to talk shit about that and you don't want to you don't want to let the bad behavior or propaganda From people within the organization or the infrastructure to make you tear down the infrastructure if there's some value in it We call it throwing the baby out with the bath water, right? So you have to be careful about that shit, which means the only solution is to Educate yourself better because you it has been proven now and look This has been a logical fallacy forever. It's called appeal to authority. Well, the experts said X Well, that's a logical fallacy. I don't give a fuck what the experts said. What does the data say? So you have to in civics you have to understand how government works and how the Constitution works and you've got to do a little digging if you're a parent and you're worried about a Vaccine schedule for your kids you better go figure it out because you can't trust any of these motherfuckers to tell you well It's always the same people that feed their kids endless amounts of fucking bullshit to you know I got my kid all vaccinated. Yeah, and you feed him McDonald's four times a fucking day What do you think about the fact that in 20 from from 2000 or so To let's call it 2015 the anti-vax crowd was the progressive left Right and that weird and now they are for the Vax and now rage against machine is raging for the machine It's very bizarre. I don't know that any generation has flipped like this such a short Well, I think there's a couple things I think there's a couple things that they've done that one over to window has clearly shifted to the left where Where you know people are called right wing extremists are literal like centrist from 20 years ago You want to play that video of Hillary Clinton talking about Immigration I can send it to you if you'd like where she says they got to put a point out of here Get him out. Yeah, it's from 2012 Bro some like that the like when they first started using the term right wing extremists and Y supremacy I was laughing at it. I'm like what the fuck are they talking about like There's nobody running around here with KKK she in on fucking all this shit and Then I figured out they were talking about us You know and the reason they're talking about us is because the normalcy and the over to window a shift It's so far to the left. I think that's the first reason why you have like, you know rage against the machine The lyrics are completely appropriate to our side quote unquote the central right side though Well also think there's ego involved and I think people have a very hard time I Think I think I think one of the biggest reasons people are even personally successful in life is because they attach themselves to their opinions to the point of self-destruction and we think about like How many times in business right We've thought something was right and we've been forced to accept that we weren't right or else we would have lost money Right, there's consequences to consequences are what really matter correct and there's no consequences to these people not having to change their opinion So they plant their identity in this opinion and even though they feel like it might be wrong I mean think about the app like you and I we've been in business for a long long time It's very easy for me to shift and say okay, that didn't work. Let's fucking do this. Yeah, I don't have any ego attachment And I read Ray Dalio calls it a higher slow fire fast. Yeah, right. Yeah, it's a very simple principle and I think it's I think at first when I started in business I would let my ego Attach my identity into being right. Yeah, it's called pride of authorship. Yeah, well, and that's what we're dealing with we're dealing with people who are not They don't have to admit they're wrong in any circumstance in their life that costs them any sort of repercussions So why the fuck would they do that now after they made post after post after post after post their whole identity is Ukraine Israel Democrats this that whatever man we have to as American citizens We have to be able To adjust fire when we need to yeah, and that's so Spent cost fallacies part of that as well. I've gone this far. I can't go back now. I'm like that that's certainly a part of it But part of it is that Men when I say men I mean dudes who can grow facial hair and have shoulders right not people that vote for Democrats Yeah, for example now white dudes for hair. Correct. They men need to be leaders stop waiting around and bitching about how things are And even being It's okay to be critical of ideas But you you have to be really careful about being critical people now people in leadership positions light them up all the time But average dicks who are voters you got to be really careful about that stuff Because coalition building is important. Yeah, like if somebody's wrong You have to give them a graceful way to become to the right side. Yeah, man out. Yes, Abraham Lincoln said if I've made my enemy my friend If I not defeated him right yeah, like if we're talking about saving this goddamn country It's not gonna be us walking over the fucking corpses of liberals That ain't no dude. I think that's not saving the country. That's fucking bullshit. No, it is bullshit But also so few people are willing to give people room like you have to give people room and and dude You know we've seen this with like COVID right like a lot of people got fucking hoodwinked with COVID I mean and right now I mean there's so many people who are like fuck dude fears powerful man Yeah, that's right and they fell for right, but then there's people that didn't fall for it. They're like fuck you Fuck you. You did this and this and this and this and this and they don't give them any room to even admit that they were wrong Not not realizing that those people are actually victims of a psychological operation I mean think about any argument you've ever been in did you win the argument by Dancing on somebody's grave after they accepted no because they will never come to your side. That's right ever Yeah, that is the dumb you all you care about you don't care about making a difference You just care about making your fucking point and that kind of makes you a cut in my opinion like you're not you're you're a value You're not a value out at that point right to the community with we're seeing that nonstop with with influencers and even People on the right in the center not giving anybody any room But there is I mean there's a lot of people that do the opposite to there. I mean in all fairness There's a lot of people that give people room and they say welcome, you know, thank you and that's the kind of shit We need we look Trump's doing it Trump is known behind the scenes in Washington as vindictive Right, but what is he done over the last calendar year? He's brought people that he's that have been both critical of him and he's been critical of them into his camp Yeah, right like Gabber like fucking Vivek Yes, Swami like his god damn He's all of K. R.K. R.K. all these people that's a coalition building I'm gonna criticize Trump all day on the COVID stuff. He fucked that up. Yeah, he did But the Abraham Accords that he should have won multiple Nobel Peace Prizes for that I it's it's insane that he didn't frankly right to bring the five richest Arab countries into a peace agreement with Israel for the first time in human history Is the wildest shit I'd never thought that would ever have it right to be honest and he did it Behind the scenes without even making a lot of dust about it frankly. Yeah, well didn't get covered because they fucking Yeah, no credit for that stuff Obviously the account the opportunity economy which they are like the line trying to say now, but it's like he's the one that actually did it There's plenty of stuff there and then you add into it like he grew It's weird to say that a guy in his mid 70s grew up a little bit, but he grew up a little Like think about the kind of person That can do that in their 70s right this we can't teach an old dog new tricks Well clearly we fucking can't agree with that either I see I mean we're looking at the evidence at the highest level Yeah, but dude if you think about all the successful business people that are and I'm talking about Ultra lifetime successful. I'm not talking about they built one thing and they cashed out made some money I'm Mark Cuban putting radio on the internet. I'm talking That's it. He's that that character from Silicon Valley that's Mark Cuban. I'll put radio on the internet That's literally all he did in his life everything else. He's fucked up. Well anyways, the the the point is is that that Is a requirement the requirement of the pursuit of constant growth? Yeah is needed to succeed and you can't have that if your ego is attached in a permanent identity such as I'm a Democrat or I'm a Republican Ramaviss or that You have to be fluid and you have to be willing to adapt to change and I actually think that one of the biggest Indicators of someone's potential for success is how quickly they can adapt to change Which requires little to no ego right you have to be able to wipe your ego out and say hey fuck I didn't see that coming. I didn't that was wrong. I did this wrong All right, I'm not gonna do that again and you have to constantly be pursuing that so I don't Personally think that Trump could even get into the position that he was in without that quality about him Yeah, you know, but I think you know the first term People forget this you know, he's not a politician He doesn't know who the fuck is how bad things really are he has an idea of how bad things are But he doesn't know then he gets in he gets submarine by all the people that said they're gonna help him Yeah, it's like drinking from a fucking fire hose man. Yeah, but you got a higher 10,000 people Yeah, basically yeah, and the typical process for that once you get elected and you're in the debt the lame duck period is You go through Government accountability and OPM basically and they help you hire people for these jobs Well, those are all fucking leftists and they're not doing that this time. No, no, they know what we're talking about Yeah, they're using a private group to do it of some friends of ours actually yeah, yeah And some friends of ours are gonna be in that administration as well. Yeah, good. It's gonna be something else, but yeah to This is very obvious. Where do you put me? Oh shit, man woodchipper patrol maybe Had a head of murdering pedophiles. That's what dude. I'll take it. I'll fight you for that job. No, we'll do it together Yeah, yeah, I'll fire an off. Yeah, well, you fuck it. But you've got a you've got to like it's easy to see all this from A conservative side because leftists had been in charge of this even during Trump's term because they controlled the The the center are the House rather and they also controlled all the bureaucracies right so we're talking about since Bush left office in 2009 Leftists had been in control of this country. So it's easy to see all the ways the censorship the fucking stupid foreign policy decisions and the economic stuff blah blah blah. It's easy to see that you got to you have to take a Like a fucking a really clear look Nonpartisan look at what's happened over the last 40 years in this country because not one of these motherfuckers is innocent Reagan started this shit with deregulation, which we like typically right we like deregulation What we don't like is deregulation followed by government choosing sides in business and that's what Reagan started and then Clinton Double down on it and the military industrial complex from Clinton and 92 are 93 when he got inaugurated to Obama in 2014 a couple of things happen One we went from a hundred military industrial complex companies servicing the DOD down to five yeah five companies, right We went from prosecuting 16 major Antitrust cases a year all the way down to three and 2014 when Google was doing it shit buying Double click or whatever the ad thing to vertically integrate their ad service, which is fucking everybody over now 2014 to zero antitrust cases, right under Under Bush and Obama we went from well, we see that everywhere. We see that all it's an every industry So we create a monopoly now Bush allowed whirlpool to buy Maytag and then whirlpool had a 75% market share of Home appliances 75% right we went from six phone companies to four under Bush and Obama we went from 20 airlines Under Clinton to four That present right now you talking about it takes turnover and creativity to build that's what that is the essence of capitalism That's that's the whole point of it is competition and consequences competition and consequences iron sharpens iron That's the only way it works. We don't live in a capitalist society Not think we do it's called it right there's a really good book about this called the myth of Capitalism that everybody should check out, but here's what this is the best way to capture it We think we've deregulated But in reality for every bill every single bill that Congress passes there are 16 new regulations passed by Unelected bureaucrats in this country 16 16 to one 16 to one they're not elected. They're not answer rolled anybody Untenable right? Yeah, that's that's kind of where we find ourselves today. It's You know, I don't hurt Trump talk about deregulating any of that either Yeah, I mean, so he's signed some pretty good deregulating Stuff during during his first four years And he he also signed into law the biggest anti-trust piece of legislation and 50 years He just didn't it was in the later part of his term and it hasn't really taken effect as of now But we'll see I mean that's something that again You can see that Republican after Republican both and the White House and in Congress have been a part of all this They're not innocent in any way shape or form so your responsibility as a conservative or Republican or libertarian or however You see yourself is to not just bitch about the other side But to make sure your side is held accountable. Yeah, otherwise you're fucked I mean, there's something in the Bible about getting the wood out of your eye before you talk about it's right the splinter and somebody else's You know what I mean? They're the plank or whatever the fuck yeah, it's like maybe listen to the 2000 year old wisdom for some reason Every 200 years we forget about the Stoics and the Bible and all this like all this stuff has already been solved It's already been solved and we're fucking stupid so we just let it come back up for some reason I Think I think we deal with people who don't ever take the time to study those lessons Yeah, it's a big problem that people that don't understand our history or I think a lot of I think a lot of people in our government Don't even know that I don't think they give a fuck. I don't think they understand much about the Constitution No, but you should do they're talking about they want to rewrite it Yeah, did you see that fucking article by the Atlantic where they said oh, it's time to get away that's dangerous You had do away with the Constitution. This is this is people that don't understand where the Constitution came from so I'm gonna take you on a Historical journey right quick. I'll be brief We've been talking about the natural rights or God-given rights depending on how you want to say that of Man for a very long time, right, but it came to a head a couple of times There's a couple of key moments throughout history one is the Magna Carta, right? King John not very popular this is Richard the Lionheart's little brother. It's where Robin Hood mythology comes from France invades he needs the barons in the north to help him fight They say no and out without an agreement that we have rights, but it was only the barons that got rights their plebs There's serves whatever in a column they can get shit Carry on a couple years you get to the the Protestant Reformation begins, right? And the Protestant Reformation is parallel to Everything that's going on in government the the ideas of libertarianism and property rights and all this stuff are parallel to this You get to 1525 surf rebellion, right huge rebellion and This organization comes along called the levelers Levelers, right like like a level levelers and they write this Document called I can tell you right now what it's called an agreement of the people and it was the first It's actually the basis of our constitution now is an agreement of the people they write this document and for the first time in human history A group of people write down that everybody's got the same rights king prince popper whatever that's where that prince and popper phrase and our constitution comes from All this stuff inspires people like lock to write about the rights of man and let's be clear what the ultimate right is property rights, right? And the ultimate property is yourself and not just your body and and such but your mind That's what really matters. That's what makes censorship so it's a relative Relevant conversation right now. Yeah, that what makes censorship so evil like you really I really encourage you to look into these things Not you specifically, but your audience to look into this stuff and understand why something is right or wrong Not that it's right or wrong the reason it's evil is because Speech is thought that's your that's your thinking making its way out, right? And if you control somebody's speech you can control their thought it's evil the end. I have no fucking tolerance for that bullshit so The all of this stuff Including English common law the French Revolution all the stuff makes its way into this textbook called the perceptor like a precept like a whatever the perceptor and between And agreement of the people lock Monosque and the perceptor these are the documents that our founding fathers were reading when they were writing our Constitution our Declaration of Independence in the federal's papers and all this shit, right? You need to understand where this comes from so when somebody says oh well this thing that's not really that important Okay, let me stop you right there here is historically why exactly it's important and why we do it this way and look This is the same trap we fall into every 200 years or so and in the West We forget about stillnessism we forget about being rational people we forget about first principles You know what I mean we forget about it and people like oh that's that's Pass a or antiquated we don't need that anymore. They don't understand why we might need it if you don't understand history You're doing to repeat it. That's we've heard that over and over throughout our lives and Continuously we not only Forget history we intentionally ignore that shit. Yeah, so you know We're getting the government that we fucking deserve right? Well, I mean look dude. It's a it's a cycle of history. It's every 80 years. You read the fourth turning. Yeah, yeah People people should read the fourth turning They they start to understand what we're dealing with and why it's so important for everybody to get engaged right now Yeah, and why it's important to choose sides but to choose them the right way correct Well, it's right versus left. That's a connoct It's fucking up versus down. Yeah, it's them versus the aristocracy versus everything Yes, like the aristocracy will always protect itself before they'll protect any ideology any person any political party any of that shit Yeah, they always protect themselves first and that's how you know it's us versus them, but We need right and left we need oh, we were talking about this. We do need a balanced conversation We need right and left the same way that a child needs mom and dad Yeah, they need empathy and nurturing and the need toughness and fucking decisiveness Well, there is no left right now bro. That's what we're talking about well the left. They're both on the right right now The left and the right are both on the right right now frankly, right? It's like think about it Well, are you talking about from a authority on standpoint? No, no, no I mean like RFK and fucking JD Vance right two people that are yeah, yeah, yeah No, okay, I get one far right once far left, but they're both on they're both on the conservative side now Yes, and the only that's what I'm saying the only people left on the left are legitimate Marxist communist yeah So it's it's hard to have Like the labels that we've been able to apply historically don't really apply right now. Yeah, it's difficult Yeah, I mean where we've gone from we're in a plutocracy now, right? So Blue is imploral Togracy isn't like a authoritarian It's it's a It's it's a small group of people that are trying to impose their will on everybody else. There's a really good story about this actually Never ends well again from 2000 years ago. Well think about this. So there is a And well this time either it won't it never it never will people get sick of that shit and never ends but There's a conversation recorded I think it may have been and Flavius Joseph is antiquities But it's it's a Roman slave or I'm sorry slave trade or foreign slave trade or talking to a Roman senator and when the slaves were delivered from overseas and a Rome they would have a leather collar or a pierced ear with leather through it or something like that some kind of a denifier And it was mostly for the marketplace and the Romans would then take it off and then brand them usually somewhere Obscure under the clothes or something like that or on the wrist not not like on the forehead and shit like that Um, and the slave trader in this conversation asked the Roman senator. Why do you guys do that and the Roman senator says when we have large public gatherings If they look around to see that there how many more of them there are the Nus they would kill us all yeah You need to understand this as a person There are so many more of you than there are of these assholes who are trying to run your life That doesn't mean you should go out and start murdering people what it means is that you don't need to There's so many more of you. Yeah, all you have to do is say no, and here's a good example dude That is the whole that is the only thing that's put us in this position It's cultural weapons such as cancel culture political correctness silent majority The removal of competition from society. Yeah, those are that's why we're here. Yeah, what's uh manufacturing consent Yeah, people should look up and understand what that phrase means, but there's a good example of how Not not violence none of that bullshit that people are all amped up about you can solve these problems Not easily, but you can solve them effectively remember the governance disinformation board Yeah, with Mary Poppins. Yeah, yeah, by the way she's working for the UK government doing exactly that same job That bitch is fucking crazy. Yeah, she's a piece of shit, but anyways uh That lasted for two weeks. Yeah, everybody including the It would have lasted a lot longer. She wasn't on the internet legitimately singing songs about canceling people Yeah, uh all people did collectively was say nope we're not doing that And that's that's fucking all it takes instantly It's all it takes and you saw it at the tail end of some of the lockdown stuff too Finally people are just like I'm not doing that anymore. Yeah, and this is This isn't like an anti-cop or anti-authority thing necessarily But it is like when something is wrong Refuse to do it. There's this principle called saatya graha, right? It's what passive resistance is based on but part of it is accepting the consequences of your resistance Yeah, it doesn't mean that everything's gonna work out well for you, right? Sometimes you have to do the right thing and take the con you got to take the hit like Nelson Mandela spend a 20 years About me. Yeah, like that's what it means really. It's not just about sitting in and getting arrested and getting to find and going I don't know it's sometimes it sucks. Yeah, but it is it is Peaceful non-compliance. It's gonna solve the problem. Yeah, like uh in our buddy in yeah, right in Smith His his gym gets fucked with he's like, you know what fuck you yeah, we're all the embellmars some shit like that left He is fuck up. Yeah, and he was just like, you know what? I'm just gonna take the door off. Yeah, you can come lock it I'll just take the goddamn door off. You know what I mean That he and he took a big chance. It's all gonna end up working out for him at the end But he didn't know that at the time. Yeah, he could have been no it all got crushed He could have been it all just recently. Yeah, I know he could have been bankrupted for the rest of his fucking life For the prison for that paying him. Yeah, he took the chance and he did what I think was the right thing and they broke It happened to work out for him, but it could have gone very poorly and it did for some amount of time. There there are people that have done things in the last four years That will never get the credit and never get the recognition they deserve For their actions. Yeah, and he's one of them. Yeah, he was the main guy who resisted the coven tyranny and If he hadn't have done that Many other people would have done it either. Yeah, and he set the standard for that to happen But he didn't act like a wild asshole. No, he wasn't holding like armed rallies at his fucking job. He was just like no. Yeah That's not doing it. Well, you know he is. That's how he is. Yeah, his chill. Yeah. I'm sorry doing that and that's usually In your personal life, but those guys like those few guys that actually stood up first They deserve a lot of fucking credit and support that they're not getting. Yeah, which is very frustrating because now it's cool to be You know conservative or pro freedom or whatever now it's cool But there was mother fuckers that were taken arrows four and a half years ago for everybody that people have forgotten about Yeah, quite a few. Yeah, he's wonderful. Yeah, but you know they I mean It's probably a function of the censorship too, but a lot of people don't even know about this stuff. Yeah, to be honest You know, it's it's good to talk about it's good to remember and it's important that dude deserves the fucking metal of freedom Yeah, yeah, I mean it not not to like I don't like the word hero that much, but it's important in culture Who your heroes are? Yeah, when our heroes I'm thinking about like the 19 20s through the 1950s our heroes were people like Jimmy Stewart He was an actor. He left his acting job to go to two separate fucking wars retired as a Brigadier General the Air Force Bob feller Joe de mageo Ted Williams these guys left The pinnacle of their careers and the Ted Ted Williams missed two years in the middle of his career twice Yeah, to go to two separate wars to be a pilot, you know what I mean? Still still one of the best players ever. Yeah, if your heroes are identified by people who cared more about others than themselves who cared more about honor than their personal accomplishment, and that's what you're gonna get that's what young boys are gonna grow up wanting to be If you have people who are fucking twerking and taking selfies, you're gonna get fucking assholes And then we have now right and it's our fault. It's our fault for doing that. No, it's here's why it's our fault. It's our fault because We gave inches when we shouldn't have gave any inches and you know when they started telling us Because you how old are you 43? Yeah, we're the same age so fucking When they started removing Partis- or putting participation trophies in school like that was a major red flag for me at the time I didn't know why they were doing it, but I was like this is ridiculous I didn't say much about it right When cancel culture started happening. I didn't really recognize what it was Political correctness started happening that that shouldn't exist when we were in high school like We were saved whatever the fuck we said and that was it and um You know It's it's really only been the last five or six years. I started to recognize cultural weapons and I still don't think a lot of people have recognized that a lot of these things that are Accepted behaviors now are intentional cultural weapons and have been put in the society to control the narratives to control people speech and thought Yeah, I mean, that's really what it is like yeah, you know you want to To get into and maintain power you're incentivizing and you're and and there's a bunch of ways to do that obviously paying people giving them what they want whatever right um And it's for some reason I don't know which came first. I think it'd be interesting to look into this but Social currency went from like it used to be honor Right to be respected yeah, and by by let's say you were Being introduced to somebody to a stranger by somebody who knows you the things they say about you would be Particularly things good husband good dad good businessman goes to church whatever the fuck right? I don't know it depends on where you grow up in the country I suppose But honor played a big right. He's a good man. It mattered that you were a good man And now that list is gonna be quite a bit different frankly, right and It's it it is collapsing a lot a big part of our culture right now so When social currency can be replaced and we're talking about the difference between serotonin and dopamine really is what we're talking about These are biological analogues for this but when When social currency is replaced what when you when your social currency is that I've got to work hard to achieve Right, and I've got to be a good man to be respected things like that think about the thing I have to do to get ex-result Right when it changes to oh, I could just put thoughts and prayers on the internet And I get the same dopamine hit yeah, that if I had actually helped somebody Yeah, I never helped anybody. Yeah, so I feel great still But I've actually not helped anybody that's like eating junk food for your soul Right, and your soul starts to deteriorate and when there's a critical mass of deteriorated souls We find ourselves where we are today. Yeah, so all this stuff that you talk about all the time about doing hard work It isn't just for the sake of doing hard work It's because there's a goddamn purpose for it. It's that we have biologically programmed to be this way And if you think you're smarter than nature, good luck bud. Yeah, well it's been around for a while You know dude the ultimate problem that we're facing here is a culture problem. It's not it. It's not a political problem It's it's a culture problem. We have weak men Which is the biggest fucking problem we have We have men that are not healthy. We have men that are not wealthy. We have men that are apathetic We have men that value the wrong things um And that's gonna create a weak culture. Sure. Okay, so men are leaders. I don't want to hear bitching from you If you're a man, I don't want to hear stoicism I don't want to yeah, I don't want to hear about how all the women are this or that like you're a fucking man Lead them bro or shut the fuck up. What are you talking about? Listen This comes back to This is another cultural weapon in my opinion. It's it's the propagation and intentional um installation of victimhood culture in your society You know you got all these men fucking talking about like you know how Much problems they got and this and that and this and this bro That's historically now what the fuck men are about. Well not a lot of them and I understand you know things might get hard sometimes I get all that shit and when I'm talking about making your identity is some sort of fucking like You know Victim yeah, well, you know all this comes from a French pedophile named Michelle Foucault um Postmodernism is the phrase that people use to describe it, but really it really is What would it really boils down to is there's no rules or ethics anymore? It's just like your lived experience, but like hey, yeah You know just whatever you think is right. My truth. Whatever you think is right. My truth little tell me if you want to cut your dick off And name yourself fucking Samantha a good good go for like fuck off man. Yeah, um, but that that's it really boils down to intersectionality intersectionality is this And plain language We're gonna fucking rank everybody by their victimhood status. Yeah, right? You get two points for this the three points for this Yeah, and what you've done is created a competition a race to the bottom yeah, so you're you're racing to be the most pathetic It's the complete opposite of what we need But dude when you look at it like that and you start breaking it down About how it's legitimately the complete opposite of what we need and then you watch about how it's propagated through society and culture It's impossible not to recognize that it's intentional. It's a hundred percent. Yeah, and and dude men fall for it, bro like it's just like Fuck even I fell for it for a little bit like in a year's ago, but like we got to get to a point where You know we realize who the fuck we are man like what our role is and this role in society. It's been diluted and Taken off the backs of men is the reason that culture so fucking flip floppy and weak You know, we have to get men to stand the fuck up We have to get men to understand that their job is to protect provide and And basically be the shield for the weaker people in society and we don't have that right now. We've got a bunch of fucking pussy men that You know want to go to their fucking group and cry. Yeah, instead of fucking handling shit Well, it's you know one of the things I've been thinking about a lot lately is uh, because I think it's It's good for the layperson who doesn't spend all their time reading and thinking about shit like this to his happy very plain language to understand and I think We can boil this down in a lot of ways to the difference between hope and faith So hope waits for somebody else and faith moves Knowing and believing that somebody that the others are gonna get on board with them, right? It's that first movement. It's like Hope is Sitting around waiting for food and and faith is jumping off the cliff to snag a bird out of the air So you want to like hey, maybe it doesn't work out But I'm gonna fucking trust this process that it works out and that's the difference It's just that little bit of action and you can again. This is another thing that has So many biological analogs for it the the data we have now is If you move around Consistently 15 minutes a day you reduce your chance of heart disease by 50 percent With 15 minutes of your day you can reduce your chance of heart disease by 50 percent 50 percent It goes up exponentially if you're doing it every day and four 45 minutes or longer, right? 75 percent chance or 75 percent reduction Just it doesn't take that much think about it this way from a biological standpoint the difference between a river and a pond You'll drink out of a river. I would not recommend drinking out of a pond Just keep your fucking blood moving around that's that's step one, right? And then realize that again, we don't understand civics and we don't understand biology There's not you're an active dude that eats a lot of protein They're you don't have a single cell in your body that was there three years ago About two and a half years at max for somebody like you your brain your teeth your eyes. It's all different How's that happening? You're shedding and you're eating protein. That's how it happens So you eat a fuckload of protein and move around a little bit just like we have for the last 250 fucking thousand years Yeah, that's it like what the fuck man But again, we're on that cycle where people just can't figure it out because they don't understand First principles what the the underlying structure of the belief you have is so you gotta fucking care for First bro, you do yeah, people don't fucking care. I mean you do a grocery store lately Fucking walk through the grocery store and tell me any of these motherfuckers give a fuck about fucking this country or themselves I'm not sure how much they know That's what I'm saying you got a care first. So how do you how do you get him to care if they if they are completely fucking in the dark? Yeah, I mean, you know Just the amount of process stuff people you're saying to me and I did it to growing up We all grew up eating that shit. We're all like kind of Making our way back to being a normal person. Yeah, for sure But the good news is again sells replicate very quickly You can get yourself right in about three years max right if you're active You can get yourself to a level fitness that you could not have previously. Yeah, I think that's a truth regardless of where you are right now A hundred percent you could be 600 pounds right now. Yep. Yeah, yeah, 100% I mean, it's that's just how nature works like you're literally shedding or placing cells all the time All you have to do is control the input and output of that right is that why you're getting lighter Hmm, I say else you're you're hoping to be wider. So you get lighter are you doing that Michael Jackson shit? No Sammy Sosa of being different. I think Mike was a little different What not nothing what what what happened with Sammy Sosa He says he was taking some like steroid like like I think he owns it now. I think he says he loves it He pro Boy, I mean it's definitely he's definitely a You know, look right. No man, that's He it's almost like a racist caricature Yeah at this point because he's like super white, but he's got the big black features. Yeah, it's like dude I think you might be racist. Yeah, yeah a lot of home runs against his own people by the way We got a big steroids back in the sports and what you see the steroids back period. Yeah, everybody should you know The average 21 year old male in America right now has a same level testosterone at their grandfather had in 2000 That's yeah, and then they clear see they scare everybody with misinformation about testosterone So, you know, I fucking dick's gonna fall off. Oh, oh, Royd rage. Oh, look dude This is why you're fucking got titties. Yeah, right? This is why fucking you looking to do with a bulge in his pants to get a boner Okay, you're fucking you need some fucking testosterone. This is why you vote for common I guarantee you I know you can there's a study about it. There's a study There's a study that once they started ministering testosterone for like eight weeks their their views change Yeah, I'm sure the concerto is 100 percent which is like of course it fucking did You know what I mean? Oh shit, but like all yeah, there's there's a lot of bad information out there So you start taking TRT your estrogen levels will rise because your body wants to reach home Eostasis it wants to fucking level out. So you just take an estrus old stop it. That's it. Yep for about 70 bucks a month You can fix this problem with every like we're talking about 99% of men in America. Yeah, it used to be Sometime around 27 you start ever remembering they used to tell us about testosterone. Oh, yeah, I fucking kill you It's all Lyle. I was you know and yeah, Lyle. I was taking fucking 500 energy. She's fucking D. All into his forehead. Yeah, of course you're gonna have problems But when you're talking about just regular testosterone dude, it's Probably about the healthy healthiest thing a man could do. Yeah, I mean so my doctor His Kurt Parsley's a former Navy seal He he likes to say I want to show your labs to a stranger to another doctor without any of your biographical information on there and make him I want him to think oh, that's just an average 25 year old right? Yeah, and why not there's little there's literally no Bad effects from this as long as you do it the correct way. Yeah, it's really it's really simple and it's cheap too This is something we're working on with the DOD right now actually trying desperately trying to get them to address this issue Because I'm sure you're listening to probably saw this in Rogan the other day or I have seen it previously 70 plus percent of American males are unqualified for military service. Yeah, we're talking about the 17 to 25 year old. Yeah, 70 percent Where we used to have people to fucking lie about their age to get in yeah, yeah, I mean that's why 70 fucking great They don't have how would you conquer a country bro? Yeah, from the inside out. That's right. You just fucking make their men we could fuck it was the ultimate Trojan horse You just implanted that idea that being strong doesn't matter not not just that it doesn't matter The fucking dad bod shit came for yeah trying to encourage you to be a fat plebe fucker and You know it pro and telling you that your masculine urges are somehow intrinsically evil yeah or or menacing to somebody It's like all right cool. Well when the wars break out or when somebody starts a fire or when you need a fucking or you're walking down the street Some do fucks with you. Yeah, you're on wish you had somebody. Yeah, well, I'm just talking. Yeah, just any of this stuff like this this kid Daniel pennies going on trial now Why aren't women lined up out the fucking door of that courthouse demanding he be released well because women only want to promote You know, they only want to get active about one or two issues when in reality bro You know, it's all the other issues that matter the most you know they these we've women that claim to be feminist But don't say anything about men competing in their sports or removing their identity or winning beauty pageants or winning their trophies You know, that's insane. You're not a feminist. You're you're a full of shitist. Mm-hmm, you know A full of shit truth. You get how you gonna be a feminist and not for women. No, it's wild to be honest like I mean it Third wave feminism is just full full blown retardism. You know what I mean? That's that's really what it is But this happens in every any kind of culture war issue an entire industry will pop up around it We're talking about like organized labor Especially right yeah, so trade unions and teachers unions especially but the feminist movement and even the breast cancer stuff Is crazy the amount of money they've raised versus a much more common colon cancer, which is raised no money well not only that bro I think we all know after COVID that these people are highly aware of the things that actually help Issues, but they're unwilling to admit or promote any of the solutions because it costs them too much money Or it doesn't make them enough money. No, it's no Their their whole system is based off treating fucking cancer sure so why the fuck would they cure it? Okay, and we look at like what they did a Rogan during COVID like look what they did a Rogan about talking about Ivermectin not just that But CNN put a fucking desaturated image of how shit they made it Then he really was yeah, so dude when you look that's that's an example of what they're willing to do to hide Kures For profit so you can't tell me after all these walks and all these marches and all this money raised and all these things for breast cancer You're gonna tell me that these motherfuckers don't know what actually cures it or they do yeah They fucking know, but they won't tell anybody and they allow people to go out and continue to get it and continue to die from it These people are fucking criminals no, and it's there's a there's an analog for that in politics The phrase goes solved problems don't get out the vote. That's right, right? So if comma Harris had done all the things while she was not here There's one of two things happening with comma Harris and this I just want to address the counter argument that Democrats are leftist make about this stuff so One is that she says I want to do x y and z Um, and the Republican response is well, why can't you do it do it and their response is well she's vice president They don't actually have any power. Okay, so you this is what you want me to believe you want me to give the person a job who doesn't have the clout To walk down the hall and say hey Joe This wrong the country's fucked up. We need to help Americans and she doesn't have either the the willingness or the capability to get that done Then why the fuck would we promote her into the next job wouldn't that's insane. That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard of and it's the dumbest excuse like oh, she's not actually the president vice president doesn't have that power So she doesn't have no clout saying over and over that she wouldn't do anything different. Yeah well, she's she's a She's a political nihilist. Yeah, bro. She's a panda. Yeah, she's just like Hillary Clinton So let me let me take you back on another little historical journey really quickly. It's 2013 And I'm sorry, it's 2016 Hillary Clinton's running against Donald Trump and the phrase most commonly used to describe her campaign from the left And even some center people was the single most qualified candidate for president and u.s. History that's over and over and over again And it's because she was a senator secretary state because of her work with the Affordable Care Act and all that shit. Okay fine cool Let's look at the actual qualifications in a minute, but first let's look just at what leftist believed at that time period The things that mattered the most it was the beginning of the me to moving and what did she do in the late 90s? She spent time she actually said we have to destroy these women about the women that her husband raped Right, so they wouldn't interrupt her political empire. She was wrong on marriage equality at least from their perspective She voted for a rack all the racks right she voted for the Patriot Act twice So what exactly qualified her to be your leftist candidate? Right you all the stuff that Democrats believed in 2016 she was on the other side just a few years prior Yeah, these people are political nihilists. They don't actually believe any of the shit. That's what they think are that they say Well, that's why when people say you know that Kamala's a communist like I say often and people are like well You don't know what communism is well motherfucka you don't either because they don't go up there and campaign on the communist platform They go up there and fucking subvert and lie and cheat and steal and then when they get in power they fucking kill you That's what communist deal. Did you see this? So yesterday Tim Walls and aoc played madden on the side made you know what made you know it was crazy about that It made me it made me think that they were just like us I was you know playing video games played madden I just like a couple of couple of normal people. I just love to have a beer with 10 walls I love that he does jazz hands in the background like some fucking gay lord. Well fuck off dude. I mean listen bro I pretty sure it His testosterone is like in the negative somehow not only that like what do you think is hard drives like? Yeah, I don't think he's up to anything good means it that But yeah, it's like so This is how fucking stupid these people are oh we know and part of it is like I part of it It's important to understand when you're dealing with somebody who you really said on the fucking did you hear what he said about when they were playing man He said fucking aoc runs a mean pick six. Yeah, like it's a fucking play run. Yeah Yeah That's what he said that's pretty dumb. It was like the I this guy claims to be a football coach. Yeah, they kind of quietly agreed that We should end the filibuster in the senate which is called the nuclear option For a reason because it's fucking crazy, right? But the fact that they started the fucking stream That went on for some amount of time at 330 Half an hour before the bears and redskins played with the two the top two picks in the draft Right like the big one of the biggest matchups of the year Maybe the teams aren't super good, but that's one of the biggest matchups of the year And they they run it concurrently with that game, which is the only game on at that time That's how much they know about you the average man. Yeah, you know what I mean Yeah, and then it's like god damn it. Just be who you are Did you see that fucking get they hurt and Gretchen Wilson did in the fucking bar? Oh, I got to oh you do Let's uh Let's not got some of these headlines man. We got some interesting stuff to cover So yeah, guys remember if you want to see any of these pitches links articles videos Go to any forseller.com you guys can find them all linked there for you with that being said It's gonna throw a first set of headlines Trump was in Madison square garden That was pretty interesting.

Yes, the joke the joke went over everybody's head They don't understand that they have a this huge waste disposal problem down there That's the fucking joke the joke wasn't like oh Puerto Rico's piece of shit The fucking what like people are so ignorant to world issues that they don't even know what the fuck he was talking about Dennis Millie used to run into this problem all the time. He told high-brow jokes Yeah, and people are like what the fuck are you talking about like well just read a fucking newspaper? What I'm saying people are super butt-heard about that one super book man They aren't the Puerto Rico we've been making fun of anything about him saying that he was gonna carve watermelon up with the black guy Did you see that It's fucking hilarious. Well, I mean it's crazy because like you know Obviously the common look campaign wanted to jump in on this a tweet run out Says governor walls and at aoc react to this clip when you have some a hole calling Puerto Rico floating garbage Know that that's what they think about you It's what they think about anyone who makes less money than them I want every Puerto Rican in Philadelphia and reading and across the country to see this clip What did what what did the money part have to do with that? I don't know Was projection because that's what they think about you right right the fucking deplorable Well, by the way, it's it only Puerto Rican's in Philadelphia and reading Pennsylvania that matter The gap is yeah, I don't know. Yeah, what is that that's it's a battleground they interviewed a few people At the actually at the at the rally that were Puerto Rican. They're like yeah, I mean he's a comedian I mean he made fun of pretty much everybody he made fun of everybody like you can't laugh at the joke about it Somebody else and they get mad when there's one about you. Sorry, but it's come to us. It's not how it works Well, Tony didn't look that slide he decided to reply to this this tweet right here actually said quote These people have no sense of humor while the device presidential candidate would take time out of his quote busy schedule To analyze a joke taken out of context to make it seem racist. I love Puerto Rico and vacation there I made fun of everyone watch the whole set. I'm a comedian term might be time to change a tampon Um, and it's interesting because you know the internet's a very interesting place Not you know pretty much find everything there. Did you guys know that just yesterday actually Um, they had George Lopez at a Tim Walls. Oh, yeah campaign event. Did you you know you you want to know what George Lopez said at that event?

Yeah anyways Um, yeah, let's let's check in and see what I get a heel dog had to say Now one other thing that you'll see next week, Caitlin is Trump actually reenacting uh the Madison square garden rally in 1939. I write about this in my book uh, president Franklin Roosevelt was appalled that neo-nazis fascists in america were lining up to essentially pledge their support for the kind of government that they were seeing in germany So I don't think we can ignore it Yeah, so that's what she had to say and what kind of government was that Oh, that's a discussion for another day next episode Um, but a OC jumped in it she called it a mini-genuary six what um, I mean it was all over mainstream headlines All right, that's everywhere fallout spreads from racist rhetoric at trumps msg rally Um, they're I mean they're all over the place trumps Madison square garden event features crude and racist insults talking about Hitchquist watermelon joke. It was just one joke I don't even see out. I mean shit. Do bro. It was fucking funny. Have you ever been Hey, what flavor is that drink? That's great What's great with a monkey head on it's made that's racist you shit that somebody wouldn't even make that Did you put that together yourself or is that a real one? Well, let's cancel or hit your mama Yeah, she's saying Let's cancel the black icon of fucking the grocery store Antio mama what's a racer is what it is. That's what it is people don't get that it's the same shit with the red skin same shit with the Indians all of that shit Trump's team because I know they listen to the fucking show First order of business reinstate all these fucking bullshit casualties of Woke culture the right the trance the tribe Who the redskins logo the chief that it was based on nine out of ten of those people are proven it They're like please bring it like that was a big thing for us. Yeah Um, you know, because I'm bullshit. They're not pussy. Yeah, this is this is retarded nonsense every Everybody I disagree with is a Nazi is how a fucking child thinks well, dude. Did you see what em? So this is this is really interesting here this MS MSNBC They literally did a segment on their fucking, you know top of the hour bullshit And they were literally playing clips of a fucking Nazi rally right next to it Scream screen chairs. Let's check this out But that jamboree happening right now you see it there on your screen in that place is particularly chilling Because in 1939 more than 20,000 supporters of a different fascist leader Adolf Hitler packed the garden for a so-called pro-America rally Arale were speakers voiced anti-Semitic rhetoric from a stage draped with Nazi banners When a Jewish protestor rushed the stage the associated press reported quote Instantly a dozen or more stormtroopers set upon him knocking him down and beating him as he held his head in his arms Most of his clothing was torn from his body later. He was booked for disorderly conduct Now against that backdrop of history Donald Trump the man who was threatened to use the military against opponents He calls enemies from You don't give a fuck when the mother fuck a hockey team play there or the fucking basketballs played there hockey is this evil backdrop of Nazism, you know, it's a fuck out of here dude. Yeah, 80 years to do something about it I just three canceling matters because it's bullshit. I don't I just don't have the energy for this No, nobody does it's fucking insane and the more they push this bullshit in my opinion and from what I'm observing The more people are going to Trump They are in such a whirlwind of lies and deceit and nonsense that they're pushing even people who were anti-Trump They're like fuck dude. All right. This is this is out of control Well, dude, it's you know the meme of like the guy riding the bicycle when he takes a stick Yeah, like that's what they're doing right now. I know because I put shit up like this But they don't know what else to do though. Yeah, but in the same breath, you know, they're they're bracing for unrest I'm Trump. This is absolutely correct. So I've heard from governors of multiple states Um, these are blue states and they are prepared to deploy right now They've already issued warning orders are to put prepared to deploy their fucking national guard to cities to protect their cities if only if Trump wins it's only if Trump wins, but you you have to listen to The these fucking mongoloids and the defense department in the state department is what my favorite words constantly talk about how the biggest Threatness country right now is white nationalist extremists or whatever the fuck right Uh conservatives. Yeah, right? That's the biggest threat the biggest terror threat in this country is that right now, but not We're not even having the conversation what happens if Trump loses at a security level at the national security level They're not even having that conversation because Republicans have fucking jobs. That's it Right is there not even have so the national so who's gonna fucking riot all the fucking Upper middle class moms. Yeah, and no, it's a fucking all the Antifa torps are gonna get paid again to go out in the street with their Fucking pool noodles and their fucking trash cans do it. I agree do it. Yeah, please. Yeah, do it. It's Not for nothing, but it's Russia and China funding antifa these people haven't These people haven't had repercussions to any of their shit in over 10 years They need a little spank all these little nerds With their fucking haircuts and their fucking pierced nipples and shit They think they can run out on the fucking street and you know fight and do whatever the fuck they want Bro, did you see that video of that fucking lady y'all that kid over the weekend? Oh, yeah, bro Did you see that yeah, you know, that's what they fucking think they can do bro They think they can do anything they want because they've had no repercussions Like I'm so because dude. It's a double standard of what's allowed and what isn't allowed I'm tired of people Being able to say and do anything they want while the other side just gets abused and bullied and they make it seem like We're the ones bullying them. How many times you've been on the street with your fucking trash can right? How many times if you fucking Been been out there marching and burning shit now. I'll tell you what I've done none of that I'm not marching anywhere. I got shit to do But I will say you know you know I'm saying though. Yeah, two two things on like bro These little fucking pussy's had never had a hands put on their whole life Yeah, so they don't respect any sort of resistance you and I were laughing in a locker room About that video that you remember that video that fucking nerd the one that was trash can running at the cops and they just Dropkicks. Yeah, to be honest That's one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life. Yes, right? It's because it's instant reality for that person Like you're 115 fucking pounds of untrained shit running with it. You cut a trash can in half like it's some other fucking star wars You know, I don't know what the fuck these people think I'll challenge this is for non-yeah Here's a for anybody that that maybe Is incredulous about this idea of who actually we don't know what that means here bro. You got a dumb. Uh uh Can't like they can't possibly believe Yeah, that it's the that it's the left that's violent and not the right. Yeah, here's my challenge you After Trump wins the selection next week and he will win Don't question about that there's going to be political violence to some degree I don't know what to what degree there will be but it will all come from the left and here's what I challenge you to do If there's a Republican rally somewhere go there and say you're a Democrat and see what happens And if there's a Democrat rally somewhere go there and see your Republican see what happens I can tell you right now what's gonna. Yeah, you get told fuck off at the left. Yeah If you've never seen that video of them taking that black man There's a black guy on the street I've seen a video three or four times and They go he's wearing a Harris shirt and actually I think it was a Biden shirt at that time And they said hey, can we go to the rally with you and he's like yeah sure But afterwards you're gonna go to our rally with us. So they go to give you see this one. Yeah, they go to the rally And the people in the Trump gear he this guy's wearing a Biden shit They get fucking a costed and harassed and spit on and all this shit And then they're like okay, let's go to a Trump rally and they're giving this dude hugs They're like hey mad come with us. What are you doing? He's wearing Biden shit. He wasn't wearing Trump shit And bro, he at the end of it. He was like this is He's like I can't believe this. He's like this is everything. I've been told is a lie It was a it's an amazing video. I can't I couldn't pull it up. I don't know where I saw it, but You're right, bro. It's it's um And you know what we're sick of that shit. Yeah, I'm sick of that shit I'm sick of being lectured and yelled at and screamed at and bullied and fucking Called all these names by some fucking little douchebag who hasn't done a fucking thing in their entire life. I'm fucking over it. Yeah, yeah You're not gonna lecture me dude. You're not gonna fucking lecture me fuck you And if you think you're gonna lecture me just fucking don't even do it because I don't give a shit. Yeah Yeah, I mean, it's you know We a lot of people are waking up luckily right to this stuff like the even the one that you're talking about where the the woman Screaming at that kid some black lady stopped her steps in as I said no, I don't do that shit. Do that bullshit Yeah, I thought that was awesome that woman I can be friends with yeah, I agree you protect kids and your friends You can be friends will be somebody that even thinks it's appropriate to scream into a child's face about politics What the fuck is wrong? Listen, it's the same can't like my can't even gain. It's the same fucking people you have life experience I have life experience different experiences DJ you have life experience. You've gone through some real shit Okay, all three of us have gone through real shit in different ways Those fucking people have not and it's always the same motherfuckers. It's these fucking it's the sheltered provided for entitled White kids that it come from upper middle class who feel guilty because they've never struggled in their life So they find identity and sticking up for a perceived injustice that actually doesn't even exist And then they think they're doing something like you're getting in a fucking child's face screaming at her top It's time to take inventory of where the fuck you are dude. Yeah, well, so we have Two very different outlooks on life people who Who see life reality for what it is right and then people who see What they want life to be and that's that's where they're stuck right it's like life isn't fair. You're right It's not and you can't demand that it be fair. It won't work. No, it just doesn't work man That's that's delusional Carl Sagan used to say that for me it's far better to accept reality Accept the universe as it is rather than persistent delusion regardless of how Like satisfying the delusion is no shit because at the end of the day like it If I think that doing something is gonna benefit me and it's hurting me or doing nothing then I'm fucked Well, this is also why you have to equip yourself as an individual To be mentally tough enough and resilient enough and have enough fortitude and perseverance to handle an unfair reality Because it is unfair because we caught the is ought fallacy right So the way things ought to be or the way the way they the way something is versus the way something ought to be That's right And the way that you intellectually handle that problem is here are the way things are here's the way I think they should be I'm gonna take action to make that that's correct, right? Like what am I all first are used to tell me if you're in a position That especially in business or the military or whatever it is your relationship whatever it is Uh or not your relationship, but like your personal life your relationships uh Work hard on yourself And rise to a position of power or authority or competence so that you can affect change that's your only outlet It's the only way it could possibly ever work for you that and coalition building as well, but The to your quote, you know about personal excellence is the ultimate right and that's perfectly encapsulated in the United States United States isn't geography It's not fucking right or left. It's not a president. It's not a political person that bullshit It is the fundamental truth of governance and the universe that That individual liberty and personal entrepreneurship are the ultimate inoculation to tyrannical bullshit That's all it is well, bro. It's a simple concept If we want a great fucking country We got to recognize that the country is made up of citizens If we want a strong coalition of citizens We have to recognize that a strong coalition of citizens is made up of individuals So if we want strong coalition of citizens that equates to a strong country We have to have strong individuals. Yeah, when the state is large the individual is small. That should be unacceptable Yes, why we have federalism the ninth and tenth amendments But there's person there's personal responsibility there that people fucking have You know, they they abandon Every single day for favor of ease and comfort and you know You know when you're talking about is an ought There's a lot of people who fucking don't understand The Trump situation like they're like all our Trump's Trump's not the answer this and that okay, but he's the best option right now And if we could fucking get the best option right now then we can work towards yeah where we need to go Like it's it's weird to me that people don't fucking grasp that Yes, I mean, it's you know, we we're myopic shortsighted and the way we did the way that we handle everything Yeah, to be honest, but to the best way to encapsulate your point This English author who's right that he's a Roman historian to some degree But he wrote a bunch of books about his name's G. K. Chesterton and he says that Men didn't love Rome because she was great the Rome was great because the men loved her right think about that That's the difference between Top down leadership and bottom up leadership. That's right Men a critical mass of people loved and believed in Rome so Rome was great And that's the country you can live in if you choose to well, and that's what we're missing And that's why when when we talk about solutions, it is not a top down solution politics is downstream of culture Culture is the solution and we after if we want to fix culture it to recognize the world that we play in culture as an individual Which means you can't bullshit your way to a great culture You have to live it you have to dedicate yourself to it you have to be committed and you have to do it when you don't fucking feel like it That's if we don't do that as individuals We cannot have a strong culture which means we cannot have a strong country and this is very simple Looks you're gonna get the government you deserve 100% of people it's a reflection of who you are as an individual 100% of people since this experiment of America began Have gotten exactly the government they deserve right including us. It's just the way it is Guys, I'm down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think about this topic, but that being said let's keep this screws moving We got a You guys kind of brought it in let's let's revisit this because there's some interesting stuff happening I always like to talk shit on the other side. Yeah, I'm reason. Yeah, you guys mentioned it Tim Walls AOC they stream video games on twitch And desperate attempt to reach young men so sure it worked. I'm sure it works. I'm sure It had to I mean it's like it's like hello fellow kids Yeah Geez, we're gonna run some pic six roll how I mean it's so cring How fucking ridiculous does that old man look like sitting in front of a fucking gaming computer with a headset on look at this shit That's what the fucking mountain do And his his his camo hat look this guy was in the national guard Um, no, he was in Afghanistan. No, he carried a weapon of war He was in cinnamon square and he certainly that's that is true actually He certainly never you stopped the tank. Yeah, he was haem. Yeah, he did it. It's very famous By the way, so he likes every time this dude says and like no no smoke on by the way Antonia Brown is fucking hilarious Where you know smoke on national guard people. I love national. I love the national guard. I work with them many many times Um, but saying that you serve for 24 years like he may have served a total of four Like actually in uniform first on the job right saying you're a football coach and you're gonna run a pic six First of all Antonia Brown is funny. I just saw this for the first time he says This is who is online playing video games with your kids every day Yeah, fucking lion Check his mother fucking hard drive dude. No, I just like the one of the odds that his hard drive has some weird shape Oh, yeah, I would say almost I mean would you oh there's something there is it upwards of 80% I'm a pot of possibility 80% yeah, I would say 100. I would be shy It would shock me if there wasn't some weird shit bro You got it you can't tell me the way that dude bro We just made that study a study was on the show about gave voice being a real thing Well, the next study is gonna come on as game movement. Mm-hmm. And that guy's got that shit now You know, Twinkle Toes fucking Timmy. What was some examples of the movement? You know Here the expert. No, I was I mean he brought it up. I thought you yeah, you did you were doing it there for saying I was like this What he does do Fucking Tim walls does dude jazz hands and fucking otter claps dude. What is no, then he does this Yeah, it's like Ryan Reynolds and fucking Deadpool when he's acting gay on purpose When the little when dog pull runs up to him and he starts clapping Tim was just does that no bro. What the fuck dude? Oh god All of duty stolen valor that's really good bro that guy creeps me out bro. He's a weirdo. Yeah I don't understand so the left so how the fuck did Kamala Harris pick this dude when she could have picked that dude and fucking Pennsylvania, but he said no. Oh, he did hear I said no. Yeah, there's there's competing theories on why he said no Some people says cuz he has young kids and he doesn't want to go be president now until they're a little older The the real theory is that he didn't want anything to do with this fucking mess Well, she's unelectable and that would have put a stain on his political career Yeah, and it did hear you want to hear my theory really quickly This is they're punting they don't have any intention of letting Kamala Harris or Tim Walls get into the White House I'm gonna say they I mean the left. I don't think they wanted to win this election They didn't have anybody teed up they waited too long to get Biden out of the way What they want to do is wreck the country and dump it on Trump so that they get Like 12 years of service in the White House after that right think about it from this perspective If Kamala Harris wins this election They can't run any of their stars Whitmer or Newsome newsome's kind of on the periphery of a bit Whitmer Shapiro and number of these people until 2032 Because they're not gonna run against her as an incumbent in 2028 Yeah, that would be that would be really bad optics right So that means they're putting an eight-year fucking post-pomant on their two rising stars in the party That ain't gonna have yeah, but see that eight-year that four-year post-pomant People have to realize they can't go to sleep and get disengaged because They are going to bring back the exact same shit that they've had Yeah Bro a lot of these people should be in fucking prison. I agree You know like and if Trump really is who the fuck he says he is He he will he will file through on that well for buddy of ours ends up as the director of the FBI We might see some movement on that. That's right. We're good by you. We'll see how that goes Yeah, I hope but yeah, it's it's some's got to happen there do to killer and by the way A vice president sitting vice president winning the presidency is only happened four times in American history The first two Right Adams and then Jefferson George H. W. Bush and then who was the fuck ahead of the same I think Grover Cleveland was the other one. Yeah, the summary end of it. Well H. W. Bush doesn't count because he was appointed Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah It's very rare that it happened to this because they carry all the baggage from the even if it's good like Reagan finished on top They were the the the The Russians were effectively defeated by then so he was able to ride that way But it very rarely happens. I just don't think that they had any attention of her. I tell you this if I had kids There's no fucking way. I'm leaving him alone with this motherfucker. No, no, he's got some real weird vibes Yeah, no, you know, by the way, he's got that mush mouth, you know, I like that you know, I like that You know what I'm talking about mush mouth. Yeah, yeah, you you mentioned a study about gay voice Stanford did a study about the face Yeah, gay face We fucking covered it last week. It was like 4,000 pictures. Yeah, I've just a gay and straight men just a still image And that's it 83% of people were able to accurately identify a gay or a straight man just by a still image of their face Right because 95 plus percent of communication. Okay, is buy this if you're showing a picture of that man. What are you saying? Um get away from my kids I'm saying he's past gay. Yeah, he's into the Yeah, my opinion. No, he's not even gay. I'd be an insult to call him gay. That's my opinion I just don't know why the left The left is supposed to be The nurturing side why are you trying to act manly just be who you are? Oh, he trusts so hard Disingenuous. I don't understand it in the harder they try it's like a Chinese figure. Well They try to be manly the gay or they look bro the thing yet. Yeah, cuz it's you they can't do it very well You couldn't even get full-fledged fucking do you had to go die it die mom do this a period of regular I mean, yeah, but like I mean if you really don't try to be Kyle, bro like listen He should have punched the whole right through that fucking dry. That's right. You want to be a real man? Yeah, which when aoc scored runner pick six You know some holes should be in the drywall. Yeah, well, while he was playing video games common among us.

Oh, here we go This clip right here. It's so funny, dude. I don't know if I'd be sober if This stuff weren't killing people to be honest with you. I know that's sad to say But that keeps me out of the risk of it, you know, it just makes it too makes a little scarier. Yeah, that's the thing It makes it scarier. Yeah, but it's also sad that somebody I mean, this is ridiculous to say probably that somebody can't You know, you can't even do cocaine in this country anymore, you know And that seemed like a crazy thing to say and Don't say it don't say that I said but I said it but but yeah, but don't say that I'm gonna steal that line that's gonna be after the election though, and I No, but a win first. It's That's pretty funny. That's that's good. Your Theo Vosfania's fuck. Yeah, so it's a jadee's a pretty good dude I like him. I think he's he seems like the I said his name out of Sketch you skit. Yeah, no out of the floor Out of the Ford people running for president vice president. I think jadee vans might be the most normal I don't think that that's definitely true. I don't know if it's normal I think it's just because of his age. He's he's able to relate more maybe with the people You know, I think Trump's pretty fucking normal. He's just fucking. Oh, his name is zackarific You see miss kizackarific night. It's fucking his look at us. Give the due to follow. He's fucking funny Is he bit where's what's his platform Instagram? I guess it's I guess tick-tock in Instagram I just saw him for the first time and I saw him on Brad Brad Martin show and then fucking I went and checked him out I fucking laughed my ass off pretty funny Yeah, but real quick on this second highlight. Let's talk about the voting real quick because there's there's interesting things going out different topics That are the things that are happening right now One of the stories today that came out Is that apparently ballot boxes are being set on fire And in different states they have two states right now Oregon and Washington Where police are investigating two separate Incidents where fires were set at ballot boxes. It's just eight days until the election day And what appears to be serious cases of attempted election interference in Portland, Oregon Police are investigating after a ballot box in southeast Portland was let on fire early Monday morning and hundreds of votes were destroyed Officials responded to the fire around 3 30 a.m. By the time they arrived the fire had already been put out by security employees working in the area And then also at another ballot box in Vancouver, Washington um, and so It's Vancouver huh? Yeah, and Vancouver, Washington Now I mean those places don't strike me as like you know the the epicenter of conservative, you know strong Well, there's one election in in Washington where the repube as I like to call them Is winning and it's a joke can't be familiar with him Joe Kent Shannon Kent's husband Shannon Kent is the choose killed right so that yeah that that show lioness is about her She's the top She might be the the number one intelligence operator in the history of this country She's responsible for like six seven hundred dudes bad dudes getting fucking warheads dropped on their face good But yeah, she she was kia 2019, I think jane or 2019 Yeah, he's running for office. He's run he ran last time too and then went but he's last I heard he's up in the polls right yeah I follow this is I like we get that's in the south that's in I think their third district and that's all the way south and you're the Portland border This is Vancouver is all the way up near the what do you think of this border? I mean I I don't know it's interesting because I mean we've definitely been seeing a push for more This is the crazy shit I'm talking about these people do this shit when I'll repercussions unhinged Listen man, we need some fucking fear in this country We need these people these people that are willing to cheat in elections and do all this shit like I really do hope Trump Fouls through on every single person down to the motherfuckers do shit like this. Yeah, like those that person who ever did that Should go to prison for their fucking wrestler line and everybody should know they if you fuck around with the election in any way shape or form You should go to prison forever if everybody knew that We would have free and fair elections because people will be afraid to do this shit. Yeah, yeah It's just sucks because like I mean like you don't know how many ballots were in there Right could have been thousand well here. I'll tell you this um I'm not sure about organ or what their processes But I know in the state of Washington. There's something called ballot curing right so you can check on Washington's Election website whether or not your ballot was was actually counted right if it's been counted yet Um and if not you have to go down to the election office and do what's called ballot curing curing like curing meat or something like that's what's called a provisional ballot or something like yeah You you fill out a provisional ballot and then you got to keep you got to check back in and make sure that one got counted Right, it's on you to do it nobody else can do it for you But I don't know about organ. I'm sure it's probably the same But I know in Washington they do that because Joe has had issues with this before yeah But yeah, this is like That's unacceptable and and every possible way. I don't know what you would What's the difference between that And and working for a foreign government something you want to mean like it and by the way the Elections get stolen all the time globally speaking. It's not always yeah, we kind of we kind of set the standard for that Brotherhood bays stolen election in the late part of the 19th century to stop reconstruction right so it's not always The dams either but usually if it's If it's dead people voting or ballot harvesting or any of that stuff, it's almost always left And fire usually the left as well. This picture is just so ridiculous. I'm playing a video game Like it's so ridiculous It's not great man.

I can't more who it was and he was telling me how he has a exercise verse Video game exchange. So however many minutes. I believe he said something like however many minutes they Exercise is how many minutes they get to play the game? I mean that teaches you a lot of stuff. Yeah consequences. You should you have to earn your fucking leisure time Which you should like that should be something programmed in your brain sound a problem with that You know what I'm saying?

Let's them down in comments What you guys think but that's different in video games I'm actually learning a real skill of how draper race car. Yeah, it's different. It's a valid investment Yeah, yeah, I mean There's is it's call of duty like real shit because you've actually like had to do call of duty shit No, so you don't get you don't get to pick up Revive random fucking plates off the ground and stuff them in your carry on to get shot twice and keep going and pick up another point Okay, so so basically so spawn point race car race car games are good everything else Bad yeah, I mean look nobody's ever gotten better at sports by pressing X. Yeah, that's right. I wouldn't think Maybe that shit. I don't know there there was max hallway did used to talk about how he would learn moves from the MMA video game By the UFC video back in the day, but I think he saw it's right this weekend idea then he went to the mat and actually did it You see his fight this weekend? No, man now was I was running he got knocked a fuck out If I felt bad for him because usually he's knocking motherfuckers out. He's not used to that. Yeah, when something really happens Yeah, well, it's gonna try to throw the final headline guys. This is a topic one to bring back You know, we've been covering this very in depth then I know you have um Personal interest in this topic as well, so you know, I think it's important to that people don't forget Um that our country is you know Things are still happening. We still need Attention and energy towards certain things. So let's let's just cover it Talking about the the hurricane damage North Carolina Things like that. Not sure if you guys saw loop combs their church they just raised Um over 24 million dollars for hurricane victims at a star-study concert for Carolina Uh, that's awesome. They featured James Taylor Keith Urban Cheryl Crow. Yeah, I think it was um loop combs already had the The Show booked but once this happened they got pushed a week and it was like well We just invite a bunch of people and throw this party and raise a bunch of money for people Luke Combs a great dude. Yeah, I mean it's pretty fucking awesome, man Um, I think that's the best thing is like you know throughout this time like we've seen the Urban Nicole Kim is still married. I would assume so otherwise what the fuck was she be doing there? You know that'd be a weird for her to show up by the way Randy Travis showed up too and he's Coming back from cancer right now really yeah, so good for him. Yeah Cheryl Crow another cancer person came coming back and And the show it's just it's just nice to see like you know the people still give a fuck You know, I'm saying like wherever you know, we obviously came rely on the government. Yeah, no help I mean the most generous Charity in the history of human beings is the American public and you can see this all the time Anything anytime anything whether it's here in the US or somewhere else You don't see people in and no no offensive thing, but you don't see people in Asia or Germany or fucking anywhere else Getting on the phone and fucking like hey how can we come help you guys? Americans will fucking get on a plane and go fly somewhere to help people. Yeah, I don't know what it is About Our American spirit bro. Yeah, I mean I just don't I can't it's hard to pinpoint sometimes. No, it's just we've we've got away from it a little bit That's all way my whole lifetime. That's how it's been it's always been that way it should be I mean like the in the All of the the skills the gifts the talents The whatever the access the resources you have Are designed not to make your life better But for you to use to help other people be the kind of person that uses favors to help other people right and you'll get more and more Favours you'll always notice that This is how we're biologically programmed the week the reason that we Build civilization the reason that we build walls around things isn't because their week It's because they're important to us, right? It's hard. It's been hard to convince The modern Woman of this and then convince the modern man to this is how they should behave There's a lot of this black pill nihilism going around these fucking sigma males What do they want to call themselves like all life's not fair? So I'm just gonna Retreat. Yeah, like you're a fucking pussy, dude That that is completely unacceptable. You're the man. You're the leader That is your job to step the fuck up and do the work. That's it, right? And if you're out there collecting resources or collecting skills You better be doing it for something other than just yourself otherwise you're gonna be a miserable cunt your entire life That's just how it is man. I mean, Gandhi says if you want to I don't want to be a cut now. You don't want to be that Gandhi says if you want to find him yourself would be a happy kind Gandhi says if you want to find yourself lose yourself in the service of others Oh, bro. It's especially true for a man. It's the key to fulfillment happiness man Like even if it's your fucking pets. Yeah, you know what I mean? Like just do it like you'll never You'll never be able to reach people laugh at me, dude because I don't have kids and they fucking they're like Oh, you make your fucking animals your kids. Yeah, you're fucking right You know what bro when I go out and see my ducks, you know what I think my ducks got the best life out of any ducks Ever I like that makes me feel good. Well, that's that's like that that's how you exercise The provide protect Without becoming egocentric and my ducks fucking kill you. They are highly trained battle ducks. Oh, racist I'll fight those ducks. No, no fucking kill you. I'll find them. No, I'll dress up like a duck. That'll be the end of you Bro, I'm telling you I got him trained. I'll dress up like a duck and then I'll start breeding with them Over time I'll develop a superhuman duck human hybrid dance bit of the duck more for a minute Just like a little fucking Howard and ducks come right out. Yeah, but they've got like ginger beauty Oh Fuck my bad dude. So you changed his name to Daffy Yeah, this is great a lot of people have been helping A lot of people you'll never hear about Like you'll hear about us because we've got social media followings you'll hear about Ian went Who was super helpful down there's what he says he's coming after you about something? I don't know he told me to tell you that he's what he's coming for you the fuck out of here bro. Yeah, you never He knows what I'm talking about. That's what he said Yeah, he keeps fucking talking about how he's gonna get more jack than me. It's not listen. This is a message to you Ian Never fucking happened But yeah a lot of dudes like that on the ground my friend Chelsea and Hunter 7 foundation It's a charity that screens about her it's for cancer early stage to keep it from dying great organization But they're there on the ground rebuilding stuff. There's hundreds of people like this organizations and individuals that you'll never hear about That is the America that we all want to live in is that one right? So be that person one and if you can't get there physically send your support and your finance what are your resources? What do you do however you can yeah just do something? Yeah, I think it's amazing I have a lot of respect for Ian and the crew and all the guys out there on the ground Yeah, we've gone there, you know, I fucked it and there's a million people there unnamed and unknown Who are there giving their labor, you know, it's one thing to donate a little money because you can Pick up the phone because you can it's another thing to go do the work Yeah, I can make more money, but I can't make more time that's right when you take your time out of That doesn't mean that what you're doing or what I'm doing isn't valuable It's just I have a lot of respect for the people that are willing to go there and do the work Yeah, none of the like I Martialing resources doesn't matter if somebody doesn't pick up a fucking hammer. That's right And there's plenty of people that are yeah, it's fucking cool. Yeah quite a few Was it really is bad there Because I mean obviously like we see these things and headlines or the independent media sources, right? But like what really was the temperature? What was the opt-simps on the ground? So a lot of a lot of really stupid shit happened right The we I don't think the federal government should even exist I think it's like it should be 12 dudes that are doing accounting and that's it 12 CPAs That's what the government should be but if it does exist and people rely on it and it constantly fails them Then somebody's got to be held accountable for this the biggest issue in this particular iteration with Helene and North Carolina was governor Roy Cooper who is an absolute fucking retard, right? So There is there's a way to go about this um I have I guess maybe some unique experience because I work for home and security I have Hundreds of hours of FEMA training because I was studying to become a certified emergency manager And I was also in the 82nd airborne, right as an aperture guy so A couple things on this the first lesson from Katrina. There's two main lessons from Katrina the first one is uh Sends Title two authority to title 10 immediately right that is a say give control of the ICS the ins and the command system and the national guard to federal authorities immediately for a number of reasons one The interconnectivity of the J9 it's a joint group that has representatives from all the relevant agencies and the military right So you have all the the All the reps that you need to get anything done all in one shot all the communication the line's relationship everything right um The other one is don't try to recreate the wheel and list private organizations that are capable of doing certain things like Back of the day was Walmart. Let's get Walmart to set up supply lines for food and and water because that's what the fuck they do Why are we trying to recreate something already exists you know what I mean and And they didn't do any of that in North Carolina out of ego. There was actually out well. I'll get to this in a second, but He didn't want to see control Um of the ICS to federal authority for a number of reasons one There was a female colonel on his staff that convinced everybody in the immediate area That apolachia people would just murder any fucking female people that came nearby so that's where okay because we Then they they created this fucking lie that armed militias were driving around with signs female get out It was one dude one guy and they tried to send and this this stupid motherfucker Created scenario where all the resources that could have been there FEMA actually did a tactical pause for a moment people out right who knows what happened I know that like the week after that happened five people died of hypothermia Because they didn't have the resources they're sleeping outside still right now Right now there's still people sleeping outside and it's about to get cold up there in the mountains Um the other part of it is you've got the not even about the proximity, but you got the 82nd airborne right down the street This is what we specialize in jumping into a hostile territory usually an airfield, but anywhere Securing the area with the inventory and then food and hospital and logistics So we set up a small city, right? So everybody else can come in and we have now we have a forward operating base Literally the specialty the 82nd airborne to right down the street all you had to do is call and I can tell you this The people that are in command over there of 18th airborne core 82nd airborne they were standing by they had their guys on base packed up ready to go And no call ever came for like a week and finally they got a call And it was like okay, you can come but we're still in charge. What the fuck are you talking about? Why why to what end right so you can take credit for something? No, you fucked it all up and people died because of it But Cooper is a lame duck. He's on this way out. He's serving his last term right now. It's over So he's never got a face any accountability for it. Yeah It's crazy, man. How can how can people help? Well, you got to find I mean look here here's what I what you don't want to do don't just show up right And don't you know there was a lot of that yeah, there a lot of people got turned away and they're like oh they're turning us away It's like yeah, because like they things need to be organized to be effective um The the best thing people can do is Find or start organizations that do this kind of stuff specifically um, there's a number of them out there um save our allies is the one I work with uh and if you If you don't remember save our allies during the Afghanistan withdrawal in 2021 We're the organization that got 12,000 people us citizens out of Afghanistan after the government But fuck that situation too got people out of Israel, Haiti, so on right all over the all over the world Uh, Tim Kennedy and those guys Nick Paul Mishon a bunch of people that I can't say because they're still working in government Um a lot a lot of dudes did a lot of good work the CEO is Sarah Varado One of my best friends and business partners and if you find an organization like that Right you you can you can actually Instead of just moving cups of water you can start to move gallons of water right that's the difference Um, and that's what I recommend people doing and don't wait for the next one to happen start looking into it now and by the way It's not over Some of these months and months and months years yeah, I mean bro, they're there are there are 53 billion dollars There are people who are not gonna sleep indoors until Six months from now. Yeah, that's right that are up there right now There are places that won't have power for a year right because of how Remote they are and shit like that. It's gonna be a mess bro, and it's not like the The people who are without power and without shelter These aren't like soldiers bro that are used these are like elderly people It's really sad. Yeah, there's a lot and that just This is I wrote my master's thesis on the energy grid my master's degrees and I only it's international homeland security, right My thesis was on the energy grid and how susceptible it is to attack if If power goes out in a region or whatever it's devastating if it goes out in a larger region So if if the nine major hubs in the US got knocked down three million people die in the first month 90% of people are dead in 18 months if we don't turn it back on because of hygiene, sanitation, shit like that Running water people don't die from heat they die from the cold always um It's a bad situation and they're up in the mountains. I mean, this is this is not good. It's not good. So don't lose focus I know the news cycle likes to move on. Oh brother. They haven't even said anything about it in fucking two weeks Try to find any order but you're not gonna look if if you you know intellectually That you can't wait for the government to come save you you damn sure shouldn't wait for the fucking media Who's just a puppet arm of the government anyways come save you uh reach out to people that are working there right and and do what you can you know, I mean right now we're collecting I've got one group of friends who are buying RVs and campers and sending them up there I have another group that's getting tense and and this but this particular type of tent It looks like a tv that has a heater and heating element inside of it stuff like that But these people are gonna be fucked for a little while right and The government's just not gonna help They're they'll Take credit for things and do this or do that a little bit It's just like why but why would you even want the government? Why why rely on what what what what's think about this Anytime you're getting something from the government. What did you give up to get it? Right what what's the government? What's the state purchasing with that little favor? They did for you because it's almost always not worth it. I'll tell you that yeah I just want the bleeding hearts that put the you know you crane For like in there. Where are all those people that that's what let's be real about that Where are all those motherfuckers and Tifa where are you fuckers that fucking claim to be about The the next social thing you post the black square you post the Ukraine flag you post the Israel flag You fucking post every mother fucking thing that's out there why we're the fucker you guys now Because the last I see I haven't seen anybody saying shit about this. It's it's super irritating You all fucking act like you're all holy and fucking virtuous to shit until there's actually something that happens that you have to do something And you don't do it. It's just it's all a fucking show for most of these people bro They don't actually care. They just don't want to be the outcast of the next social fucking initiative. Right It's they should be re just rename as as very fucking you know keve And I get some some extra support down. It's fucking bullshit. I'm not saying. Well, I've seen I yeah, it's kiff. I'm not what I'm doing that. Yeah, what it was it's kiff. Yeah, the fucking media changed it Then they made that shut up a couple years ago. I'm not doing no shit. Yeah, it's not keve. It's fucking kiff There's always the kids this one small group in Ukraine that calls it Keve but it's not the majority as a matter of fact It's the 40% of Ukraine is Russian right ethnic Russian so fuck off. I'm not Not Everything's just sucks Everything sucks. No, it doesn't suck. Hey, we're better off than we were fucking four years ago Not because of the what's going on, but because a lot of people are waking to fuck up Yeah, you know you and I up three of us and you know a lot of people listening here Have been on this message for a long time and we had zero support In fact, we got fucking shot for every single fucking day. Yeah now people are like oh Oh, I get it. Okay, and my bro. I still get that's that's that's good I still get asked almost on a daily basis how the fuck do you guys have sponsors? Because I say wild shit all the time. I don't know fuck. I've never I'd never stopped saying wild shit I mean aren't I mean you guys watching Right so that's another I'm a proud sponsor Yeah, that's a hell away that's another way that's right By the way, that's another way that you can help not by sponsoring people by being successful Yeah, be like make yourself successful and use that success to support other successful people That's right. I mean like nobody who believe you believe it. Yeah, nobody eats alone in this world. Yeah Yeah Guys, I love it god jumping on this conversation.

Have you seen the horse in the suit? It's just hilarious man put your dog in a fucking suit. No, it's a good look bro. I'm down with it I think it's I think he's right. I think culture needs to make come back and honestly if we're being completely real I believe that we are in a cycle for that to make a come back fashion is usually cyclical for us right But not for dude so much. We just kind of wear the same stupid shit. Oh, yeah, but I also think that it I've thought a lot about this I actually think that Culture has suffered greatly Because of the informality of our dress code I really believe so I mean dude look the shit that and this is man And women I'm not picking but like you know when you go out in public or you look on Instagram Chicks got her fucking ass cheeks hanging out of her shorts and shit like bro you're it's just cheap It's cheap shit and you got guys You know who look like they're they're in their forties and they look like they're wearing fucking pajamas and shit like bro It's just not good for culture man, and I really you know I wear workout clothes, so I can't like I can't say I'm any better, but well, there's also a gym right there Yeah, and that's what I do yeah, but you know when I leave the house. That's not what I look like You know, I wear a fucking suit usually or a fucking really nice jeans and a black v-neck But the point is is I think I think this is gonna make a comeback Yeah, I think I think it should Thumbs up. Yeah, I like it too a lot. Yeah, I think it's super important to culture that men dress nice and Present themselves properly I mean it's broken window theory, right? So it's some degree It's social you know broken window theory is no it's a it's a theory in criminology where if you Prosecute low-level crimes especially vandalism and low like just other low-level crimes like that and keep the neighborhood looking nice people will treat it nicely Yes, that's the theory. That's true social theory. Yeah. Why not do the same for yourself. Yeah walk out Out of your house looking like a pile of garbage people are gonna treat you like one dude look it look just okay Just go get fucking gas and walk in the fucking gas station anywhere in fucking America and just take inventory of what the dudes look like You know, I'm not talking about working class dudes that are there getting there You know, I'm talking about somebody that's on the way or whatever Yes, they're out and about not not home Yeah, I'm not talking about dude on the way home from the job or on the way to the job That's not what I'm talking about.

It just does and like a lot of dudes have no fucking swag and no style at all Riz they call it now. Well, is that what it is? It is called yeah, yeah, I call swag Sauce sauce. No sauce. No sauce. Yeah, but think about it like You're representing something every time you go out. Yeah, your family the I mean this was a big thing back in the military Like hey, you're out there representing me. Yeah, so you better fucking act right. Yeah, I mean, but that's just having the Left and right limit of that standard is a good thing for everybody I think I agree and also to that that's one part But the other part is just culture like this is what we do here.
