It's a real story. It's verified Down in Georgia. We gotta go down to Georgia Georgia is a nice state. Yeah, like Georgia. It's all right very historic state I would say out of the states that Georgia is in you know I think Georgia's in my top 10 oh States that's high. No, I don't think so I like Georgia the countryside's beautiful. They got beautiful You know estates down there they got stone mountain they got Savannah, George. They got the Savannah bananas Yep, Savannah's nice a lot of great Savannah was nice. Yeah, Atlanta's nice people people talk shit on Atlanta But I like Atlanta a lot of homo sapiens there well, you know what I like about Atlanta Is that everybody dresses up man you go out. There's some classy people out you know what I'm saying? Anyway Let's go to Georgia real quick. Yeah, this is actually a really fucked up story But I want to get your take on this man, okay, so the headline reads Georgia dad For leaving young kids at McDonald's to attend job interview. I saw this dude. Let's dive into a little bit It's a tough scenario. It's very tough. Yeah, let's hear it. It's tough. So a Georgia father of three Was arrested for leaving his young children unattended at a McDonald's to go to a nearby interview Chris Lewis who's 24 years of age Allegedly walked with his three kids from his apartment to the restaurant in Augusta just before 4.30 p.m. on March 22nd according to the Augusta press the youngsters ages 1 6 and 10 Spent their time alone in the restaurant Which has an indoor play area attached to the dining room Lewis was seen leaving the fast food joint returning shortly after to check on his kids before leaving again Where we customer told police the outlet reported which recount he sheriffs deputies arrived at the restaurant and located the unharmed Unoccupied minors who remained inside the store until their father returned Lewis returned to the McDonald's just before 6.20 p.m. Where police confronted him for leaving his children alone Lewis who doesn't own a car Tole police he left his children behind because he didn't want them to walk back to his home as he went to the interview the outlet reported Police waited inside with Lewis until the children's mom arrived to take her kids home. Lewis was arrested and charged with deprivation of a minor now The mom couldn't fucking watch him for fucking half an hour. I went to an interview to try to better the fucking their lives If fucking suck listen dude this story actually like really pissed me off the sucks. Yeah, it sucks man Like I mean not at him. No, I mean like like look bro. It's a poor choice. Yeah Okay, like But fucking could have left him that fucking there. I mean a thousand other places you could have fucking left him at that would have been 10 times worse I mean he could have taken the interview put him in the fucking lobby You know like bro somebody brought their kids to interview and that's all they had to I would understand that for sure You know in fact, I think that's happened a couple times. Yeah Do the sucks it does suck and it sucks that like okay The mother couldn't watch the kids for fucking hour. Yeah, you know or or Dude, it's just it's such that some variables we don't know and now they're gonna probably call family services It's gonna cause all kinds of other trouble. This is where the system gets it fails. Yeah, it does it fails these things for sure And you know when you're really at the beginning stages of trying to Better yourself the system is very difficult to work through and and well What what what you mean it's supposed to like you know be beneficial to people trying to break out the fucking You know terrible matrix that you know they depend on us being in yeah, I mean look dude It's just it just reinforces all the things we talk about here on the show man You know they want people to struggle they wanted to be hard on people they want it you know the fact that this dude got arrested for this In my opinion like I'm sure it's against the law, but I mean fuck guys like Don't don't we I don't know Like you left me go get some fucking drugs. Yeah, I'm gonna go fuck you know that's what I'm saying like get a fucking job man dude, and it's just like It's just due to it I saw it and it bothered me too, but it sucks. Yeah, fucking sucks But remember for every one of these guys that we hear about there's a fucking shit time that we don't yeah for sure, you know and Yeah, bro, this bum me out when I saw it dude. It's up. Here's a guy who a young man who's 24 who already has a lot of Responsibility in his life for 24. That's a lot. Okay He's probably not getting any help for anybody the guy's trying to get a job I don't know, you know like it's just I don't know it doesn't seem right no But the good thing is there are good people in this world. Yeah, you know, and it's always funny too Like the people who you know get the most heat or the most hate They tend to be the ones with the biggest fucking hearts. That's usually how it works Enteres the relay of show we got a B Antonio Brown He's doing some really awesome stuff. Yeah, I guess he saw it somewhere I came across it. He put this tweet out saying Anybody know how to get a hold of Chris would love to help him and You know put the link to the article and stuff and and you know That wasn't enough. He then started a go fund me for Chris And it did an initial funding on it and And published it using his own personal platform to do so And other people started jumping in on it Tony O'Brown started to go fund me for that dad That was arrested as job interview father who has struggled immensely. I will be donating urge all fathers to do the same and At the time of the recording and it's almost made it to its goal of $50,000 is at like 48 grand right now Maybe you know posted a follow up saying almost made it to go Sometimes people just need help Happy to help Chris and his family get a stable life spoke to the family They have been homeless since November trying to make it next up will be helping Chris land a job I like that a lot The only thing I would say to that is that don't just give them the money and just look You can't give people large sums of money that have never had large sums of money and expect them to make the right decisions with it All right, we see this in the NFL. We see this with now in college with N.I.L And it goes no different for this man $50,000 more money this dude's probably ever seen this whole life Okay, it's more money than most people will have it one time in their life And that's fucked up that's sad, but that's the truth and I would encourage Some of the men who are trying to help him to also get him connected with some people that would help him Allocate those funds wisely So that they don't just come in and go out for sure, you know what I'm saying? I'm in the same position Correct. I mean you gotta remember to like it's not even just he's 24 You know I'm saying like there's very little life experience there. He's gonna know and guidance You know $50,000 can go real quick if you just Don't understand what you're doing. Yeah, 100% man. So yeah, we'll shout out to a b-man. Yeah, that's fucking awesome dude And the McDonald's is not commented on it. So I mean don't have anything on that for right now, but Listen, why do you think they didn't? Who McDonald's yeah, oh Well think about it from a business owner standpoint. Why wouldn't you do that? Why would McDonald's not give $10,000 or $100,000 or even just off for a fucking job. Why? People do it intentionally So their places will become a place where people try to replicate this story or to get yes With I mean that's the other the sucky part of humanity in society in this. Yeah, but that's true. It's a real thing It's reality. Yeah A lot there's a lot of people that will try to take advantage of any Good heart. Yeah, yeah, it's just the way it is 100% man Yeah, I'm gonna follow the story and we'll see if any updates come out of this man. It's a good luck to you brother Hope it all works out, but yeah, man. What that being said Let's let's get into some of our main headlines here I remember guys if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com You guys can check them all out there or come hang out with us on YouTube and See some of these articles here with that being said. Let's get to our first set of headlines. We got headline number one This one was interesting court booker book booker. I almost said bugger. You did say bugger same thing. Okay, same thing He is The first African American to break the record of filibusters Standard of Corey Booker's marathon filibuster against Trump agenda goes on and on and finally ends after he breaks Senate record What's the longest you ever had to talk like speak? And once yeah at one time or over the course of a day No, I mean well no like one stop one full session Probably three hours. Okay. Yeah, all right without a break without a break. Yeah, no no pissing break Yeah, yeah, this dude just went 25 hours. Yeah, 25 fucking hours without going to the bathroom without nothing It's impressive. It's just fucking impressive. It's for you. I probably word diaper I'd imagine I'd be a bro. I can't go more than 25 hours without shit And when I do it's never good. You're 25 on 25 off Yeah, you're like the fucking firehouse bro. Yeah Yeah, um well Since we love you guys so much I have the full 25 hours of of speech here. We're gonna watch the whole thing check this out It's getting good trouble my friend madam president I yield the floor That's enough of that shit. Yeah, you did this this this full speech Not really sure what what he was trying to accomplish. Oh, yeah, it's a selfish Goal I want to be the person with the longest filibuster. You know, it didn't achieve any listen It's indicative of the focus that these people have It is not about achieving things. It is not about helping anybody. It's not about solving any problems It's about what's in it for them and what was in it for him is for him to say I have the record now I don't know if you watched much of this but it was ridiculously stupid, okay, and this was some sort of a mix between Martin Luther King the wish version of Martin Luther King and like Incoherent babbling that you would hear in a corporate environment a lot of yapping. Yes a lot of yapping And it was all it was just some garbage shit, you know and you know At some point in time We have to start recognizing that if you're not trying to solve the problem you don't belong In Congress Period, yeah, and that's what these people are all about if you watch You know people and by the way, this is not a partisan statement. This is a bipartisan issue a Lot of these people are out there flying their own flag getting their own credit trying to create their own brand because we live in a world of Technology where your personal brand is the most beneficial and We've gotten away from these people even pretending like they're trying to solve problems Moved into this phase where it is all look at me. You know what I'm saying? We just discussed. Yeah, let's discuss. Yeah, I mean he did not say any and then they're all clapping and cheering like why would you all clap and cheer for? 25 hours of total nonsense, right wasting the American. Yeah, why would you do that? Yeah, why would well because that's how they all think and so I actually think this is a perfect Metaphor for how these people look and think about themselves dude Once even crazy is like right when he got going to start this whole thing Apparently one of the staffers got arrested for carrying a gun on Capitol Browns So and like I looked into this a little bit of a parent. It's not you know nothing crazy He got was a he's a former police officer thought he could carry inside you can't carry inside even if you're former Eleo so there's that you know that that all came up, but that's that's not the big news of the day Andy today is a great day. It's it's a liberation day Yeah, liberation day in the end of the world's trade war against America. So Trump You know, he's been touting this April 2nd date being a very significant date the golden era of America being Liberation day. I actually tweeted this out from the White House's account today It's liberation day in America president Trump with some emojis And it's that's a pretty badass picture. I can't lie. It's not bad But I mean a lot of things are coming to come come into a head here one of the You know people people everybody I think had their opinions on these tariffs and shit like that and like all It's gonna ruin the economy. It's gonna destroy it stuff's gonna get so much more expensive, but like you know There was a there is there's another route this could also go which at the time of the recording it seemed like it's definitely going But I got some numbers here when I throw up for you. This is From 2024, okay, so this just shows you the last pretty much last year of Biden's presidency What the state of the economy basically was in this is a good shot of looking at it. This is just our trade goods, okay? Our net exports what we went and what left this country went down roughly 2.6% Okay While on net imports What we brought into the United States went up three and a half percent Now those percentages may not seem like a lot, but when you put them in you know dollar numbers We're talking over a quarter of a trillion dollars extra That we spent in 2024 Now with all of the stuff going on Trump, you know, he narrowed down this list and It's about 15 countries that are basically abusing The tax dollars here in this country and there's literally what they're doing. They're charging like I mean Japan charges a 700% tax on Rice that we in tariff tariff. Yeah on rice Important. Yeah, yeah, 700% This listen This is what people do not understand These other economies cannot survive without American consumption of their goods So when they come in here, they are not up until today tariffed the proper way and when we send stuff to their countries We end up with a three to 700% tariff on things like rice and food and all kinds of things okay services. Yes Now that is intentional because the purpose of the government in The last 20 fucking years straight has been to make America actually weaker by making us dependent on Other people to provide us with our goods and services and what Trump is doing because he understands those countries cannot survive Without us consuming their goods and services Okay He real and we can survive without theirs All right, and the reason that all these American manufacturing jobs and American made jobs and why American made goods are more expensive Right now Is because these countries are allowed to send their products in Made with slave labor and cheap labor over there with no real tariff On their product while if we send it over there We can't compete price-wise so what it does is it makes us non competitive in our own country and in their country Which removes the need for us to manufacture really anything and we become a country of consumers which creates a scenario where We have less jobs. We have less production. We are strategically Far more unsafe than we would be if we made our own shit Okay, because let's say everybody gets mad at America and they say guess what we're not gonna send you anymore China says okay bricks guys. We're not gonna send you any more of this or any more of that or any more of this or any more of that and We're not in a position to produce it on our own what happens here. We have product shorters. We have supply-shane sources. We have You know potentially starvation and issues like real big issues And if you were gonna go to war with the United States That's where the war starts That is where they start Okay, and they start with trade embargoes and things like that to cut off supply chain so this is not just about jobs and Profit which it that's a big part of it all by products. Yes, but also Which is not talked about enough is that it's about the Independence and safety of of this country and its people so there's going to be an adjustment period here that You know things may get a little bit more expensive for a minute and Then they're gonna adjust back to where they are as the products start to come to be made here So you know when people argue about this they the arguments they make are not very smart, you know they say things like Well, that's gonna make this go to this okay. Yes temporarily it will But what is also going to force is it's going to force that company to manufacture those goods here Which is gonna create more jobs for you and your family? Okay, and it's gonna allow us to buy Truly made in America goods at cheaper than what we would be able to buy Ship from China, which is the opposite of what it is now So there's going to be a readjustment and that puts our country in a position of Strategic and economic power and most people can't think that far ahead and that's not their fault brother struggling You know I'm saying most people want to go buy goods the cheapest they can but they don't think about what that's actually costing us and what it's cost us over the last 30 years is legitimately our strategic security And safety so we have to understand that and if Trump really you know If they really wanted to make the economy the best it could be they would follow up these tariffs With a huge tax cut cutting from where we are to like a flat tax of 10% Which would allow more cash flow to enter the market that by it would it would increase the standard of living because the cash flow to go into the market People could afford more goods and while the goods raised in price they wouldn't have no problem paying During the adjustment period because they would have to pay less tax So if you manipulated and turn these dials just a little bit You know and that's why it's so ridiculous to me to watch these people complain and bitch and protest and Do ridiculous shit because it's like dude. What are you doing like you're protesting for literally a much more expensive and Lessor quality of life like you don't even understand what the fuck you're doing now. They don't man The countries that include this cut. I thought this was interesting countries that include this so these countries they're in the top 15% of countries where They we have the highest trading deficit, okay, so this is China the European Union Mexico Vietnam Ireland Germany Taiwan Japan South Korea Canada India Thailand Italy Switzerland Malaysia Indonesia France Austria and Sweden and by the way when you go and buy shit What are the most common names on the shit that you buy here in America? Oh, it's all of them all of Malaysia Mexico in Indonesia China, right? So so they can sell their shit here, but We can't sell our own shit here and we can't sell our own shit there How does that work? How is it fair? for me to To sell your products in my store, but you won't sell my products in your store How does that benefit me and if you if I do I'm gonna charge your shit to sell. Yeah, that's how it's that up Yes, so so we they have created a consumer environment here in the United States for the purpose of strategically weakening The security of this country You gotta remember dude when we're making our own energy and we're making our own products and we are self-sufficient We're the nobody could fuck with the United States Like at all in any way, okay, but that's strategically been removed step by step by step by step by step by step By all of these establishment politicians Bro George Bush and Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and George Bush seat those are all the all those guys are from the same fucking party dude They're they're them, you know, the more us like it doesn't matter if it was Bush or Clinton or fucking All these guys are establishment guys and so they've intentionally weakened the country and you know Well, I have my criticisms of Trump and I have my doubts about Some of the decisions he makes and who he supports sometimes It's very clear that this guy is not a Part of the same establishment that these people have been a part of because this will strategically strengthen our company our country Which is a company? It is a fuck yeah, you know, but there was an option to right, you know Thanks could get more expensive for sure if like these temporarily if don't we they don't react to the research or We just stop selling their shit and then they're fucked which by the way they can't live without us Selling their shit that's what Trump understands countries like Canada for example, bro The state of Texas has a bigger GDP. Yes, the entire country of Canada. Yeah, you know, I'm saying to us I we would be fine listen bro all these countries would be third world shit holes without the people of America Consuming their products 100% and that's why they fucking do this shit And so this leads me to this this other possible out option Which appears to be you know gaining some steam around the world Which I am I'm of the belief that it might have been Trump's intention the whole time But you start seeing stuff like this Israel ends all tariffs on US goods ahead of Liberation day. Well, that's the first thing I've seen Israel do for us You know, I guess you know, they're giving us a bagel. You know I'm saying Thanks for the bagel guys. I like bagels Man, but yeah, so so Israel's back and out now in the turn of events Canada I'm Terry O Premier Ford Canada will drop all tariffs of Trump does see this is an interesting Listen because they cannot this is what I'm saying bro They cannot survive without the American consumer we consume more shit here in America like it or hate it Then fucking anybody else regardless of the number of people that live here So they cannot survive without us he knows that he knows it He knows it so shit may not even get more expensive bro. This is like cheaper. Yes That's that that is a third that that looks like it's gonna be that way because like these are two Now we got a couple of more again the show you know, it's everything well. They don't have leverage bro The bigger the bigger countries that produce more gonna have more leverage like China's got actual leverage, okay? fucking You motherfuckers up there in Canada they try to pass you I'd be like oh, yeah, well fuck the US. What are you talking about bro? You are only Canada because we allow you to be it's real yeah, you guys would be speaking English regular English over here Yeah, I mean dude, it's just true like you're Canada because we allow you to be Canada. That's it They could not do anything about it. There's nothing they could do so and then they posture I mean like oh, we're gonna we're gonna fucking tear off all the United States 400 percent. Okay. Well, you're gonna fucking starve Yeah, it's just bullshit like have you seen the videos of the you know, I guess the strong Canadian men You know, they're out there with the fucking you know Ranger panties in the snow and shit and like oh, American things they can come take us a you know, yes Yes, I'm not saying we want to I'm just saying let's accept let's accept reality bro, okay You're allowed to exist because you're allowed to exist. It's not because you have any Real ability to do anything about it now and and be real dude not only do we allow you to exist We also allow you to not be invaded by other countries, right? Okay, so let's just We love I love Canadian I do too. I'm also listen. I'm just this show is it's fucking tyrants though This show is called real AF. It's not called let's pretend Okay, and the real truth is is that you guys up there exist as Canada Because you're allowed to all right, so When you pot when these leaders posture like that Trump's in the office laughing. No, just I'd be in the office lab Like did you hear this fucking guy? You know like it's crazy man, bro that'd be like that would be like you know It would be like a fucking snow cone stand Trying to like argue with first form, you know say it like right What do you do? I just make snow cones and I'll set up next you can give them away for fucking free You know what I'm saying like yeah I mean you want to stop people fucking with you So it was one way to do it listen. I've had to tell people that before I've had people fuck with me And I say man, you know if you want to fuck with me that bad I'll just open up whatever the fuck it is you do and I'll do it for free And then they get they get in line real quick, you know Change his man. Yeah, I said this could be all a part of the great down plan I don't know we got plenty of time to see it and check in on it though But guys you let us know what you guys think down in the comments. Let us know Hey, look You guys we can all say whatever we want about Trump, you know, I personally still fucking really like him. I think he's making some From my point of view questionable decisions about certain things And who he endorses and that doesn't mean that like I've lost all faith and Trump or anything We got to give him credit where he's strong and where he is strong as he understands business and economics and Leverage and negotiating. He's really good at it. He's had to do his whole life now Does he allow himself to be influenced by you know people or? We don't know the fucking plays on the back end of what's what? Yeah, this is really good. Yeah, that's great This is good man. All right sweet man. Well, let's go down in comments with that being said Let's go check out some of these comments cool Yeah, let's check them out this first comment comes from at impact painting services LLL my pastor asked where we get our news and my wife was nervous because everyone around the table said like Fox or CNN And when it was her turn she said Andy for seller pastor said I like Andy. Yeah See that That's what I'm talking about. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, that's cool. All right. God loves us God favors us. What do I tell you all the time? What do I tell you when when when shit's fucked up? Uh-huh, or it's questionable. I always say the same thing. I'm like bro. Don't worry. God favors us That's it, man. You know what I'm saying? Like that perfect gangster. Do I not say that? Yeah? Yeah, bro like youngsters need prayer too. Hey man, if you do good good things happen to you if you do wrong things happen to you and You know people can say whatever they want about me or us or anybody else But like bro, I never fucked anybody my whole fucking life. There's not a single motherfucker to can fucking say that period Not a single one. I do the right thing you do the right thing We as we as companies are conglomerate of companies all try to do the right thing and when you do the right things good things happen Mm-hmm, and you know, hey man. That's it. Yeah, I love it I'm not saying perfection. I'm not saying we're not human beings, but you know like I make a conscious effort to Fuck and see it how it is and clearly your pastor is a genius You know what I'm saying? I love it. There we go. Our next comment. This comes from Kevin Lewis 91 51 now and you know you are a competitor Mm-hmm. I think we're talking about competition. I think this was this from the Q&A episode. I think But you're talking about you know hating losing you know saying like you know that concept this comment says I hate losing to the Moat to the part up to the point where I don't even care about winning. Yeah, well, so Kevin says Andy would be the guy clubbing his competition with the baton It's possible I mean, it's possible. You know look real talk like it you know Sometimes you get in the heat of the battle bro and you do dumb shit, you know, that's it. Yeah I would say The old the old version of Andy like Seven eight years ago and earlier Absolutely, you know, yeah, absolutely and then if you said did you do that? I'd be like fucking right at that I wouldn't cry on TV and act like I did it was an accident I'd be like fuck this guy's trying to fucking take food off my table, but what I figured out is you know to the last question is that the The universe which a lot of people will get mad when I say the universe, but they'll say well, that's God Well, who made the universe? You know, I'm saying like it's fairly reasonable argument to say that if God is the creator that he created the universe And it's possible that the universe has its own set of rules and I believe in the universe having its own set of rules We are a part of the environment that interacts through our thoughts and vibrations and what we say and what we think and what we feel in our heart even if we don't say it and I have found that when you actually respect and Give credit to people who deserve it and get happy for them when they win even if they win against you More winning comes your way and and I don't know, you know, you could still want to Beat people, but it's it's a different way of thinking about it. Never mind. I mean dude listen. Here's the reality about competition You don't beat people by tearing other motherfuckers down you beat people I mean better than them And that's it and if you're blinded by jealousy and hatred and anger and frustration It's hard to identify what they're doing better that's allowing them to beat you So the calmer you say stay and the more that you respect them the easier it is to learn and identify the things that are I'll probably make you a winner versus them. Yeah, real shit. Yeah, I love it We got one more comment for you, but the truth is I probably I mean I ain't selling the head with a garden hoe one time damn. Yeah, oh, it was an accident It was we were digging for gold in the backyard That's real talk did he find gold and you hit Man, we were digging for gold in the backyard when we were like probably like six and five No, that's probably like five He's probably four and I was you know, we were digging he was using a hammer like you know Sal man, that sounds about you know he's using the hammer dig. I got a hoe and And he stuck his head in the way of the hoe. Oh, man. Yeah, like I was and he stuck his head down there and hit him in the head good lord. Yeah Well, so that's what's wrong with sound God is kidding. I last comment come from a Gabriel F7 R6s DJ's giggles sounds like a pepper grinder and Andy's laughter sounds like an old Chevy trying to start up I'm sorry.

Oh Dude on the elevator. Oh, guys so good. It's so good. It's so good. It's so good. Yes. Let's play the video. It's the clip Hi, I was a worker at HHS. I was fired Legally on February 14th there are many people who are not getting social service Programs especially people with disabilities. Are you gonna do anything to stop what's happening? You probably deserved it. I deserved it Yeah, that's great to hear why why did I deserve it? You hear her at the end. Oh you should have said that on camera listen mother fuckers This doesn't matter anymore because no one gives a fuck Dude These these people get off their phones. Yeah, they antagonize and then They act like they're the victim when somebody puts them in their place Mm-hmm If we always talk to people like that we would have never been in the situation of this crazy shit in the first place It's real okay. That's what they deserve that's the level of that's how you treat people to do that You tell them the fucking truth about themselves. You make fun of them for who they are You know what you did deserve to get fired because anybody who behaves like that? I wouldn't want my organization anyway You got fired back in February bro. You you not work. I go get another fucking job They don't care dude because these people see the government as a Free money situation. I guarantee you dude if you go audit that guys work. He didn't do a single fucking thing Okay, so yes you are a clown. Yeah, yes You probably did deserve it just like Everybody who doesn't do their job and and do just because you work for the government and In fact, I would say especially when you work for the government if you don't do your job You don't deserve to have it because it's coming off the backs of your neighbors and the money that they're taxed Right so it's not like they're you know you're the federal government selling goods and services That's what I'm doing. Listen in a private enterprise if you want to keep someone on that Doesn't do their job because you like them. That's your prerogative. It's bad business, but you can do that in a government situation I think it's even More important that people do not have jobs that don't execute their jobs well because dude It's not free money. It's coming off the backs of the families that you're supposed to serve and Furthermore, I'm tired of this shit. I'm tired of people running around with their phones acting like you know I got you get this motherfucker Bro, did you see the other one? You know, I'm no for real dude like did you get this? She get it all the way in the fucking frame bro She can both of the how about like this what about like this? How about like this you get that one too? Yeah like fuck bro Like I'm just fucking over it Do you see the one from the other day? I forget the fuck yeah that guy's walking down the street and he says the guy says some ridiculous shit to him like to feel Listen, it's a moral high ground. It's like what we covered about Tick ticker whatever trick trick trick. Yeah, yeah, I don't fucking know bro. Sorry trick trick You know, I couldn't think straight. I was too busy being mad at these other motherfuckers The same reason you're mad at him though. They're standing on the moral high ground Talking this leverage this it's manipulative shit, okay, then nobody said nobody that senator did not say oh people with Disabilities deserve to lose it. You're trying to bring up something that is not relative to the actual issue to make people seem like they are poor of poor moral standing, okay? People are tired of this so when you walk down when these people walk down the street and they say oh Don't you care about the 40,000 fucking Babies on Mars He's like Why don't you go back to your mom's basement and get a fucking hot pocket bro and keeps walking it was awesome He didn't know what to say bro. He did he used my line He said he said you need to go why don't you go hang out in your mom's basement play Xbox or some shit The hot pocket juice. Yeah, bro bro. You know what damn. Yeah, I'm just saying dude There's nothing more insulting than telling somebody that like hey, man truth. Yes If he looks like there they got care of his in my house, how'd you know? Yeah, he was lost for words bro They you know what when you tell him the truth They don't know how to react because they're so used to bullying that when you even like flick him in the ear back They fucking freeze the fuck up. Yeah, man. That's real. Yeah, I just thought that was fucking awesome little dose I loved it. I do it listen if everybody handled these people like that We would have never been in this backward situation in the first place the entire reason that culture is so fucked up Is because people are afraid to tell the truth to these people who position themselves as a morally superior human And when somebody attacks you and you are a good person your natural defense is defend that you are a good person But if you just accept that you're never gonna be a good person to them and you just tell them the truth about them They don't know what the fuck to do furthermore if everybody just gets back to this today It would be over by Friday will be in a whole country dude. What I say three years ago that we needed Everybody need to get back to what bullying fuck you. Yeah You know, I'm saying bullying is good for the soul bullying is good for society Okay, and if you can't bully I was bullied too, bro I was made fun of being a fucking fat. Yeah, I was a nerd. I fucking like it was fine It might still be true, but I still give a fuck anymore You know, the point is is that bullying at a certain level builds character and teaches you how to real to survive in the real world. Yeah, bro and These people have done all the bullying and and you know common sense people have sort of been like dude you know It's not even this is the attitude of I will say the reasonable people in America It's take the high road. Mm-hmm. Look look at this nerd. He's harassing me. I don't really give a fuck It's not worth my time That's just empowers these people, okay? No, they will get worse and worse and worse which we just witnessed look what they did during COVID okay But if you just stand up to him the first time they learn to leave you to fuck alone because They end up being embarrassed and Dude, we need to get back to shaming these people and bullying these people to the degree that they bully us Okay, oh, I don't want to offend anybody. Well, do they give a fuck about offending you? No, they don't Yeah, just to offend them That's actually listen I you know you know how I roll during COVID.

Like I'm on the team to try to win tell me some shit so I can help yeah, right?

Well, you know what? We don't fuck around here. We work straight through to tornado sirens regardless of the circumstance. That's right All right, let's move on that actually isn't tornado siren Let's check the red let's get the radar before I talk this shit Yeah, I just said godfabers us. Maybe he didn't like that Oh, no, we're good bro We're good Yeah, it's we're good All right, let's keep going Um, yeah, I just thought that was I thought that was awesome. So we got uh another news Um, there's this rumor going around DC right now and it started from politico of all places Uh, that uh, this is the headline political put out all right and they're blasting this all over the website Trump tells inner circle that musk will leave soon It is complete Bullshit and fabrication It's complete bullshit. This is just a ske- I mean it's so stupid to the point that White House hats respond. This is topic two. Mm-hmm. This whole thing is this. No, okay. What did they say? Um, who political or white house? The White House. Carolyn Uh, just put a simple tweet out she said the scoop is garbage. Elon Musk and president chump have both publicly stated the Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when His incredible work at doge is complete which is July 426 I think no, that's the doge commission. So special employees They get a hundred and like 30 days. So technically his expires like may Uh, I want to say it's like may Ferritiath When when when when Trump first came out and talked about this he said that their work would be completed by July 4th 2026, so I don't know that's what he said. Yeah Is it yeah, I think I think I think maybe political is basing that off of like the the the clause and the law Special government employee they can only be employed for like a hundred and thirty days out of 365 or something like that But the doge is it's here to stay until next year. Well, I mean is he a special government employee? Is he not getting paid? That's why he's a special government employee Yeah, I mean it's just interesting. I mean, it's just it's just the bullshit that they're lying about and his work is not done He's got plenty of it to do Uh, in fact this new article come out Elon Musk accuses US government of deleting terabyte of financial data to cover up crimes claims we recovered it due to their tech and competence So this is a new thing that just got released just just came out to bombshow they like to say um Here's the breakdown, okay, this is coming from Mario N-Nar-Narfall, okay Um, and this is focusing on United States Institute of Peace another government agency that was you know helping funnel Uh, a shit ton of money comes to find out Um, they were actually funding America's enemies So the Department of government efficiencies discovery at the United States Institute of Peace Revils Washington's dirty secret agencies often do precisely the opposite of their stated mission When doge investigators finally gain access to usips books after days of institutional resistance requiring FBI intervention They uncovered the unthinkable now 132,000 dollars funneled to a former Taliban member and 1.3 million dollars to an Iraqi organization with questionable ties This fits a devastating pattern a 2019 special inspector general report found 19 billion dollars in USA to Afghanistan was unaccounted for or misused Between 2002 and 2016 showing how routinely taxpayer money flows to our adversaries under noble pretenses Even more disturbing Was the attempted cover up usip officials deleted a terabyte of fine which a terabyte that's a shit ton of fucking data By the way like that's a shit time. Mm-hmm terabyte of data Financial data hoping to hide their tracks not realizing doge's technological capabilities Would recover everything a perfect example of the 65% of federal agencies still using outdated IT systems vulnerable to mismanagement Um America ranks a dismal 27th in global transparency rankings behind much smaller nations from the Pentagon's 125 billion in administrative waste To the IRS is 1.2 billion dollars in improper payments The pattern is undeniable Elon's technology driven audits are precisely what these institutions fear most sunlight on decades of deception Now Elon responded directly to this, okay, this is his tweet I'm talking about how we were basically funding the Taliban and Iraqi leaders Elon Musk tweeted this out saying any government institution is most likely to be the opposite Of its name and then confirmed that leak saying they deleted a terabyte of financial data to cover their crimes But they don't understand technology so we recovered it That sounds criminal to me Of course, it's criminal. I think people are having a hard time understanding this first of all There's sending Sean Ryan talks about this. There's sending tens of millions of dollars to the Taliban weekly Okay, still all right now Why would they do that? Why would they fund the Taliban and then be fighting against the Taliban? Well, maybe it's because if they didn't fund the Taliban there would be no war to fight which makes them a ton of money You know makes them obsolete What we mean military industrial complex If there's no war to fight that's right. That's right. Absolutely exactly So they have to fund both sides of the war So that the fucking smaller side doesn't get you know exterminated by the United States military in two weeks Because then they can't make the money and this is what people don't understand We are having our own tax dollars Fund conflicts across the globe Where are brothers and sisters sons and daughters dads and moms and aunts and uncles go to die for the causes of these quote-unquote elites And bro that's that's absolutely criminal. It's not a little bit criminal. It's it's It's the worst kind of crime okay your people can go die, but I'm not going no and by the way not only am I not going? I'm getting rich bitch You see what I'm saying exactly their mindset so so when you think about these people And you think that they give a fuck about you or any of your family Realize that they are 100% willing and have been willing for many many many decades to send your fucking men and women To die so that they can make money so just think about that when you when you think about what these people are actually all about Dude, what was the what would it take for you real talk? Yeah I just let's break this down into fucking Let's break this down into humanity like individual standards Let's say that you're You okay, and you know that you can make a whole bunch of fucking money by Joe's daughter and Joe's other Joe's fiance which by the way congratulations and Zee Sharn's kids They go fight a war to die What what amount of money would be appropriate for you to make that decision? Have to be a shits on Dude, it's there's no money that you can do that with if you're a fucking decent human being now That's fucking fucked up bro. Yeah, it doesn't matter and these people don't give a shit So remember that when they tell you how much they're good they're gonna do for you and what they're gonna you know Do for your community and how much they care remember They're 100% willing to send you your family and everybody you know to go die So that they can make some fucking money. Well, in the worst part about like I do We have a recent example of this too right like with Ron when Biden Unfroze the six billion dollars in assets and then all of a sudden we have this major conflict with Hootsie Like that's been dormant for over a decade by the way You know, I'm saying it's like like it's it's It's nonsensical. Oh, it's what I said it is It's fun the other side get them just enough weapons and just enough power to create a war that they cannot win Send our people over there continue to fund them and allow the war to happen so that they can get all the political kickbacks and make all the money in their stock investments in this Disgusting evil cycle that they you know, and they tell us they tell our brave citizens, you know home of the brave were the protectors of democracy globally blah blah blah blah bro. That's all a lie That's all I that's the idea of America the idea of being patriotic the idea of Brotherhood and sisterhood and all of us coming together and for a common goal and unity and all these things Tremendous ideas amazing idea sounds good. I believed in it my whole life But unfortunately what we have now is not that Okay, we have a bunch of people pretending that that's what it is so that my family and your family and all of your families will you know Go fight their shit so that they can make some money and they say it's your brave and You know your courageous and you're a hero and they give you a a medal and a little box with the fuck Flag on it and they say oh, thank you for this and then they say see you later You want to know you don't think that's true go ask one of the fuckers did fucking their families have been killed in action Go ask what the fucking government's done for them after they made a big presentation They forget about them. They don't give a fuck now Okay, so while I enjoy and love and fight for and care about the idea of America, which is what I'm about What we have is not that and we all have to acknowledge that before we can get that and so you know, it's important for people to understand that these people Are willing to send your family and your children and your parents To die so that they can fucking get money. Yeah It's insane. Well, I said we should only be going to war When it's absolutely fucking necessary. Yeah, when it's when it's when it comes to our security Right like but dude, you know, how's that gonna, you know, how are they gonna get rich done? Right What do you think I mean like are they really your enemy if you have to pay them to be your enemy? With the enemy actually It's one of the things that a lot of the soldiers struggle with You know a lot of them don't because a lot of them enjoy the job and that's that's fine. I understand that I would probably enjoy it as well, but the You know, I've talked to many people who have been in the military who without naming names question And have regret over the things that they did because they realized that those people weren't really any different than they were They were what would you do if some motherfucker came to your country And there's a good clip of Robbo Neal talking about this and He's like I think about this one dude that I killed and he's like I went in and you know, I'm in his bedroom and You know, he went for a gun and I shot him And then after I I think about it many years later. It's like well What would you do if somebody was in your house? You would go for a gun So then he thinks well, what if we met you know at a different time in different place What I probably would I like to have a beer with that guy and these are these are real things because dude most people are the same Bro Like there's like we talked about in the last show. There's good people and then there's bad people And just because the media and our government says those people are bad That doesn't mean they're bad, bro They're just trying to get you to fucking hate them so that we could justify going over there and doing whatever the fuck we want So at least I would appreciate if they just didn't lie about it and they said hey We're gonna go over here and get this fucking oil like oh, okay That makes sense, but don't tell me it's about fucking Freedom or democracy or some bullshit weapons of master's Yeah, I mean tell the truth dude and we can fucking have a real argument whether or not it's worth it But dude you gotta go huh you gotta go too you vote for bro. That's how it should be if you vote for war Your military age the military aged People that are direct your family you should have to send three of them For real So and you get to pick who gets to go I'm being serious. No, hey Hey, if you care about going to war that much and it means that much to you then you will have no problem making that decision You're gonna pick the strongest bravest best people to go But they don't believe in this the way they pretend to bro. They don't believe in that They believe those sacrifices are for us not for fucking them. It's real, man Now speaking of crimes because again, I'm my opinion deleting the shit Actually, that's criminal right you should go to jail There is another little shakeup happening right now in the FBI. I'm sure you saw this Um, because we got some new unredacted leaks coming out FBI imposed gag order on analysts who told Twitter hunter-biden laptop story was real Shocking why are they gagging them when it's accepted to be everybody knows it was real I think they were talking about at the time. So they silenced this guy Well, listen, this is go ahead man. Let's dive into it The FBI silenced an employee who tried to tell Twitter the hunter-biden laptop story was real on the day Came out newly released chat logs show on October 14th 2020 the day the New York Post first reported on Hunter Biden's laptop the FBI told employees quote Do not discuss the Biden matter and imposed a quote unquote gag order on an analyst who tried to confirm the story's Varacity to Twitter during a meeting according to chat logs released by the house judiciary committee So an FBI official with the bureaus foreign influence task force Laura Demlow Previously testified that an analyst on a call with Twitter confirmed the laptop was real before an attorney for the FBI told the social media platform It would not comment further the chat logs show FBI personnel Deliberating on how to handle the laptop situation one FBI official instructed the rest to do not discuss the Biden matter and subsequent messages reiterated that order after the meeting the FBI placed a gag order on the analyst who was Monished by FBI staff for speaking up during the meeting and FBI staff Relemented that the analysts won't shut up as instructed The chat logs show the FBI has to climb the comment, but we got the chat logs here. We got him here. I mean and they're they're all there um, and so this is this exchange going on in this FBI group chat You see Laura Demlow in there. She's messaging a couple of people. There's a Bradley Benavites minnevites James Dahini or Denny Um, they're all they're all up in there chat logs prove it. It's there um Why now? I mean how are we just now figuring this out like I did see the hunter Biden apparently got his law license strip today As well, but the dude needs to be in fucking prison and that's being light Listen All these people should be in fucking prison. Okay If you're in one of these agencies and you're not speaking up for what's right you're complicit in the problem That's how it should be viewed All right, and I think that is how it's going to be viewed I think that a lot of you guys because a lot of you guys listen clearly um If you don't start fucking speaking up, bro, you're gonna get grouped in like people are still trying to side with side They're gonna fall on you know what I'm saying? Who's gonna win and yeah, and you're riding the fence and I do it I'm just telling you I'm just telling you dude. This is reality and this is not a This is not a it's just reality You need to be on the right side and the right side is gonna be the side of the people Because if Trump doesn't do it the person that comes after Trump is gonna do it And if they don't do it the people are gonna fucking do it So you need to figure the fuck out what sides you're on and do the right thing and all of you guys who are in these agencies Who are afraid to speak up? This is your fucking moment to actually serve your country and not be a fucking fake ass pussy bitch and stand for something Stand for the thing that you actually probably stood for when you first joined up in these agencies You know, why did you do this? You didn't do this to protect a bunch of fucking criminals You did this to actually make a difference and protect the American citizen That's why you did this So this is an opportunity for all of you people who know what the fuck's going on To actually step up and say and make a difference for this country It's probably your greatest opportunity you're ever gonna have all right, so And if that's not enough motivation for you You need to realize that even if Trump doesn't do it The people are gonna do it because people are woke they're understating not woken the fucking all way They're understanding exactly what the fuck is going on and they're not okay with it It's not just me there's millions upon millions upon millions upon millions of people who are fucking sick of our government Taking all of our fucking money and then using it against us Okay, that shit is gonna end and it's either gonna end at a Trump or it's gonna end because the people are gonna This is history. This is this happens. Do you think you're gonna be the only people in history to You know deflect a revolution? You're not Governments fall and this one is no different and if they keep fucking with people the way that they've been fucking with people That will be the inevitable reality that they deal with and You know, that's it. So That's not a threat. That's a statement of fact That's knowing history that's knowing history. Yeah, why don't you? Okay, so those of you who are in these systems Who know what's going on you have a duty you took out fucking oath To tell the truth and you need to do it And quick yeah quick man guys jumping off this conversation let us go down in the comments Uh, what's you guys there? I want to get that that said to do a fucking shout out. What's his name? I don't know, but he's awesome. Yeah, let me see your guys name here um Indiana senator Jim banks. Yeah, I liked it. Yeah, good job Jim Yeah proud of yours. Kudos Well guys with that being said we got the brand new segment Brand new segment coming to you guys right now The segments called put it in put it in up. So every day or every every every time we put in the show together You know someone on the DMs the podcast team. They always hit me up like DJ put this in. Oh, yeah, put the clip in So put it in all right here we go Well Things quickly take a time to hold it so I got an idea for the segment. Okay, we got a guess who said Who said who said to put it in okay, who says put it in okay? All right, that's the guess. Okay I think our our audience has to guess guess who said to put this clip in yeah, okay, here we go So you got to say in the comments We're not gonna say But we got to make a guess it was it me was it DJ? Mm-hmm was it Joe Young was it ice cream Joe Was it Keith was it madat or was it z-shon? All right, that's the list of players And you get the guess all right So here we go brand new segment put it in let's check it out Well Things quickly take a turn when a demonic Portland abortionist assaults a pro life Christian Today now No, yeah, that's very sad what percentages of those women So every woman that's getting an abortion is due to medical procedures? No, most of us are No, they're not abortion was other dead and for you. Okay, sorry to hear that. That's most abortions That's not most abortions Statistics most abortions are clean ups after miscarriages when you get those No, it's less than 1.7 percent You don't know the statistics are extremely common and most women opt to have miscarriages and abortion are different What is what is abortion? No, a miscarriage is a medical No, no, it's not okay. Let me let me educate you. Okay. Yes, okay. Oh, give it. Hey, give it Hey, hey, hey, okay, hey, give it Good example she's setting for a daughter there beautiful. Exactly. Yeah Fucking attack someone who's actually correct because you're stupid ass doesn't know the fucking facts Okay, first of all medical abortion is excluded from the abortion laws. Okay um So what the fuck are you talking about? I know she doesn't know She's fucking some stupid ass leftist who by the way This is a prime example of someone who has never been held accountable to anything they do How old do you think she is? Oh, she's probably I mean 30 I was gonna say at least 50 no that woman's got a young daughter, bro. She's like low 30. She just looks old Okay For the last 15 years since she was 15 years old these people have been able to say and do fucking anything without getting any repercussions Okay This is why they're so quick to violence and they're so quick to attack And if the other side was quick to violence these people wouldn't even fucking exist The only reason these people just like Canada exist is because they are allowed to exist by the restraint of the physically superior people That they have no problem attacking. Okay, so Of course she did because she's wrong She's got her kid right there Who who would fucking have a kid with that one? Imagine dealing with I guarantee you she's single bro. She has to be saying yeah I guarantee it because that those people are insufferable or a husband transitioned maybe But but what's she talking about the helicopter Say that there's gonna be helicopter crashes of women trying to like fly to Oregon to get okay How many babies are killed a year from abortion 40 million? Yeah, okay, so So You don't even you don't give a fuck about that You know what I'm saying and by the way Look man, I don't think the government has a place to say any of that shit I think we have I think we're it's okay to have personal belief and be very convicted about it But what's not okay is that when you're presented with the actual facts of the matter Because the facts of the matter are that Most abortions are not considered medical abortions medically necessary miscarriages right Every abortion law that I'm aware of and you might want to fact check this Excludes Is there is there a medical is there any state that considers medical miscarriages and they won't do it. They won't go clean it out. That's my knowledge. I don't know I'm 99.99% sure that does not exist in anything. I was just like the exceptions for rape and incest It's all there. Yeah, it's all there so You know I don't know I think You know And this person's gonna shoot gun play victim because the dude put her on the ground. I want to see the full clip I would like to see the full clip you fucking hit me in front of my dog. I guarantee it That's what the next thing out of her fucking mouth. Yeah, you know these people have no problem running their fucking mouth Getting people's faces and then when there's any repercussion whatsoever. They're the victim. Yeah, what are these people? Shop it bro. She shops at fucking you know Real talk it costs a lot of money to look like that really yeah like to look like you know Much money people spend to look like shit to look like shit. That's crazy. Yeah for real bro They buy designer ugly ass shit and they think that it's that makes them cool and they look like shit But that's old Navy bro. I don't know what the fuck it is but Dude these people are walking fucking hypocrisys You know what I'm saying? I drive a Tesla But now I'm gonna attack you for driving a Tesla. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, fuck the great deal Yeah, I was making more carbon dioxide. Yeah, it was burning the shit up and they're all self-centered and fucking selfish as fuck What'd you find? Find anything um no I have to do more research on that Oh, man, let's fucking look it up here Okay, here's the facts No state laws explicitly forbid medical care for miscarriages zero fucking zero So her argument is complete fucking bullshit Which is most of these people's argument and by the way, I don't really give a fuck real talk I hope you have all the abortions because I don't want to deal with you in 20 fucking years I don't want to deal with your kids being brainwashed with your dumb ass shit All right, so let's be fucking real. I'm not above and you guys can judge me however you want But there's an old saying never stop your enemy from making a mistake So why the fuck will we give a fuck if the people who don't I know people are gonna say well, you know, it's not the baby's fault Well, the baby's gonna be raised to be just like them Okay, so do you want to do you want them to take care of the problem or do you want to deal with it for your whole life? So I'm just that's reality, okay, and people could judge however they want that's reality You know, I don't like people that act like this. I'd like to have less of them Okay To your point this video on social media has about 1700 comments and most of them are talking about how she should have never done that in front of the kid and How poor the effect is gonna be on the kid.

She will fucking march for all the illegal migrants and all the shit, but the minute we say hey take one into your home Well, that's not safe for me. She don't want to know illegal mind. Yeah, it's all bullshit It's these people their ideology is all bullshit They don't stand for anything they say they stand for that's fucking reality So it's we should just accept that that's reality because they have no logical argument and I'm talking about lehtis I'm not talking about liberals. I'm pretty liberal myself, okay These people should be dealt with very directly hey fuck you How about that? I don't read it man. Yeah, I'm with it bro.

Ice cream Joe Z-Shiner Medot Let us know I think people know Your passion is pretty indicative brother that was not me That wasn't me Guys, let's get your out of the finals headline. We got our third set headline number three I would never send a clip like that Oh Man, gotta talk about some judges. We got some interesting things happening with some of our judges So let's just highlight some good ones and some bad ones and What's shaking and what you know shackle acting over here. All right. Did you see Eric Adams got his case dismissed So judge dismisses Eric Adams case then denying DOJ an opportunity to revive it later So this entire case it has been dismissed With prejudice, which means he's a good and he's completely out the clear. Well, it means it was total bullshit It was total bullshit the entire time. I don't like Eric Adams. I don't like him either But but you know what they can do it. Hey listen. Yeah, well Probably did something Well, let's be real bro. Let's be real. Okay. We say whatever we want about Eric Adams He doesn't it doesn't feel like he's a part of their shit It feels like he's a guy who has liberal beliefs who's knocked down with the leftist corrupt shit And you know, there's a lot of things honestly dude. There's things he said. I mean like bro. He's fucking right You know, so I you know nobody should be prosecuted for things they didn't do Yeah, well, here's the other interesting thing with this just quickly. They noted down here at the bottom But this arrangement have to just just dismiss this With without prejudice, meaning they could retry this at a later time that would have given Trump a massive leverage Stake over Adams, you know, so that even that whole collusion that they tried to throw in there the fact that it's got dismissed with with prejudice like It goes to show it was all fucking bullshit. Of course, it was all bullshit So all right good job, you know, good good good work judge, but let's let's have to one that ain't doing too good Let's watch one that ain't doing it too well Massachusetts judge charges ice agent with contempt of court for detaining suspect in middle of his trial Do you hear the shit now? Oh man, so a Massachusetts judge on Monday Found a US immigration and customs enforcement agent in contempt of court for detaining a Dominican man in the middle of his trial last week Boston municipal court judge Mark Somerville Accused ice agent Brian Sullivan of violating the rights of the defendant William Martell LeBron Sullivan did not appear for court for the hearing Quote this is a disturbing case summerville said Quote it's a case of obstruction of justice It's a case of violating the defendant's right to be present at trial and confront witnesses against him couldn't be more serious Martell LeBron was taken into custody last week following the second day of his trial on charges that he provided false information in a driver's license application Some of you'll dismiss the charges against Martell LeBron Some of you'll also criticize the assistant district attorney from the Solfeit County District Attorney's office and ordered them to investigate some of it the agent So this guy who's not supposed to be here. Hold on Go back to what the judge said Yeah right here This is a disturbing case Somerville who's the judge said It's a case of obstruction of justice It's a case of violating the defendant's right to be present at trial and confront witnesses against him Couldn't be more serious Absolutely judge You are the one obstructing justice and just to remind you this is not a citizen of the United States Which means he doesn't have the same rights that a citizen of the United States has and as a judge you fucking know that Okay, you're not doing so let's talk that's right. Let's talk about Who's actually obstructing justice and then to try to investigate a man who is doing his job To remove illegal migrants from our country that do not belong here that Commit crimes and suck up tax dollars from a struggling American citizenship Okay, so who's actually obstructing justice here? I would say that it's judge Mark Somerville that's my opinion and I think I'm pretty fucking correct on that opinion hold you it's continued That's right. Yeah from all the way in Boston Listen dude, but I was fucking because I hear the situation right the guy was actually what even in the courthouse outside the courthouse And agent spotted him they fucking got him it doesn't matter if he's in the mother fucking courthouse Well matter because here's the thing like this is what this judge would have done the judge knows the ice was looking for him And a lot of times he's the activist judges. I've literally been seeing these clips of this shit They will take that dude and like you know Not release him on a bond and hold him or whatever he has to do just why long that because they're active I bet this motherfucker's funded by George Soros is no doubt. I bet you if we look at him I bet you I betcha Trace the money by the way Do you see what happened in Minnesota? Well of course I saw what happened in that yeah in that while in that wild that You know Susan Crawford projected winner of West Consist Supreme Court election keeping courts liberal majority and then Soros actually funded her election with our money Which now because they're going to redistrict could eventually cost the United States the entire house And then we will deal with the same bullshit that we dealt with in the first fucking term of Trump where they're trying to impeach him Every single fucking day for the entire time. Okay George Soros should be fucking arrested. Well, he wasn't just him George was in it The governor Pritzker from Illinois all of these people They all need to go to fucking jail 100% they all need to go to jail. They're craziest piece about this dude Um, so this is just a screenshot. This was 4% of the votes in uh shimma was actually winning And then at 14% which is when AP called it They completely flipped essentially they completely flipped places there So I mean, I thought that was interesting, but but here's what's really interesting, right? Is because must it come in you know like what love him I hate him. He gave him 20 million bucks. You guys transparent Yeah, he's very open and honest. He bro. He was giving people a million dollars in a lot of read a fucking go vote Yeah, he knew it was an important his own money by the way that's not the text. That's not our money. Right by the way Your money just so we're clear was just used to elect a judge Who is going to end up creating a scenario where You're going to suffer more. Yep, 100% but here's where it gets funky and he because it's rules For thee but rules not for me 100% let's go to a tweet by justice select Susan Crawford Elon Musk is buying off Brad shimmel Right, so she tweeted this back in February um, and it was applied to a tweet said building America's future And Elon Musk back group has now bought 1.5 million of airtime on Wisconsin's five markets in support of conservative supreme court candidate Brad shimmel That included 351k and mke and 349k and Madison But this lady Susan Crawford who just won she decided to tweet out saying Elon Musk is buying off Brad shimmel Okay So I was donated two million dollars. They got funneled to you Pritzker gave half a million and there was another I believe it was a total of almost three million That came out of fucking nowhere from other groups who knows where the fuck trace that shit back at But when she's questioned on that she said no George sorrows donation is just fine Of course it is because it benefits her Look bro none of these people should be able to donate at all these things none like it should like these big donations While I appreciate What Elon Musk is doing and I understand why he's having to do it play the game because that's because that's the game right But the game should be fucking changed to where these people cannot do this It's fucking bullshit Pritzker standing up and stop magnet extremism. How's the state of Illinois doing right now? Well, just stop fucking obesity. How about that? That's another thing Did you see this fucking guy that trump just uh that trump just fucking endorsed no um This guy representative Randy fine Yeah, oh that's a big guy pro israel guy He's not big he makes pritzker look like a fucking victorious secret model He makes the fucking good-year blimp look like a fucking paper airplane.

I shook that up To integrate it into it now the folklore behind this is it has HGH stem cells amino acids minerals I drink a little bit of it every morning. This is aged urine and so you pee in here You put a cheese cloth over it You get anaerobic bacteria going in it and then aerobic bacteria You close it up and it seals it and it cooks out here in the sun.
