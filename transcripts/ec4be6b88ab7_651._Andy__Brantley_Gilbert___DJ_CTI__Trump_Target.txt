having me today man I've been excited about this for a minute we're trying to get together for a while yeah you know I've been a fan of your stuff for a long time man and and I'm kind of my exposure to social media is limited on purpose yeah you know I know the going thing is to listen to a lot of podcast things like that I'm wrapping my mind around that but I'm a little bit old school when and and I didn't see social media really benefit in my life and my marriage as as a husband as a dad I wasn't really seeing the benefits I got it for you know for work and things like that obviously it's a necessity but my exposure to that stuff is is similar limited so I've got a buddy that would always send me you know bits yeah this podcast and I was like before I know who you were I was like this dude gives zero Fox and he's just speaking it and I was like dude I love it because you know especially in our society nowadays you know everybody's real hesitant to get into this that another you've always embodied that in your music in your brand how you talk to people on stage I mean this is always speaking the truth of what you feel has always been I feel because dude I've been a fan of yours for a long time as well I was telling you know it's it's interesting because off air we were talking the first time brandly came in it was super weird because back in 2011 I bought my farm you guys who follow me you've seen my farm on the internet and there was a lot of work that needed to be required so I basically took like a year off of work and I was on the tractor or on equipment all day for a year and then Emily and I got married on the farm after a year so like the farm needed a lot of work and we basically me Brian teach my dad and my brother and a couple buddies Chris Sellers Skyhulsie a couple really good friends of mine spent like all our time building this out and so I spent dude hours and I mean fuck hundreds of hours on equipment listening to music and back then it wasn't Bluetooth that was oxcourt so like all I had what's an oxcourt you know I'm talking about now yeah it was young joke yeah you look young yeah no shit he is young bro he's only 27 28 we 28 yeah wait yeah I'm good too because did catch the school yeah I got no I got the oxcourt yeah yeah now VHS I don't know what that is well then you certainly don't know what beta max is I don't know what the beta max you know VHS oh you're beta and I wrote every phone anyway so that's right so so bro so I'm listening I'm listening on the tractor to the same song so over and over again because I got my playlist to my phone and DJ knows I don't update my phone bro how you don't the other day my phone shit out on me and I like lost all my stuff because the last time I backed it up was like 2021 and so we we dealt with it for three days but anyway so I get it and nowadays I'm the same way yeah and now get a text from somebody and I don't know who it is I'm gonna eat I lost my contacts and this day and age everybody's like yeah that's fucking bullshit yeah you know you got our cloud man yeah now bro I don't use the cloud man I still don't use the cloud because the cloud gets hacked all the time man I got to hold my business shit on my phone and all that shit like I'm not doing that shit validating my wife right yeah I don't fuck with that bro and you don't talk her in the send me pictures as she won't because she said it's amazing to hack the cloud bro that's some real stuff I know people that's happened to you all you gotta do brand-least take it off the cloud bro you're good I've been trying to talk her in start the only thing let's generate some revenue you know what I'm saying shit she had nothing they want him to have the conversation Andy bro hey listen man there's pure brand entrepreneurs bro she might kick your ass bro so dude I'm on this tractor in a skid steer for a year straight man which I love dude that's the shit I love to do I love running equipment it's probably my favorite thing to do besides cars it sounds so random and so weird but anyway I was listening to your shit back then and like that was the first time I was really exposed to your music and bro I probably listened to country must be country-wide 4,000 times like you know yeah four yeah no shit I'm about to try me and me yeah so but dude you know I had all my all my favorite guys on there you know Jamie Johnson Randy Howeser you you know all the guys that sing about real shit you know what I mean and I feel like that speaking the truth is a cornerstone of your success you know and dude so I'm super excited to have you on the show bro because like you're one of the few people out of all these famous people and all these artists that have been uncompromising and what they're willing to say and stand up for and and bro that that's admirable in today's you know age so we connect on that same thing for sure absolutely I love it what do you think of what's going on man like what's your overall thoughts of buddy I mean you know I'll say this being a dad right it's changed the way I look at everything we have a four-year-old little girl his gags as fuck man in a six-year-old little boy he's just the sweetest little dude he's got the best heart I've ever seen on human in my life and you know that just the world I'm seeing it through a different lens now some things that you that used to go on and I kind of just thought my periphery on keep it moving kind of feeling like this point it's something I need to take issue with sometimes and be a little more outspoken you know in the past I never really made a habit of being political my job always treated my career I just wanted to tell my story because I felt like you know I had a little fender bend right after I school and and if you've seen pictures of the charts no way I made out you know it shouldn't it shouldn't be here and you know I from that I gathered God wanted me here for a reason and I thought my story was one more telling and I saw it resonate with people and you know actually making a difference in lives and and in my own I always wrote music for it's I always say it's like the it's the greatest form of expression outside of prayer you know sometimes almost even more powerful you know because there's a melody to it and you start singing along to it and it gives a little more weight to the words but um you know if you listen to everyone of my albums about the bike you'll have a good idea who I am and where I stand and and all that but um you know so it was more of a it was always about storytelling to me and then you know the kids came along and uh man it's just the different lens I remember you know my wife Amber who's who's here with us she came to me and and was talking about homeschool and I know when I was in school the kids that were all school just look different you know and I was dead said it was never yeah you know never in a million years I'm not cool with it they can go to school where you at school where I went to school they'll be fine and should be told you know but then you know I start seeing this stuff I got guys sending me you know clips of guys going to school boards and talking about books that their kids are reading and out of the library that talk about shit the kids out there ain't got any fucking business reading or being exposed to at that age and I remember telling Amber like hey I'm kind of coming or you know I'm wrapping my mind around this idea because if I go to a school war meeting because of something like that I'm not going to talk to anybody that's the kind of stuff I was going to be in the same place at the same time like I know my temper and I know me and you know the the was forced by kids go man I you know there were chapters of my life when I wasn't necessarily the the ideal person to piss off yeah I've never been as dangerous as I feel like I am right now because if something happens to those kids you know whether it's you know somebody saying the wrong thing to them or exposing them to the wrong thing that's that's not something to talk about to me that's a people are overstepping their boundaries with people's kids absolutely yeah it's a big deal man and I think the way you feel is the way a lot of men feel and I think a lot of dads especially need to step up and start voicing this because it is a major problem it's not okay for our school system to be telling people's kids that they can be whatever they want they can be a boy or a girl or they can you know read these books where you know there's sucking dicks in the books like bro that's fucking not okay no and it's not oak and I totally I totally agree with what you said about seeing it in the peripheral let it go because I was that way forever dude like when I was doing my first podcast MFCO project it was I was just talking about making money in business and entrepreneurship and I love that and and I was I would say socially pretty liberal like do whatever you want man as long as you're not stepping on me or bothering me it's okay dude I don't care I don't care if you're gay I don't care if you're doing smoking weed I don't give a shit man just leave me to fuck alone I want to go do my thing but the problem is is this shit has encroached into our territory so far where now if we just live our normal lives there's something wrong with us we're big it's we're we're racist we're massaging this we're all these we're fobs of every sort of thing it's like no dude we're just regular people that want to be left to fuck alone and how do you left us alone you be able to live your life but now you're coming to fuck with people's kids bro and that's not gonna fly over well I don't think I think people I think you're sharing a sediment that a lot of people are coming to that realization where it's no longer hey I'm just gonna pull my kids out people are starting to feel violated like dude we're paying taxes in this country to live in this crazy country where our kids are being taught all of this insane shit when they're way too young even be hearing about it we're stealing their childhood and so it's good to have you say that bro because I think a lot of I think a lot of people are there man yeah this you know to the point where I wrap my mind around the idea and she started this school called art learning academy in our hometown and you know we I don't think you had any idea what that there was a need for that or a desire for that in the magnitude that we've seen it that school but it's you know they're keeping it faith based yeah which is definitely don't see that in public school anymore you know it takes you out of the shoddads and you know I mean we want to rush around with the world you keep taking it away from God but eventually go put his foot down that's right here's gonna put on your throat yeah but I've got it you know and I told her my my few things were you know I want them to spend I want these kids to spend time outside learning how to do shit outside learn how to plant stuff learn how to fish learn how to do stuff that you know can make yourself sufficient yeah and they've done a great job of that but I've wanted them to learn history too because man I've got a 16 year old God's on I was watching a I'm into the Crossy deal man phase of life early and I've watched World War II documentaries like that's my shit so my God's on comes in and he's like what is this I was like what do you mean what is this you know this is World War II well who's that guy that's that's eight hour village one of most evil men on the planet you know what what the fuck do you mean who that is you know I think we're all familiar with the fact that history repeats itself and it repeats itself in the worst way if you become ignorant to it and the weirdest way right the people who you think aren't gonna be that become that yeah yeah didn't show up on the scene that that wasn't you know that wasn't what the banner said no bro but that's that's one of the issues we're dealing with is that Marxism and and you know communism are being advertised as freedom now you know like the banner on the outside of America right now says freedom but it ain't very free if we really think about it dude it's not like it was even when we were kids you know now we're paying I mean think of all the taxes that we have to pay that gets sent over and then funneled back into people's pockets it's the same bro and in whose pockets yeah exactly not ours shit bro man that and I mean I was having a conversation with somebody the other day I thought it was pretty interesting because you know it kind of turned off obviously I'm a second amendment guy I believe in right to bear orange and I don't have a good indication if you're from the ATF and your watching this I'm this is a fucking proud moment for me you know they're trying to make it now where if you give somebody a gun you need to have a FFL or whatever yeah it's just like all this red tape and shit man what are the two things that separate this country's freedom from the freedom that did a lot of the rest of the world sees right to me it's our first amendment right and the fucking second yep right those are yeah second protects the first right that's right they're with those are the two things I think that that really set us apart from the rest of the world yeah and when that starts getting a coach to put man here's the thing I feel like I surround myself with reason for human beings I got a couple of hot heads and I can be hiding myself from time to time but for the most part I heard somebody say once you know you're kind of the you know the whole of the best in the worst of the five those as people around you I have a lot more than five people around me at all times yeah just for what I do for a living that's right so you know it's really important to me that that all those people are solid human beings you know and and you know it's I feel like man we're more like than we give ourselves credit for yeah you know and I feel like between social media and in politics man they give us all these things they put all these things on the table and remind us how divided we are right and amplify it when intentionally truly yeah yeah at the end of the day man especially and I saw this when COVID happened right it was under a magnifying glass for us when we came back to playing shows I forgot how much like just concerts in general right which is what I do for a living but that's under a magnifying glass for me right seeing how these people interact with each other and when it came back to get it was like they were learning how to socialize again yeah you know what I mean and it just you saw you could see that from the from the stage buddy that's crazy man it was wild and I mean in all the guidelines you'd see you know even when it came back in 2021 you know the numbers are way down for everybody there were people that were excited to get out yeah but there were still people probably more like-minded to me that they're like man fuck that I'm not going anywhere yeah you want to try to swab my hand and choke me out through my nose to walk in somewhere bro that was me yeah I didn't do shit for a year and a half two years I didn't leave the house I went from my house to here that's it yeah there it was you know I did you know when you talk about division and in and in all that stuff man I feel like we're we probably live more along the middle of the the aisle than we realize yeah most of the people that I love and respect are pretty close to the middle yeah you know there's a couple issues that sends you hard left or hard ride yeah and man I'm unwavering on mine yeah the you know the gun thing to me and I feel like that's also a cultural thing I remember doing a interview with guy one time he was doing a interview it was a article called country music and guns and I remember asking when I was like so you like country music not okay I've never seen one in real life and you're the one right this article you know I feel like it is a cultural thing to me you know when a gun comes out and people get freaked out about it that's weird I think that's weird too bro I mean that's that's strange to me but to us when you know that I've been in the room with people and guns come out yeah yeah that's weird to me but obviously we're breaking a gun out weird to them dude I was sitting in a meeting I don't know this is back at old HQ and I was sitting with a I forgot what it was but it was a couple dudes from California that were there I remember this and I always carry right so like when I sit down sometimes I take it out and put it on the table and I think shit because this is what I do everywhere like when I drive I take it out I put it on my passenger seat you know I pull the gun out put it on the table bro and these dudes freak the fuck out they were like they were like is is that a gun and I'm like yeah and they're like what's that for I'm like fucking shoot people it's not for hunting it did not it did not connect with me that this was like the first time ever they had experienced that because here in Missouri or in Georgia where you guys are that's pretty normal like it's pretty normal for all of my for even all these guys all my friends walk around armed all the time like that's a normal thing you know it's weird the culture how how different it is I mean I'll say this though I do think it's important man it anybody is tote and going if you're not training with it I'd leave it the truth is how well no it's more than useless dangerous here a liability at fucking point yeah you know what I mean like we make a point to try to you know not only just situational wearing not just shooting targets but being situationally aware yeah you know and knowing when you're within your rights to do usually the force yeah you know what I mean enough I feel like that's an important part yeah yeah yeah that's how it's someone someone gives you the finger yeah right yeah you know no and his young kids are all on that shit now now if you disrespect them they want to they want to go to guns and nobody wants to fight no more I know and fighting's good for people I think it is too yeah we more fist fights our friends like we have some some friends are kids hang around with and then we had a little birthday party at the house one day and they all walked out and the kids were fighting like hell on a trample I mean it was like it was like a gang fight man you know he's throwing down but I mean all the other kids throwing down too they're scratching everything but one of the miles what that was like oh my god you know freaking out and she was I was like why she was like are you gonna stop him and I was like hell no you know this is good enough and that's right let him make kids you know but but yeah you know as far as you know it really kind of show me through through her creating that school I really learn more about where I stood yeah then I did just walk around doing my job because you know there were things that were important to me about it for me to get on board and in the last one you know speaking of guns was hey you know when the you've already shooting happened you know when it comes to school shoes obviously they're trying to and you know when things like that come and the when things like that happen you know obviously they come right after us to come right after guns yeah what look at the places that are getting shot up yeah they don't have any on targets that's right so I told her I was like one of the most important things to me is I won't every teacher there doing pistol one two and three yeah and we brought a guy that I truly respect with with my whole being and do name John Love or if you ever sing the warrior poet society no thing is worth looking into there's the real deal he's a retired Ranger and there's just real I tell people it's like he's pursuing an degree in you know faith unapologetic masculinity and he's a tactician yeah and you know he came down and and ran all the teachers through some courses and we've we've had some follow-up training and you know I I told it was important to me how I won't I won't one on hand on everybody I took me forever to to talk her into it but she walks around with one now at all times you know somebody tries to come in that school I'll be shot but they'll definitely get shot at yeah where do we at least go be shooting back yeah but yeah man that's cool you guys did that with the school that is awesome yeah see that that's what we're talking about did we talk about this on the show all the time is we need people to step up and provide solutions it's not just about posting on the internet anybody could say with a project bro it's about taking some action that's real action yeah people's lives are gonna be better because of that well I was man it I told her it's like a service to the community I feel like it's not a business it's not something that's gonna you know put us in a new house or take us to another tax bracket but it is a service to the community and we're sure we do I don't think you even knew what the the need for that was in our community but how long ago did you guys do that she's just the first year and you know the same old man 28 that is awesome man and she said to turn several away yeah you know next year to be a whole new a whole new deal but we ended up tied up with a church man that's another thing that's kind of a current event in my life is is she got back she got me back into church that was something I kind of got away from and they actually ended up kind of giving us a building or giving her a build and I say I'll ask I can't really honest to God I can't take credit for anything to do with that school outside of those those three deal breakers I had you know she's taking off and ran with it but man it's you know the church stepped up and and provided a building when we didn't have that and and it's just man it's it's been the answer to a lot of prayers yeah that's a lot of me and it's like I bless with a lot of things in my life you know God bless me immensely but man when he gave me that one right there he really did me a solid yeah um is it you know she's uh when you talk about being proactive and making choices I think one of my biggest issues was social media in general there's one they've effectively turned the entire world into the worst to the worst aspects of a small town yeah you know what I mean yeah the entire world is the gossip drama yes right they're not sucky and what's not yeah right dude I totally get it and I just feel like man I see guys and I and I know this myself I'm an addict right I know I don't know if you guys know that part of my story or not but uh I was born that way it's in my gene pool is riddled with addiction and I'm an addict I'll die an addict you know um but it's uh shit I forgot where I was going with that I just I just came straight out told y'all I was an addict and then lost my damn train of thought um no we were talking about how uh you're like yeah yeah so being an addict man you know I downloaded TikTok on my phone because I want to see how it worked when it started turning into a real thing right like I want to learn this algorithm and how it could pertain to my business and how it could you know make my business better and management it kind of encouraged me to take a you know more interactive route with you know Instagram and Facebook and snap face and all that shit um so I made an effort to and I had all those apps on my phone and then when I noticed this three o'clock in the morning and I'm scrolling through and now living your life rabbit hole yeah you know and you know for an addict and I see other people doing that and man when I noticed when I noticed myself doing it I was like this is a fucking problem yeah because here's the thing I feel like now from a thousand feet view I got it out of my phone right and I'm seeing other people doing it's like man do you know what would happen if you spent 25% of the time that people spend on social media if you take 25% of that time and put it in your home in your church in your community into your family and your fucking kids these conversations are different that's right you know the information on the internet is different we're in a different situation socially altogether if if that happens you know there are people that live their entire life glued to that bro most of these identities off of a lot dude it's a it causes like legit mental illness I actually talked about this last night I was talking on the internet right like because it is a tremendous way to reach an audience right um we wouldn't be here without it but you know it's Valentine's Day right and everybody's posting how great the relationship is and then on Christmas everybody's posting the family photos with the matching pajamas and bro there's a lot of motherfuckers that just don't have that in their life you know what I'm saying so like when when you look around in the entire internet looks like it's perfect and you're the only one that's not and you know that your life is completely fucked up you know it starts to make us mentally not right absolutely you know what's fucked up too is a lot of people that are posting those bullshit that's what I was saying bro that's what I was fucking saying I'm sorry that room look like five minutes bro that's what I'm saying the mom is screaming at the kids calling them little shit telling you better stand in fucking smile like you know like that's what you going on yeah if you're supposed to behind the scenes and to put John my face I'm here for yes and do the internet used to be that it used to be real life man like it used to be like your dogs your kids and you know you what's going on what your thoughts are now it's all brand it's like all marketing it's all marketing and even regular families are marketing themselves as the perfect family right and it's like motherfucker I know you ain't perfect I'm sure as fuck a perfect y'all are full of shit yeah and that's the that was the basis of the story last night bro and people were loving it because they were like bro every holiday because like dude you know it's hard for people that don't have a close tight family when they see an entire family and a thousand in a row with matching pajamas right like that shit kind of sucks you know like Emily and I weren't able to have kids so when we see that shit we're just like well fuck should we put our pajamas on you know I'm saying like I'm wearing my pants yeah bro it's just it's just matching pajamas in huh I do it with you I'm I'm saying we could do it we'll do it as a family all right all right I'm down I'm down with that if you like to be like the blind side I think a lot she had me in some match pajamas for Thomas black fellers here we go here we go he's got a ace up his sleeve I got a I had a time of talk with DJ before the show I said I look we got to keep the racism to a minimum DJ like that's one yeah like y'all are at the worry about me you got worried about him but dude I think you're completely right man I think the internet is fake as fuck I think it's setting a terrible example for people at this point in time I think everybody's full of shit for the most part nobody's sharing their hard days or if they are sharing their hard days that becomes their entire brand so we have this we have this polarization of content which is I'm either a victim and I'm something wrong with me every day and this is my brand or my shit is perfect and that's my brand and the reality is is for every single motherfucker listening and all of you guys watching you're somewhere in the middle bro don't lie about it absolutely keep it real man like fuck there are days where I don't want to get the fuck out of bed bro I have to you know what I'm saying I don't have a choice there are days where you know I feel like I'm king of the world and there are days where I'm like fuck this really sucks you know what I'm saying and that's life yeah you know and we forget that because social media has become just all this big marketing shit that people perceive as real life you know it's damaging it is damaging it's damaging to the family unit when you could go online and see four gazillion half naked women 24 hours a day that's that's fucking that's man supposed to be like that listen bro it's the work for no it's not bad real it's a bit of shit you put the work for it yeah it's just it's right there available for you no you you could go on only fans to see every girl you know but hold man you know I'm saying like you were supposed to like earn that could you imagine growing up a young dude like you're fucking 17 years old and you look on the internet and every single attractive female you look you can see for like three bucks like bro that's gonna keep you home that's gonna keep you in the basement on the video games bro you know what got me out and made me build all this shit and do all these things I wanted to meet chicks bro like that was it I was fucking fat I grew up I didn't have fucking no girls like me I want to girls like me so I motivated me to go out and do things and like obviously that change as I mature and got older slightly matured right but the truth of the matter is is like that's a huge motivating factor for man and now like dude back in the day yeah there was porn but it was like your buddy had like two magazines that you had to hide under like four piles of bricks in your neighbors

and fucking juking off together the jokes are on the internet dude like this is the shit we're consuming on the internet well you guys are consuming oh yeah I'm not consuming it nasty yes I get sense of interesting shit all right I get sense of interesting shit man anyway let's get into it man yeah but dude I want to say this I want to say this before we get into the show bro it means a hell of a lot that you're here you invited me to go on a duck hunting trip back in November I wasn't able to go I want to hit that with you at the next available opportunity I've never been hunting I never been duck hunting now that's healthy masculine yeah no you're gonna off together just make a shirt let me tell you self-conscious I just want to say thank you so much for for everything man like thanks for going up there being brave saying what you believe I know it don't feel like being brave because it's just who you are but it is brave it's showing a good example for people to speak up stand up half standards and uh american needs it now absolutely it's bad-ass to me you know what about being outspoken to I'm too a chapter in my life where I'm okay for the first time in my life I don't ever remember being a in a chapter in my life where I was okay being wrong yeah if I speak out about something and you can prove to me that I'm wrong and hey I learned bro it makes the world a lot easier when you can say you're wrong absolutely it really took me a long time to learn that too dude but I'm the saying I'm the saying I'm also okay with people disagree that absolutely yeah like hey this is my opinion like when we do this show there's always people that are like Andy I think you're wrong here Andy this is bullshit and I'm like okay cool like I'll consider that yeah I probably will still think what I think but you could think what you think and I think that's what's healthy for america man like when you're talking earlier about everybody kind of being in the middle I feel like that is the case I don't when we walk down the street bro black people and white people are getting along you know what I'm saying like this this division that we're facing is all bullshit and we're being forced to pick between two sides which neither side has our interests in mind or this country's interests in mind they have their own interests in mind and so when we walk through society and we talk about the issues going on I think it is important for everybody to realize like hey man most people are good most people are cool most people want the same things they want to be left alone they want to pay low taxes they want to be able to make some money they want to live their lives they don't want to be yelled at because of their beliefs or called names or bullied and bro we want to be not like dude when I go out in public people are nice they're not rude like even dude even like we joke right like we went to the Apple store a few weeks ago and I made this joke about non-binary people like that they damn so I said there was a lot of them and there was there was but I'll say this they were all fucking nice as shit everybody was cool you know what I'm saying america like whether they were trying to figure out how we were walking around I think that's really cool they thought we were a gay interracial couple so we were getting preference that's what it was that makes sense now I got you they were nice to us because they didn't know we were a couple of white supremacist domestic terrorists yeah especially you but bro I I that was Hitler's dream baby I literally call him Aryan Kaiser he's like a perfect white dude that's what I'm telling you that's what the little man was I tell you 64 yeah 64 perfect bill blue eyes blonde hair the little dude with the mustache was trying to build that that's what it was all about oh man fucking air is while I wouldn't be mad yeah break the fucking internet well bro seriously man it's it's fucking awesome that you're here love start to be here man guys let's get into it guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them links there before we get to our first headlines you I know you like Dana White I love Dana White Dana White big fan you guys see what happened in his most recent podcast interview yeah it was a great did you see this this is great yes check this out UFC chief Dana White leaves podcast host stunned by walking off at start of interview I'm literally done so Dana White sparked mass confusion on the podcast by walking out less than a minute after it started UFC CEO was appearing on the Howie Mandel dust stuff show before the bizarre incident occurred he was set alongside comedian ginger billy host howie mandel and his daughter Jacqueline Schultz podcast started with mandel giving a glowing tribute of white expressing his gratitude for the 54 year olds time here is the video clip let's talk about it only an amazing businessman you are an inspiration you are a philosopher the way you do business the way you conduct your business and your friendships and media is I'm jealous and but Dana I can't thank you enough for being here thank you for all the common words I appreciate it I am so fucking tired of doing podcasts it's I'm literally done with them I'm not doing any more podcast so I want to start by saying thank you for not leaving yet yeah look how confused they are bro the solar comfortable he does not give a fuck I think this is the greatest shit I've ever seen bro at least this year it's perfect but so far this year this is the best shit I've seen I love it but we don't know why like they're what's the back nobody knows the back so I'm gonna go back story I fucking tell you exactly why what do we want to tell you exactly why he left first of all I bet they don't know each other worth a fuck okay and you got this guy who is liberal minded who says all this fucking weird ass shit all the time pretending like their best friends dude you're a philosopher your Dana white is a real mother fucker bro like he's a real dude like he is he's a genius businessman he is smartest fuck he's a strategic guy like when you talk to guys like that they're not just hearing what you're saying they're automatically on the spot evaluating why is it they saying this and what's going on here what's the and you can see his fucking wheels turning and by the way this is all my speculation Dana could hear this and be like Andy you're full of shit but here's the reality how I read that was Dana knew he was in for some bullshit from the start because of how he was pouring it on and dude would I see him what I see happening there was he recognized that he's getting set up for some fucking stupid shit and he's like fucking I ain't even doing it yeah if it opens up like that yeah it's almost like he's he's he's giving you the positive up front now we're going to drop a bomb here in a minute yeah walking in the vents for Trump right right yeah or whatever yeah there's there's a hidden agenda in there that's what I'd be my spotty that's what I thought too bro and like dude we see this shit like just because someone is has a podcast or goes on a podcast we don't know who the fuck these people are we don't know what the fuck they're going to do and this guy has to be super careful about who he's around and what he's in you know what I'm saying automatically bro he's he's a he's the light that shines on him is so fucking bright all the time that like bro when this kind of shit creeps up he's he's just gotten to the point and well honestly where I need to get to to where it's like fuck this I'm not doing this shit because for me dude I get like too nice I'm like oh well you know oh and then I end up getting fucked you know like so dude when I should get fuck yeah bro it's real true when you when you have some recognition I mean bro you're legitimately fucking famous like legendary famous and I'm sure you know I mean you've experienced all this shit in your life but like dude when you have a name and I didn't know that bro I'm not even famous but I'm famous enough to where people want to like stand next to it you know what I'm saying yeah you're well you know what I'm saying yeah I like I imagine being like him you know I'm saying like you're wanting a $10 billion company and people want to stand next to you and then they want to leverage your name and bro it ain't always good and when you see the good in people and you were you try to do solids for people and be nice to people and then they end up fucking taking advantage of it and bro that's what I see there I see I see him recognizing a pattern that's happened to him over and over and over and over and over again and saying you know what fucking yeah I think it's great yeah I love it I hope you told me he would do my show so I hope he's still doing now if you come on the show I won't bullshit you bro I don't need nothing from you man I'm not gonna try to blow you before I start it just come on the show and talk some shit yeah let's talk about why you don't talk about the yeah I love it man guys tell us what you think down in the comments yeah my uh why Dana walked out let me bro you see it that way too absolutely yeah absolutely yeah yeah yeah he yeah he he you start off an interview blowing somebody there's that heart that was hard yeah that was hard that was the full got got got got got special yeah that's it yeah all the fucking inches down there yeah all the Dana yeah yeah that was a straight he could have sucked the basketball through a garden that's fucking right dude anyway that's my favorite thing to happen all year so far yeah we get in the show no I like it bro I love Dana white's fuck you bro that's what America needs America needs more of that I don't know if he realizes how much like he gives a lot of people permission by doing shit like that like he gives him the permission I think Dana is one of the smartest dudes on the fucking planet strategically you don't get to that level by accident bro no that's not what I'm saying I think he's very aware that he's setting an example but it also aligns with who he is just like brandy yeah brandy like I'm not speaking for you but I think you know that what your message is important but it's also who you are genuinely you know but do my jobs never been a job I mean it may my wife can tell you this it's it's my life yeah I mean it's literally my my job's never never been a job so like I said it was about telling the story but yeah inherently you know who you are bleeds all over that yeah especially music you know what I mean I know it's all about shit I don't have conversations bro and that's the difference between we could get on this conversation for hours but that's just great music and fucking okay music yeah you know great music oh we were talking about Jamie Johnson before the show the reason Jamie Johnson is so is Jamie Johnson is because his shit is real dude you you it's deep it real it touches you your shit's the same way bro I really want you to meet him I'm gonna make that happen for my 30th birthday my birthday my 30th birthday present Emily took me to a concert at his at Kansas City Power Light bro it was one of the coolest things I ever saw you tell me somebody to give it to you straight to god and he'll do it on stage yeah that give a fuck yeah he's done it a radio station like not too long ago he went off like this radio station was promoting it or something and they got up on stage at one point and he's like yeah I'll get the fuck off y'all don't play my shit no way did they responded like on social media they were like we actually play your songs all the time and he was like yeah not my current shit though everybody plays old shit man well the good thing about his old shit is that ain't ever going anywhere no that's how fucking great it is well you were talking about in color you said someone on your ring man I do I do think that's the best country song of our generation yeah yeah and I think it's I don't think there's anything close second I started taking guitar lessons when I was 30 and I played I took lessons I was 35 and then just got away from it and the whole reason I started playing was because of that song oh yeah yeah I wanted to learn that song I never learned it though when I heard that I was like I as a songwriter that's one of them you hear and you're like what did you think of that in the way it's written like there's there's no way perfect flow yeah in every night when something comes out like that it's just freaking legendary like I'll try to poke holes on it and say what I've said this different if you if you change anything about that song it gets worse it you screw it up yeah it's perfect all right anyway go Dana yeah go Dana why oh yeah guys let's get into our first headline that's number one headland number one reads CIA and foreign intelligence agencies illegally targeted 26 Trump associates before 2016 Russia collusion claims report you got see this no oh it's a big deal but I mean we I believe we've talked about this a number of times we've talked about president anybody in this room absolutely not here's the thing I mean but like this report has unopened and unleashed a shit ton of shit the fact that it's hitting mainstream media now is a big deal it's a big it's a big deal and and and honestly you know some of the things that have come out of this like it's complete like nobody even saw that it was that deep like it's deep deep right so so get in there deep let's get into it yeah well I'm I can I can get in there let's go yeah yeah I bet you know lie go lie you have white I know where part is half I know what part is why oh no no listen I'm black from the wall it down all right I'm sure we used to do that I'm sorry I'm sorry okay we said we was getting in we I'm done that's it no more all right the U.S. intelligence community asked foreign spy agencies who surveilled 26 associates of Donald Trump in the run-up to the 2016 election which triggered the allegations that the former president's campaign have been colluding with Russia according to a report former CIA director John Brennan identified and presented the targets to the U.S. intelligence sharing partners in the so-called five-eyes agencies the intelligence gathering organizations in the U.S. the U.K. Canada Australia and New Zealand according to a report published Monday on Michael Sheldonberger's public sub-stack the report by independent journalist Sheldonberger and Matt Taibi an Alex Goutentag has not been confirmed by the post they cite multiple unnamed sources including ones close to the house permanent select committee on intelligence led by representative Mike Turner Turner's office did not respond to the post request for comment now Jesse Waters did a really really good debrief of this and I got the clip so let's just watch a little bit was this that was out of the watch to post what's up now this New York Post oh okay well hell that's that's the word all right we have main street starting to pick this stuff up now okay yeah but it's becoming unhightable yeah well that's what it is I mean that's their biggest fuck up that they haven't accounted for is like do the spread you can't stop the spread of information you just can't like that's the one positive about social media as much you know there's plenty of negatives but you can't stop the spread bro like there's just too many people getting the stuff too quick well do when you think about when you think about how Facebook came around right you know one day it was you were you get you do any 10 foil you lower you lower to the top that's how 10 foil the fucking CIA stopped an operation on one day and the next day it was what was it called fake it was called a life book life book or something like that so the CIA had this operation called lifebook and what it was was an operation I was called something else what was it we covered it on the show a couple years ago so anyway they had a social media network that the CIA made to spy on people and to get their information and they closed the operation in the very next day like legit the next day Facebook was founded the very next day that's not conspiracy bro that's not coincidence okay so that what's interesting is all of this shit that these people have created to get information and sort of control the narrative of society is now blown up in their face no that's what's happening well I like that yeah me too it's wild and then you look at like even with the section 230 stuff and like how all these organizations are protected you know and then who they give money to to keep their protection like it's old school mafia stuff right yeah I thought what is that I think it was life's life's life vlog something like that yeah it was life vlog that's what it was called life yeah yeah yeah it was a shit it was a deal and the biggest gang in this country oh 100% yeah absolutely buy a big one yeah we we but the product the thing is we got to fix that we got to make our gang bigger well it looks like his hat yeah no shit yeah so let's watch this clip from Jesse Watt is this is his debrief of this this whole report here it is brand new details about how Obama's CIA targeted Trump and started the entire russia hooks for years we were told that tips from an Australian diplomat tipped off the FBI after a random conversation with pop a doppeless a no name 20 something but according to new reporting by Michael Schellenberger and Matt Taibi the whole thing was a CIA setup former CIA director John Brennan identified 26 Trump associates to be targeted by the five eyes intelligence alliance and then those interactions were the targets and were targeted by the FBI as suspicious and that's how the FBI launched the russia collusion hooks the details of this entire operation have been stored in a top secret binder in a secret room in Washington Trump ordered the whole thing declassified and now the rumor is that the binder might be missing do you know what I mean now one of the reporters who broke the story Michael Schellenberger Michael explain how this all started with the CIA picking these 26 Trump people yeah good to be with you Jesse well obviously this is an extremely serious story and serious allegation by multiple credible sources that public and racquet that's Matt Taibi's publication have spoken to these are people that are close to the house intelligence investigation of how the russia collusion hooks began the story as you mentioned was that oh we were just informed by foreign intelligence about this our sources tell us a very different story which is that this was initiated by the u.s. government it came from within the u.s. government's intelligence community including the CIA that they asked the so-called five eyes nations intelligence agencies that's the other english-speaking nations including britain australia to spy on 26 trump associates or at least they had a list of the 26 associates that were identified this is new information some people have theorized about this and speculated about it we feel very confident that our sources were in a position to know and are very credible in this report it's obviously a very serious allegation because this is illegal spine and it's illegal election interference okay so you're reporting that the CIA got these allies to bump these 26 Trump associates create interactions and then call these interactions suspicious and let the FBI know they were suspicious and that starts the whole thing what about this binder that encapsulates this whole thing and no one knows where it is right now or trump has it what's that well jesse will have a piece tomorrow that is specifically about the binder but as a friend of of the show and of yours on this i'll say that there has been widespread speculation that this binder was the was the reason or a reason for the FBI raid of mara lago and we'll be discussing that tomorrow but obviously if this binder contains what we have been told that it contains which may include raw intelligence information showing that the u.s. government the CIA and the intelligence community of the u.s. government initiated the russia collusion hoax that it did not occur in the way that the official story and clean the german investigation had portrayed it then that's extremely serious information and it may be if the FBI then went to go get it in order to continue the cover-up of this information that obviously adds an even more dramatic wrinkle to this again we'll have more to say about it tomorrow but this is a huge huge story i mean i can't i've been thinking about it in the history of the united states of america have we ever had something like this with the intelligence community is weaponized against a political candidate and weapon and using our foreign allies to do it i i can't think of a more important or dramatic story yeah and then going to great lengths hold on though do we really think there's ever been an election that wasn't fucked with an all-life old refreshing i think that started happen after kennedy was assassinated yeah i think before that we had real real elections really and i think prior to that or after that i think that's when it switched that's where because dude by all accounts tucker Carlson called cover this pretty in depth and it seems convincing and we don't know because they haven't released the official story but i mean they drew a lot of dots that said our own CIA assassinated president kennedy so what our fk uh... you know our independent presidential candidate right now says is that that a lot of people think a coup happened in twenty twenty but what rfk is saying is that a coup actually happened when kennedy was killed and and everything since then has been fear of it yeah uh so that and i actually think that's correct for everything that actually i did with that for a minute yeah had to know what happened because it was the mob side right in the secret service i didn't see i yeah well and if you think about it it makes sense for what this story you know that kind of naturally ties into what this story is all about you know a lot of people that haven't been and this is the big problem with what's been going on in the world is that it's so complicated and it sounds so outlandish that most people who are just trying to live their lives can't follow along you know like when they make the economy as hard as they made it and they make the situation for the working class as hard that makes it very hard for them to follow along what's actually going on and when we look at this like and people really break down what's happened here allegedly which means true um the cia Brennan told the the the five eyes intelligence okay four in allies to spy on trump and his closest people and then Hillary Clinton hired Christopher steel to make up the steel dacier which was the whole entire crime of Donald trump he's a Russian asset he and it was made up completely fabricated just like this was fabricated okay so when we look at what the reason is for why they hate this man so much it's because he's not part of the establishment and they're trying to do everything they can to keep him out and then when we think about what's happened since then right since 2016 when this whole entire shit came about that the media every single channel every single media outlet every single one every single celebrity in Hollywood every single influential person all of these people came out against trump saying that he was a Russian asset and the story has now been shown to be completely fabricated so what what is the punishment for that because to me that's treason because when we look at the disruption that that's created in society it's created eight years of complete chaos and society it's destroyed friendships it's destroyed households you can't have a political discussion with anybody anymore because they hate Donald Trump so much and when you dig into why they hate him it's because of shit that was completely fabricated out of the air so a few people a few very powerful people created this narrative that has now created this cultural divide the societal divide that we're dealing with now in culture you know and do what's the punishment for that going to be you know that's so many layers of insulation I believe in my heart hearts man there's there's so many layers of insulation those those two on the screen right there yeah they ain't going to wear yeah you know what I mean I mean it would have to be they aren't going anywhere unless someone like me gets in like that's real talk bro I'm putting them on fuckers in a woodshipper dude yeah real talk bro listen this is treat this is this is so incredibly damaging to our country because of the division that it's spurred and created and then when we think about the media's relentless division over race over politics over sexual preference or orientation over all these issues this is all for their gain and our loss and so dude we have to start recognizing the true story no matter what you think of Donald Trump you can think whatever you want you can say he's not for me he's not my cup of tea I don't like the way he talks blah blah personally I understand where he's coming from because the reason he's so fucking cocky and the way he says shit is because everybody else is dogging him all the time he has a stand up for himself I understand that got to your own horn you have to if you don't teach your own shit bro nobody else going to do for you especially when everybody else hates you and the biggest power matrix that's ever existed in the history of humankind hate you the most so I get it but like for a lot of people they just can't stand his personality or his ego he does have a big ego you have to have a big ego to get where he's at in life that's reality it's required they don't like that shit but dudes all that shit aside what we have here is we have people who have decided that their control over us is more important than destroying our entire culture our entire society making our entire way of life difficult disturbing the middle class pushing the middle class and the poverty through all the COVID shit like this is not coincidence this is orchestrated tyranny that's been happening for years and years and years in this country and this is just a major piece of evidence that's proving that it's actually true it's not just some shit that some podcasters saying right like here it is I agree with you dude like these guys they they are so insulate that's why they're comfortable doing it that's so comfortable that they don't they don't they don't feel fear to do things like this but in and what I think America is supposed to be we talk about the second amendment they're supposed to be afraid of us they're supposed to be respectful of us and you know I see all these people when they talk about the second amendment they say oh second amendment I lost my guns in a voting accident no dude that's pussy if it's time to lose them it's time to use them that's real shit come on yeah like we're not lying about this motherfucker I got all the guns I got a fucking tank you know I'm saying like fuck you two of them like yeah yeah that's so shit but like I'm just saying like bro we have to start standing up to them and saying hey if you push this line any further fuck off because dude they these people are way too comfortable bro I'm gonna do this like dude if I was president United States in the fucking we had 500 million guns in this country I would be respectful of that absolutely I would say hey we got to care about these people and I would do it out of my what I care about this country dude you know like everybody do we're Americans bro we're not black Americans we're not white Americans we're fucking Americans dude and we got to start realizing that the people that we've elected or they've elected themselves right yeah however they got there they don't give a shit about us and uh you know it's just crazy to think too like when you got the the president and and getting up on the stage and telling American citizens that if they're frustrated with their government how it's running and if they think they can overthrow the government that they're gonna need F-16s and like how how cocky is that oh yeah who you gonna get to fly home homie not only that bro and you got all the the people that support him saying yeah you ain't gonna do shit it's like bro you you look next door to me you ain't got shit yeah if this shit cracks off I'm coming to your house first motherfucker just so you know and I'm taking all your fucking food and fuck you no except for the vegan shit you can have that yeah like I mean dude they don't think no here's the thing when I see something like that man I feel like it's it's almost common sense in the background my way on other shit's been going on yeah right for a long time right but to see major news like it's different yeah bro that's a different I think this will if people they know part of me thinks like dude it'll open people's eyes but then part of me thinks some of these people are so stuck in their ways bro they'll ride to the bottom you know that there's there's there's some dangerous mentalities in this country you know the the sheep thing is real yeah man we've also been so far removed from conflict too I mean we talked a hundred of years of like where the conflict here in in this country right like we are so far removed from it that most people don't know what that looks like smells like or could even fathom that being a reality of something that can actually happen I guarantee you the minute it starts happening bro they're gonna be saying fuck dude Trump wouldn't let this happen oh they'll be on they'll be on fucking snap face trying to figure out what everybody else is where we're saying man like you know when comes to politics she's like you said you say what you want to but I think he's funny as far he we met him uh he did a rally down near the house and that he used the bus yeah and he met my wife and I knew one of the secret service guys I was chopping it up with him but I didn't know it was our you know we were supposed to be taking a picture whatever no walk up he I won't say he was hitting on my baby he was telling her how pretty she was I was like that's sound like that sounds like my fucking dad you know yeah I don't know probably you know he wasn't me a disrespect for nothing like that but I you know if you hate to do it is it is what it is but if we have a realness how many people you think legitimately I can't I don't remember of an election where people didn't necessarily vote for the winner they voted against yeah somebody yeah you know what I'm saying I don't know anybody I don't know that I've had a conversation with anybody that voted for my four Joe Biden that's right they voted against Donald Trump yeah nobody did bro yeah I mean and that's the danger of the angels yeah right there by hey man you can say what you want to about the guy but bro I like him too dude he resonates with my personality and I don't resonate with everybody neither do you right like we're we're we're a we're a choir taste as I speak and uh you know when I see him dude I you know there's things I don't agree with that he says or does sometimes but in general the guys to me how I read it is he's a fucking independent guy who's an entrepreneur who's become very successful in life and he decided to give up all of that and bro you know that success bro like like people don't understand what this guy's giving up man you're give this guy flies on a fucking full-size airliner as his private jet there are no limitations to a life like that that means like if we're sitting here and we say hey let's go to Dubai when I know let's just like that's the life that he gave up you know to do this and and you think he did that because he wants to go get abused just for his own ego like that's a hard thing for me to reconcile when people talk shit on him I'm like bro this guy gave up the best life that he could have ever built really probably one of the best life that anybody's ever built when you consider he was a he was an icon culturally he's a multi billionaire he's got he's in the social circles of every circle and in the face of the earth royalty leaders everybody and he gave that up to come do this job of service which is a job of service and these guys don't like that they don't want that they want one of them they won't play the game yeah and so like to me dude you know I sometimes when Trump you know I got to keep it real dude like when when people say dumb shit or do dumb shit I got to say what it is but like sometimes like I didn't like what he did with the vaccine shit and the operation works being all the shit but I also recognize the tremendous amount of social pressure that was on that man's back at that time to make a decision because had he just said no fuck the vaccines like a lot of people wanted to say you guys would have crucified him for that shit you know so like being told by somebody that you're being told by the guy who has been the head of national health for 40 years that this is going to kill people if you don't do this but like people can't put themselves in that position because most people have never let anything you know like you like like dude if I'm in this building like I don't do we got 500 employees bro I don't know what the fuck's going on out out on the outskirts bro someone comes to me and says hey if we don't fucking do that somebody I trust somebody who's you hey if we don't do this bro we're gonna lose the fucking ship guess what I'm fucking doing it yeah and like dude that's that's what people don't understand and so I do talk about the things that I don't like but all in all bro I mean this guy is the closest that he's the only thing that's good like dude if we have four more years of Biden we're fucked like our country's over dude and it's not gonna be Biden it'll be somebody it's gonna do worse damage yeah yeah I heard a funny story about Trump dude I do have to say this like what kills me about him is I understand like I'm not a big Joe Biden fan right I'm not hanging on Trump's nuts either but I'm not a huge Joe Biden fan I mean he's been a fervent hate towards the man I do you know I'm saying when you see people about here's the thing here's what I'm saying when Trump comes up in conversation you and we've talked about you know the lack you know in society we've lost the ability to have a conversation yeah right there's just it's so heated yeah you know Trump's name comes up I know people and do business with people that if his name comes up they're just disgusted yeah for sure I'll be goddamn if anybody's ever gonna have enough control over me right especially if somebody's my fucking animal I think that's a difference between the culture of of the Trump side and the Biden side bro or the the common sense side and the progressive side right I do I do not like Joe Biden I think he's a traitor I think he's on the payroll of China I think he's fucking destroying our country which my grandfather and fucking died for yeah okay that pisses me to fuck off so I have no love for the dude at all but like if like somebody like I have plenty of friends who are like yeah dude I voted for Biden and I'm fucking hate them right you know the problem is those people with you say I voted for Trump they fucking hate you yeah they don't just hate Trump they hate you you know I just look at people and I'm like well that's unfortunate bro you need to get better about making your critical decisions of life yeah I mean that's important yeah it's a point away but dude I heard this funny story about Trump one time bro he but it's gotta be true a buddy of mine went to the White House they uh they they want a they want a world series okay and he went to the White House and they have McDonald's firm when they got make they got make pro blows McDonald's apparently big

Turner warns of serious national security threat to us in cryptic statement now this this was a this made like everybody was freaking the fuck out on this all right did you see this this like tweet that went out oh yeah yeah yesterday it was freaking everything you mean you mean you mean the the big emergency that they put out exactly right after you know this right the Trump or the Tucker Putin interview I missed it under my rock yeah yeah it's all good so so this is shit that's a moral of story here it bullshit yeah yeah so so this this comes out from representative Mike Turner okay he puts this uh the tweet comes out from the house and intelligence community says quote today the house permanent select committee on intelligence has made available to all members of congress information concerning a serious national security threat I am requesting that president Biden declassify all information relating to this threat so that congress the administration and our allies can openly discuss the actions necessary to respond to this threat chairman Mike Turner but you like it sent the internet and fucking like a frenzy right like everybody's oh my goodness what's what you know what's freaking out um so the truth comes out about what exactly they're talking about here what's the big national security threat national security that is uh GOP warning of national security threat is about Russia wanting nuclear weapon in space that's it that that that was we're not gonna have a national security alert about the 22 million fucking migrants that are military age males that have come across the border in the last four years we're gonna have to alert about that hmm no way about that do we not legitimately think this is already at man bro this has probably been happening for 50 years just watch Trump did space force probably do I'm gonna go ahead and say this I hope we have fucking nuke since space yeah yeah I'm not fucking with you at all because I you know if somebody's gonna have it my hope it's us yeah I'm down I hope he wants some because he knows we fucking got him yeah well so here's to so so the Kremlin Putin and they they responded um and the response was Kremlin tries to shoot down claims it is putting nuclear weapons in space Putin's top spokesman accuses Biden of playing a trick to get more money for Ukraine that's the real reason yeah but did you see what oh fuck yeah that's what that's the real reason they got that bill they got that bill passed in the Senate they're trying to get it passed in the house so they create this emergency that fucking Putin's gonna drop nukes from the sky on her heads and then my all the while we got China flying spy balloons over a fucking country with EMPs and shit does it was wild to make it all right passed directly over us dude oh they watching you know there's no doubt about that hey they don't fuck my buddy hey too much much listen bro you you we got this fucking damn I want to take this moment to welcome Bradley to the top of the domestic territory watching you that's right oh fuck me that's a new watch list yeah bro that's exactly what this is about we got Kevin these are FBI agent to listen to yeah he's cool Kevin's he shares the show Kevin shares the show yeah bro what's so funny what people don't realize like because we talk all this shit you should be going back and forth to Wilma bro listen we got all all these three letters like they might be playing us bro I don't know but like these motherfuckers send us gifts and shit they're like keep it up here's my commission coin like all cats like all of the alphabet yeah all of them a lot of yeah like we got I know I got like close friends with a lot of these people yeah bro they all they all listen dude yeah I don't know why they're listening but yeah well they we know why listen and then they're playing us we're like keep going here build this big case please episode three I just keep talking damn fuck yeah everything we do this is good yeah I mean anything on this I mean I mean do you know what familiar with like how this shit's working with the Ukraine stuff like the fun with back stuff I mean very service yeah that no it doesn't take a fucking this fellow yeah I go a lot to you this fellow the fucker cracks me up yeah yeah I come yeah I mean listen dude people don't understand like if you're leading a country with legit hundreds of million of people in it right they're this guy like people like oh my god Putin's got nukes no shit he's got news but to be a leader bro you have to lead responsibly like he understands that if he drops a nuclear bot like all these people here you guys are fucking brainwashed against this dude you're not allowed to see his speeches you're not a lot of see his comments you're not allowed to see shit you're told he's a crazy ass fucking dictator because he doesn't let grown men dress up as women and shit they're dicks in front of kids that's what the fuck he doesn't do and you guys call him a fucking crazy psychopath because of that I personally think that if you allow that you're a crazy psychopath okay so maybe I should move to fucking Russia I don't know bro I like it here though this is my phone I'm a fight for it but but the reality is is that this dude is showing massive amounts of restraint and did you see his little chest move that he made today with Tucker did you see who he recommended for president oh Biden yeah so so so so we fucking got all the liberal media talking about how Trump and Putin are best friends and how I wouldn't kill everybody in America and then they ask him who he wants to win the president he goes well Biden will be best for us what are you gonna say to that shit true man it's fucking smart dude you know when you think about your vote you have to think about who's going into the wrestling ring what that does yeah and was easy pain yeah he's a real these are real leaders dude that's the scariest thing about Joe Biden to me is is I respect the office right but at the end of the day that dude don't belong in a room with that guy no no it's just no you know that's just terrifying to me bro that would be like us taking our elderly grandpa who comes over for Christmas that we sit over in the corner that we all know is gone yeah and who like you know when he talks we're like yeah grandpa yeah that's throwing a poodle yeah go and then tell them to go around the country yeah like dude we don't even like do you really listen to your elderly grandpa sits in the corner bro I mean really most of the week and he doesn't feel like he does a whole lot of talking yeah he does a lot of falling and I can I can lie to you dude I can't help it yeah it's funny I don't make a habit of making fun of the elderly I do but when he fucking falls off a bite or down some stairs off air force one is I can't quit laughing like I'll throw up laugh well bro why you got a wonder like dude the people around this dude are just like just go do that and he's waving well yeah imagine imagine having to be one of his like secret service guys that's like changes diapers and shit bro did you we didn't we cover the clip where he shit his pants in front of the fucking pope what yeah bro when he met the pope that was a real shit his pants in front of the pope and had to change his whole suit yeah that was a real thing bro shits his pants that's our that's our fucking they tried to come freedom we can't that's our country's leader bro yeah we can't be do I mean real talk I shit my pants plenty of times but never in an important situation like that yeah about to meet the pope you should probably like do a preventative movement that's right even if you ain't got to drink up a coffee smoke a cigarette yeah yeah for the for the listeners what what is a preventive movement what does that mean that means a preventive bowel movement like how does that but that means like before I go on stage I'm sure brandly does the same I got to make sure that nothing happens while I'm up there guys one of those things is to take a shit got it that's that's a fact that's a preventive movement yeah okay I don't know if it was like exercise I don't eat things I'm not supposed to eat I'm real careful dude I'm 44 years old bro I don't have the safe control I used to have I did it I did it I did it let's take a sneak up on you it doesn't have the worst to be sick yourself being on stage or just being older and not being able to control your shit anymore that's real shit man that's that's real shit yeah yeah well real is fuck guys jump out of the comments below let's know what you guys thought about that last headline let's get to our third and final headline guys headline number three I've been trying to hold in that is an epic fucking picture like that yes you like that I say this every top that is my favorite so madat right here no that is my nurture muscles they did not know that's my second favorite so madat right here who is a legal immigrant of the United States that he's been with me for what fucking seven years yeah he's no we've no you've not been with me since you were 16 oh six yes since 2016 so eight years I thought you were like I'm like what the fuck he's smoking bro you guys got hard last time it was this 30th birthday last night so maybe you went real hard having burnt day bro yeah so madat makes all these amazing graphics for the show bro and every time this one pops up I'm like that's the fucking best one yeah that's gays that dude well so here's the best part I I tell you the best part off the air because I can't tell you I can't tell I tell everybody we haven't we haven't done it already yet well I tell you it it's gonna be great we'll save for the house all right yeah all right well let's get it to have number three I tried to hold back but we got to we got to address it all right black people here we go well finally will it's be removed from election case against Trump judge to hear arguments there's been a lot of developments in this this is the girl from Atlanta this is so this is the DA Atlanta that's charging them with the Rico act right black she's she's black I disagree with the Rico print just don't promise a lot fucking hate just on GP well because they can get anybody on it they can get anybody they want with it yeah and did you know like like you know there's like a two-year bro anybody who runs an organization of any sort of any kind can be hit on that bro you could be hit on that with your band absolutely yeah where's the thing like the so like you know for the law the way the law is written they have like two years to to like get you on it but they can wait you know that last fucking day of those that two years and if they find anything else or another person the add-in and listen to listen dude that's not even they keep running at the same time it's so fucked up that's not even how they do it bro they listen we're not living in a free America anymore it's not like it used to be like you had to do some shit that's how it works anymore now it's all right they go like like they wanted to get me they would go to you guys and they would say if you don't fucking do this I'm putting you in jail for some shit that they made up like they just make shit up bro that's that's that's and and so they pressure all the people close to turn on and then they've got 22 witnesses this is what happened with his all it's all his attorneys and she would have yeah exactly what happened but here's the problem you know that in like I mean so there's four main you know criminal cases that that Trump has going on right now four big ones like 96 fucking charges or something like that but there's Rico one's a big deal but the problem is that again these people are not clean this bitch has been lying about who she's screwing the dude she's screw and she tries to get him to be the prosecutor on it and then there's still in taxpayer dollars to go do fucking love true well think about this bro so that's like a couple that'd be like you and Alex sitting at home being like yeah we're gonna fucking get this dude right so should that be a good this shouldn't even be a question while she was I mean the dude's really that to me that yeah this cool guy she just yeah I mean here's the thing by the guy by the time you guys hear the show she's probably already has been removed from it but but there's been some development so I mean she's had her best friend um oh you know Nathan saying that he hasn't had sex with her at all since last summer so he's fucking lying uh you got one of Fanny's uh long time friends says that there's no doubt that the Fanny and her in way were in a relationship that started back in 2019 and he's been married the whole time um she's seen them hugging and kissing but but that's not even the big big big thing uh it comes out in this trial that Fanny will is allegedly reimbursed her lover and fellow Trump prosecutor with cash for vacations so he was taking these trips charging him on his business credit card she reimbursed him with straight cash and then he still wrote that shit off on his taxes so I mean you or me will go jail for him he might go jail yeah yeah exactly no no that's that's the thing because there's a double standard here right that was a little and so like that's the fucked up thing but I want to you know I just want you guys to watch this clip and then you guys tell me if you think he's lying okay here's the clip did you go to a cabin with Miss Willis ever ever wait wait wait wait wait wait wait a cabin uh huh you lied uh bro he's look look look no that is a man that is a man who is contemplating his entire life no based upon the answer that he's about to give bro ever that was beautiful no he was watching give him watch him watch him watch him watch him watch him watch him watch him watch him I don't know we got time every fuck yeah if you go to a cabin with Miss Willis ever ever rapid No I'm here for the fucking the Obviously line and just straight up now I'm here for it bro they fucking get it Bro This guy for those of you guys listen on audio this dude is legit on the fucking stage on On a press conference look at it this girl's ass like Leop look at like That's him that's him saying man I had a great time with that cabin The epitome of a real people with the red thing hanging out Well Well technically wasn't a cabin yeah, it was more like it was a log house. That's how they play that yeah I actually think it was a tree house that that's no but like that's the language game I think it was a barn you know what no, yeah Yeah, that's fucked up. Yeah That's a fucking funny. That's picture That's fucking great these people are fucked man. These people are fucked you know what though. I mean there's We can find humor in it, but I mean Like the initial thing you put up on the screen. Well, Fanny will as we remove what up on it what the fucker name it How is that a question right? Yeah, well, I mean, that's a double standard bro, you know like all this stuff they do bro any of us We'd be in jail for a long-ass time And they know it too. That's why they act so blatant. They're like That's what about that's what's starting that that is one thing the blatancy These days are the things that are going on is is kind of troublesome to me not kind of troublesome It's very troublesome. It's like You know, I mean you look at the shit they're pushing on it's like the way the COVID thing happened. Yeah Blue my mind and Some of the people I consider close to me just being bossed around like that and took it Yeah, you know when they started telling us we couldn't play shit like literally did I thought I had a job It was recession proof. Yeah, and when they shut us down it was like what yeah, and they're telling us you got to do this that now and I know there People in our business that made like vaccinations mandatory in their camp. Yeah I'm not speaking bad about them people, but you know for where I'm my manager sitting right here When it came across the table There was no question and what no let me think about for 24 hours It was I can't tell a grown man what the fuck to put in his body bro. That's real You know, I'm saying they just bully me Bro, they tried to hit me with a $700,000 fine per employee if I didn't force them to get vaccinated Yeah, who did the fucking government, bro? That was their and bro I went on my Instagram that day. I remember I was driving my Lincoln Mm-hmm. I went out the Lincoln and I said well they just told me that they're gonna make me pay 700 K per employee at max fine if I don't get them vaccinated and I started just fucking dying laughing Fuck you. I'm not fucking doing that People are insane bro do whatever you're gonna do to me, but I'm not doing that these people are young They're healthy the shit just came out. We don't know what the fuck it does I'm old enough to know and remember and see all these commercials on TV. Did you take you know this or did you take that or had Were you exposed to this all this and they rushed this thing to the surface and you got Bill Gates on the Fucking stage talking about killing everybody and depopulating the planet and then talking about that I'm putting all this shit together. I'm like not happening dude. Not have take everything I got Fuck it put me in jet. I don't give a shit. Fuck you. It's not happening. I'll sit there and fucking Deal with it. Like dude. We did the same shit, bro And we took so much heat we took so much heat from our customers We fucking probably like dude half the cuz they were split down the middle right and like half the people that They were like, oh, I can't believe you guys are so responsible You know like and dude. There's people that still think that shit like there is people that are still on that shit Dude, they're still wearing masks. We went to the mall of Apple store. How many motherfuckers we see still wearing a mask? It was quite a few it wasn't it wasn't a lot, but it was it was 10% Yeah, it was more it was more than just like bro people and like you when you think about like the amount of fear and propaganda that was put on to people and then you look at the actual data that's out now where we have a all-cause Death increase across the globe reported by the insurance companies of 40 fucking percent. Okay, so that means 40 whoa wait, whoa, yeah, bro. Rogan's covered this too The insurance companies are reporting all-cause death across the globe is up 40 percent now What's changed in the last three years that would cause that must be only common? There's only one thing and everybody wants to pretend it's not real But I know two motherfuckers that fucking died under 40 years old after getting vaccinated I know okay, too. I got seriously fucked up from okay, and bro my DMs are close filled filled With people with vaccine injury from that vaccine and so like imagine the amount of fear and the amount of propaganda and the amount of manipulation that was put on these poor people like a lot of people like fuck those people that got the vaccine Bro, those are the actual victims of what happened like when we talk about like yes The people who were resistant took a lot of shit, but when we consider who the actual victims are It is the people who were highly manipulated by the biggest government propaganda scheme in the history of earth The internet didn't exist and during the Spanish flu of 1918 like this was the first time ever that the entire internet was weaponized to manipulate and That we that in this way and Bro, people don't know man like there's there's a reasonable expectation that a person should be able to Hear what the doctor Fauci says and say fuck he's telling the truth. Why would he lie to us? You know why would the news lie to us? Why would these people lie to us and They don't you know when people like us say bro, these people are out of line or they're fucking crazy or their psychopaths Or like what I say their communist and they were put were in the middle of a communist revolution We're domestic tear they think I'm fucking crazy and it's like bro Do you still think I'm crazy because like I have an a built dude listen my whole job in life It's to see the future. That's my whole job. That's why I'm good in business the reason I'm good in business Exclusively the reason I don't do shit in this building other than sit down with the top people here It's because I can see down the pipe that other people can't see so like when I take that and I apply it to what's going on in the world It's very easy for me to see what's going on and When I look at what's going on I see a lot of people that the common sense crowd or the the unvaccinated crowd Still hates that are the actual victims of what happened and yes Those people were crazy and yes they were out of line and yeah, they called us grandma killers but Consider the amount of propagation it took to get them to that point brother that's psychological abuse There were showing clips of people falling out in the streets the body bags and the grave They were digging they were digging fucking bridge and central fucking park in New York like people forget about that shit Yes, and like shit we bought it for the first like three days. Yeah, everybody did you know I'm saying like everybody was like holy shit Okay, this is some real shit. I remember hearing about it. This is no joke. I remember hearing about it But it was still over there you know you're yet and oh I was Dead tired I slept for like Literally slept till time for me Greek didn't meet Greek went back laid back down went and did the show laid back down Till we got ready for the next night meet Greek tested negative for the flu Three different times. I mean for like two weeks in it went away before we knew it was here You know, I think I tested positive for that thing several times Well, even with the testing stuff, bro. They turned up the rate the cycle rate on the PCR test was was turned up 10 points Yeah, by default so for so for that cycle rate on we'd a bunch of doctors on talking about this So what happened with that PCR test where they test you guys and I never had one but what they did was they made it so sensitive that any bacteria any virus that you may be carrying that we all carry at all times Would set off for a positive test so to the tune of like they were Yeah, so to the tune of like 97% were false positives. Yeah, is what they assumed Bro people don't realize that and then like what do you think about how about I mean that drove the case count number which drove the hysteria So they were One of the count one of the promoters that we work with had a thing where they wanted every memory your organization to take a test before they stepped off the bus at every Any yeah, and I had a conversation with somebody was like look man. I Don't I don't know who's financially capable of rolling the dice like that every week, but we're not I can't take five Pre-vote buses and five semi's to California Just to hope I get the play show because you know if one guy steps off my bus and test positive He's out for 14 days. Yeah, so is every fucking body else on that bus. Yeah, yeah, dude I can't do my job so yeah, we we made it we said look I'm gonna test my guys on Wednesday We usually leave a Wednesday night or Thursday I'm gonna test my guys on Wednesday if they test positive they stay at home. I'm on my one guy For you know 10 days. Yeah, right? You know, I'm not doing it every time we step off the bus and dude it you would have thought yeah, you're the devil Yeah, you know what I mean? How can you be that irresponsible? I'm not being irresponsible Being a fucking businessman. Yeah, and you know trying to do my job like you know how much money Bro, I mean people don't even think about it, dude. I had to turn my warehouse so dude They would only allow us so at that time back in 2000. What was that? 2020 we had You know fucking half the employees we have we have 200 employees 250 employees at the whole building and Mm-hmm and they said that we they said that we qualified as an essential business So because we sell food products, but I could only have 14 people in the building at once Yeah, cuz they did a square footage things like it was like the county put them in it in where you could only have so many people per square foot of your Yeah, so I had to rent the building next door a complete tire building Build a line over next door so that we could ship our products so I could run two crews to do it And one of my proudest things that that whole entire thing was not a single fucking employee of mine not a single one Missed an hour of pay if they were a 40 hour employee they got fucking paid There's not a single person that can say I got my hours cut. I got my pay cut I lost my job nobody got laid off nobody got fucked with I stood in front of all that shit for my entire fucking team We did too yeah, bro and dude that's that's a big deal that people forget about you know People should be now Supporting people who did that in their music and their business whatever they got going on because those are the mother fuckers That are gonna stand up for you when shit gets hard and I mean I will say this we were able to do that Man, that's that's one of the things a big deal, dude. I was super proud of that Yeah, me too, but you know one of it. I looked at it as an investment I spent just spent 20 years building something that's special and I didn't want to lose that and I love my guys me too I'm close to her families and you know, yeah, you know, just like it's a real responsibility Yeah, absolutely, but you know, I will say this there were people in the music business that couldn't yeah You know, there are people in every business that didn't have a choice but the like people love you know And it's but it's okay to go to Walmart. It's okay to go to Target and we can pack people in the fucking BLM riots Oh, yeah, shoulder to shoulder. That's okay. Yeah, but but but shut down But shut down Let's shut down the mom and pop businesses or the small entertainment acts, you know my buddy Ryan Harwick They they are partners in the one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world They do a lot of the shows actually their partners with Dalai Parton in like her dinner shows and Dude they they got their entire business fucking hammer because of this shit You know what I'm saying? They're just now getting it back to where it's kicking ass again 60% of small businesses are we're closed and we'll never be open again Yeah, 60% Durant bullshit, bro. I'm gonna tell you I don't think we definitely can't go through anything like that again The matter thing is man, what we're not people just got to say no about you is is and you guys in the show in particular's You're okay with saying hey at some point. We got a turn of origin action. Yeah, you know I know call you domestic terrorists for that right, but here's the thing at the end of the day man I feel like you know, and this is something we've talked about when it comes to my son You know, I've explained aggression to my son. I've explained violence to my son. He's six years old When people may say well, you're exposing your kid to think you know, he shouldn't be exposed But you'll put a you'll put somebody's try to be something else in this classroom that's around and that's all right You know my thing is at the end of the day, man. That's insane To me here's the thing honest to God, you know, we talked about Keeping it moving and keeping things in peripheral. Not bothering me. There are people if you anybody that knows me well, right that works with me You know There's a lot of people my manager is is a gay man. It's nothing. I don't have You Sorry During the day I I'm like, damn, I'm like, right? Yeah, homophobic are you over, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Holy. Really? Well, they are always jacked though. Like, they always are in good shape. Oh, dude. His husband seriously looks like he made a few ups. You know what, man? Aaron, it's all right, bro. We don't listen. It's all good. Oh, love here, man. Yeah. All right. I'm not doing podcasts anymore. Yeah, I'm gonna look fuck out. You know, my thing is, you know, you hear people say, I don't have a problem with black people. It's not that I don't have a problem with that. I have love for you. Yeah. That dude called me, I'd done stop whatever I was doing if he needed me and he helped him. And you know, bro, it's not a gay issue. I don't have hate for anybody. My thing is, I feel like all of his ever responsibility is men. I think we have a line, right? I think all of us have a line. And for me, I feel like that line moves. But I think it's healthy. And it's an necessity for us for survival. We all have to have a certain point. You can push me here. But you ain't gonna push me past them. This is when I push back. And with me, my line is my kids. Yeah. Right. And you know, when the Bud Light thing was going on, I don't know if y'all saw the clip. They were up in arms because you smash the Bud Light. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Most of them didn't do their homework. We'd been doing that shit shows in a row before Bud Light ever did. Right. So it's like a, we'd have my tour manager would get down in the pit and throw me a beer up. And I'd smash it or poke a hole in it and throw it to the drummers. Yeah. Every night it was part of the spill we do before bottoms up. But everybody got all up in arms. And they were like, you know, the cover song that's playing in the background the lead singer was gay. It was like, I don't have a problem. I don't hate gay people. Yeah. And then we were like, it's not a gay issue. No. It's a culture issue. Absolutely. There's the thing. Until you project that towards my children and weaponize it against my children, I won't take, I'm not taking an issue. Bro, most people don't really like shit being pushed on me. Yeah. Right. To the COVID thing or anything else. But dude, I feel like our kids are confused enough and they deserve to be able to be fucking children. Yeah. This is shit where they're letting them take like hormonal drugs and stuff to do. That is ludicrous to me. Yeah. You know, we're crazy to them. Yeah. Right. Because we like, we shoot guns and shit and we believe in God. Like crazy. My, my, my thing is dude, at the end of the day, one of the things I respect about you most is not just that you're willing to just be got to get certain things, but you're willing to go step further and say, hey, at some point, dude, there has to be a line and we have to push back. Yeah. And we got to hold that as individual in our own lives. And I'm perfectly comfortable with that, man. Yeah. I, you know, I think it's important for our son and our daughter, but mainly my son. Man, I'm not trying to raise a little boy or a little girl. I'm not even trying to raise a man and a woman. I'm trying to, I'm trying to, in the society we live in today, my wife and I are trying to raise a king and a fucking queen. Yeah. We're trying to raise leaders because, you know, maybe at the end of the day, you know, the sheet mentality, there's going to have to be kids that grow up leaders that are able to say, hey, this is what I believe in. And, you know, and to march a certain direction and, you know, to be able to give somebody something to follow. That's what we're trying to raise. And, man, you know, we're seeing all this division and we're seeing our society kind of collapse in front of us, right? And you're one of the few people that will say, hey, shit's getting fucked up. Yeah. I'm just paying attention. If you hadn't noticed it, we're getting fucked up. And to me, man, and I don't know if it's just that she's got me back in church recently or whatever, but I am a guy guy, dude. I believe in God, too. And, and my thing is, I feel like it's just, it's just written in stone, dude. The further we get away from him and the further we take this country away from him, the more we lose it, you know, I think at some point, we're going to have to give it back to him and get the fuck out of the way. Yeah. Or the shit's going to get real bad. Yeah. But, you know, it's, it's, you know, it's, and it's to the point now where I was having a conversation with somebody the other day and it's like, they're not all my kids fighting or war. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's just that's where we're at, bro. We're at, we either got to solve this or our kids are going to have to solve it. Yeah. And that's a big fucking deal. That's super, super true. And I just feel like, you know, we, we, we have lost our ability to have a conversation. Because I feel like dude, no matter how, how passionate somebody is about something, I feel like if you put, it can be somebody that thinks the opposite of what I think on every subject under the book, if you put us both in a room, and I'm not talking about physically, right? Yeah. We'll find some middle ground for sure. Well, at least we have to have a conversation. And we hang out for a day. We're going to have a good time. Absolutely. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? I think we've forgotten how much common ground we do have. Yeah. You know, how like minded we are in certain things. And I mean, I just tell you, it's sad, it's sad to see, but as a dad, man, I've never been, I do to be afraid of much outside of snake sharks and commitment. And that changed when I got married. And I'm scared of snake sharks and my wife. But you don't terrify from my fucking kids. Yeah. I really am. And, you know, this, this school thing that she's done, I know a lot of people are looking at it. You know, you're socially distanced and then from people and necessarily that, we have things that we believe in that we don't think need to be lost aspects of a healthy society, man. And dude, one that God and Jesus are a detriment to is not anything I'm going to be a part of. You know what I mean? What do you believe or not? There's nothing in that book that's teaching you hate anybody. No. You know what I mean? Is this not promoting anything that I feel like is unhealthy? I just, man, I respect you guys for taking a stand and actually kind of taking it a step further. Like I said, saying, hey, it's something point, man. And like I said, my line's here. My line's here. My kids and my guns. You take it away. My family. It's not happening. It's not happening. No. No. Dude, I think you're making a, you're bringing up what I, first of all, I appreciate that very much because that respect is mutual. 100% there. And you know that. I think you're bringing up a very important point because I feel like most people believe that there has to be like some leader that steps up and organizes some sort of resistance against all this shit. Bro, that leader is you as an individual in your home. That's right. You have to draw the line in your own life and say, what am I willing to tolerate and what am I willing to push back on? And whatever that thing is that you're willing to push back on, you have to get engaged and start pushing back on it, start doing things in real life. Like if you're, if you have kids at a school where they're doing this crazy shit or grown men because it's never women, it's never women that, that dress up as men that go do the thing. It's always these grown men dressed up as women and they're not dressed up as women. They're dressed up as little girls, okay? Reading books, but they're not reading books. They're dancing around and doing stripper routines. If you have that shit happening in your class or you've got teachers telling your kids, they should be this and that and lie to your parents about your new name at school and all this shit and you're not fucking showing up and doing anything about it, bro, you're a bitch. Real talk. Yeah. And dude, that has to happen. There's no organized militia. And by the way, if there was, you're too pussy to join it because you won't even speak up for your own fucking kids. So I think that's the point you're making here, bro, which is there's a line in the sand that we all have to put in our own lives and we don't let people step on it. And that's it. Dude, if everybody lived that way, this shit wouldn't be happening. It wouldn't be happening at all. And to your point about gay people, most gay people are super against this drag queen shaking their balls in front of kids shit because they understand the damage that it's doing to their movement, which they've worked very hard to get. Absolutely. People have been persecuted against in this country for a very long time and wrongfully so in my opinion, I don't agree with the far right people that fucking say there's no room for gay people in this bullshit, bro, they're just people. They love someone else. They should have every right to a normal life without being persecuted or any of the shit. They should get the same benefits everybody else gets. There's nothing wrong with that. When it encroaches into the other stuff, they're recognizing the damage that it's doing because it is creating an anti gay movement in this country, which in my opinion is very wrong. We don't need it. You know what I'm saying? So, unfortunately, just the natural progression of it. It is. It is. And that's why gay people are starting to stand up against this stuff, dude. Like you guys that gaze against groomers, when we had them on the show, you know, they're more vocal about it than anybody because they understand the damage it's doing to their culture. And I think it's super important to state that when we talk about these things, because bro, you guys can't go out there and just be like fucking being assholes to people who are gay. Yeah, but it's cool. Yeah, Aaron is cool. He's handsome too. I can see why the dudes like that. I'm sure. I'm sure you would. But yeah, that, I mean, like he is, I mean, we're talking about kids, my kids age. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they need to be learning how to fucking read. Not only that, dude, it steals their childhood. Absolutely. Like, dude, when we're kids, I don't want them being taught about straight shit. I don't need them being the gay shit. That's right, bro. We're not going to go talk to them about men and women. No, having, let's go down to Hollywood and grab Cindy off the pole and let her do story out. You have a problem with that. Yes, that's a problem. Every single American in the country would say, oh, you got strippers reading books and doing dances in front of kids. And they'd be like, that's a polling. It's a problem. But you put a grown man who, honestly, what you're not wanting to be around those kids unless there's a fucking problem in your fucking brain. Well, here's the other thing too. How many of those same fucking drag queen story I was ever seen where that petafiles, they always end up, bro, like they get arrested because they got fucking kiddie porn on the laptop. Yeah, like every one of them, bro. Yeah, I can't say everyone. Not out of ten. Well, it's definitely not uncommon. And say that last one they just haven't called yet. Yeah. Yeah, but, uh-huh. You guys want to wrap it up? We got one last second. Yeah, bro. All right. This is our favorite part. Guys, this is our thumbs up or dumbest fuck. That's where we bring a headline in. We talk about it. And then we'll get one of those options. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, brother, he's a fucking man. Yeah. So we bring a headline up and it either gets thumbs up or gets dumb as fuck. So this is our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline. It reads, Southwest passenger fumes as fellow flyers sits directly behind him on nearly empty flight. Look where he decided to sit. Listen, yeah, let's not into it. So he just wanted to decline in peace. Washington based chef, Anthony Thomas was baffled by his fellow traveler's decision to seize the seat directly behind him on a nearly empty Southwest flight despite dozens of options available. Quote, imagine having the luxury of boarding a flight with only two passengers on it. Thomas wrote on X, sharing a selfie with the man sitting directly behind him on the open flight. All the seats on the flight look where he decided to sit. Two other passengers are seeing nicely spaced across at least ten rows behind Thomas. Here's the Pisserie Post. I mean, it is absurd. Yeah, that's fucked up, bro. Yeah, it is absurd. I fucking get what he's saying. I mean, what the fuck, bro? I'm just funny, too, though. Yeah, I just feel like I mean, like, and guys will know this, right? Because I mean, this made me think of another situation where space is important. Dude! It's the same thing. Yes, I have an issue. I got a bug. I agree. I agree. I'm guaranteed that they don't play with the same one that Mike Tyson made up. Bro, I'm fucking telling you, dude, listen, when you're in the fucking journals, okay, and a dude walks past seven other journals to stand next to you, that's fucking annoying as fuck. It's weird. That is exactly the same thing. Just ask to see my dick. Yeah, bro. Everybody's like, oh, you're saying just ask me. Yeah, like if it's in a sporting event, bro, we're all doing the thing. We're all in a line. It is what it is. It's a different thing. That's a different thing. But like, bro, you motherfuckers that do that shit in the men's bathroom, there's something wrong with your fucking brain. Really shit, man? Yeah. Like, bro, the rule is at least one year in or in between. One space, yeah. And if there's no available urinal, you fucking, listen, you're fucking getting next and you keep your eyes on the fucking wall. You don't say shit. You don't smoke conversation. Yeah. There's no, there is a space you can have conversation. Listen, you might say something like, oh, man, it's great. Yeah. I would see that home when I was awesome. You might say some fucking bullshit. All right. Yeah, this happens at a bug. Yeah. Right. Yeah. There's no dividers, typically in those places. Yeah. There's no dividers. Dude, I got phobia about pissing next people. You know, like, it's because you lie about your dick. No. No. Out of these urinals, guess which one I got to use? You got to use the word on the right because I want on the left. I'm using. No, no, I got to use the one on the left. You can't take my joke and reuse it. You fucking, man, once against the code. Yeah. Anyway, I wouldn't mind having one a little higher, but he obviously. I can use my house. I don't like to make splashes. I'm a shit. You know. It's hard enough to find the motherfucker. Yeah. She is mad at me by pissing on the floor. Like, well, goddamn, at least I found it. You know what I mean? Fuck. Bro, I feel like this dude here has a legit guy. Absolutely. Yeah. That's unfair. It looks like a nice motherfucker, dude. Yeah. And dude, the back probably honestly, he's looking at his phone. He's probably one of the motherfuckers that don't ever look up. And he's got a pause in. Yeah. He don't even know. Now, he's lacked total self awareness, bro. NPC, bro. This is the motherfucker that goes down the wrong way in the grocery store. Like he comes down the way you're supposed to go down on the right. It's America. Yes. It's a fucking, the grocery aisle is like a road. Yep. He's poking a lot of the stuff. Yes. People understand this. And he's the motherfucker that comes down the wrong way. No question. It looks like you're fucked. Yeah. Oh, he just stands there and looks at you. He's your mask. Yes. Yeah, that's him, bro. Yeah. I can't even see you. I can't even go to the grocery store. Like I cannot do it. It was weird. I had to go the grocery store. Christmas Eve. Mm-hmm. Okay. Because Emily and I do stockings, right? We don't do gifts. You know, we're blessed. We get to do what we want to do. We do like stockings. So like we'll put like each other's favorite candy and shit in there, right? So I had to go to fucking deerburgs for the first time in like 10 years, dude. I don't go the grocery store. Yeah. Holy fuck. Well, by the way, the store was beautiful. And that first form display on the end cap is definitely not an ad, but it was amazing. It was nice. I did spend 35 minutes and you could go fucking find the tape of fixing that motherfucker too. So y'all owe me a little bit of money. All right. But I was making a little nice man. I care about that shit. You got to do that. Like, dude, if you're in the store, if you're in a store where they're selling you shit, you shit's all fucked up. What are you doing? That's right, bro. Absolutely. I'm fixing it right there. It's the way it is. But anyway, they don't sell much in the store anymore. Yeah, I know, bro. It's all digital. It's so weird because going to the, dude, that's something these young guys will never understand. Going to like best buy or street side or one of these record places that sold actual albums, that was one of the coolest things ever. Oh, you may have been waiting for the motherfucker to come out. Bro speaking of, yeah, dude. And then finally getting in here. Bro, you get there. And you were hope there was some there. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Because the shit was so hot. Like Jamie Johnson. He's got that song between Jennings and Jones. People don't even know what the fuck that means anymore. Because they don't have to go look for the albums. You know, he's talking about his album being right between these, anyway, fuck it. We sound like a bunch of old dudes. But the point is they're not do feel like I've been across the old man face life early. Like I'm, I feel like I am one. Dude, you know why? Thing away from hollering at a kid for drive to fans. Now, bro, I tell you why that is because I'm the same way. It's because you've worked a lifetime already. You didn't get where you are. You guys did not create what you've created with your brand with a little work. It's not nine to five, bro. It's full time job. So as at what do you 38, 39, 39, 39 years old, you've already worked 100 year life. And so like, dude, we, we meet guys like us who fucking, that's our whole thing. And that's what we do our whole lives. We dedicate our whole presence to it. We become old men early. Like we get that, you know, that shit that old people have. We're like, fuck, I don't go fuck. Yeah, we get the shit early because like we've, we're that age on the inside. That's what they're doing. Show me a little bit of grace. Yeah. I'm getting old. She made me because she knows I'm dying. She better do the work and broke that she knows I'm dying. So I didn't live alone. And she is going to fuck you up. Yeah, bro. See, she ain't in a show. Tell me truth. I don't want it. Okay, that looked me. He's a pretty good friend of the real. You know that look me. He's no friend. Shut the fuck up. Yeah. That means if you want the Colonel. So we're in South West guy. We'll be giving some thumbs up. Yeah, he's right. Well, he's right. I wish you had a turn around and Mike Tyson that motherfucker. That would have been a better video. Bro, what ever happened to that? I don't know. I'm telling you, dude, can you imagine being, I mean, I don't give a shit. How Mike Tyson is? How the fuck you going to fuck with Mike Tyson, dude? Bro, did you see him? He just did a video. No, bro. He did that fucking exhibition match. I think who would he fight? It was the man with event. Roy Jones. Yeah. Bro, this dude's in his 50s moving like he's fucking 20 years old. I think he took it super easy. He did. He could have killed him. He could have killed him. I'm not going to fight one of the Paul Brothers. I was like, I legitimately want to see that. Listen, I like the Paul Brothers. I like Jake a lot. I don't know Logan. I know Jake for a long time. He's a tremendous athlete. He's hard as fuck in terms of work ethic. This dude, he's a real fucking athlete, bro. Oh, yeah. A lot of people fuck with this guy and talk shit. I'm telling you, dude, I know the dude personally. He's a big motherfucker. He's strong as fuck. He works as fucking ass off. Mike Tyson would still crush him. I did. I'm sorry, Jake. I mean, the way that dude, he's just a different thing. Dude, but I do think Jake, I think Jake legit is going to become like a champion of boxing. I think you could take anything away from me to one of them guys. Yeah. You know, anybody is willing to dedicate themselves like anything. Yeah, and he has, bro. He's going to afford the best coaches. Yeah, but. My fucker, that guy, that guy's up at three o'clock in the morning training for boxing. I'll fucking be doing multiple workouts. Yeah. I'm just going to listen. You still got to do the work. Exactly. That's what people don't understand. You can buy all the best coaches. Yeah, they work. Yes, they think because those dudes are famous and they were famous before, the same rules apply to them that apply to everybody else. If you want to be great at something, you're going to put it in the time and he does. Yeah. I mean, fuck, bro, you can't take any shit away from Logan either. Logan got the ring with fucking. What's his name? You can't hear me. Fucking boxer. Floyd. Floyd. Floyd. Well, may weather. Who's the fucking bro? And what's a fight? A fight is entertainment. Were you not entertained? Yeah. Who's super entertaining? Yeah. So like dude, it bothers me when people talk to shit on these dudes because like they're real dudes, they're real athletes. They work really fucking hard. And I mean, bro, I truly believe I don't know. You guys think I'm crazy that I think Jake could legit be like a fucking legit boxing champion eventually. I think so too. I mean, dude, if you put the work in, but that's the, that's, that's my own of us. And I still think my Tyson go fuck you up dude. Oh, dude. That guy just moved. Dude, he's, yeah, man. And he's a different kind of mean too. Yeah, you remember that dude, that one interview he did. We're the other guy of fucking ass. Dude, do I get dude? Dude. Fucking you. That's a different kind of anger, man. Yeah. He bit a motherfucker's ear on the pay-per-view. Yeah, he did. I watched that shit live. I was like, oh, he bit his ear. When you're watching it live, you're like, oh, he's bleeding from the ear. He bit, no, he bit a piece of a van or holyfield's fucking ear off and spit it on the crowd. He did. A pay-per-view. Dude. I love some Mike Tyson. Bro, me too. That's our era, bro. Yeah. Bro, when we were kid, this is, this is what's fucked up, man. Like, the technology is really kind of fucked the life experience for a lot of people, bro. When I was a kid and my tight, when my Tyson fought, dude, I'm gonna tell you this. The world stopped. Yeah. And everybody was doing something. Everybody went to someone's house that was getting the fight. I mean, it was like the Super Bowl times a hundred. The world stopped, bro. Mike Tyson's fight. What are you doing? Everybody's watching the fight. It's just a different thing, man. It's not like that anymore. Even at the biggest stuff because the internet's such a distraction thing. I mean, it has just good parts too, but. Yeah. I mean, here's the thing. Even what I said earlier, man, I don't, I'm not gonna come across like, obviously we've benefit from the internet, right? Yeah. Social media. Like, we need it for work now that. It's great for certain things, right? It's great for certain things, right? You know what I mean? But I do believe in either conversation with somebody another day. I don't know that I've seen a marriage it was good for. Yeah. You know what I mean? If you're not using it for business or something else like, you know, that was about a point two. People are showing you their best or their worst. Yeah. And the best part about it is you control the narrative. The worst part about it is you control the narrative. Yeah. I mean, on ours, I mean, just for example, you know, you'll see the best picture they took out of me out of 300. Yeah. You know what I mean? Were you like on there about me being, you know, loyal to a fault or impulsive or, you know, an addict or, you know, you don't see the bad shit. You know, how I watch my kids grow up on FaceTime. And should I'm not proud of? Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, yeah, I think, dude, that's what I respect about what you guys are doing. The people are out there telling the truth and showing you the good to bad and ugly. I got respect for that as much respect for that as I do. Anything in the world. Well, I think it's important for people to keep that in mind, dude. Like, you don't become, you know, a music superstar or a CEO of a big brand or any of this stuff you guys want that you see these dudes out here. Like, bro, they got the same fucking problems you got. If not more problems because of the responsibility. Now, I'll be real, bro, I'll take those problems over the problems I had before. Yeah. Like, when I was trying to figure out how to fucking eat. Like, I don't like that. That was a shitty problem to have. But, there's, there's struggling that. And there's, there's, there's faults. And all of us men out here that go on the internet and pretend like we're perfect and everything's great. And we've got all the shit going together, bro. That's a lie. You're lying to people. Okay. And what's happening is you're showing people who have faults who do not have the confidence or the wherewithal or the awareness to understand. You're making them worse. You know, they're seeing that this image of perfection. We see it a lot right now with the, I guess, the manosphere or whatever you want to call it. Like the men influencers, you know, they're like, fuck, dude. I'm the man. And if you ain't like me, you suck. Bro, that's, listen, bro. Those guys got problems. Those people got issues. And we all do. It's called being a human being. It's called being a human being. We all have faults. We all have shortcomings. We all have problems. We all have struggles. And I think if people were just a little more transparent with that without making it their whole identity, right? Because that's where the internet has gone for a while where people just use that entire, I got all these problems. And it every post is all their problems. Bro, let's see. They're one way or the other. Yeah, man. Just be real, dude. Like when you're a fucking rock star, fucking your rock star, when you're shitty, you're shit. We're not rock stars every fucking day. I mean, you are. But you know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? No, bro. Like we just, we got to do our generation of man has to, has to, has to be a little bit better at leading in that, in that regard in my opinion. Oh, dude, we got to do a lot of things better, man. We got to get back to home. That family unit thing, man. Not being friends with your kids, being a fucking parent. You know what I mean? Being willing to stand up for stuff and just, I mean, she's no backbone anymore, man. When you can hide behind the screen and say whatever the fuck you want, and not be able to be held accountable. Yeah. Like that's a dangerous, that's a dangerous thing. You know, we're so fragile, you know, in society, right? Because we're so bold on the fucking internet. Yeah, we got to go back to fighting each other. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? Fighting the parking lot. This fight. That's right. I'm just being those kind of person. I mean, I have to go to the truck and get some shit to come back with. That's right. That's a big difference between people are age in this younger generation. This people are age, bro. And then do you think of the stuff they miss out on by not being that way? Like, bro, the people who I have fought physically in my life are my brother a million times. He's my best friend. My other best friend, Chris, got in fights with him. You see what I'm saying? Like, there's a bonding experience that happens through those conflicts. And there's respect earned and there's humility earned. Absolutely. And we don't earn that anymore because now these kids, they watch on TV that, you know, if they get disrespected or get harmed, they're going to shoot you. Like, bro, that's some bitch ass shit, which is docks. Yeah. Like, we need to go back to being real men. And like, dude, you guys who are women and you don't understand this shit, like, you know, you may not understand this. This is a part of male dynamic that is existed for fucking thousands of years. There has to be physical conflict in order for respecting humility to be understood amongst men. There is a natural pecking order that happens along that way too. And that's why we have all these people who are so comfortable on the internet talking all this shit. And you know why? Because they've never been in a fucking fist fight. They've never been punching a fucking mouth. They've never been embarrassed in front of 30 people who are watching them in a fist fight. Like, bro, it's a big deal. Oh, then that sucks, man. Yeah. You hear these guys talking about, I ain't never, I won't ever fight ever with it. Shit. I mean, you have my shit kicked in. Me too. And learned more from that. Yeah. Then I ever did for women. Yeah. Well, I'll be real. I think I got my ass kicked more than I won. I definitely did. Yeah. For sure. You know what? Every time I got my ass kicked, guess what? I fucking deserved it. Oh, every time. You and me both. Every time, dude. You and me both. Love it, man. Well, guys, Andy, man, this is a good time. Yeah. Yeah. Well, man, bro, they get it. Yeah. I'll sit here all the fucking night. Yeah. I've got the first four. Screamin' freedom, baby. That's right. I hope you ready. That's right. We won't. Andy's half. Well, I'mma drink a little more. I'mma chase you around like a ham. Go over there. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. You can take a, he got a whole fridge right around my back. He's two, three up. We'll get one for Eric too. Yeah. Yeah. We gotta come out. We gotta sit you up and come with that party. Let's do it. Come straight on. That's a night. That's a night. We're going to Andy's at night. We're going to Andy's at night. Come on. You missed a part where Andy hates gay people. You didn't hear me? Look at domestic terrorists and everybody's watch. That's right. He hates traitors and gay people and black people. We can't even stand here. We don't even know it. No, that's fucking DJ, bro. That's not me. That's him. No, it's not. We gotta have a powwow before every fucking show. I'd be like, hey, man. Keep it even today. That's not, it's not white people. I hate black people. Bro, that's not it either. You just hate everybody. Everybody. You know what it is? You hate bullshit. That's what the fucking is. That's what it is. Anyway, I got respect for that. Yeah. He fucking hates it, bro. And there's no give on it either. Like what he fucking, it's like someone like this is what makes him great at security. Someone's out of line, bro. They're out of line. That's fucking it. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? It's not like you're the month thing. 90% of the time it's last. That's what say. That's what you are. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's not, my thing is that I don't care what color you are. What gender you are. What you left right side. I don't give a fuck. You know, I'm going to show your respect to you. Give me a reason not to. That's right. And bro, we, all those people combined, have to come together and realize, bro, we ain't each other's enemies, dude. Those tyrants up there disturbing their entire life in our entire country and making it hard for people to eat and survive and put paychecks together to connect. Those are the fucking enemies, bro. And it ain't the black guy. It ain't the white guy. It's not the gay guy. It's fucking, it's the fucking tyrants, dude. And they'll do everything they can to make us think that we were the enemy of each other when we're not. And we all want the same shit. We all want to be left alone and earn money and build a life and do cool things with their life, lives a life that's meaningful. I think a lot of people believe in and we can't do that when we're constantly being manipulated to hate each other. And that's a big problem right now. If we could come together and realize that, the Shibba stock conversation. That alone, man. I think that, I can take 20% of your time that you spend on a screen and put it into your home and your family and your church and your community and your kids. I think the whole world's different. Yeah. I really believe that in my whole heart. I believe we all have enough good in us. we focused that kind of injury and that kind of passion into that home unit. Right, and that's one of the things that she's been awesome about is kind of reminding me, yeah, dude, I have a platform and I can share things with, you know, I can be really loud if I want to. Yeah. But man, it's like somebody asked me the other day, you know, what I want to be remembered for, I didn't know I was that old to be. And it was that a meet and greet thing. And I tried for about five minutes to come up with an answer that had something to do with music. And I couldn't think about, I literally said, I said, listen, I said, y'all gonna hate me for this. But then today I want to be remembered as a good dad and a good husband because I mean, it don't really matter what the fuck y'all think. I mean, if my kids think something different, my wife thinks something different than I have failed that life in general. Yeah, I'm saying that. Sure. She's good about reminding me to kind of focus on home and, you know, I think that resonates everywhere else in your life. I think that's what's going to solve the problems, too, bro. Well, brother, thanks for so much for coming. Thank you for having me. I had a blast. Yeah. We did too. I could run to a fucking wall right now. I'm about to go make me a sign in protest. We need to come up with something good. But I'm ready. Let's do it. Let's go. Let's do it. All right, guys. Well, hey, that's the show. Don't be a hoe. Try the show. All right.
