So uh, don't be a hoe show the show all right And then another thing Buy my shit Not an ad All right Anyway, you know what's cool about that. I mean we talk about Like for somebody who can who can accurately speak on culture bro, you know what's cool is seeing all the stories of the people Uh, our customers who like are out in the stores and they'll see the cans and and they go straight No, yeah, and get those logo straight. Yep. Like you talk about movement. You talk about true real fucking yeah Like that's it. Listen cool. Listen dude our people the people who listen to this show and the people who patronize our companies these people understand what it means to Set an example They understand what it means to do things right they make an effort to be better every single day and that's The most important thing that we could have in culture right now You know, when we talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion It really does come from us living a certain standard which has to do with how we do everything because we all know How we do the little things is also how we do the big things and the little things compound into the big result that we call our life And if we cut corners and we don't do things right or we pass things that we know we should do and we don't do them That it roads our discipline over time and when our discipline gets eroded over time it affects all areas of our life So when you look at something This is just a little tip that I share Quite often in RIT syndicate and when I talk about entrepreneurship But when you look at things that you know need to be done and you see them like let's say you're walking across the parking lot And you see a shopping cart and you just go and get in your car and drive off Even though you know it's wrong and that shopping cart should not be out in the parking lot Even though you're not the one to put it out there But you passed by it Because it wasn't your responsibility You have to understand what you just did was you took units away from your discipline skill set No different than madden football or a video game where they have ratings Okay, so you saw something that needed to be addressed and you walked by it and didn't address it at all And that means that you're rating went down a couple notches And so when we start looking at skill sets as something that are perishable and go down when we Ignore them and go up when we invest in them Now we understand how the game really works because we're all Sharp in different areas week in other areas And if we want to be sharp in all areas we have to look at these things as perishable skill sets that we make investments too And if you were to take that shopping cart and put it back in its place even though it's not your responsibility Then you are making an investment into your discipline skill set And so this is this is the way that it actually works and we talk a lot about this in the 75 hard also in my book But the reality is is that Most people just think that these things like discipline or grit or fortitude or perseverance are just things that people have naturally And they're not they make small little investments on a daily basis that compound over time to make the entire skill set And that entire skill set is very valuable in the big picture of life So you know when you see people like going into the grocery store and straightening our cans out They unders what they're doing that's not just like oh, I'm a fanatical first form fan They understand what I'm talking about here. They understand hey, I do love this company But also I'm gonna take a minute to represent it the right way and they do it on their own and it's fucking cool But that comes from people understanding Most of these people are familiar with 75 hard and they're familiar with live hard And they're not one of these people on the internet that thinks it's a weight loss challenge or some fitness challenge It's a fucking mental recalibration program and the people that understand it understand What we're talking about and they do things like that and they you know when when appropriate So I do think it's amazing and I appreciate all you guys that do it and uh Yeah, I think people are going to be surprised what we do Um with first form from here on out I think a lot of I think a lot of people well they have no fucking idea I just keep it at that. Yeah, I'll fucking love it man. Yeah, I love it Uh guys CTI yeah, you want to do when I want to do some cruising. Yeah, I do. I like to cruise Maybe my my Well shotgun. I'll take shotgun. Yeah. Yeah, where we going to eat though That's all I'm worried about bro. I mean, it's gonna be somewhere fucking great That's a fact. That's a fact. We go two of us ain't fucking at it. We go fine. We go fine. We go fine. We go star Guys, let's get into this cruise remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos Go to any facility. I come you guys can find them link there. We uh, we like to I want to remind people We do this for a reason so that way you guys don't think we're just putting bullshit up it right like that's the way for you guys To go do your own research and look at your own stuff and let those sink in Right, I think it's always good to share where you get information. Where's your what your sources? You know those the internet loves to say source right science Where where where can I see this? What's your source on this? Yeah, and we use everybody here. It's fine We know discrimination. Yeah, we we do sources. That's right Guys, let's get into a headline number one. Let's talk about it man chiefs three-peak winners win She's one. Yeah, what do we say on Friday? I know we talked about it I think I said she's the win. I think I said My home's is a winner. He's hard to beat. Yeah, but then you also said, but I'm not gonna like Uh, put put the I'm pretty sure if we go back and listen to show I told you guys that it was gonna be an overtime win And my homes was gonna throw touchdown pass and This was happening exactly like I said. I'm pretty sure that's what I said Is that not what I said? Yeah, I can confirm this. Yeah, that's what I said. All right. See see Home here right there But yeah, so listen to it. Listen, it was a hell of a game Yeah, doing like so like I went to a watch party and like a lot of people were getting it But like the other member by the way, just for those of you that didn't catch the other I didn't say that That was Joe I was laying it on pretty thick. I don't know if you caught it But uh not do like I thought it was a very very impressive defensive game on both sides Yeah, like a low-score game that means your defense is doing the job Yeah, and they don't score you don't win Maybe don't really really good. I thought it was a good game overall Um, but yeah, so but uh Yeah, so three times the champions Um, my home is hard to beat bro. He's an athlete. He's a fucking winner. It's not just that he's an athlete He's a winner like bro. There's lots of athletes. There's lots of people with the raw talent To win mm-hmm There's not a lot of people that just win when the fucking pressure is on and they figure out a win That is a that is a gift That is very very rare You know most people when the pressure gets like that they can't crumple them as well That the true champions the guys that Tim Grover calls cleaners These people get better in a little circumstances. Yeah, so it was it was pretty cool to watch. Yeah But I mean that obviously there's gonna be controversy with all of this stuff is there's always some controversy. Did you see the um Did you see uh Coach Reed and Travis Kelsey give me a little yeah a little shovel yeah, I do what they want to call it Yeah, so there there's some it's been unearthed a little bit So uh this says how the truth could come out about Travis Kelsey and he read Super Bowl blowup tells the world So Travis Kelsey knows there's a way where the true exchange between a star tight end and chiefs head coach Andy Reed From Super Bowl 2024 services even if they keep cracking jokes about the dust up and pretend as if it was no big deal but Kelsey I will let any possible clips from his microphone dictate whether or not that scenario materializes quote you guys saw that Kelsey at uh Kelsey said according to the associated press quote I'm going to keep it between us unless my mic up tells the world. I was just telling him how much I loved him. So this is the clip. Let's watch the clip Uh Here's the fumble his clip Comes over to Andy goes keep me in what happened is On the fumble he was not in the game. No, a gray went in and he had to block It's probably said I love you He didn't say I love it. No, he didn't he didn't but uh so they did reach out to coach Reed uh they were able to get an answer from him So he uh this is coach Reed's response. He says quote uh he caught me off balance. Reed told reporters according to ESP uh ESPN Quote I wasn't watching he was really coming over and saying just put me in I'll score I'll score So that's really what it was um I love that it's not the first time I appreciate him the part I love is he loves to play the game And he wants to help the team win. It's not a selfish thing. It's not what it is. I understand that And he says quote as much as he bumps into me I get after him and we understand that he just caught me off balance Uh, so after the exchange Kelsey hug Reed and the coach patted him on the back according to the athletic um Yeah, I mean it happens Listen dude. I think people making a big deal out of this are fucking pussies. That's what I think You've never played at a high level you have zero fucking intensity you don't understand Anything about what it's like to compete at a high level these guys are these guys have worked their entire life since they were little bitty Fucking kids to get to this game. All right, and by the way, I'm not the biggest fan of this dude. Let's be real I don't like that he took the Pfizer deal. I think he's I don't like his girlfriend Listen There's a lot of things about him like I just call how it is. Yeah, he's a great fucking player, bro And honestly, I like his swag. He's going to yeah, they're I just don't like that Pfizer bullshit Dude, people are getting sick people are fucking actually getting harmed from this and I don't think that's cool And so that's where my gripe is but as a player he's fucking dominant that's the facts and Dude, the fact that he has that intensity and all these people don't understand it is why he's there and you're not That's what people don't understand. So here's where the problem is he shouldn't have bumped into a guy the guy is old right and The center of gravity. Yeah, listen. It could have been handled differently I can appreciate the intensity, but I think most people that are criticizing him like I seen these videos are like Taylor Swift needs to run because he's a fucking psycho He's in the middle of the Super Bowl And he's pissed off because he wants to fucking win. Yeah, like And they just fumbled like To me amongst winners. This is normal. If you don't have that I need want to play with you And I don't even want you on my fucking team if you're not that fucking passionate about winning. Yeah, that's the truth Okay, so did he fuck up a little bit by bumping into it? Yeah, I think he went a little too aggressive, but at the end of the day This is the intensity of high level competition that we're seeing and most people just ain't ever fucking seen it before So there you know people Make it this into this huge deal And it's because they never competed they never played anything never done anything at high level They fucking are normal people who look at this and say look at it and they want to talk some shit And then he comes out in the second half and fucking Rex listen The guys are fucking the guy is a fucking winner. Yeah, he's as much of a winner as as as uh my home There's things I don't like about like and it's not that he swaggy, bro. I can appreciate that I think Conor McGregor's the coolest fucking guy on the planet with his swag. I like swag But what I don't like is when you take a deal where there's tons of evidence where people are getting sick and hurt For a check that to me. That's not cool. We'll go for yeah, whatever dude and anyway But the point of the matter is and here's what I will say Andy Reed Fucking protect it him with his comments Covered like dude that could have been way worse if Andy Reed said yeah, man I got out of hand to blah blah blah, but see that's elite level leadership discipline that you're witnessing here What you're seeing is a man who understands that this dude overreacted a little bit in the heat of the battle and I'm not going as a coach. I'm not going to destroy the team chemistry or create a rift in this amazing thing that we have going on Which is the Kansas City Chiefs by letting him fry on national television And so I respect Andy Reed for protecting him the way that he did and honestly the truth is These dudes go to battle together every single day. These are like brothers and yeah, Andy Reed might be older and Travis Kelsey might be younger But like I could promise you if they were the same age they beat the fuck out of each other and then hug afterwards Like this is what it's like, you know, so To me, I thought it was blow blown out of proportion You know, I think Andy Reed handled it as a true fucking Real elite level leader, which is apparent because he wins everywhere he goes So I and as much as I you know don't like everything that Kelsey does I thought this was way blown out of proportion. Yeah, for sure. For sure Other weird things that popped up. Did you see the kind so I not know his commercials always a big deal Bro, you know what I'm saying though most people live in a fucking bubble. No, it's armchair quite a bit This you guys live in like bro people live in this bubble where they think there's no competition and intensities bad And this is why you fucking lose You fucking lose because you don't understand what's going through that man's fucking mind right now Maybe you had a little bit more of that your life would look different That's the truth and I'm not some fucking Kelsey fan But that's the truth that's compare I like it as a competitor. I'm like fuck yeah bro. That's badass Did he bump them and shit? Yeah, he shouldn't done that. They're smoking a little like don't do that Yeah, could have broke seriously could have fell down and hurt himself. Okay, but at the end of the day Winners fucking get intense they want a fucking win. Yeah Yeah, now the other thing in the Super Bowl are the commercials and stuff Um, that's usually always a big deal a lot of the commercials were kind of trash if you ask me But did you see the Kanye West commercial? Yeah, so so apparently Kanye West You said I mean it's Kanye West divides fans after blowing seven million dollars on a Super Bowl advertising spot to share a bizarre homemade video Filmed in the backseat of his car So this guy just bought his own Super Bowl ad. Yeah and put a video in it and the recorded it from from his phone from his backseat of his car I didn't see this. Let's watch this clip. I got I got it. I got it here 29 seconds here we go On the commercial spot We actually On the actual commercial But the idea is I want you to go to easy.com Y-E-E-Z-Y-DOT Com and I'm already at the bottom of the screen and I got some shoes and That's it Seven million fucking dollars. Hold on that's fucking genius. Yeah, it's fucking awesome. So first of all do listen I don't care when anybody says about Kanye West that motherfucker is smart as fuck you smart man dude. He takes he takes his brand Spend seven million dollars and he understands that Everybody else is making these polished commercials and all and he's like fucking. I'll just shoot it right here Like that's genius shit. You know you know the size of balls that takes to do and I bet it worked too. Yeah Yeah, I hear it's here working. Yeah, that's fucking I think he made 18 million or something on his website Really just for that from that that's crazy not only that that's not what I mean that's that's his first hit How many of those people are gonna buy other shit how many of those people are gonna become residual customers on his business right so Clearly so we spent all the money I don't look but we didn't spend no money on making it So I love it man. I love it's great last little piece of bullshit. I want to bring up here before we get to our next deadline That's been causing quite a bit of ruckus is this this whole thing with the black national anthem man And I want to say this first like we have one We don't need another one. We don't need three of them. We don't need four We have one national anthem that we all should stand for and we all should participate in Um, and it's beginning some heat for them doing doing the black one so here's a here's a headline every it's Democrat congressman Sends absurd tweet about super bowl crowd not standing for lift every voice in sync Um, and here so here's this sweet first so it's um This is the guy. It's Steve Steve Cohen. This is him here. Okay. He's a representative out of Our audio just so you know, this is a white dude. Yeah, white dude. What is that?

He's the uh, he's a representative from Memphis, Tennessee He tweeted this out because apparently nobody stood for it Oh man Shocking you know why? Cause no one cares Fuck no one cares bro. No people people are tired of being divided people are tired of the shit The irony the people who are upset that nobody stood for this one are the same people who were like well We don't have to stand for the American man national anthem You know when fucking cappernick was doing all the vish and fuck all these it's dumb shit But let's look at his tweet and I want to see I'm gonna to tell me if there's anything that stands out To you okay here is this tweet from representative Steve Cohen The Negro and the actual anthem holy shit this motherfucker's tweet here's what it says How How does this guy get away with saying shit like this? Oh, it gives worse It's good. It gives this tweet Just so you know, I'm not just saying Very very go. Yeah, it's quote Very very few stood at the Super Bowl for lift every voice and sing the Negro national anthem Not a pretty picture of Super Bowl crowd and you wonder who the fucking races are Words it gets worse. It's worse No, no, no you hit boy you come on down and you you stand for that zone Jesus man, I'm gonna fuck about KFC guys looks like a fucking he looks like a like he looks like a guy Mm-hmm that they hired To play the part of a racist Democrat politician. Yeah, like he looked like he's too perfect this motherfucker He doesn't this is a character man. There's no way look at his haircut Look at that There's no way this is a real dude. That's real man. Steve Cohen Mm-hmm Can we say that is that is that is that like a thing like do don't black people they don't like that what being called Negroes right well, I mean it depends on what's it like just black people depends on the Negro you ask I mean some Negroes have problems with it No, I'll be serious man like that's not a that's not a modern term that you would use listen But like but that's the thing. It's like you know some some of it's coming back It's like oh, why can't we just don't even know no bro. Why can't we just call my fuckers Americans? Yeah Why can't we just be fucking regular people? Why can't we just not all Americans and then it's like the dude happens to be black Or say yeah, it's a black dude. Yeah, it's a white dude. Mm-hmm like Because all Americans don't steal Oh, that's why Bro you ain't ever looked in a trailer park You don't fucking understand It's American on American crime guys stealing is stealing is not a Oh a pigmented skin issue you never spent any time around the fucking The trailer parks and shit. Yeah, everything gets stolen. You think you you think your bike got stolen fast when you were a kid And they get stolen pretty quick though. It was fucking It was pretty pretty fun quick Uh, but last time because I don't want to bother you. Oh you guys forget how did you guys forget dark Brandon man What do you got anything on this fucking weird tweet bro? Just like we drew it up coming from the official Joe Biden account. I mean look dude. Here's the deal Everybody's freaking out about this. They're like oh shit dude NFL scripted. It's all fucking fake and they're rubbing it in our faces Uh, like and normally like I would put my tin foil hat on and I'd be like fuck holy shit Are they really might be like broke? This is a fucking joke. Yeah, this is a joke That they ran that did not land because bro the guy's so fucking senile and he's so Unable to connect with people or anybody That people don't know if it's serious or not and they what they're doing is they're trolling all these people Who said you know the Taylor Swift's a fucking CIA operative and what's true hold on I'm gonna get to this So In all fairness I read it as a troll. I read it as they were trolling like some smart ass You know leftist Staffer So I and said this would be funny as fuck and like broke if this is a troll It is kind of funny because everybody fucking freaked out about it, but the problem is We really don't know if it's a troll because of how fucked up all the shit they're doing So is this them actually trolling or is this them pretending to troll To basically show the world like To cover for the fact of what they're actually you don't understand Like like like when you say like just the stealing thing right say bro You're always fucking stealing. Yeah, you know me dude. I'm always stealing. I'm always out here stealing You see what I'm saying like it could be one of those things. Yeah, like it could be a cover for for like You know, maybe they are really doing shit. I don't know. Oh, man. I don't know man But like the the point I read it initially as a troll and the way people reacted to it It did make me kind of laugh. Yeah, so I got a laugh at both sides with this but But but dude, I mean I really do believe this guy's dismantling the country intentionally and I think they're trying to put this joke out there to sort of like cover up These it out. Yeah, I don't know. What'd you think of it? Yeah, I mean, I don't know I It was bad. It's not gonna help him. Here's the bottom line that did not help him. Yeah, and I would anyway shape or form Yeah, because dude this what this did just now is you just rubbed in the face of every single person that disagrees with you that All of this shit you're doing is unintentional intention. Yeah, you rubbed it in their fucking face. They already is not it's litified that belief bro Yeah, so you instead of unifying the country is just more division And it's that's what the black national anthem's about to it's about dividing dividing dividing dividing and this is not funny especially considering the state of the country and In my opinion this is gonna hurt him because this just makes people hate the people who didn't like him now they fucking hate him Okay, and You know you got people impressions that thing has that time recording. It's a hundred and fifty five million Yeah, what do people say about it? That's almost half the country. Well hold on What are people saying about oh there he's getting destroyed in the comments? Do do people think it's funny And they think it's a troll or people pissed them. Yeah So I mean dude, it's a bad move because bro You've driven the country into the dirt and people are pissed off and they're sick of it And they're frustrated and they're angry and they think you're a fucking trader which I personally believe as well And so now you're rubbing it in people's face now. I do believe it was meant to be a troll But dude even if it was a troll you're still rubbing it in the face like Ha ha yeah, we know that's some 22-year-old staffer and Yeah, I mean probably a fire But it's not funny dude. No, it's not fucking funny and this could be the other thing too You know people talk about these people worshipping Satan and shit, which I believe they do Oh, there was a lot of that shit and like dude one of the rules about being a Satanist when you do shit Is you have to tell people what the fuck you're doing so that removes the accountability for you to be How responsible for actually harming that I told you it's considered that they harm themselves So if they warned you and say hey, I'm the fuck I'm just like we drew it up and you walk right into it. That's on you not on them. And that's how they Released themselves from accountability for actually For his own accountability. Yeah, 100% so like dude, you know There's a lot of theories about this and it doesn't help the country like if you want an example of Why this man is terrible for the United States of America. This is it right here For a total tone deaf shit, bro. Yeah, man guys tell us what you guys think. Well, I mean, I don't believe the NFL is scripted Like everybody keeps saying all you know, so you think it is. I mean, I think I have a fuck today script NFL Bro easy. Yeah, how many players it like got hurt yesterday from like fucking nothing Very valuable key players that get out for nothing Fucking the 49ers are dominating the entire fucking three quarters of the game and runtime and all so you think this is just like WWE I mean listen I haven't seen a lot of proof that says it isn't Yeah, I would have to see a lot more proof to believe anything like to believe that it is. Yeah I'm it listen. I think people are getting a little too out there. Yeah, we think so. Yeah, that's my opinion I haven't studied it in depth Maybe there's a crazy 10 hour documentary that we could watch that's on bit shoot that's nowhere else on the internet That explains the entire thing. That's absolutely the truth. Yeah Like other ones. Yeah, exactly, but what I'm saying is Is that first. Yeah, yeah, I'll find out. I have to see it This is I don't know man. I don't know. I just know there's anytime there's money. There's gonna be corruption. So Yeah, it's all I'm saying. Yeah guys tell us what you guys. Yeah, I like know. What do you guys think? How crazy are we? today Let us go down to the comments guys Speaking of comments, let's go cruise to him. We got cruise the comments Got two of them for you today. Oh cool. All right. This first one comes from at New York Jordan 90 underscore 1p Says bro more Andy is always a positive any platform any content hashtag frysella. Oh, I appreciate brother. Yeah, 2028 Cool and then this the second comment And this guy's this in reference Andy had put out it was it we do an official poll It was kind of just let me know what you guys think about more content. Oh, I told the guys that I might go back to post on Instagram because you know, I feel like I feel like the entrepreneurship space has gotten so diluted with so many fucking people that are just full of shit that I have an obligation in my opinion to show people What's real stuff? Yeah, you know, so that was the that was the discussion we were having. Yeah And then the second one is from at Jason Roche 1883 Says great show is always fire definitely start posting on IG again stories are okay But as a follower there's no good way to share your story post make it post make that much easier. All right You get a lot of love out here. Yeah, I hear you guys noted. Yeah, no man I don't like doing all that when I used to post dude I would I would get thousands of comments and so I would have to be in the comments talking to people and it would take me hours of my day and If I do come back and post there's I'm gonna do something different like I don't know what I'm gonna do But I do feel the need to start sharing some stuff Because I feel like so many people out here are Painting the wrong picture of success and what it's like to build something real and entrepreneurship And I feel like this examples become so watered down that a lot of these younger entrepreneurs or aspiring entrepreneurs Don't really know what it actually looks like right? Yeah, and if they don't know what it looks like How do they believe that it's possible? And so I do have an obligation to share more of that with people You know what I mean? And I got to remember what it's like For the 18-year-old 19-year-old 20-year-old Andy to see success and so you know, I am gonna start sharing again. I think Um, I'm not sure exactly how I'm gonna do it But I do think people need to see it and you know if you don't like it then fucking look away You know if you don't like fucking win and look the other way because I fucking win at everything I fucking do That's the truth, you know, and I don't do it easily. It's not easy for me. It's nothing's easy for me It's hard as fuck, but that's how I know you can do it too because it's so hard for me I know you can do it like one of the things that you got to understand about people that you inspired by Is that if you got close to them and you understood how regular they are Actually were you'd realize house Abtainable it is for you as well, you know, and they fart just like anybody else. Bro, it's listen bro Everything's been hard for me nothing's been easy for me. It's not I've never won easily. I've never I've I've very mediocre at everything that I do and I have to work really hard and do a lot of things To stay competitive and to be good at what I do and you know like just living on the live-hard program a lot of people will say things like What are you trying to be like David Goggins? No motherfucker. I'm trying to be good at what I do Which is the same reason I tell you to do it so you could be good at what you do and so You know, I think people seeing Success from someone who is just a regular person who's just fucking ground and ground and ground their way through life I think that gives hope to people that understand they don't really have anything special about them as well You know what I mean? It's real shit, man I don't know I feel like we need more examples and I feel like I'm a good example in that regard and I do need I have an obligation to start sharing a little bit more Yeah, it's real shit, man guys. We appreciate you guys for commenting down there Appreciate you guys for me in real-ass fans Let's keep this cruise cruise it we got head on up a tube head on up two reads Trump arrives in federal court in Florida for closed hearing in his classified documents case Yeah, got a little fuckery going on. So let's let's dive into this. So this is an AP news article reading uh former president Donald Trump arrived Monday morning at a federal court house in Florida for a closed hearing in his criminal case Charging him with mishandling classified documents Hearing was scheduled to discuss the procedures for the handling of classified evidence in the case Which is currently set for trial on May 20th Trump faces dozens of felony counts accusing him of hoarding highly classified records That his Mar-Lago estate and obstructing FBI efforts to get them back US district judge Eileen cannon expects to hear arguments in the morning from defense lawyers and in the afternoon from prosecutors each outside Of the others presence Quote defense counsel shall be prepared to discuss their defense theories of the case in detail and how any classified information Might be relevant or helpful to the defense can have wrote and scheduling the hearing Trump's motorcade arrived at the court house in four peers shortly after 9 a.m The hearing is one of several voluntary court appearances that Trump has made in recent weeks He was present for instance at a pills court arguments last month in Washington as he looks to demonstrate to supporters that he intends to fight the four criminal prosecutions he faces while also seeking to reclaim the White House this November Now here's the thing It's cool when they do it. It's a problem when I do it So yeah, so Biden has the same thing going on and then I charge in him So let's dive into this a special counsel Robert her Said he will not recommend charges against president Joe Biden for his handling of classified documents while out of office Despite finding evidence that bifoli quote-unquote Willfully retained materials Capping a year-long investigation that loomed over the 2024 presidential election And he drew a bright line with this case against former president Donald Trump who faces a criminal indictment for his handling Of classified documents after he left office saying that Trump refused to return his documents and quote obstructed justice Trump has pleaded not guilty And nonetheless throughout the 388 page report her painted a dim picture of the president One that is political opponents immediately seized on as an elderly man with memory issues Who could not remember when he finished his term as vice president or when his son bow died quote We conclude that no criminal charges are warranted in this matter said hers report Quote we would conclude the same even if there was no policy against charging a sitting president This was despite the fact that the special counsel quote uncovered evidence that president Biden willfully retain and disclosed classified information After his vice presidency when he was a private citizen the report said Quote these materials included one marked classified documents about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan and two no books containing Mr Handwritten entries About issues of national security and foreign policy implicating sensitive intelligence sources and methods said the report Now the materials were found in the quote the garage offices and basement then and mr. Biden's woman ten dollar were home now Ultimately Her office Felt that the evidence does not establish mr. Biden's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt This was the statement that put everybody Very very on edge With this president quote We've also considered that at trial mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury as he did during our interview of him As a sympathetic Well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory reports that quote it would be difficult to convince a jury That they should convict him by then a former president well into his eighties of a serious felony that requires a mental state of Wolfeness So so how exactly are the two cases different it's very very simple guys Once Trump was Biden That's pretty much it Now a lot of people have been having some responses to this This article comes out I believe this is AP as well as his Biden faces his komi moment So this was Biden's response I got the clip here. This is his response To that report coming out in addition I know there's some attention paid to some language and report about my recollection of events There's even reference that I don't remember When my son died How on the hill dare he raised that Frankly when I was asked the question I thought to myself Wasn't any of their damn business every memorial day we hold a service remembering him attending my friends and family and the people loved him I don't need anyone I don't need anyone To remind me when he passed away Well clean it a little Clint Eastwood action there Um got comma saying she's ready to serve as president if needed Um, he even sent uh the White House even sent their own counsel to the DOJ's office to try to figure out why exactly that is but According to Rachel Maddo. It's okay because you know Biden still fit because he can ride a bike Andy where we got on all of this Well, they're saying they can't prosecute him because he's mentally unfit But then he's up there on the stage saying that he is perfectly mentally fit does it does that mean that Biden can be prosecuted? Does that mean that he's saying he's saying he can be prosecuted? That's what I'm saying right so which is it That's my take on it Okay, and it's also seems very strange and oddly coincidental That both of these situations are happening at the exact same time. It's almost like It's happening on purpose at the same time So that we can see how much corruption there actually is in our legal system and our government like a movie It does feel like a movie It does feel that way there's a lot of moments here And I'm not one of these people that buys into this that this entire parkour and shit script didn't know that's not how I don't believe that but it does feel that way when we have two exact cases that are exactly the same and One of them is being handled a completely different way than the other one and I think no matter who you vote for or who you believe That should be concerning to people and it's almost like that's happening at the exact same time to show people What the level of corruption really is and I do think most people see it so Um, my question is who's trying to show it well. I don't know. I do. I don't think I'm saying I don't I think it's a coincidence But you know a lot of people think differently and nobody really knows what's going on here But it is oddly coincidental To have these exact mirror cases happening at the exact same time and one is being held um One is being held up under one light and one a completely different light under two different sets of rules when lady justice is supposed to be blindfolded Well, no that also too, bro. Nobody's mentioning the fact that in president trump's case He was a president. He can declassify anything. Yeah Biden does not have the same privileges right because he wasn't president It was not right in to like you're nobody's even talking about that. Yeah You know, I mean, they're like listen. There's just a lot here and you know, and as that as this reports coming out and all these people jumping in back on it Also apparently just bumped his head on marine one While they're trying to debate his mental fitness You know, so it's just like Well Look man, how I read that whole thing. I mean, let's be real They put him out there to struggle in front of the whole entire country because they're done with him They put him out in front of the country. They wanted him to struggle. They knew he would struggle They knew it we would expose himself and what it's really exposed is that People are understanding that this man has not been in charge the entire time It's been a conglomerate of other people which I believe Barack Obama I mean Barack Obama talks about this. There's an interview floats around We could throw it in here right now people would ask me Knowing what you know now do you wish like you had a second third term um And I used to say You know what if if I could make an arrangement where um, I had a I had a Standing a frontman or front woman and they had a near-peace in and I was just in my basement and my sweats looking through the Stuff and then I could sort of deliver the lines, but somebody else was Uh doing all the talking and ceremony. I'd be fine with that. Okay. There it is um Where he talks about he didn't want to serve a third term of president But he would like to be the guy in the background with the earpiece in right? Yeah, he couldn't legally serve Yeah, and that's that's what's happening here. I don't think anybody doubts that that's what's happening here and so we have a bunch of people who have Captured the White House and installed some guy who is totally unfit for office, but the perfect fall guy for The destruction of America in many different ways because when you destroy America If this man was up there and he looked like Gavin Newsom and he spoke like Gavin Newsom People would not give him the benefit of the doubt. They wouldn't say hey, this guy's just senile. He's old He's well-meaning. He's an elderly guy and That's what's giving him the pass for the disruption the damage that he's creating people on the left who are not In on it so to speak. They're not that far progressive communist type person They're just Democrats or left-leaning people that want to you know have a life and be left alone Those people are now seeing that it's very clear that this man is not running things all right So we have to ask why is that why are why are they showing that and it's because they want to get rid of them And they want people to Give him the pass right like dude if do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah, like if we took a fuck this multiple If we talk a mentally competent person and they destroyed and dismantled America the way the Biden has People would call for his head on a fucking stake But because he's old and he's senile people give him a pass And so the people who are on the left who are Democrats That are not like in on the play those people are not Freaking out because they're like man. He's just old. I agree what he's doing is messed up I mean, I can't tell you how many times I've had this conversation with people on the left They're like dude. He's a piece of shit. We get it But Trump's not any better like that's where they always go is to Trump. They can't criticize They can't take accountability for the state of the country without bringing it back to Trump Which is unfortunate, but the truth of the matter is is like dude This guy is the perfect fall guy. Yeah, okay, and they've destroyed a lot of what needed to be destroyed And they don't need him anymore because they got us on the path of Demoralization and destabilization were two of the communist priorities. So That's what I think I think he's the perfect fall guy. I think they put him in I think there's a lot of people behind this behind the scene pulling the strings I mean KJP fucking runs his Twitter. She tweeted a tweet from her twitter It was supposed to be on his twitter and vice versa a few different times. Yeah. Yeah, so like You know like these people have decided that they are the moral authority that they know the way And they don't give a fuck if the average American disagrees. They don't care if the people who Uh, are you know out here in the real world suffer? They want their way and they're gonna get their way and that's what we're dealing with and now they're done with this guy Because he's damaged the country and the way that he needed to damage it and now they're looking to bring in someone else And they're probably gonna bring in someone else Like Who's going to destroy the country worse that you know can be Protected in another way like for example if Kamala would become president because Joe Gets removed you won't be able to criticize or otherwise your racist otherwise your misogynist otherwise your sexist otherwise You're this you're that you're this so there's other ways to protect her That they're are not what you abide it. You see what I'm saying. Yeah, so But but really dude, I don't think culture gives a fuck about that stuff anymore I think people are over this shit. I think they understand what's going on You know when people have a hard time eating and a hard time paying their bills and you people come out and say Massage and eating and racist and bigotry people like fuck you man Like they only care about that shit when things are good and they can eat and they're not starving now people are like Bro, we're not falling for that shit anymore So it's gonna be interesting to see how this shakes out But I think they're done with them and I think they put them out there on purpose to look like the way he looked And to show his mental instability. Can we get a prediction? I mean, I mean obviously You know this being the election you know, I mean how how soon I feel like if they're getting rid of them they have to be soon, bro You know, I'm saying like yeah, it has to be soon. They're like they can't wait until like the very long. I mean look dude When did all the chaos happen in 2020 March it happened in March I think we're approaching the time where the chaos is about to be cranked up Yeah, and I think it's gonna be along the similar timeline I would be very surprised if we don't have some major disturbances happen in the next 60 days You know remember dude when covid came along we were all just doing our thing bro We were all just doing our thing we were working the next day world will shut down Like like we all think it can't happen again. We all think they won't do it again They will do it again and the reason they'll do it again is because everybody complied the first time without hesitation You know how many people wore masks like I was very vocal about this and so were you we were talking about How if you wore a mask and you didn't believe in it you were actually contributing to the major problem of showing That everybody was on board with it And bro most people that wore the mask they didn't believe in it All right, and so what that did was that created a perception that everybody was on board which emboldened the tyrants All right, so that compliance was very damaging over the long haul because it made people believe that the numbers were with that when the numbers were not with that And so whatever happens this next time whatever they decide to do it's going to be very important That if people don't agree with it that they don't comply with it Otherwise, we're gonna end up in a similar situation and they're gonna disrupt the world You know, they tried to bring back the pandemic narrative back in September and everybody said fuck you and what happened in the narrative It went away Okay, so we the people have the power but it's going to come from peaceful non-compliance when they bring in whatever bullshit They're gonna bring in we have to all stick together and say no We're not fucking doing that and if they do that it'll be dead in the water and their plan won't work Yeah, they had to have they have to have fear yeah, that's right They're gonna bring fear bro They're gonna start gonna try to scare everybody and they're also gonna make you afraid to stand up against it because they're gonna shame you like they did last time You know, oh you're a grandma killer. You don't care about people I thought you cared about people you're a selfish fuck you want to keep your business open you want to keep your people employed Fuck you blah blah, you know like bro that's a tremendous amount of pressure But I didn't lay off one single person during COVID every sink there wasn't one single mother fucker that worked for my companies That took a single dollar less than would have normally taken I protected my people. I stood up for my people. I stood up to all you fucking fucks who came after me And I'm gonna do it again and the rest of you better be ready to do it this time too And if you went along with the mask last time When you didn't actually believe it was real You need to make that correction this time around whatever that is you need to find your backbone You stand the fuck up because the only thing that's actually gonna fix this is the mass majority of people saying no We're not fucking doing that and then not do it. Yeah, and then not doing it and that's what needs to happen That's real man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments Let us know what you guys think with that being said. Let's get to our third and final headline Headline number three. It's a quickie But I don't know how this got missed but this is a really really big deal. And I just wanted to get your insights on this this Hello, I'm reads Republican Senator J.D. Vance warns of hidden impeachment calls buried in 95 billion dollar Ukraine and Israel a package that he says could backfire on Donald Trump if he's elected Now we covered this the other day where the Senate passed this this this emergency funding Bill Single calls bill that they passed just last week But buried in there apparently something very very dangerous that jadey vance is uncovered and is now going to whistleballs Let's dive into this Uh, Senator jadey vance is warning that the Senate's 95 billion dollar foreign a package Can imparral a future Donald Trump presidency the massive bill if passed Which provide funding for Ukraine until 2025 effectively hand-cuffing the next president nine months into his term And if Trump wins the presidency and then tries to cut funding to Ukraine He could be impeached according to vance the highly debated deal would provide over 15 billion dollars for Ukraine's military And security financing that would not expire until september 30th 2025 Vance uh, who's out of Ohio is vehemently opposed to the bill Is making a last ditch attempt to get Republicans to vote no in a memo monday To all GOP lawmakers in the house and Senate Trump has been outspoken about ending the conflict within 24 hours. Should he take office So if he ends funding to Ukraine any earlier than that it would set him up for potential impeachment argues vance I represent the mat gait out of Florida also wrote on x Quote jadey is correct this bill as an impeachment trap Uh, the supplemental represents an attempt by the foreign policy blob deep state to stop president Trump For pursuing his desired policy and if he does so anyways to provide grounds to impeach him and undermine his administration vance wrote in a letter obtained by dailymail.com If the bill passes ensuring the funding uh for Ukraine until 2025 and Trump attempts to stop the funding before that date Partisan democrats would seize only opportunity to impeach him once again Um the ninety five billion dollar bill cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate on sunday And is expected to be passed later this week Um, it's fate is uncertain in the house as Republicans are divided on whether to send more money to Ukraine Um, and we all remember when Trump was impeached back in 2019 um over a very similar Uh hurdle Find print and bills. Yeah, and what do you what do you got on this man? I mean look, I think they're gonna do I think this is what I'm insane. I don't think they're gonna allow this guy to go back into office I think that people that want Trump to be the president They're gonna have to understand which by the way I'm one of those people. I don't like everything down Trump does But what we got going on is fucking ridiculous and it needs to stop and The and there needs to be accountability for a lot of things have happened That's the truth and I don't know the Trump will do that. That's one of my main main gripes with them um But the idea is that You know, they're trying to create a situation where this guy can't get in and he I don't like people think they're just gonna vote This guy back in I don't think that's gonna be allowed. I don't think I think they're gonna pull every single thing That they can to keep him out And they feel justified in doing so because they think that this guy is the fucking devil And they they've convinced the population that doesn't like him of the same fact that this guy is the devil and that any means necessary Are allowed to keep him out and that's not okay. That's not what this country was founded upon That's not what this country is about. That's not what we're supposed to have here And I believe that if people want this man to be president Like I said on the last show there's gonna come a time where there's gonna be a line drawn in the sand and people are gonna have to ask themselves What kind of bullshit are they willing to tolerate because I don't think they're gonna allow him to win an election I think they're gonna cheat blatantly in our faces I think we're gonna see a situation where the mask of communism completely comes off and they say Yeah, it is what it is. What are you gonna do about it and people are gonna have to ask themselves? What are they gonna do? You know what I'm saying? What is it? What do you think it means when they start like because to me This is almost like foreshadowing bro. Yeah, you're putting in safe guards because like bro if Trump runs this election That's gonna probably be the one of the first things he fucking bro. These people are insane But does that show you like I mean are they showing the cards like are they really afraid that he's actually gonna win this? Like do they is that them showing that I don't know. I don't know. I think I think there's so many people Who have decided they're gonna vote for Donald Trump That They can't cover the gap with just cheating I don't think they're gonna be able to do it because I think he's the dude's gonna get a hundred fucking million votes or more You know what I mean? Yeah, and I actually think he got way more than what they claimed last time Um, but like you can't argue with real world evidence like people like to sit Like look dude. There's this thing Called asses and seats. Okay, like you can tell if someone has real influence by it Asses and seats. All right. I've been a I've been a speaker for a long time Which I'm fucking retired from now. You'll never see me do another fucking event again. I'm not doing that shit no more I'll do my own events, but that's it um But like in that world there's a phrase Asses and seats. Do you put asses and seats or are you full of shit? And Trump put at Trump puts asses and seats Trump puts people in the fucking crowd and um When you see you know leading up to the election like we saw in 2020 for 30 days a hundred thousand people show up to see this dude And this other guy can't even fill up a gym At a high school that's a very real indicator of the asses and seats effect and who is actually the people's champion You know Trump spoke this weekend and there were fucking tens of thousands of people that showed up You know you don't see that for anybody else. You don't see that for Joe Biden And that's not that's not fake that's real shit and so I think whenever You know when I think you'll do the same thing. I think he did those events leading up to 2020 to optically show people that he had the following he says he has and I think he's gonna do it again and I think what's gonna happen is they're gonna cheat and if they can't cover the gap and he actually gets in They're gonna pull out every single stop that they can to get this guy out And it's gonna cause all kinds of turmoil and really dude if Trump gets in he needs to clean house with these motherfuckers Because dude Americans are tired of living in turmoil We don't deserve to live the way that we're living We don't deserve to have our lives filled with so much division and so much hate and so much drama and so much anxiety Over this one fucking man because he's not part of their club So we have to we have to be prepared for what's about to happen and these people are criminals They're fucking cheats their liars. They're willing to I mean dude How the fuck does this guy get an 83 million dollar judgment against them when all the happen where her feelings got hurt Right right you know what I'm saying? Barry yeah, yeah, that's and it's insane and because if they do it to him they're gonna do it to anybody that stands up against them You know them giving Rudy Giuliani a fucking nine figure penalty for court Alex Jones gets a multi billion dollar punitive judgment These are these are fucking insane levels of Corruption happening these are examples yes these are examples being made so people are afraid to stand up And that's what Jay six was about that's what all this shit's about and so people are gonna have to get brave People are gonna have to get bold and they're gonna have to be willing to stand up and say we're not fucking doing this anymore with you Fuckers and that's what I hope happens. Yeah So guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think I was that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck This is we're gonna have a lineup we talk about it.
