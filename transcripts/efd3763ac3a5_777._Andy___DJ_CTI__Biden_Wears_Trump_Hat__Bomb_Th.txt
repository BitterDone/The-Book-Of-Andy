What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realest thing about the lives, the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcoming mother fucking reality guys today. We have Andy and DJ crews the mother fucking internet. That's what we're going to do. That's what CTI stands for. It stands for crews the internet. We put topics up on the screen. We talk about what's going on. We speculate. This is a speculative show. And then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on in the world. Now, if you're new to the show, which a lot of you are because the show is growing, we have shows within the show over the course of the week. Our main meat and potatoes is definitely the CTI. But we also have Q and A F now Q and A F is where you could submit questions and we give you the answers. You could submit your questions a couple different ways. The first way is you can email these questions into ask and you can go on YouTube and the Q and A F episodes and drop your question in the comments will choose some from there as well. Other times we will have a real talk format. That's sort of like what we have this past Monday. That's where I get on there and I just say some stuff for five to 20 minutes that I think is relevant and valuable to you. And then we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus where someone who's completed the 75 hard program comes on the show talks about how their life was before how it is now and how they use the 75 hard program to realign their existence on this planet. Now, if you're unfamiliar with 75 hard, it is the initial phase of the live hard program, which is available for free at episode 208. And if you've been living under a rock, this is the world's most popular in history, mental transformation program. And it is free episode 208 on the audio feed. Now, there is a book that has the entire live hard program top to bottom included in it. But it also has 10 chapters on mental toughness. Why it's important how to cultivate and how you use it in your life. Plus a whole bunch of case studies on some very famous people who've used mental toughness to improve their lives as well. I would highly recommend you doing the program and reading the book because quite honestly, it'll fix your shit. So you can get that book at AndyPersona.com. It's called the book on mental toughness. Now, there's something different about this show that other shows don't do, especially other shows that are this big. We are one of the biggest podcasts, the most downloaded podcast in the world. And we don't run ads. All right. And the reason we don't run ads is because this show is called real AF. It's not called say what I want AF because I pay you to advertise my shit that you probably don't even use in the first place. So I don't run ads and I make a trade with you. The trade is very simple. The show makes you think if it makes you laugh, if you get value, if you're listening to that episode right now, please do it's a solid and share the show. We are constantly dealing with censorship, traffic throttling, and all this other bullshit that they do now. So don't be a hoe. Just show. All right. Hey, what's up, dude? How you doing? Doing good? Yeah. What's up with you? Oh, you know, you know, putting, uh, putting together the drama of the day. The drama of the day. The drama of the day is that MF CEO project is coming back here real soon. Probably within the next two weeks or so. We're going to officially launch it. If you're interested in figuring out where you can listen to the MF CEO project, you need to go get on my email list and subscribe to the Andy Graham, which you can do at Andy for sell.com. So just subscribe to the Andy Graham and that'll get you notified when we drop MFC. I will not post it. I'm not going to make some big announcement on YouTube. It's going to be done through my email list and that community exclusively. So if you want to know, that's the only way to know. Sweet. Yeah. So what's the drama? There's a lot of it, man. There's a lot of it. I got some special for you guys here. A little bit later on in the show. But I want to ask you, man, because you know, you're a wealthy guy. You know, a lot of wealthy people. What is it with wealthy people just like spending ridiculous amounts of money to do crazy shit? Like, what is that? Well, it depends. Like what the fucking space? Well, I mean, look, dude, when you got, when you have like who's Bayzo's? No, so like this other guy, like this just happened today. Billionaire steps outside his SpaceX capsule and dangerous first ever private spacewalk as it's historic first words are revealed. A bajillion amount of what he say, holy shit. That's what I'd say. I mean, it's just, I mean, like, but like, like, do you have any asked for you? You could probably, you could go to space. How much was it? I mean, it had, I don't know. They didn't list their amount. I guarantee you it had to be at least a billion, bro. A billion at least. No. Yeah. No, it's probably like a million bucks. No. Yeah. Well, that was the case. Everybody be doing it. My dad looked this shit up. How much does it cost? Everybody would be doing it. If it's a million dollars, you go pay a million dollars for fucking vacation, bro. I mean, if I could, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would here's to answer your question. This is the answer. When you have that much money, you start finding shit to spend it on. That's the reality. You do shit just because you can do shit. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? And while I may be a pretty wealthy guy, I came from the dirt. So I value a dollar still. And so while I may spend money on things that other people think are stupid, like cars, my car portfolio goes up. So I don't lose any money there. How much, dude? So we need orbital leaf space. Yeah. Hundreds of millions to billions of dollars per mission. No, that's not what he paid deep space missions. That's what he paid. That's what musk paid suborbital flights. So that's below that that can cost 250 to 450 250 grand, right? Yeah. But that's suborbital. So orbital. Like this dude is orbital. Yeah. So double it up to 65 million per orbital per ticket. Yeah. Pertec per seat. 65 million per seat. That's a billion. I ain't a billion, but that's still a shit. Tell the fucking money. Yeah, it is. Like, you know, I guess it's mind-boggling. But I thought this was pretty crazy. So this guy, his name is Jared Isaacman. He's the first civilian to spacewalk. Now, we do some conspiracies and shit like that. You know, but we got some video clips here. And there are a couple of things that just like just don't make sense to me. But let's dive into this a little bit. So a crew of four aboard a SpaceX capsule embarked on the world's first private spacewalk on Thursday. It's two astronauts stepped out into the vacuum of space billionaire, Jared Isaacman, who's 41, exited first about 652 a.m. Eastern time with space six engineers Sarah Gill is who's 30 taking her turn just a few minutes later. So yeah, so he's Jeric Isaacman. He's a billionaire. He's 41 years old. His role is the mission commander. I guess you could just, you know, pay for that too when you get up there. I'm the mission commander. I'm the mission commander of real AF. Command is a mission. That's right. But he's the first ever non-professional to complete a spacewalk. So he's the CEO of the American processing payment processing company called Shift 4. He founded it in 1999 in his parents' basement when he was just 16 when it's a cyber security industry and did some stuff like that. It did very well for himself started with just like $10,000 from his grandfather to convince a bank to sell him credit card terminals. So here's the clip of them depressurizing the capsule. Okay, let's watch this clip. Yeah, break breaking new ground with those new suits, new operations for everything. We're at about 4.5. We're going to see that tick down. It's going to get down to just under one and it's not going to go all the way down. And then what we'll actually see is we've got a capability to open the hatch automatically. We've got a motor in it. But Jared's actually going to unlatch it and he's going to give it a little tug to kind of break the seal, break any of the kind of the stickion in the hatch itself. And that's going to kind of take the capsule down to its final vent before that's them depressurizing it. Now this is he didn't want to do the thing. He's about to get the next clip. Oh, now this clip is of him stepping out of the space capsule. And let's hear his words first civilian in space. There's a text back at home. We all have a lot of work to do but from here, that's sure it looks like a perfect world. All right, that's that. You can one of them stepping into that sound. Hold on. That sounds like the same crowd that cheered for India. Yeah. When they went to space. Does it not? It does. It did. But his words were that, you know, I know we got a lot of stuff to work on back home but from up here, the world looks perfect. I wonder how long he thought about that. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, but like here's my question. Okay. So we all are very familiar with the NASA space suits, right? They look like this. Yeah, but that's like 40 years ago. 60 years ago. That's true. But I don't think cowboy boots are doing it, bro. I don't know. That does not look. I would rather be wearing this shit if I am going to the deep into the pool. I don't believe any of these people. I think it's all bullshit. So like, what do you think they're going? You think they're actually like, what if they're going to the ice shelf, bro? I don't know. Listen, everybody's a liar. That's my fucking take. Yeah, everybody's lying about fucking everything. My fuckers were going to swim in pool or some shit. They're having some sort of duel against fucking NASA. So they threw a capsule in the pool and threw this dude in there and said, hey, we say some shit. Yeah, I'm not buying it. Yeah, I'm not buying it. No. Yeah, it's weird. I'm not buying it till I'm there and can see it myself. I don't believe anything, dude. I think everybody's just completely meant like it is. It's bullshit. I don't think I would want to go to space, even if we could. There's no like admiration to do it. Like, that's how I feel about skydiving. Oh, zero. Yeah, everybody's like, oh, it's cold skydiving. I'm like, bro, I get enough excitement like every single day. Like you, you must be a really like non eventful. Like, what do you do for those like three minutes? I'm just saying like, what do you? I don't know, man. Yeah, I'm alright with that. Dude, listen, my my life is so warped into building companies and doing things that have a result that like, I just don't do things to do them. You know, it's a bit more purpose. It's been a long time since I've done that. And so for none of this shit, like really, I don't know. Yeah, it's whatever, man. Yeah, all right. Good for him. Yeah, I like his business story. Yeah, business story. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. We got that. Now, I wanted to bring something else in here real quick. Because, like, dude, I have it to you to owe. And the gratitude and appreciation, I think, you know, you've been rubbing off on me, man. Oh, yeah. And, you know, I think everybody's familiar with Andy Domis. You work out today. No, I've been putting on the show. Well, I didn't rub off on you yet enough yet. Rub the other stuff. Yeah. Everybody's familiar with Andy Domis. And I got a little DJ Domis for you. Okay, little DJ Domis. I already know which one I know what it is. All right. I dig it. Yeah, little DJ Domis for you. I want you guys to watch this clip. This clip is from yesterday's show, actually. Let's just check this out. I'm just telling you, dude, like, because I don't know if they got the questions ahead of time, but it my first thought was she's got these, she's had these questions. I think that's going to, I honestly, I think that may even come out within the next couple of weeks. I could see that too. I think someone blows a whistle and says, hey, this is what actually, it was a some fucking, you know, you know, 52 gender fucking person working for ABC. Yeah, accidentally, yeah, sent the fucking question like, yeah, I can see that coming out. And I would not be surprised. Yeah. All right. That was a tag team, Domis, but I'll give it DJ Domis. Okay. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. That was, that was going well, so that clip comes out, yesterday we talked about that on yesterday's show. And then today, what comes out? This comes out. Holy shit, ABC whistleblower allegedly will release an affidavit claiming that Harris campaign was given sample questions that were essentially the same questions were given during the debate, as well as the circumstances that Trump would be fact checked and she would not. Man, it's almost like, it's, it's almost like we're in the matrix. And we're just saying what's going to happen. And then it happens tomorrow, my dick's going to grow two more. Let's see what that. Fuck man. And hey, I was wrong. I said we said weeks. We did say weeks. We didn't say one day. 48 hours, man. Ah, dude. I mean, come on. We knew this was coming. There's no way that she could be at that on point without some help. Fuck no. There's no fucking chance. No chance at all. Well, well, guys, let's get away for that to actually come out. I hope it comes out today. The actual affidavit. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, this is coming. Bro, you knew, listen, man. These people are cheaters, liars, thieves, criminals, tyrants. There is nothing, nothing beyond their consideration to maintain and keep power in this country. Nothing. They've tried to prosecute this man. They've tried to shoot this man allegedly. They've done everything they can. Every weapon they can. And it's going to get worse between now and then. What do you think they got planned for the next 30 days? Right. Right. There's too much at risk here. There's too much on the line for them, for them. And so like, I mean, up to, I mean, potentially death. I don't think there's any. I don't think at this point in time. I mean, dude, the momentum is so far away from these people. I don't see how they could even cheat it without people going fucking crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we got a little bit more on that too. Yeah. Coming up. So with that being said, guys, let's get into our headlines. Remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You guys can find them all linked there for you. With that being said, let's get to our first headline. This could have been a dumbass of the day. But I thought, let's put it in the headlines, let's talk about it because there's some other dots here. Headline number one reads, Biden poses with children and pro Trump attire an awkward photo op and swing state Pennsylvania. Now, I don't know if like, there's people on this team at this point that are just saying, fuck it. Like on Biden's team, on Biden's team. Did you watch the video? Do you have the video? I have a clip too. Let's watch the video before we comment on it. Okay. Yeah. Um, yeah. So he posed in the crowd of children that were all decked out in pro Donald Trump attire. Um, and there was an awkward photo op. Uh, here is the picture. All right. And you can see him. I mean, it's all like the, it's, it's all the, the notable Trump gear. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Um, he knows it too. Look at his face. I love Jesus. Jesus is my savior and Trump is my president. Yeah. Emily has that. I'll be back shirt. Yeah. She wears that. Yeah. You know, so there's this, this, this photo, right? Um, a couple of, one of the kids didn't even, I mean, he's not even fucking smiling. You know, it's, that's because Trump ain't back yet. Yeah. What it is. Um, but it's even deeper than that. You know, like, there was something weird about this entire interaction. So, so he brought beer and pizza. They're at a fire. He brought beer. They brought beer. Um, and pizza. I can go for some beer and pizza, man. Not a bad man. Sounds good. Let's fuck this show. All right. Yeah. I'll see you guys later. Fuck off. But he brought beer and pizza to this firehouse. Um, after a reflating ceremony at the memorial for United Airlines Flight 93. Um, this was all in commemoration of 9-11. Um, and during there, while he was there, uh, headline reads Biden jokes with Trump supporter that he does remember his own name at Pennsylvania Fire Station. You're an old fart. Did you see this? This is fucking hilarious, dude. Uh, so he was having a senior moment. President Biden joked that he could not remember his name moments before he donned a red Donald Trump hat during a 9-11 commemoration event Wednesday. Biden, 81 made the crack at his own expense when he agreed to sign a presidential seal hat for a Trump supporter at an event honoring first responders in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Uh, video footage shit on TikTok showed. Quote, do you remember your name? The Trump fan and older man and suspenders, I, I don't remember my name. The octagonarian commander in chief reply, the earning laughs from the crowd. Quote, I'm slow. He added. Here's the clip. You're an old fart. Yeah, I know, man. You're an old fart. I know you would know about that. I'll be an old fart. No, I know. All right, I'm a young farmer. You know, he's mind when the guys they grew up with, the Lord's one was they were with. Yeah, I need one. There you go, man. I need that hat. More monograph? I don't know. Come on. I ain't going that far. Yeah. Yeah. Bro, come on now. Listen, that's the most likable shit that guy's ever done in his whole life. I actually think this is super wholesome and funny. You could tell Biden's joking with the dude and they're joking back and forth. It's just two old men talking shit. Yeah. And I love that Biden treats them like another just old dude and they know they're both old. They're like fuck and they're making fun of each other. Like I do. I thought this was great. And I think if Biden would have done more shit like this, just been a little more friendly, he'd be in a completely different spot. Yeah. So you think he's like, like, this is a, like, I don't think this is anything towards. Yeah. I'm saying like this is not like a seen-out moment. You think he's just fucking around. Yeah. I think he's being a cool guy and like, that's the coolest I've ever seen him. Yeah. I mean, he's telling jokes. He's saying, yeah, man, I know I'm old. You know something about that, wouldn't you? You know, dude, to me, this was the best clip I've ever seen him by. And it had nothing to do with the Trump had. It's just his candor. Yeah. You know, he looks a lot happier, dude. He looks like he's like, let me know if you're vacation in every other week. Well, I'm just saying. I mean, he doesn't have the pressure of all this shit on him, you know, even though he's still the president. I think he's checked the fuck out. So I mean, look, man, I'm not a fan of Biden. I still think he's a traitor. I still think all the things I said, but I call it how I see it. That's the, that's the coolest clip I've seen of him. No, that's real. Yeah. No, that's real. So you got all of that going into your, to your statement, you know, he did drop out. He's out of the, the running as an incumbent president. But there are some interesting things happening right now that we should bring some attention and awareness to. We've said multiple times on the show guys, they're going to steal the election. There's, there is nothing you could tell me to convince me otherwise. They're going to do it. How? Well, they're doing it in a couple of different ways, right? Like, I mean, the polling, just trying to get people to think that it's not, you know, the numbers are not what they truly are. I think there's going to be definitely shit going on. The ballot boxes with mailing voting, these illegal migrants voting, there's plenty of ways that they're going to do it. And according to all of the polls, I think they're willing to cheat up to 70% of the fucking votes. I mean, that's what they're going to have to do if the polling will be seen in favor of Trump. Or if those are real, they're going to have to come up with at least 50% just to make it fucking close. But there's interesting. Well, they're, they're going to have to double their voter base with the cheat. That's what it's going to come down to. So if they get, you know, 40 million, they're going to have to get, they're going to cheat to 80. Yeah, that's what I, that's based upon like what I've observed. It seems like they, I think, they cover, I think they think they can cover that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Which I mean, and I think their whole play up until that point was to create a scenario where like I've said a number of times, the perception is close. Yeah. So that the, the, the NPCs that really aren't paying attention, we'll do the same thing they did in 2020 when they're like, Oh, you're an election denier. You're this, look, there's going to be no election denier claims this time. No one's going to give a fuck, bro. People aren't going to stand for it. Yeah. Well, it's interesting because like there are things that the administration is doing the cabal. They're already start, starting to set some things in action. I think it's very, very interesting. I found this little golden headline here. Let's check this out. This hell on reads Congress to get super ball level protection on January 6th, 2025. DHS designates the certification of the 2024 election, a national special security event to prevent a repeat of the Capitol riot. The federal government has for the first time declared that the certification of the presidential vote next year will be treated as a quote, national special security event, acknowledgement that the once routine part of the democratic process now carries special risks. The designation by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas places the J6 session of Congress on the same security footings as major events such as the Super Bowl or the United Nations General Assembly. It authorizes measures aimed at preventing a reprise of the riot at the Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election quote, national special security events are events of the highest national significance, Erick Ragnaghan, a special agent in charge of the Secret Services Dignitary Protective Division set in the statement Wednesday announcing the designation quote, the United States Secret Service in collaboration with our federal, state, and local partners are committed to developing and implementing a comprehensive and integrated security plan to ensure the safety and security of this event and its participants. The announcement underscores the tense environment with polls showing Trump and vice president Kamala Harris in a close race and a bitterly divided electorate. So what this does, the designation empowers the Secret Service who leads security planning and provide extensive resources to state and local authorities assisting with this implementation. It will mean unprecedented levels of security when Congress certifies the results of the presidential election, things like protesting, as general assembly of the people, all illegal can't do it because of that designation of that event. Now we're months out, months out from both the vote and months out definitely from the certification. Why would they be putting this stuff in place? Well, I mean, I think it's very obvious why they're putting it in place because they know there's going to be chaos regardless. It's the same reason that Pennsylvania came out and said, oh, well, we're not going to know the results of the election on election night. And that's normal for these younger voters because they haven't been able to do that and have passed couple elections. But dude, that's not standard operating procedure in the United States, dude. Like all my life growing up almost every single time we knew the winner right away. And the fact that, you know, I mean, all these things are playing into it, right? Like every poll that's done outside of the mainstream media shows that Kamala's getting crushed 70 to 30, 60 to fucking 40. I don't even see one at 40 yet. I'm just saying some massive. And then every poll that we see done through mainstream media is tight. You know, it's one point off. Right. And we know it's bullshit. We know they lie. And, you know, I think, I think it's very obvious why they're doing it. Yeah, because they wouldn't be worried about, you know, the people on the left writing and protesting and doing anything. Well, I don't know. They might be. I mean, those people are fucking the ones that burn down their fucking neighborhoods and shit. But I don't think those people, I don't think the majority of those people are voting for Kamala at this time. I don't see it happening, bro. Like when we see, when we, we don't see like the only people we continue to see supporting these people are either like boomer Democrats who aren't paying attention what's going on. Young Gen Z people who are confused on their gender and they're into this LGBTQ, IA, fucking plus 17 to the square root of eight, right. They're all into that shit. You know, and that's really the only people that we see supporting these people. So I don't know. I don't see, I don't see the left, I don't think they have the numbers to to do the riots and things. I mean, dude, don't you think it's weird that like all these people have done the riots in the last 10 years, starting with George Floyd, or I'm sorry, Michael Brown. These people are busted from all over like they're busted and paid, man. The how come when they make these arrests at these local, it's never people from the area where these people are. No, no, no. This is a Democrat army that they're financing to come in and disrupt shit. In fact, Justin Fergson has a quick statistic for you in Ferguson during the Mike Brown stuff. Per the report that was put in by Obama from the DOJ when they analyzed everything, 68% of those arrests during those protests were people from out of state. Yeah. Importantly not border states. Right. 68%. Yeah. You know, and so like, yeah, they're definitely being busted. Right. At hotel reservations, car rentals, they're being busted. No doubt. No doubt. I think, I don't know. This, to me, I just look at this as more proof that they're going to cheat and they're putting in the protections now to save their ass and protect their little cabal. It's not going to work. I don't think it's going to work. It's not going to work, dude. The country will become ungovernable. Like people will just not comply. It's not going to work. People will stop paying their taxes. They'll stop complying with any laws, anything. The country will go to chaos because dude, that's what happens when we have coos. Yeah. You know, this is exactly what they're doing up for. Yeah. 100% they already pulled one, bro. We're occupied right now. We technically they pulled two already. Listen, do you? They didn't win in 2020. I don't care when anybody says they fucking didn't. Okay. And now you have a big swath of Biden voters from 2020 that are voting for Trump now. So it's going to be even harder for them to cheat. And I think they're still gunna. And I think it'll be more obvious and I don't think people are going to accept it. No. Guys jumping on this conversation. I don't know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said, let's go check out some of these. Let's go cruise them. This first comment comes from at Rillo 7096. Let me know whenever you guys put out applications for a woodchipper equipment operator. Andy can pay me with first form drinks and his meat sticks. Deal. He didn't say his meat sticks. You liar. It says Andy can pay me with first form drinks and meat sticks. I mean, why you try to put words in my man's mouth here? You're trying to put something to do, mouth. Fucking weird. Are they not your meat sticks? He doesn't say my meat sticks. He said just meat sticks. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. They're the teams meat sticks. So he wants the teams meat sticks. Yeah. He wants to get tagged team by the meat sticks. Bro, would you open it up to like actual like you know operators? Who should have the job of pushing the bus? The family who is the victim? The victim's families. If they want to. If they want to. Yeah. If they choose to. If they don't choose to, I'd be happy to substitute in. I don't have any feelings in that regard. I'm with it. Yeah. I'm with it. If you did some fucked up shit, bro, you deserve what the fuck you get. It's coming. Now if it was animals, that's a different thing. Animal could bite the fuck out of me. I'm still going to feel bad about it. Yeah. I shouldn't have been there. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. This next comment comes from at paint 1016. They should let you guys be the debate moderators. That's a new one. You know, that's a that's a W suggestion. It would be hard. Come on. Shut the fuck up. Yeah. We all know you're lying. You're you've already told this lie. It's already been debunked. Now say something is truthful. Stop saying I'm gonna cut your fucking mic off, lady. Yeah. I'm talking. Yeah. I'll bro. I was fucking. Oh, we're black. I would have a hard time. I would have a hard time. I would just go up and stand next to him and let you be moderating. Try out my guy to tag team, bro. Yeah. Guys, we appreciate you for being real ass fans. Thank you for liking the commenting. Make sure you guys are subscribed and hit that bell notification on the YouTube to stay up to date with the latest episodes of real AF with that being said, let's keep this cruise cruise. We got to have before we get into the next headline. Can we just talk about how yesterday I said my favorite part of the debate was what? They're eating the dogs. And now it's the number one rap song on the fucking internet. I got you. Okay. Like, let's just say I started that shit. Well, in nonsense. Did you see my fucking dance movies? I did. So good shit right there. Yeah. I didn't get one fucking one of you motherfucker saying, oh, what goes? Look, it's all teen crackers and fucking no rhythm. I got more rhythm. All you motherfuckers. Yeah. No mayonnaise was present. That's right. Give me that. Bro, I got sauce and swag. Leavenerbs and spice. That's right. Extra extra fucking boiled. What? No. Guys, hell off number two. Let's dive into it. This is an interesting headline. We got to talk. It's still a talk of the town, man. I think it's just important. We expose. Keep exposing lies here. That's what we'd like to do on the show. Hell on number two. Reads. Bomb threat in city at heart of Trump immigrant rumors sparks evacuation. Now, this Julio Caesar chavez. I think the great great grandson of chavez. This guy's an idiot because you read this headline and this headline would make you think that this bomb threat is a direct cause of Trump. Okay. I mean, what Trump has been saying about the dog. Oh, shit. Excuse me. I'm sorry. That's screaming. I'm doggy. So let's dive into this. The government of Springfield, Ohio, said it evacuated at city hall on Thursday due to a bomb threat two days after Donald Trump repeated a false claim that put the city at the center of a national debate over immigration. Quote, due to a bomb threat that was issued to multiple facilities throughout Springfield today, city hall is closed today. The city government said on social media. But listen to this. Officials did not say whether the bomb threat was prompted by Trump's false claims. You're baiting, bro. You're guessing you're lying. That's a lie. It wasn't false claim. First of all, it's true claim. Okay. Secondly, what does that have to do with Trump pointing out? It's listening, man. It's another fucking lie. It is. And that's all it's been. You know why his pool numbers are going up because people are fucking done. They have finally seen after this last debate, how willing they are to like dude, the prosecution, the media bias, the Russia hoax, this, that the FBI raid, this, this, this, this, this, this, the, assess people have seen enough. They get it. They get that this is a dude who is an American citizen who is from the outside who is trying to run and make some changes and they're seeing the machine. The machine continues to expose itself and people are fucking seeing it, bro. And that's why his poll numbers are going up. It's, let me actually, this is like, but like we can see that. Most Americans can see that. That's explaining the poll numbers. So why don't the fuck do they keep doing it? Like that's the point. What are they going to do? You know what I'm saying? Pull on. What would they? Okay. So what would the alternative be? I will tell you what the alternative would be. It would be to do more shit like Joe Biden just did. Okay? Or like when they stood yesterday when they were at the 9-11 memorial and they actually let him participate in it where you had Biden, Kamala and Trump all standing there. They haven't allowed him to even be recognized as a president. He's an illegitimate criminal according to them, a tyrant according to them, a threat to democracy according to them. If he's that big of a threat, why the fuck you standing next to him at 9-11? Right. Okay? Now have these people, if they wanted to make a correct move, which I believe it's too late to make, they would act like civilized human beings and they would stop all this crazy rhetoric and all this shit. But I'm glad they're continuing to do it because all it's doing is waking people up to how bad this really is. And even the most, like bro, I got buddies and you do two who are and were heavy black lives matter supporters who I'm still friends with even though they were on that page back when that was happening. And bro, those motherfuckers are vowing for Trump. You know what they're telling me? They're saying, bro, this is insane. Like this is what they do. This is the way that they treat us. You know what I'm saying? Like everybody's awake to what's happening and the more they push, we said this a year ago, the more they push the more power he gets. And you know, it is what it is. Yeah. I'm glad they're doing it. Yeah, I'm not mad at it. It's just like for me, it's like, okay, like, like, is there something else here because you know, like 97 fucking indictments later. You know what I'm saying? Like the mugshot, like they keep doing all of this stuff. And every time they've done this, he's gotten like more popular. He's gotten more fucking support. And so it's like, they made a martyr out of him, dude. Right. But it's like, so like nobody looks at Trump anymore right now, DJ and says that guy's a fucking tyrant. Right. Nobody's looking at that. The message is just like, have like, you know what, they're saying they're saying, look at this poor man. He's, he's almost 80 years old. He's a multi billionaire. He flies around in his own, his own 757. He's got properties all over the world. This man gave up his life for the last eight years to be harassed by these fucking people for basically making the country a better place. And people are recognizing that and they're starting to see like, why would someone do that? Like why wouldn't and after this is all done if he does get elected, which he should, it's going to be 12 years of his life. You know, 12 years of his life that he worked his whole life to earn that could have been his that are now the peoples. So I think people respect that regardless of, you know, the way he tweets or whatever he gives a fuck how he tweets cares. Yeah. Guys, funny. That's crazy. But they, but they're, they're staying on this crazy shit. Nonetheless, they're staying on it. This is another article from USA Today. Immigrants eat pets trope is a century old stereotype and very old racism. Oh, it's racist. Good job, Karen. Yeah. And wine tribe. Wine tribe. Wine tribe. Interesting. Very interesting. Very interesting. Let's see how she starts this this art cloth. When Mary Lee Chai was in high school in the early 1980s, a Chinese restaurant finally opened in the small South Dakota town where the food was the cat started disappearing. Yeah. Yeah, the gerbos too for the stir fried gerbos. The food was delicious. Remember Chai? Now a creative writing professor at San Francisco State University. But when her parents invited friends to lunch there, they always politely declined. Rumor was they'd be served stray cats and dogs. Yeah. Though the rumor was totally false, according to unnamed sources, the owners who had fled from the communist, Kamarroj regime in Cambodia eventually had to sell their business and move away. Chai told USA Today. For well over a century, Americans have falsely accused immigrants of cooking and serving household pets. That's why many people, especially Americans of color, were disturbed this week. When leading Republicans, including former president Donald Trump and vice presidential candidate JD Vance, repeated unfound it claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio were eating household pets. It's just it's interesting. And then even going to the governor. So so so where were all these these people of color that were offended by this? Because I have seen the on the internet for the last 24 hours, a whole bunch of people of color making rap songs out of the fucking statement saying how much they love Donald Trump and how much bullshit it is that they're actually eating animals. In fact, I believe that I found an actual human being from Springfield talking about this. Didn't I? Didn't I send that to you? Mm hmm. And what she was black, wasn't she? Black. Oh yeah. Cron. Yeah. Saying, hey, quit eating my fucking pets. It's not safe. She says not a joke. People are actually eating our pets. They're eating our dogs. What would you do if you walked out? Do you have the video? Yeah, this video right here. You're my the fucking you saw your dogs had the capacitor on the fucking ground like I do. Why are you thinking this is a joke? It's not a joke. I don't feel comfortable walking anywhere. Like what the fuck I should be I would put them out on city. Everybody's fucking home. It's out here. And shit. But fucking scary. I hate this. It's lurking and creeping and saying, y'all thinking this is not fucking fine. I can't make it this shut up. It's not made up, bro. This shit is real life. This shit is really affecting me. Like what the fuck? Yeah. Well, who'd you fucking go for? Who'd you go for? Don't you remember lady that how racist it was? Don't you remember how racist we are? Don't you remember how telling people that a legal immigrants can't come means that we hate black people too? Don't you remember that shit? You're bought it. It's interesting because it seems like you're getting a taste of your own fucking medicine as much as I empathize with her because that would be horrible. You made your bed. No shit. You made your bed. And it's very unfortunate. But like nobody's like you know pissed off or taking you know a fence of this shit being called out. No. And nobody I mean I guess people are kind of making fun of it a little bit but like I've been more pissed at the people lying that it's not fucking happening. You know what I'm saying? Like the governor of Ohio. The internet can be quite crazy. Yeah. Well we all know how this is going to go. Right. It's not happening. It is happening but it's a good thing. And then it's your fault that it's happening. Like no, yeah. That's just crazy man. You know but you know and then it's going to go to if you don't think it's okay for them to eat your dog then you're racist. That's what it'll end up being. Yeah. If you don't sacrifice your dogs. Yeah. If you don't, if you don't agree with their way of life then you're fucking racist. The racist man. Yeah. It's cultural norms. Totally normal. Not here. No. I mean the thing is like like it's not happening but at the same exact time the governor wants to say that. You know then why are you sending state troopers? And you know Ohio tax paying money to to Springfield? Why would you be doing that then? Ohio sending troopers and $2.5 million to a city that has seen influx of Haitian migrants. I thought everything was fine. It's interesting that that's the wrong. Yeah. That's just crazy. Yeah. Yeah. That was yesterday. Hold on. Yesterday was what would it say? Yesterday was Ohio governor Mike DeWine pushes back fake migrant story amplified by Trump. The internet can be quite crazy. And today it's I'm sending troops to Springfield. Yeah. Right. It's totally fine. Okay. Now, we've been talking about the animals, the dogs, the cats, the ducks, the goose, the geese. But let's let's look a little bit about the driving of the Haitians because there's been a compilation that came out now of the Haitians driving. Let's check this out. Well, they killed that kid. Yeah, they just killed him. Yeah. Yeah. Just happened. Let's check this out. Who's hard? Who did this? Why am I not going to make it about a minute? You did this? Yeah. Yeah, man. This is the third wreck today. We got to do something about this. We need a uh, Anthony has a fight on him. This is the third time. This is happening today. It's the third time. How are they getting these cars? Are these stolen cars? I don't know. That's a nice car. They look pretty nice. So the Haitians come here from no, with no money and they get all these new cars. It's the fourth car collision. Oh, this is the fourth wreck involving the new Americans. They're not new Americans. Did you not see the car? No, this is the one. This is this lane. He can turn in here. You can't turn. It's in here. We wasn't right here. We was on the line when you and they give us a green light to turn. We turned exactly on the same size we should turn. So you're saying it's a useful? Yes. Because we give him the signal. He should see us. So it looks like he was in this lane and then y'all was in that lane and he y'all turned into here. Because like y'all hit him. He didn't hit y'all. Hey, do this. Do this. Google me this. What's the average IQ? Y'all. Exactly. Both. Look at the guy. I'm just, so it's 67. So basically are you filming us? Is that because we don't have to we don't have to do any. Is that what it says? Okay. You think somebody with a 67 IQ should be driving a fun car? Or does that put every single person in that fucking town in danger? That guy, the guy driving, has no fucking clue where he's at. We have to stop with this idealistic shit dude and start looking at the truth of the matter. My fuckers ain't even smart enough to drive. No, it's crazy. I mean, the other thing too, man, you know, is that like one of the comments that that they constantly say, you know, in these articles, when you read them. Dude, I just want to get to the point where we can talk about things without emotions. We can talk about things as the reality. Dude, when we we have to start looking at people and being honest, like, where are they? Are they capable of this? Are they capable of that? What are they capable of? What are their customs? How do they fit in society? You know what I'm saying? But you can't say that shit because I get into you. There's going to be people that say just because I pointed out that the average IQ of a Haitian is 67 and I'm racist. How does that make me racist when I'm pointing out a statistical fucking fact? Right. Right. The other part of this suit that bothers the bothers me is like, you know, they even go down here in this, uh, in that first article by Reuters and saying, you know, quote, now the article reads, uh, roughly 15,000 Haitian immigrants have come to the city in recent years boosting the local economy, but also straining schools and other social services, wages have surged and local officials say crime has not risen. And it's so interesting because just after a little bit of looking, um, this is a topic that we've covered a while ago that they're not reporting the crimes in these places. Um, and guess what? Ohio, more specifically, Springfield is one of them that are not reporting the crimes. So of course crime has not risen. Oh, by the way, let's zoom out here just for those, for those of you that cannot see this map in 2022, they made a new national rule where reporting crime was optional. And if we're looking at this map right now, you can very clearly see that the area of Tampa, the area of Orlando, the area of New York, the area of Washington, DC, the area of San Francisco, and the area of Los Angeles and the area of Phoenix, stopped reporting crime on a national level. And then these people get up on TV in front of the whole country and say crime is down just because they made a rule that said you don't have to report and those people don't report. So of course, crime is down. Of course, if there's not, if it's not being fucking reported. Yeah. To the tune of 32% of all agencies, all police agencies in the state have actually opted out of doing this. Okay, just happen to be all of the major cities. 32% of the reporting is not being reported. Right. Okay. That just changed in 2022. So when they say crime is down, you, you, I, it's a total pencil fuck. It's a lie. No, dude. The video equipped the rap video is pretty cool. That's fucking hilarious. She's Asian. She's not offended. She's like, I, you cast all times. I love it. I think it's a fucking hit. I started that shit. Guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let's know what you guys think. But that being said, let's check in on headline number three, a third of final headline reads. No, bro, bro, hold on. Before we go into the thing, do you know that the 67 IQ, you, you can't legally stand trial for a crime that you committed? No, look it up. Damn, I don't know that. average IQ of an American is 98. Yeah. It'd be 120 for one for those 67s. Did you, am I right or wrong? Yeah, 67. What is it? What does it say? It's the minimum IQ level needed to stand trial and court. So all these motherfuckers doing all this fucking shit are not even smart enough to stand trial in the court of law in the United States of America. But we're going to import them by the millions. We're going to give them cars. We're going to give them money. That can't be. That motherfucker had, dude, did you not see his face? He had no idea why he crashed that car. He had no fucking clue. He's like, I fucking hit, I hit something. No shit. You know what I'm saying? Like, bro, this is what we're dealing with. And it's, it's fucking, you call whatever the fuck you want. But it ain't good. And I'm not a racist for pointing out the fucking data. No one is. Data is fucking data. It's not data is not racist. Math is not racist. It is fucking data. That's crazy Chinese people lost more than white people. So are Indians. You know what? It is what the fuck it is. You know what I'm saying? I just happen to be an exceptional white person. White supremacy over here, baby. Yeah, man. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think. What do you think is stupid white people? Z-Shine? Being from India. They're okay. They're pretty stupid. Aren't they? Yeah. Yeah. See? That's not racist. That's statistical fact. And I'm a person of color saying that. Yeah. Yeah. See? I'm about where you guys want that? He's a fucking, he's a westerner like me. We might not be the smartest, but we're the best looking. Questionable. Questionable. Let me know. We're the best looking. What else we got going for us? That's about it. Biggest fucking white dicks. Yeah. Big white, big fucking shammu's. Questionable. Prove it. We got good credit scores. Okay. You can have that. I'll give you that one. Yeah. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think. We cook better and everybody. Cook better? Yeah. I know we're just lying, bro. We dunk basketballs better. We run from police better. We're faster. See that? That's how you just lie to people. You just don't report the lie. Yeah. You can read. I. Yeah. Hey, that was that was from the Indian. It's fine. He's the smartest one here. So fucking, it's gotta be true. So statistically. Yeah. No, that's questionable too. I don't know. Yeah. We're pretty dumb. Just ask the internet. Yeah. Guys, Andy had line number three. Let's get you our third and final headline had line number three reads. New York City Police Commissioner resigns after his phone was seized in federal investigation. Uh oh. New York City ain't doing too good right now, bro. Uh oh. They are down. Oh, they're down right now. Let's dive into this. New York City Police Commissioner Edward Caban resigned Thursday. One week after it emerged that his phone was seized. It's part of a federal investigation that touched several members of Mayor Eric Adams in her circle. See, just why you always have two phones. Yeah. When they come take your phone, you give them the one with no shit on it. There you go. No problem. Tell the other one to fucking fire. Uh Caban said he made the decision to resign after. Uh in fact, Zishan needs to order us all an extra phone. Uh Caban said he made the decision to resign after the news around recent developments had quote, created a distraction for our department. According to an email to the police department obtained by the AP. Uh Caban was one of several high ranking city officials who electronic devices were seized last week by federal investigators. According to people familiar with the matter that people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation. Now the subject of the investigation, uh which is being led by the United States Attorney's Office and Manhattan remains unclear. Um the reasons why they're investigating like they haven't really said much. Um it was not immediately clear whether federal authorities were seeking information linked to one investigation or several. Um federal authorities are also investigating cabans twin brother James Caban who runs a nightclub security business according to a person familiar with the matter. Now the person cannot publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on the condition of anonymity. Now Edward, uh 57 have been in charge of the nation's largest police department for about 15 months of Puerto Rican heritage. He was the first Latino to lead the 179-year-old New York police department. He is now also the first Latino to get his phone seized by federal authorities. Good job. Something about those first. Now it's interesting. This is where the story gets weird, Andy, because we talk about this cabal and it is a very very tight circle. Dude what is the shit? He was the first this to lead this who fucking cares. How did it work out? Who fucking cares? How did it work out? Bro, uh did you edit that clip that you put up the set of the one the people got pissed about that. Which one? The one where I say who gives a fuck about if it's the first woman or whatever. Who cares? We work the best. And then two things to point here whenever somebody was commenting some random stuff with didn't make sense. It was a bot. It was a bot. Always a private account with either zero posts or no posts. Yeah. And then the two out of 10 people who would come and back supremely charged with emotion, devoid of logic. In fact, you question them back. They're answering them back with emotions and bias. What what what what different what were they saying? They were saying that it's going to be worse with Trump. She's the best and bringing up abortion thing which you you have talked about multiple times. Bringing up the Russia thing which well what happened there was that that clip went to somebody's fucking little back group. Oh yeah. Oh this is another point Keith was talking about earlier. When I posted that clip I did not use any hashtags. I just put not the first but the best and it was your clip and you talking and there were people commenting who don't even follow who have no relation like distantly cool. And then within 10 or 20 minutes they're just bombarded like you said happened with you talking about Hillary. Yeah years ago. Yeah, but same thing. Yeah. Well come get some bro because we ain't gonna shut the fuck up. Oh shit. Now this is where it gets interesting though because we do talk about this next time I'll be next time I we talk about I'll say what I actually think. Hey we really be mad. What's that? Well I said next time. Oh fucker. If I say what I really like people are like fuck do you for so says we're the fuck he wants. No I don't. People have been commenting on YouTube that every time you say oh I went too hard and didn't post that episode. They want to see it don't they. They want to see it more and you should post it on either like on your website or somewhere else. Yeah well I don't think I might end up in a camp for some of the things. No this is where the story gets interesting. So this guy, Kaban, Erick Aban he resigns. When we talk about this Kabal and how you know it's a very tight knit community. It's a short short list you know I'm saying but they keep their stuff in check and you know people get installed. I want you to why I want you to look at who got who replaced this guy. So immediately after that happened Erick Adams he taps an ex FBI official by the name of Tom Donlin as the interim police commissioner after Edward resigned. Now Tom Donlin is a prominent former FBI encounter terrorism official. He's going to serve as the NYPD's interim commissioner. Mayor Adams just announced that today. The appointment again comes after Adam said he accepted the resignation of the battered commissioner at work Aban who stepped down because of the federal investigation. He says quote I'm taking immediate action in appointing Tom Donlin as interim police commissioner. Adam said in a video address quote Tom is an experienced law enforcement professional who has worked at the local state, federal and international levels. Donlin he's a Bronx native. He served as New York's director of the office of Homeland Security. He ran the FBI's National Threat Assessment Center at the FBI NYPD Joint Terrorism Task Force. He also worked as the cold case agent investigating the 1993 tower bombings as well as attacks on the US embassies in Africa. And he fucking knew a very good job there. Did he know this is where it gets weird though. He also served some stints at credit credit suites and BlackRock. And he founded Global Security Resolutions, a New York City based company that provides security protection and investigative work. The credit suites in BlackRock, that's what threw me off here. Okay. Well far fetched. He's he is in charge at this time of the largest police department in the country, New York City PD. Who does business in New York City? Trump. There's a lot of you know he travels there often. Trump towers. He stays there. Now secret service has to coordinate with local level police quite often during those moves. I'm just saying having a guy that's connected to a company which stood to benefit from the assassination attempt on Trump you know two months ago is now in charge of explain that so people fall it because there there's a lot of people who maybe miss that part of it. The stock stuff for BlackRock? Yeah. So when they dumped millions of stock shares into truth social literally a week before the assassination attempt and they shorted them. They shorted them. Right. And it came back to find out that a lot of the investment dollars were linked back to BlackRock. It's correct. Link to BlackRock. Directly. BlackRock and Vanguard specifically. Yeah. And so now you have a guy okay that is being installed right who has a history with BlackRock. A significant history with BlackRock. And Credit Suites remember that's the company that you know had that big massive you know the bankruptcy they filled out who were tied into the abstinence shit like there's a weird connection there right but now this guy Tom Dommlin is now in charge of the largest police department in New York in the country where Trump frequents a lot and he has a connection like to me that's just too many from coincident connections in my opinion man. I think Trump needs to be very very fucking careful. Yeah. And his movements. Yeah. He worked at the 93 tower bombing and then also the coal. It's weird man. Yeah. It's it's fucking weird. It's weird. It just doesn't say right with me but yeah I mean this investigation has been going on for a little bit. There's been a lot of people actually that were that are being investigated along with this. So outside of just Edward Cabin. There has been the first deputy mayor Sheena Wright. Phillip Banks. Phillip Banks brother David Banks. The city schools chancellor. And Timothy Pearson a top mayoral advisor and former high ranking New York police department official as well. They're all going down right now all on there under this investigation and it's just not looking good. It's just it's very very interesting but I'm more concerned about this time down man guy and then what that could possibly mean. I don't know man. Anybody got on this? I don't know. I mean look man. I I think all of these people are a couple degrees you know away from each other and I don't think there's that many of them. I think their world is crumbling. I think they're losing and they know they're losing and I think they're I think there's likely some coordination for what would be called a black swan event which is a negative world changing event to happen between now uh September 12th and the election in November and I I still believe you know the war hasn't worked. The resurgence of a pandemic hasn't worked. The prosecution hasn't worked. The assassination attempt failed. The media bias hasn't changed. In fact the more they go at them the more powerful he gets. So what's next for them because they're not just going to give up and throw their hands in the air and say oh well he gets to walk right in and be president. So the next thing is going to be to create what what you know what I'm saying a massive world changing event or uh you know like I said when the assassination thing happened you know I could see them 100% uh doing some sort of major terror attack that kills Trump and then they blame it on Iran and then they try to get out all of Trump supporters to support the war that they won over in the Middle East and they they take a lot of problems and they make a solution for them and so I wouldn't be surprised if we see some sort of major attack that's targeted uh at Trump and whoever's around him between now and then and I think you're right I think he has to be very careful and I think you know if that happens people have to understand that we we could see very clearly who orchestrated this they're putting them proper shot call that was in place man they're saying it on the on the news all the time dude I was watching the news last night and they were saying Iran's trying to kill Trump as we speak that was their statement and it's like dude you know they're painting this they're setting the table for this so I mean you know I haven't missed on too much man I just hope that these people are smart enough to avoid a situation like that yeah guys jump it on this conversation let's know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck uh this is where bring a headline and we talk about it to get one of those two options um I think you'll like this one um I thumbs up or dumb as fuck head long reads fearless panero worker bashes customer with bread pan after he assaults patrons and violent outbursts I saw this video but I thought it was a girl oh that was a dude yeah did you see that other video of that trans dude going crazy oh yeah I saw that one freaking the fuck out yeah this is another one yeah I saw okay this is trans person I mean it's just a dude with long hair that's a gay dude is it yep uh beat down with the side of bread a pan-wielding panero bread worker repeatedly bashed a crazed customer in the head when he started to assault employees and customers and a violent outburst inside the Colorado fast casual restaurant the suspect identified by the Glendale police department as Isaac Ross started wreaking havoc inside a panero bread in Glendale five miles outside of Denver on Tuesday according to KDVR a video taken by frightened customer Natalie Weirzma showed the suspect screaming like a maniac throwing items off the counter at a restaurant staff and demanding the workers return a phone quote the suspect was yelling at the workers and they were all super confused looking and said we don't have your phone where is the motto of the outlet customers tried pleading with Ross to stop and leave but it seemingly infuriated him further Ross has heard shouting a racial slur at one one diner before continuing to unleash his temper tantrum in front of other customers quote no one has your phone a customer screams at Ross as he continues his threatening antics let's check this video and see this this panero justice served he just dropped the n-word the n-word hard art surprise you didn't die right away a lot of backool let's do it Honestly, go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. They're probably finer that woman. She'll probably get suit the pen error probably get sued for that. Out of hire. Dude, first of all, that guy deserves his ass beat. Beat, do you see him trying to attack that old man? Like bro, this is what it looks like when you don't punish your kids and you don't spank their asses and you sit him in a corner and you say you're in time out. Yeah, we don't do time out of the Johnson House. And fuck bro, that guy never got his ass beat. Never in his whole life. That's why he's acting like that. Remember we were talking, did we just talk about this? About, didn't we just, wasn't this on the show this week? We talked about like fist fights fucking have made the world. Not having, yeah, that motherfucker never been a fist fight. He never had someone punch from square in the face and get knocked on his ass and then have to rethink his decisions. Never happened. No, man. So the Glendale Police Department told the outlet that Ross fled soon after the altercation. However, they shared that he later returned to the same pen error and had another violent outburst. Ross allegedly assaulted an at risk male victim.
