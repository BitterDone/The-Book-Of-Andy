it it's exactly the same scenes it's like the same movie oh it took the same plot line yeah it's the same plot line it's like dude is like a washed up driver then he gets a ride in the big show you know him and the other driver hate each other then they go to dinner and they play poker and they get it start getting along and then he gets an erect the other the young driver and then like they win

yeah watch it okay you'll love it you'll thank me okay all right let's do show fuck I got it in a furious shit man who's in it yeah all right all right well let's let's get into some Q&A's man it's it's a beautiful Monday Labor Day happy Labor Day day everybody out there and let's make some people better let's do it let's knock these out man guys Andy question number one Andy my question is how do you sustain a healthy balance working out working 12 to 14 hours a day six days a week operate dump trucks and I want to improve on myself I'm not overweight but it is hard to keep at it with the changing schedule so I guess just balance in like what what's this idea of balance the people are talking about that I always want I don't know you tell me dude who makes up this rule about balance and everybody has to have this same balance like who wrote this thing like oh we gotta have a healthy balance who fucking defines a healthy balance wouldn't a healthy balance be determined by what your desired outcome is and how to get there okay like this trying to take extraordinary goals and ambitions and plug them into the idea of balance that everybody else lives by does not work the reason it doesn't work is because they're looking for one outcome and you are looking for a different outcome and this would be the same thing if I were to say hey I'm driving to Boston you're driving to California let's take the same fucking like that doesn't work so what is this with you fuckers that makes you think that you're going to have balance and also win at a big level now you can have balance and you can get by and you can live a good life and you can sit by the pond and whistle fucking tunes or whatever you do but bro that's not going to get you the prize too okay you don't get to have your cake and eat it too that is not how the fuck the world works and it is so overdone and overcooked and ridiculous at this point in time that people have not figured out that you can't have both you can't build amazing shit and also have balance it's just not real and anybody who tells you different hasn't built anything okay now can you do things to optimize the amount of time that you're going to get yes you can that's why I developed the power list that's what it does you can get it for free in episode 16 there's also amazing app on iTunes wherever apps you get wherever you get your apps you can get there this product this system allows you to create productivity over the course of time day in and day out and still have free time okay being busy is not the same as being effective the more effective you are the more free time you have the more busy you are the less free time you have busy equals broke effective equals rich rich in money rich in time rich in opportunity okay so we have to define and think about what it is we are actually talking about here we are talking about being effective if you are effective you will have time to do things with your friends with your families the problem is y'all think that fucking being busy is how you get there and that's not the truth okay so and then a tap of that there's going to be times where there's zero balance no matter how effective you are during the day like when you're in startup mode or you're in build mode there's no balance bro it's every day all day as much as you can do and it's like that for a long time in the beginning the grind yeah 100 percent dude it doesn't fucking the rules don't change because you want him to change they don't change because your favorite therapist you follow on the internet says that whatever you're doing is unhealthy okay well then be like them but you don't want to be like them you want to have that lifestyle and then you want to have all the other shit too and that is now how the fuck it works bro and I'm so fucking tired of people asking this stupid ask question okay I've answered it for 10 fucking years every guru dude out there tries to tell you that you can fucking become a gazillionaire in an hour a day they're lying they're misleading you all of this shit on the internet is bullshit okay you have to pay the price and not only do you have to pay the price you got to pay the price well meaning the actions you take have to be executed at a high level like this is not that hard to understand you just don't want to understand it you want it to be that you can fuck off half the time and still get where you want to go and that just does it work okay so I don't know what it is with you guys I don't really understand this but you ain't never gonna get there with that mentality the mentality should be like this how the fuck do I get there period okay because it is very hard to get there it's not easy it's not guaranteed there's nothing about it that's fair it's very difficult it takes your entire life all of your motherfucking energy and to think that you can get there with balance to is a ridiculous belief and it's insulting to anybody who's been down the path because quite honestly you don't have any skills you don't have any experience you don't have the fucking tools you don't have the resources you don't have the connections and somehow you think you're gonna get there with less effort than even the people who do like it's it's so ridiculous and this is like this is the problem with glorifying entrepreneurship this is the problem with glorifying success and all of these dumbass coaches out there that lie to people about what it actually takes so that they can sell them their little system and they can make money all the while the person who's buying the system it never works for them and then they think I'm not cut out for success I'm not cut out to win I'm not cut out to be that person I'm wanting to be deep down inside when in reality you're just being lied to about the fucking game okay and if you knew the actual rules you would understand what it took to get there and you wouldn't stop and yourself and say oh well I guess I don't have what it takes this is like the diet industry okay the diet industry survives because easy quick instant 20 pounds and fucking one week and everybody knows this bullshit but what happens somebody who doesn't know anything starts to buy this shit they don't lose anyway and who do they blame they don't blame the company for lying to them they don't blame the marketer they blame themselves and they say shit well I guess I'm just different I guess I'm just gonna be fat and in entrepreneurship they're saying this I guess this isn't for me I guess I can't make money I guess I can't succeed when in reality lots of people have the potential to succeed but they're being lied to about the price they have to fucking pay okay so get this in your head the bigger the life that you're trying to build the less fucking balance you're gonna have okay and the more balance you have the smaller the life you're gonna build that's the reality when it comes to quote unquote success now I'm not trying to fucking talk about oh with the fine success it's for feel you know city grounding in the earth is the new rich no motherfucker I'm talking about rich rich I'm talking about fucking money I'm talking about the real success of what we talk about am I talking about this bullshit fucking feel good nonsense so you know how people are bro oh yeah oh fucking new rich is peanut butter and jelly no it ain't the new rich is a big ass bank account bitch you know I'm saying like it's always been that way that's the only fucking rich some of your kids in schools you want them to now you could be fulfilled that's a different thing yeah that's different bro but like I can't stand this fucking saying inner pieces the new rich that's rich for you whatever bro I don't give a fuck but stop trying to convince people that there's nobility and being less than what they could be and less than what they should be because that idea is what's killing the motherfucking world okay every single motherfucking person that lives out there has this vision of who they were supposed to be it was placed in their heart by god and we get beat by society in our friends in our family and we get convinced that that's ridiculous would you tell god that's ridiculous I don't think you would okay becoming that version of yourself takes courage becoming of that version of yourself takes strength and grit and discipline and consistency and it's hard but it's worth it and it's what you're supposed to do because the reality is other people will win or lose because of what you did with yourself and what you did with your life and it's very easy to convince yourself that you don't matter well yeah because they spend trillions of dollars trying to convince you of that and if you didn't matter and your life was irrelevant then why would they spend so much time energy and money convincing you of that fact your results and your life are the biggest thing that you will ever do because it's going to determine what the next generation sees and does and if you don't respect that if you don't if that doesn't motivate you to get off your fucking ass and build something then dude I'm sorry you just don't have it go sit at McDonald's bro and fucking eat happy meals you know be happy yeah dude just fucking accept accept your reality that's the problem we have so many of these people that they don't want to accept the reality the reality is you either pay the price now or you're going to pay the different way later right that's it so yeah if you want the you could do things to optimize balance bro but like this idea of balance is ridiculous how do you balance working 10 hours a day working out do like bro lots of people do that like what do you mean how do you just do it you get your shit organized get the power list out make it a fucking priority like see I've and you can tell me if I'm right I remember Andy I listen to you like your word is gold though but this is something that I've done and this might help I don't know but like I've I've gotten away from thinking about life in that way of balance like I look at it more like on a macro scale that's how you know I'm saying it's like okay well for these 10 years bro that's correct I'm gonna like it means it's gonna be late night correct there's gonna be some some some some missed parties there's gonna be like I got a girl right yeah yeah yeah bro and then in 10 years then we can talk about okay well now can I work on this that's right yeah like that's exactly how it should be looked at but how most people look at it is balance over the course of 24 hours right right how how highly successful people look at it they look at it as a balance over the next 30 years mm-hmm I'm gonna pay the price now so that later I can have more balance in my life I can do things I enjoy when my kids are 10 12 years old I can do the things that they need to do this is reality dude and like if you can't do it or you're not willing to cool but like the games rules don't change just because you don't fucking like them you know and I feel like a lot of the questions we get are just people that want to hear some sort of like confirmation that their little way of seeing things is correct and the rules are gonna bend just for them and they have yeah dude it's not like that the rules are the fucking rules it's like gravity dude like you may not like gravity you know I don't fucking I don't like gravity okay well that doesn't mean it's not gonna smash your fucking face if you fall off the edge of a building right you know like I don't know man uh but yeah it's there's distinct differences upon how people evaluate balance and how successful they are I mean there's a correlation there right dude I just look I would rather work my ass off now than be fucking 50 something and have to and you have to and have to yeah well dude I mean you see it every day like how many of these people I mean how many of these people are completely fucking themselves and don't realize that like dude when you're 50 you're gonna be working a fucking Taco Bell like you're because you're gonna have to you know what I mean so anyway dude like yeah uh I say this all the time but you guys should all remember this all these memes and all these fucking feel good bullshit all that does is cloud your mind all it does is soften your edge all it does is remove your focus and I would argue that the more content you consume from people who are trying to make you feel good and find peace and find happiness and this in like this very soft way the less successful you're gonna be bro because it dulls your edge it makes you think things should be a certain way for you when you've picked a completely different fucking path and then you end up in this situation where you're extremely frustrated because you're like well I should feel peaceful but I'm fucking this is so hard no you're trying to mix the rules of two different fucking games bro you understand like dude this this is this confuses the fuck out of people and dude it ain't it just eight you got every fucking fuck face on the internet telling people how to win and they ever fucking won I don't know what to tell you man yeah like it gets frustrating dude yeah just because you don't like the rules doesn't mean they aren't the rules that's real man guys ain't let's get to let's get another question in bro guys any question number two Andy I could really use your perspective on something so I've been with the company for seven years and worked my way up from store manager to area manager and now into upper management along the way I've taken on everything from hiring onboarding and training to employ you development and I've become the person people turn to when something needs to get done the company has grown from four stores to seventeen during my time here and I've always stepped up without hesitation when the business needed me here's where I'm struggling I just found out that two of my male peers who started about the same time as me and were promoted earlier are making more than I am and their bonus percentage is 15% higher now keep in mind I am paid very well I feel very greedy even even feeling this way I've never believed gender played a role in my career but seeing this has really shaken me I've always given 110% and never let money stop me from doing what's right for the company but now that I know I'm being compensated less while doing just as much if not more I really mean I'm doing a shit ton more I find it harder to keep going the extra mile what would you do in my situation uh well are you sure it has to do with gender or are they better negotiators than you do they voice their frustrations better than you you said oh I don't want to be greedy well you've obviously felt that for a while that you probably needed to make more money why have you not said anything why have you not gone in and say hey Joe and Steve make more than me and I'm kicking their fucking asses if you're so bad-ass why the fuck are you not doing that okay I would say it probably has little to do with gender and I would say it probably has a lot to do with lack of communication because if you had come to me and and these are assuming everything you said was true facts okay assuming always true yeah and you are highly influential and very much a part of my company going from four stores to 17 stores I'm taking care of you yeah I'm gonna fucking make sure you got what you need and not only am I gonna make sure you got what you need I'm gonna make sure you got more than what you need because I don't want you worried about shit I want you worried about what we're doing here okay and that's the way people treat valuable employees and you know it's it's completely different than than non-valueable employees non-valueable employees take up space air and resources valuable employees or investments you fucking make sure that they don't go anywhere okay and if the company's not doing that it means two things either one you're not vocal enough about what it is that you're doing and you're not tooting your own horn to the people who matter meaning not your peers you don't go around to your peers I'm the fucking best that's cancer a shit that's not leadership I don't think you do that because you wouldn't have been able to grow the way that you said you've grown by doing that and the other one is is that you know you need to take that into your superiors and say hey because nobody's gonna toot your fucking horn unless you toot it and I would have my fucking stats I would have my data I would have my KPIs and I would have my case made for why I should be making more money and I would be prepared to leave if they didn't give it to me that's the truth oh that's the tough yeah well there's plenty of companies to hire someone like that you fucking come work for me if you really did all that shit yeah I'm always looking for people to build shit okay that's assuming what you say was facts okay because also I'm going to say a lot of times people believe they're more valuable than they actually are and they will take credit for things in companies not realizing that those same things would have happened with or without them so you know I don't know if you're that kind of a person or not but I'm gonna take you at your word and say you were highly responsible for this it's either a um you're not tuning your own horn or b you're probably in the wrong company you know what I'm saying yeah do I mean one thing I was thinking too like could it also be too that like Steve and you know Joe Dared or whoever like they are bringing other things to the table that you're not aware of that you know is bringing value somehow everybody likes to go to this fucking gender race fucking shit I don't get listen I want to win people who run companies want to fucking win the competition is hard it's very it's the hardest fucking thing ever do you really fucking think that somebody is going to risk not succeeding when they have their whole life and their whole financial future and their whole thing on whether or not the mother fuckers a male or a female or fucking black or white or fucking this or that those people don't last in business because they're fucking stupid okay I want the best mother fucking players it's it's like the NFL dude I don't give a fuck bro if we got a tail back and it happens to be a woman and she can run faster everybody else and run the fuck over everybody I'm putting in a fucking game bro like dude no one gives a fuck that's the shit people that have excuses say that's the shit that people say when they you know look at things and they're like oh this isn't fucking fair it's not fair that's why you have to be so fucking good and so undeniable that when the conversation comes up it's like I'm taking fucking pat my homes bro it's it's pat my home yeah like it is what it is I'm not fucking lose like that's undeniable and people don't realize when we talk about undeniable we're not talking about a little bit better we're talking about so much better that every motherfucker that walks in that building whether they work there or don't work there understand who the motherfucker is right when they walk in that is undeniable undeniable is a thousand steps above everybody else it is not slightly above okay not close no so you know look I don't think it's because of gender your boss wants to fucking win they're growing the company they went from four to 17 stores they want to win okay so if you're that if you're that much of a key of the equation he's gonna recognize or she's gonna recognize that they need to fucking pay you and if if they don't and you really are that person they're fucking stupid okay and you know but I think it probably has to do with you not making a case for yourself the way they maybe have done yeah and I'm gonna actually that too because like you know let me tell you something yeah moat now most people who run companies will not pay someone unless they ask okay and most employees are uncomfortable asking which creates this dynamic of frustration okay and so the employee doesn't communicate it's on the reasonable expectations the employee doesn't communicate the boss feels like everything is cool and then all of a sudden the employee fucking bounces they fucking underpaid me they fucked me they bullshit you fucked you you didn't fucking say a goddamn word you just sat there and took it if you got a problem with what you're getting paid you should make a fucking undeniable case why you should get paid more and you should take it to your leadership that's the truth but it has to be real it has to be stats it has to be data it cannot be I think I'm doing better than everybody else I feel it yeah yeah fuck I work hard to show up on time yeah you're supposed to bitch like fuck you know what I'm saying yeah look go tell him what you want hit him with the facts period yeah like yeah I was thinking this too man because like again like I'm with you I'm pretty much every day bro like and I see what you have to go through like dude there's a major there's a major lesson in in in a development of an employee yeah to teach them that they have to do what I just said to their own hard hold on yeah no they've got to make a case data reality statistics points on the board a real case why do you think that is important for an employees development because eventually you're gonna have to negotiate deals and eventually you're gonna have to handle finances if you continue to move up the chain and so an intelligent leader will not fucking give someone a raise until they make a case for it because it it's part of their development that's a whole other play that yeah I was just thinking I think I think too along your lines though I'm just like the disconnection though it's like there's a there's a false assumption that like you know the your owner or your operator whoever is supposed to know and be aware of all these interests like in every little space you just grew from four to 17 stores how many more employees is that and so he's just supposed all right hey yeah yeah coming here I know you know you ain't sitting under a while let me bro I had an employee recently come up to me and tell me that they that they weren't being treated fairly and all this shit right and I'm like well I don't how much do you get paid I don't even fucking know yeah right you know I don't know I have no idea exactly exactly exactly that's what that's my point is I being tapped in and I'm like it's not fair what have you brought that to anybody well no no have you said anything to anybody no right what the fuck man right right right and this is where they go and build their own stories and they believe in that and then it's you fuck them right right when we like dude no offense to this woman here but she's already started to build that story she's already started to build the story that the reason she's not paid equally is because she's a woman which data nationally does not actually back that up at all true okay so you're making a story in your head that may not be true and if it is true it means you work for a shitty company because a real company that wants to fucking win doesn't give a fuck who what color race gender and give a fuck bro I'm on here every day talking about I don't care when is winners winners win bro and the best player plays and the people who own companies want to fucking grow and make money and they're gonna put like this whole idea is so absurd to me oh you're discriminating against me because I'm black what the fuck are you talking about bro I want to fucking win can you do the job you show a blade to work bro I really want me to do so that's for tomorrow so listen that's not exclusive to any race that's a character thing yeah for sure and you know and then people will show up on time for fucking six months I'm like I'm fucking showed up on time for six months it's like yeah that's how you don't get fired that's the extra that's real man fuck that's where I love it man we got one more question bro final question um guys any question number three Andy I have always been able to go after anything I wanted and getting it by working hard and relying on myself I've never felt like I needed anyone else for anything however as a business owner um to a service plumbing company I've come to realize that I do need others for my success I need customers to want to do business with my company I need them to trust me that I will fix their issues efficiently um and for a fair price I need them to refer me to others I need them to entrust my abilities and allow me to show them that I'm an honest business owner um and that I will conduct myself in a professional manner I need to pliers to trust me and give me accounts that will allow my business to be competitive within the industry so my question is how do I internally accept the fact that I need others to help me so that I can become successful I struggle with needing anyone and being vulnerable and even more so conducting myself in the manner of needing others I do not want to come off as a struggling business but Jason Christ bro this is the most ridiculous shit I've ever fucking heard okay I'm just gonna stop here right here what the fuck are you talking about are you gonna go play in that NFL run the fucking football out of the field by yourself you get fucking killed business as a team sport part of being successful is working with other people in fact it's the main part you can't do everything on yourself that's a small mind and mentality and it's also an insecure mentality no one thinks you're vulnerable because fucking you are struggling business because you do what everybody else in the world does and fucking work with people right like that's fucking insane bro do you know do you do you understand how ridiculous that fucking sounds it's insane you're gonna be the only person ever to build a fucking awesome plumbing company by yourself ever no customers like what the fuck are you talking about dude okay let me give you the answer to your question it's real simple change your perspective change your framework from this I don't need any people I'm a big tough guy I could handle myself I can do all this shit to this I love working with people I fucking love talking to customers I love the people I go to work with I love my vendors I love my suppliers I dude every time you see him be excited hey DJ what's up man you know how's business for you your day will be so much more fulfilling and so much more fun and you will make so much more money by just changing your perspective from I'm a big tough guy I gotta fuck do everything on my own and otherwise I'm a bitch to man this is so cool I get to do all this great shit with all these awesome people every day dude I could be working by myself being miserable and I haven't anybody to talk to I get to wake up today and I get to go to work and I get to see this person and that person and I get to talk to him about this that this like bro that's a fucking privilege not everybody has that man and like I'm gonna tell you this the times I've struggled and business the most are the times I've lied to myself about what I have to do I look at it like fuck I gotta go in I gotta handle this problem where I gotta listen this and this and this and now as I've gotten older I've started to see it like this you know what this guy's such an idiot for doing this but like he's a young guy he doesn't fucking know so now I get to help him and I get to save him from doing this shit later on you know I changed my framework yes so you gotta change your frame dude and you gotta realize that like the I'm gonna tell you guys this too let me I'm gonna be really fucking honest I've made a fuck ton of money everybody knows that it's no secret I'm very wealthy I've been very successful in almost everything I've done since the time I was 19 years old the best part of that entire journey is the people you get to do it with it's the people you get it's the vendors it's the customers it's the people you talk to the relationships you build the friends you make it's the best it's the best part of it so just embrace it dude and stop thinking like over analyzing yourself like you're not gonna be the first person that does this on your own nobody's gonna think you're vulnerable or weak because you're doing things that everybody else in the history of fucking earth has had to do bro you're giving them saying this is an ego problem you need to humble yourself okay you think you're fucking so good and so strong and so tough and so independent you probably were raised by an old school fucking man who said this shit blue collar man who said oh real man doesn't like okay cool you're trying to do something different bro and and the truth of the matter is those people are fucking miserable nobody likes them they don't have friends they walk around grumpy all the time they walk around being kind of dicks you know no like you know it's like the mother fucker you meet we all know the type hey man what's up how you doing well living the dream I'm sorry all right well fuck off then you know like you know I mean that that's the truth so like dude you got to change your frame man and the cool thing is is once you start treating people like that not only are you have more fun and you're happy or more fulfilled but you're way more successful because those people want to help you you don't have saying bro winning is a team fucking sport okay even when it's not a team sport it's a team sport tennis team sport or no yes coaches travel organization trainers recovery team sport race car driving individual or team sport massive teams that's right you've seen it up first hand okay there are people the ones people don't fucking think like that okay there is not anything out here that you could win at a high level on your own it's impossible nothing I can't think of anything fucking you oh you're an accomplished author okay well who added the book who marketed the book who did this probably yeah it's team yeah it's always team bro you can't win without it all right so bro humble yourself like for real realize that you you can you're not weak you're
