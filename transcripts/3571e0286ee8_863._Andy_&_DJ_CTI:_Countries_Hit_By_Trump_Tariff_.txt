Yeah Um, and if you guys want to see any of these articles pictures links videos go to Andy for seller.com You guys can find them link there So nice of shit, too. Yeah, you're saying. I mean I popped open the screen and free. Yeah, buy some energy drinks. Yeah, protein sticks those meat sticks get yoked Join the revolution I'm putting a hole in the drywall. Yeah, what difference does it make? Just go fucking crazy and then you'll have enough energy to patch it. Yeah You're learning new skill. That's what we always talk about Sometimes you got a break sheet on purpose just figure out how to fix it It is what it is man. Yeah, that's what it is Well, let's get into our cruise man. We got some hell of the headlines tariffs little update like I said we had a show just yesterday covering some of this but Update apparently we're getting some people that are starting to buck the whip now when it comes to this economic situation in the country Some countries targeted by Trump tear of seeking negotiations China says no winners in trade war. Yeah, well, they've been winning. They've been killing it. Yeah They've been they've been crushing it. So somebody's been fucking winning. Yeah You know I'm saying But be a world leaders across the globe are reacting to president Donald Trump's liberation day tariff announcements With some expressing disappointment and others making threats on Wednesday President announced a baseline tariff of 10% on imports in addition to reciprocal tariffs based on what each nation imposes on us Good Trump believes these tariffs will incentivize foreign investment in the US and spurred domestic growth Um now A lot of people like some people are kind of pissed off other people want to want to you know Now they're calling for meetings and sit down to try to fix this after they've been leaching off Fucking American people for the last god knows how long European Commission president Ursula Von Derleyen Called the tariffs a quote major blow to the world economy Von Derleyen said in the statement that there would be quote-unquote countermeasures Though she did not specify what they would entail meanwhile China's foreign ministry said that quote There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars according to the AP um We got Mike Pence because you know here's the other thing. Talk about stuff getting more expensive for American people right how much more Right if that is the route that we go and things just do you know get more expensive and in the countries don't Just you know take the tariffs away, right This headline reads the eye popping amount Trump's terrorists will cost each American family revealed Now this full disclosure. This is from Mike Pence Okay, I love Trump clearly fucking loves this guy. Yeah, right Definitely a patriot American first guy. Yeah, definitely he'll give you an unbiased Account on a Trump for sure. Yeah But yeah, the group founded by former vice president Mike Pence estimates the plan will cost American families more than 3500 a year That's the rough estimates The analysis noted the price tag would easily erase three years worth of pay raises from those families It also found that major purchases such as a new home or car could cost family $7,000 more I mean like you mean you mean 7,000 more instead of the double that was created by all the money that they printed in the last four years That's what I was doing like what's the difference between that like I mean it's look It's not good that anything goes up But that's a ridiculous argument coming from what we just went through Coming from a ridiculous man. I agree I mean, I some of the the tariffs to put in now. It's also important to to note here too these reciprocal tariffs There it's a discounted reciprocal tariff, right? And it's literally just put in to actually balance out the effect of because You know, we still tariffs some of their other shit anyway, so it's it kind of balances everything out, but Trump had a nice chart that came out He displays everybody these are this is just one little screen grab of it, but like you know all in all 67% is what China charges the United States, so we hit them back with 34% of the balance out. Why why would they get why do they get 34 if we get 67? Yeah, I don't I think I think it all the the asterisk says it includes currency manipulation and trade barriers. I mean there's other numbers that goes into that that's what I'm saying from what I was able to understand It's basically like that is the equal amount once you balance everything out is what it comes up to some countries though They are like legitimate equal to equal um And uh, yeah, I mean it's interesting like the UK is 10% so we charge them 10% Um, I think at Brazil 10% to 10% right? So I mean you got that like said some countries are still you know They have pulled out and turned off all of the tariffs on the United States Israel being I think that's I think that's I think that 34% to 67% for China is taking into account that we consume so much Chinese goods That if we raise the same amount it would be unaffordable. Well, that's because we don't have the infrastructure setup That's correct, right? I think that's yeah, that's the key man. It's like We can't just fucking cut everybody off. We don't have to set up yet. Yeah, you know, I'm saying but like let's get that shit set up Yeah, cut everybody the fuck off. Yeah, fuck them It is right here. It is what it is. I am Also saw this I wanted to address this down because I saw some comments people told my oh you know japan You know they do that because you know we get all the rice we don't produce rice here in the United States at fun fact for you guys do a little research Um, Japan's not even the top five for rice production just to be clear. Okay, China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia Japan doesn't even crack top five they actually buy More rice and they import that shit into the japan and then send that shit to us just to be very very clear here Okay, we have been getting bamboos with it and fuck that you fucked a lot of people won't Can they won't allow our food to go over there because it's so chemically altered 100% which is the whole another piece of the fucking equation too Um a lot of countries won't even take our food that we grow because of how we grow it Yeah, so I mean, it's that you know just a little fun fact for you there Um and other news got a little last little uh little change up here now this one Kind of shocked me a little bit. Did you see that um Eric Adams may Eric Adams? He's dropping out of the democratic democratic primary He's gonna be running as an independent. He's completely after the Democrat party. I'm not surprised by that I'm not I'm not but I will say honestly I didn't I didn't see independent I actually thought he was just running the fucking Republican bro. I really did well I mean that's what stepping step that's what that means yeah I mean what that means is I'm gonna run as a Republican and I don't want to lose everybody that I had You're out the closet but you're not like I'm still gonna suck a dick whistle You know No, no, no, hold on The other way around yeah, right right right right yeah, he's in the closet.

Yeah, I just want to talk about the glizzies I just want to throw that in there It wouldn't be a proper show if we didn't I got to have glizzies bro. You got to have them But uh, but yeah, sir Eric Adams announced Thursday He will that he will not seek the democratic nomination for mayor instead pushing all his chips in on a long shot run as an independent candidate Well, his honor dropped the bombshell news in a campaign video announcement just one day After a federal judge killed his corruption case for good quote more than 25,000 New Yorkers signed my democratic primary petition But the dismissal of the bogus case against me dragged on too long making it impossible To mount a primary campaign while these false accusations were held over me Adam said in the six-minute spiel Quote, but I'm not a quitter. I'm a New Yorker. He continued And that's why today although I am still a Democrat. I'm announcing that I will forego the democratic primary for mayor And appeal directly to all new Yorkers as an independent candidate for the general election so Yeah, I mean, we'll see it'll be interesting man um We'll see what happens.

It was democratic in nature all right now the previous The previous mascot they were the Indians okay And that you know, okay, you can't you know can't do the Indians so we got to change it and so they voted now moss argues Mars Moss argues That the options chosen so these were the final six I guess it was green machine Bears owls bulldogs and eagles And that none of those were members of an identifiable or generally perceived protected class like the Spartans he says Spartans are the identifiable and generally perceived protected classes of white non-Hispanic and race white and color Greek and national origin and Spartan or Greek and ethnic ethnicity the complaint states Um Here's here's the crazy piece Okay, like it doesn't get more fucking stupid than that um He's not new to this okay school administrators sewing over white mascot.

No, you know what the red skins are saying bro Those those Indians are bad motherfuckers, bro. They're warriors And that's what most of the Native American population thinks and by the way if you go research who the logo was actually based upon It was based upon a chief that was a known Savage ass warrior. All right, and like dude. I don't know maybe maybe it's different for me, but I would think that's cool. Yeah, no, but let's replace it with you know the people that killed him Yeah, like commanders that makes it yeah, that makes a lot of sense You know, I'm saying like it makes sense.

This is starting to pick up a lot of steam going viral today Um, let's check it out Women's men's we ever played the video of Jasmine Crockett. Yeah, we played it. Oh, yeah Yeah, oh yeah, but didn't she go on like a real long rant. Yeah, I ain't got time for that. Yeah, she went on like a four-minute rant about bullshit Don't shit. Yeah, I saw her head doing all this shit on Instagram. You know that shit, you know Oh, I know it. I know it, you know, and that she's doing that and then I looked at the time it said four minutes I said no Yeah, man You know you're a trouble when the head starts moving like that. You know, you know, I know you know Link twice Man, you're a trouble I'm gonna call you to bar make sure you're alright. Hey man, listen, that's why it's important. We you know couch shopping I made sure it was good. Yeah, we're good Well, it's nothing to this third headline man. We got a Women's fencer Takes a knee and protest refuses to face trans opponent. This is a man This is fucking great. Is it this is great? Like I like to see it. Let's check it out So yeah, women's fencer Stephanie Turner refused a match against a transgender opponent at the cherry blossom open in Maryland this past weekend opting to take a knee instead when Turner learned that she would be facing off against transgender fencer Redmond Sullivan she wanted her protest to be caught on video and decided to take a knee just before the match began She already had participated And warm ups and completed in four bouts that day and let's take a look. I got the video here Stephanie's on the right the dudes on the left Now she's selling the refs are like I'm not doing that that's a dude You Yeah, so she stopped She did an interview she spoke with Fox news online. It's important to remember she was ejected from the tournament and expelled from the facility for doing that Yeah, 100% Speaking with Fox news Turner said USA fencing has failed to listen to women's views on trans athletes participating in their sport quote, I knew what I had to do because USA fencing had not been listening to women's objections regarding its gender eligibility Policy Turner said I took a knee immediately at that point Redmond was under the impression that I was going to start fencing so when I took the knee I look at the ref and said I'm sorry. I cannot do this. I am a woman and this is a man And this is a woman's tournament. I will not fence this individual and You know the society has moved it's the temperatures changed bro and people are not fucking with it Martina I've got to love Lovah Fuming after who that is. Yeah, she's like a big tennis champion. Yeah, yeah, never to roller. Yeah, bro She's fucking badass. Yeah, I butchered a name. I'm sorry, but yeah, she's badass We have she I mean she jumped in on this conversation She tweeted this out saying this is what happens when female athletes protest Anyone here still thinks this is fair I am fuming and shame on at USA fencing shame on you for doing this how dare you throw women under the dirt gender bullshit bus I mean where were you guys when Dudes were swimming in pools, right? I'm glad the temperature's changed, but It's definitely changed. I mean, that's good, but it's it's an isn't it embarrassing isn't it embarrassing that This is even a discussion. Yeah, dude. It is it's fucking sad and what's even worse is like I mean Because it's sad the word of day and age where we have to like reiterate and put in extra You know executive orders and fucking legislation to fucking talk about commonsense shit. It's sad It's a you know, but temperatures changing now. I'm gonna show this article Because this is how the left responds like there's still trying to fume these fucking flames Which have been I've been hearing sit. I don't know what the article says, but what I have been hearing is to this argument or observing online Is them saying oh you're you're gonna bring in the less than 1% of the yeah because you want to make rules for less than 1% of the population Right, you want less than 1% of the population to dictate the entire culture of society So yes, we are worried about less than 1% of the population because that's who we're catering to in all of these things Okay, we're allowing men and women's bathrooms. We're allowing transgender quote-unquote drag queens Etc etc etc to read perverted books to our children and we're recategorizing pedophiles as minor attractive people and we are Allowing all of these things under the understanding that this is a very small percentage of society. So yes We are concerned with that and we are going to make a big deal about that You know she received a black card for refusing to compete against the man. Yeah, I mean it was expelled from the USA fencing event I mean it's it's fucking sick, but then you see situations like this a Trans girl was banned from her track team now. She's competing with the boys Okay, it's what the fuck you should be doing. Yeah, it's what he should be doing It's what he should be doing and I just like I hate how they try to like Like I mean do read it read like listen to this article Eliza months she kneeled on her bedroom floor curling her lashes She dabbed glitter into the corners of her eyes and debated whether to tie her hair into one French braid or two She slipped on a green jersey and headed to her first track and field meet and falls church high school She waited for a practice throw in the discus event taking her place in a line of boys Runners passed by on the track coaches hovered nearby Eliza was nervous But in the way that any team might be before their first competition in a new sport listen. He's a dude Go compete with the fucking dudes and and if you know if everything is equal then he should be excelling there too no problem Yeah, I'd be I'd be willing to bet he's gonna be placing somewhere in the bottom fucking total boat It doesn't matter and honestly if a dude wants to dress as a girl and wants to compete with the dudes and kicks all their asses I don't give a shit Where's the pride in that yeah for sure let's go yeah, you want to prove that you're whatever like go beat all the boys Statistically, that's not the case though. I these are dudes who have fucking been you know competing as dudes Who are 400 fucking plays and then they go compete with the fucking girl in their first they tuck their shit Now they're winning national champion not only that bro. It's the same thing that these people are doing in other areas, okay Why is it that when these drag queens Quote unquote go to these schools to read these books why is it never females? uh, you know dressed in Soutons shit. Yeah, why is it never it's always trans females right it's always men pretending to be females advocating for all of this stuff Why is that well? It's because there's a pedophile problem in your little community that you all want to Fuckin look past and everybody else in the world could see it and you could see it too, but you're making excuses for it Yeah, so let's call what it is what it is. I mean, the strikes me Yeah It's stupid you don't say but then like and they get outraged like they get you know, I saw this other headline I think this is from NBC Trump administration acts is more than 125 million dollars and LG HDTV televisions uh health funding upending research field well listen listen You can give me like 20 bucks for me to tell you the cut in your dick offing on me good for you in the long run Because essentially what they're cutting now you don't need fucking years and Mill hundreds of millions of dollars look man to tell you there's not gonna be a sucks for like just every first of all Let's acknowledge this Most gay people and the vast majority of gay people are just normal fucking people Okay, they they they want to be left alone. They don't want to be fucked with yeah They want the same benefits that everybody else gets and everybody agreed to that. Mm-hmm and the argument against that was We don't want now when that happened Most people were for it. I was for it year for it. Everybody else everybody with a fair and common sense mindset Was generally for it. They're like yeah, what fucking difference does it affect me? Yeah, right the critics of it They warned us bro. They they said they said the next thing is gonna be you know, they want special treatment and the next thing is gonna be You know, they want to read their books to your kids and they want to put their education curriculum into you know Elementary schools and this and that and I was told that by someone who's very I'm very close with Um back then and I remember getting an argument. I'm like bro. That is such an absurd way to look at it And here we are here we are, man, and you know, though all those harsh critics Of that aren't now being proven right and you know, it's good to see The gay community by and large condemn Uh, you know, this crazy shit, but like dude it needs to be more. It needs to be more because it it's the reason that these people are allowed to pretend to be women and dance like strippers in front of people's kids and read them books about second dicks and shit is because they know that's gonna result in anti gay sediment and it's gonna cause division and and so While we have to call these things out for what they are we also have to be very careful To not generalize entire groups of people into this You know what I mean? I'm not for sure. I mean because there are people out there that are trying to fight it You know, I'm saying like this most recent case Dylan with all of this crazy stuff. It's actually local to us man gazing in trimmers. We've had We've had Becky on many times. She's a huge proponent of that one of the founding members You know, but they just they just brought something out This past week Gazing in scrimmers on Instagram said today one of our members attended a family friendly drag show at tropical lacours In St. Louis she witnessed young kids hand money to a half-naked Gyrating drag queen while their mother watched and recorded them with the glee Does this seem family friendly to you? Check the video out I What would happen? What would happen if I was to take your little girls to an actual strip club? What would happen to me? You get charged. Depimation of a minor, they just charge to leave the kids in McDonald's. I mean, fuck. It would be a problem. I mean, that should be what we would have with law. Yeah. Would you have a problem with that? Fuck yeah. I'd have a problem with that. So, how do we not, how does the law not see this the same way? You know what really sucks? Dude, by the way, let's point out, what's the demographic there? Is your people ending? No, it is, but what demographic is it? It's all lower middle upper middle class white people, brunchers. I mean, I see a Canadian goose jacket in there. Yeah, I mean, they're doing good liberals. Yeah. Well, it seems to be a common theme. Yeah. A common denominator here. There is a common denominator between the activism of one particular group of people who push all of this crazy shit. We talk about it all the time on the show. Bro, you know what's crazy? Like, here's the part they really sucks, right? How is that okay? Dude, it's not. Bro, that makes me sick. Bro, here's the thing. You know what? Full disclosure here, bro. I love traps. They're actual products. Listen, man, I was in Springfield, Missouri when they started that. You had to try, okay. Fuck yeah. They started it right down there in downtown Springfield. It's an amazing place. Bro, and I love, listen, I am a sucker for boozy slushies. Yeah, okay. I fucking love them. I used to go to traps quite a bit. I knew there was, you know, there was a problem. Like, I didn't give a shit because the product was that good. Look, man, I wish I would have walked in on this shit while this was going on. Because it would have been a problem. There would have been a massive problem. I just, you know, look, dude. And they've gotten some backlash online. Good. But here's the problem. Here's the problem, man. They put out an announcement, okay? Important announcement. As of today, we will no longer allow anyone under 21 years of age in the bar, even for food. You can order tacos at Trap's on DoorDash. You will be asked to produce an ID at the door. Thank you, management. Yeah, sounds good, right? But it's not because they got kids in there. It's not because they're doing drag shows with kids. The reasoning was, unfortunately, the actions of a few who have been denied service because they do not have their IDs have ruined it for others. Tacos at Trap's is available in DoorDash and Breets. Yeah, so not because, you know, now they got fucking pedophiles dancing in front of kids. No. Listen, this is creative damage control. That's all it is. Yeah, this is, oh, let's say it like this and handle it this way. And so we don't alienate these people. Now we'll say this, this drag ring. I mean, dude, it's got some nice biceps on it. But listen, bro, I need to check your hard drive. That sounds like you want to check his hard drive with his nice biceps. Damn it, Andy. No, it's a hard driver. He's a big dude. He's a big fucking. I'm still saying they more, he making worse. All right. Bro, this is wrong. It is wrong. And dude, look, it has nothing to do. There's plenty of businesses that, in restaurants and things that I visit, that probably don't have the exact same political views I have. Yeah. That's fine. Yes. Like, there's plenty of really, dude, honestly, the best restaurants are owned by gay people. Let's be real. Dude, they made great food. Yeah. And they're cool as fuck. And they're fun to hang around. But you know what, they don't like, they don't like little kids ruining their reputation right? And parents that, you know what's funny, dude? The people that actually doing this are the enablers. Yeah. They're not even part of the gay community. They're just, they don't want to be the same. They're just the gay community. Correct. That's what it is. And it's causing all this disruption in the gay community. That's interesting to think about. Because it's not even, it's not even gay people doing it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, but I mean, but to be fair, like that drag queen, bro, you come out and you see some fucking kids and bro, I'll stop right there. Get these kids out of here. Yeah. I agree. Okay. Look, dude. Listen, listen, listen, listen. Listen. Listen. Listen. That's what I agree on right now like all morning. You guys Spider absolutely are likely to go underground loose around in several months, and say god they come all the way down there. Right? We never know where that day is. Yeah. Sometimes it happens without you all this time and it's guys who've got some closely detained or has a hell of a personal holiday that needs to be allowed. And yet regularly or urgently I see, my husband Joe and his buddy, everything, and that's how these guys really deal with gay Venice, and while he's president or bar dude and yeah there was drag queens and they fucking danced around the shit but like dude if they you know if they if you didn't want to be fuck with they didn't fuck with you and uh it was all cool and I'd promise you those dudes are not having little kids in their fucking bar doing this shit now maybe things have changed but back then there's no way they would have yeah um I don't know man that's one of the other has to be some account of it that's it like bro and if you're a drag queen and you want to go out and do that shit do it cool but makes kids leave yeah express yourself whatever you got to do you know I'm saying but like but dude but dude dude that shit looks hard to do the question heels and shit like that's gotta be the quest well you're the twinkle toes here bro and it's tucked you know I'm saying that bro that's gotta be hard to do yeah dude look look the the thing is talent yeah well you would know I never tried it um but the thing is man is like and it's just the same thing we said though gay people got a police or own community just it's not okay it's changing the perception of the gay community and a lot of people's eyes it's going to cause anti-gay sediment and I don't think that's fair because I think that you know most gay people are normal everyday people just trying to live their lives and I would say this this is why you don't push and push and push your lifestyle on to other people because eventually they're gonna say fuck it I don't care anymore you know and not everybody's gay bro in fact most people are and they don't like the shit jammed on their throat 15 times a year and when when really and everybody else is mine they've said a long time ago like I really don't give a shit if they get married I don't care if they live whatever life they live I don't care it's all good but then you know we got to live with you know an entire month of super gay shit being really being pressed everywhere and then all on top of that how many more holidays are there it's like 50 something other holidays for that community so dude we have to rise above and really understand what the purpose of all this is and the theme of literally all of this that we covered today really is they want us to fight they want us to hate each other and they're allowing certain behaviors to exist so that it will cause that disruption and those behaviors cannot be tolerated by the citizens of those communities so it is it's just right and wrong yes it yeah and and so yeah I mean it is what it is bro it is what is don't belong in the fucking women's pool they don't belong at winning national championships with women they don't belong in women's locker rooms I don't care if they had surge top surgery bottom surgery in between surgery I don't care stay the fuck out leave the women alone go compete with the dudes and if you want to dress like a woman while you're competing with the dudes cool but don't ask the entire world to bend their reality to suit your delusion that's not okay and nobody's own fucking league man huh start your own league there's only be there's gonna be enough people to compete you know they'll just start your own just you can't force that shit you know I'm saying they can force that shit because they have forced that shit when was the law for them to get married 2014 I believe it was before that when were gays allowed to be married legally in every state June 26 2015 2015 all right for 10 years now they already fucked it up I'm sorry no that was my point that was my point it went from just give us equal rights man to all of this crazy shit and it is what it is dude it's crazy man went men belong with men women belong women doesn't matter if you grow your hair out doesn't matter if you get booby implants doesn't matter if you cut off your pp done fucking matter bro if you were born whatever you were born you go in that locker room whatever you were born you you you you do those things with that person if you don't want to do those things with that group of people then don't fucking do those things I mean you would think wouldn't you want to be in that locker room you know I'm saying huh I you're a dude and calling yourself a woman now like well there's a lot of listen to one of these listen let me ask you this no no I'm being fucking dead serious right now it's become a fat in high schools all right if you knew

on a fucking skirt and wear a fucking blouse to school and they're gonna let you go in the women's locker room and see all your the girls naked you see what I'm saying there's a lot of fucking kids that will do that and that's happening you know what that loud count is cool how happened to Virginia yeah where that kid raped that girl and then he went to another school and I believe he did it again you do that shit happens all the time dude it's just not covered by the press okay so you know we need to stop accounting we need to stop accommodating the criminals and start holding them accountable for what they do no matter what race gender they claim or anything else don't matter yeah man guys jumping on this conversation let's know what you guys think down or when we had Riley on she was talking about how that dude he still had it he's still had a dick and he's showering in the girl's shower but naked in front of him that's insane that is insane insane you know man guys let us
