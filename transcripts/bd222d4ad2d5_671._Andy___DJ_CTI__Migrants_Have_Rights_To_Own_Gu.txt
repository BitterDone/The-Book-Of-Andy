What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the realist thing about the show. Alright, other times we're going to have other sorts of shows shows within the show so to speak. Alright, we have Q&A app that's where you submit questions and we give you the answers. Now you can submit your questions a couple different ways the first way is guys you can email those questions into ask Andy at Andy for selling the dot com or you go on YouTube right there on the Q&A app episode and drop your question in the comments and we'll get some from there as well. Other times we're going to have real talk real talk just five 20 minutes and me giving you some real talk and then we have 75 hard versus that's where people who have completed the 75 hard program come on the show we talk about how their life was before how their life is now how they took control of their dumpster fire and turn it into a success story. Now you can do the same right if you're interested in the 75 hard program which is the initial phase of the live hard program you can get it for free an episode 208 on the audio feed it's not on YouTube that was before we started doing YouTube. So go get it for free if you want the book there's a book called the book on mental toughness available on my website Andy for sell a dot com which outlines the entire live hard program plus 10 chapters on mental toughness how to cultivate it why it's important why you need it what it can do for you and then a bunch of case studies on very famous people and how they use mental toughness to make themselves famous so you would enjoy reading about them. So we have this thing on the show we call the fee when you say pay the fee that means share the show right you're going to notice we don't run ads on the show we're probably only podcast of any significant size in the world that doesn't take outside ad revenue money I pay for the show myself because I don't want to be told what to do and what not to do by some other people who are paying me to say some shit about the product which I probably don't even fucking use in the first place so I avoid that whole thing I fund the show myself and I ask very simply that you know you do your part all right we talk about real shit on the show we get shadow ban and throttle and censored as hard as anybody else out there probably harder than most people out there and we don't get the word out unless you share the show so exchange for not filling your ears full of 30 minutes of ads per episode I asked that you please share the show and that's what mean we say pay the fee so don't be a hoe share the show all right what's up man I a little nervous right there at the start what fucking you know Joe reached in his book bag real quick oh yeah yeah we're having another another school shooting we cool Joe like shit Joe's finally had enough and this was the day that Joe snapped no man what's going on though nothing dude just doing a thing hmm so with you not not much man you know you know just getting it done yeah little Wednesday release action yeah yeah yeah we we went to record an episode yesterday just didn't go very well I was in a mood hmm let's leave it at that yeah I wasn't worth releasing with the mood I was in probably would have set the world off I was it was just wasn't good yeah I thought that was great some yeah probably people probably would have loved it it's just I wouldn't have loved it it's fair you know it happens but look I get tired of talking about some of this shit sometimes and like some of the shit so ridiculous that it's like what are we talking about like common sense is completely left the building yeah and we're dealing with what I think really isn't a lot of it isn't even real you know we're dealing with the propagation and the propping up of narratives that don't represent real people in real life you don't go out in the streets and see all this crazy shit for the most part in terms of the social initiatives and the political correctness and the you know all the shit that's shoved down our throats every day the division you don't you don't walk down the street and feel the division you see that in a little bit of areas across the country but in reality most people are cool and like I want people to be cool people want to be cool and I'm kind of tired of talking about the uncool people and sometimes I get to a point where I think we should do something about the uncool people and I might say things that I probably shouldn't say in public and that's what happened yesterday yeah only in taverns yeah yeah right no cool that's all good well a little Wednesday action for you guys hope you guys are having a great week in this cti let's get to some of our headlines but first I wanted to check in you made a prediction about two weeks ago when this announcement came out about the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson fight and you know we talked about that guys go check that episode out right here go check that out but the prediction that you made I guess kind of like foreshadow when you made you say the Jake Paul needed to be careful about poking the fucking beast well he's poking the beast he's poking it is he now I don't know if this is just like you know the pre-fight you know drama build up you know but like an appearance he he's poking it right it was not into this little bit a couple things have come out about the Mike Tyson fight so the purses now out they've released that so Jake saying that he believes that it's going to make about $300 million which if that happens that's fucking insane right like for one single fight event you know almost half a billion dollars man that's a lot of money yeah and we know that is set to be the fight in July 20th at the AT&T stadium in Texas it's going to be aired on Netflix exclusively but according to UFC legend Henry Sajudo am I saying that right according to UFC legend Henry Sahudo Tyson is set to pocket a cool $20 million off of this fight so Huda who dropped a decision to morale down the shilvy at last month's UFC 298 made the claim on his podcast with Kamara Uzman you know now when Tyson fought Roy Jones Roy Jones junior he reportedly made about $10 million off of that fight so we're almost about double of that you know but this poking the beast thing so Tyson put out another workout video I'm not sure if you've seen this when I have a clip here you put this video out here's a clip so we put that that post that puts that video out to which Jake Paul then retweeted that video but the comments saying yes yes I do know he doesn't know he doesn't bro bro selling the fight is that what it is yeah this is just pre-jama she's right and these guys are show man real talk part of it yeah it's all good okay when is it crossed the line when whatever they've agreed to and they get in the ring and Jake hits Mike Tyson with something that doesn't feel what they agreed to I believe that things will change that's what I that's what I believe you think this is going to happen you know look dude Jake's not some sort of bitch like people fucking talk all this shit about Jake like he's like just some like the guys big he's strong he's fast he works as fucking ass off he's a real athlete I've said this every single time he's fought and every single time he's fought he's proven that that's the case so you know I think there's some respect that should be given to what he's been able to do and what he's doing and the kind of person that he is but we're talking about probably the scariest dude ever that's ever boxed in the sport I mean history we're invoking fuck night and the reason he's scary isn't because he's so fast and so good I mean the guys old the reason that he's fucking scary is because he's mentally fucking out there and I think whatever negotiations or whatever you know hey bro we're selling the fight it's all good man you know like all that shit goes out the window the minute that Jake who's a strong dude puts one on this motherfucker we say 80% yeah dude and like I don't know you know I don't know like Jake moves good to Jake strong too but you know my Tyson is my fucking Tyson and he looks like my Tyson he doesn't look that much different than when he was 30 so like you know who knows it's it's you know you got to give respect to Jake for putting this shit together because it's it's it's the most anticipated entertainment event of the entire year no question so it's going to make a fuck ton of money it's going to be talked about by everybody we're talking about it everybody's talking about it and it's awesome yeah so I can't wait to see it I might even try to go to it so did you see the you see the trailer for it they released the Netflix release the trailer here it is you know I mean it was okay yeah it's okay RCTI our day in the life it's okay shorts are better but I mean I get I get it good try if I was on the team I would have thought something cooler a forever just saying yeah yeah they got Keith hey that's what it is think I'm a guy man got well yeah they can do it with that but then he can be yeah man man look dude these guys are this is this is cool I think it's awesome do you see what this one's here what I don't know what that is I missed it at first but then like the second time I watched it I don't know what's he holding what is that I mean I don't shout out the electro magnet you're in some rocky four stuff yeah moon gravity yeah but what is the light I don't know let's just move I don't want to go there but like let's not it's hard not to that's just a guy we think they say that's an assumption yeah all right we'll sweet man we'll see how this I mean what do you think it's gonna happen I think Jake Paul is gonna get knocked the fuck out I think I think he I think it's be lights out bro I I think I think there's no chance I think that Mike Tyson I I don't know I think I think all bets are off the minute he gets even a little bit fucking shook or stunned or fucking upset and the quickest way to upset someone is punching the fucking face you know I'm saying you won when we agreed to 80 I don't even think it has to be an agreement I think whatever they say they're gonna do or whatever I don't think he fucking cares I think it's a really good one when he thought when he fought that other fight that other dude didn't even hit up that's what I'm saying yeah I'm saying I think he was afraid to hit him the whole time like fuck my head this dude is gonna kill me he looks he looks frill yeah Michael looks better now than he looked then too yeah he does yeah he does no just have a little bit of hate on him just a little bit yeah. You know you know I'm produce the Po Explosivearten stand all that that member Mike Tyson bro um patterns what's that's what I have the fight man it's what you've got to watch yeah That's the whole game making people talk about it. Yeah, well, which nobody's better than that nobody's better about creating that than Jake Paul Oh, yeah, no doubt he's a promoter, bro. He knows how to do it. Yeah No, it's how to do it guys tell us what you guys think place your bets down in the in the comments section. Let's know what you guys think What that being said, man? I listen. I think it's incredible what the what those guys have done They get a lot of hate the reality is these are two dudes from Ohio that if fucking figured out the fucking game in a new era They understand how to create Buzz they understand how to market they understand how to create promo they created businesses out of it They're doing very well and the only reason that people hate on them is because they didn't do the shit that they guys are doing That's it. So I think it's fucking cool what they do. That's my opinion. Yeah, yeah guys Let us know down in the comments, but that being said man. Let's get into some of our cruising We got a we got a heavy topic to bring up first. I'm gonna just get this out the way. Let's talk about it It's trying to make some some ripples Throughout social media And we get we got to talk about we got addresses head lot of more reads undocumented immigrants have right to own guns judge rules Let's let's dive into this man. So a judge this month dropped gun charges against an illegal migrant in Illinois Sparking further debate about the rights associated with the second amendment US district court judge Sharon Coleman of the Northern District of Illinois reference lower court rulings and dismissing firearm possession charges against her broto Carbohal Flores who was illegally or Unlawfully in the United States when he possessed a handgun in the little village neighborhood of Chicago on June 1st 2020 quote the court finds that Carbohal Flores is criminal record containing no improper use of a weapon as well as the Nonviolent circumstances of his arrest do not support a finding that he poses a risk to public safety such that he cannot be trusted To use a weapon responsibly and should be deprived of his second amendment right to bear arms and self-defense Coleman who was an was appointed under President Barack Obama wrote in her eight-page ruling file March 8th Carbohal Flores was charged under Title 18 of the US criminal code which legally disallows undocumented individuals to possess firearms and ammunition Quote or to receive any firearm ammunition which has been shipped or transported to in interstate Afford's comment for comments The defendant who contended the firearm was possessed for self-defense and protection of property Quote during a time of documented civil unrest in the spring of 2020 has never been convicted of a felony a violent crime or Crime involving the use of a weapon. I should feel like there's a caveat here in this country He's never been charged or convicted of a crime in this country What's his what's his criminal record where he's from? He's not here legally that's correct. That's a criminal record to begin with well apparently not You know and so the thing is man You know obviously know they're talking about the BLM George Floyd riots and all of that stuff That that was going on during that time You know, and it's just interesting the amount of of Birth wide birth I guess you can call the trying to give these illegal aliens You know while at the same time States are constantly trying to take away Actual American citizens rights. That's right. That's a bear arms. Yeah You got this just coming out out of Colorado Colorado Democrat Secretary of States want state level assault weapons bands. Yeah, isn't that the same secretary of state that wanted to remove Trump from the ballot correct Also correct. Yeah She told how about we just fucking get her out of office and stop dealing with her dumb shit. How about that? Yeah Sounds good to me sounds great to me, you know, I support in assault weapons band in Colorado We can't wait for the federal government to act. Yeah, well, you know what? I can't wait for them to act either because that's when it's time to use the weapons You know and Biden's always calling it man. It's like, you know, the problem here is that this there's a dangerous precedence that's being set You know, I don't know if you saw this I mean the other couple spots on the list. Yeah, okay sweet. At least like to all right You know, but I don't know if you saw this you know Tyson foods They're facing a massive boycott right now Because they just fired 1200 Americans and the release of statement at the same time saying that they would like to employ 42,000 migrants Massive backlash going on right now with Tyson foods who's a massive conglomerate. They own a bunch of different meat brands multi-national food conglomerate And they're laid off an entire town essentially in Iowa You know see we have this stuff's going on You know, and then and then I saw this I'm not sure if you saw this but Elon Musk tweeted this out And he has it pinned to his to his Twitter page And it's already received 32.8 million views at the time of this show Let's watch this clip the Democrat open borders plan to entrench single party rule explained in under two minutes One let the country with untold millions of illegals by land see and air from all over the world Enough to eclipse the populations of 36 individual US states so far Two I prioritize the needs of these millions of non citizens over the needs of the American citizen with free flights buses hotels meals and phones Ensuring their loyalty to the political party that imported them Three keep them in the country at all costs even when they commit violent crime like murder and rape Attack the language used to describe the criminals as opposed to the criminals themselves slander critics as racist Four ensure their privileges are made irrevocable with city and state sanctuary laws that act as population magnets codify permanent status and ensure non-cooperation with ice Five count the non citizens in the census that will determine congressional apportionment in the House of Representatives As of now that would equal 13 extra congressional districts a tremendous amount of electoral power Six wage a massive heavily funded law fair campaign to change state voting laws that legalize mass mail-in ballots No signature verification and no proof of citizenship requirements making it nearly impossible to prove voter fraud Seven lock in the permanent voting majority with campaign promises of lavish benefits and permanent privileges enshrining generational fealty to the Democrat party eight win elections Nine entrenched single party rule has been achieved The best part your tax dollars are paying for it And then it is happening. It's exactly happening. Andy, what do you got on with this? Well, I you know Love to tell you I told you so but I told you so All right, I told you guys this a few years ago I told you that eventually these people would be here in such numbers that they would get preference in the law And that they would have actually be able to squat in your home and when you went on vacation You would come home and there would be people in your house living there and there would be nothing you can do Which is actually happening now We actually have cases of people in other people's homes that cannot be evicted There was one woman up in New York I saw that I just went viral where she tried to remove Migrants from her house and they arrested her Okay So they are getting all the benefits they are getting all this preference and the reason that this is happening is because The people who disagree with it have been total fucking pussies and haven't stood up against it for years and years and years and years and years And now after all the people are here now people are standing up and saying oh, we don't want this Oh, we don't like that. Well, here's a game plan guys You have to kind of look ahead You kind of have to see where are the tides going what they're actually doing and you have to address the things before they do it Now after because now this is a big problem to undo. It's going to be very hard It's going to be very difficult. It's going to be very ugly and it's going to be a difficult thing for us to fix so Yeah, everything in this is happening everything in this is true. This is what's going on and it should concern you and it should Definitely concerned the inner city black communities of America who have called every single person racist Who have pointed out every single thing that the Democrat party has been doing to them for the last 50 years All right, and attacked every single person that's actually tried to help and wake them up and say hey This is what's going on and now that you've actually woken up and these communities have started to to figure out what's going on They're now replacing those communities with these people and so I would be curious how black communities feel About all of these migrants coming in and getting all the benefits that you were promised that you never got and these people just got here Fucking yesterday and they have it Yeah, so look dude um You know imagine you being so Inept and so bad at running your country That Not only can you not win on actual policy issues or strategic strategic decision making You have to move to identity politics and emotional and name calling for years and years and years and then when that stops working Now not only do we uh Not know what to do. We'll just go ahead and replace all the people because you know It's not us. That's the problem the people just don't want to continue to vote for us. So we'll just get new people Like this this is the problem and I I'm actually glad it's happening because it's finally waking people up to what's going on It's finally waking people up to the the fact that these people in Washington DC Do not serve our interest as citizens in any capacity whatsoever and when we say that Two years ago four years ago people are like all your conspiracy theorists You're your paranoid you're hyper vigilant yeah, and you know what had you listened to me back then we wouldn't be here Okay, but you guys want to fucking stick your head in the sand and you want to pretend like this isn't happening And you want to pretend like you know you want to you like people don't even want to share Information because they're afraid they've been abused for so long cancelled for so long called names for so long That now that this stuff is blatant in their face. They're afraid to even say anything about it because They're afraid to get called a name these people are going to take your shit Okay, they're gonna take your jobs. They're gonna take your careers They're gonna take your fucking houses and they're gonna be shit you can do about it And you're gonna wish when you come home and there's a migrant family living in your house That is armed that says hey get the fuck out of your own house and you can't do shit about it You're gonna wish you had stood up years ago when this was pointed out by myself and many other people So that's where we're at that's what I think and you know when it comes to the Tyson foods thing You know there's two lessons here one yeah, you shouldn't be buying shit from Tyson foods ever again Okay, and two The American workforce is has become lazy as fuck and the reason that this is happening is because the American workforce has Unionized demanded wages that are not compatible with the actual structure of how a business operates because they don't understand the cost of good sold tax liabilities all the things that go into operating a business the average employee that is unionized believes that companies make Exorbit amounts of money and they can just pay every single person $500,000 a year to show the fuck up and not do anything You're so not true no, we're in a this is the free market Okay, so this is a lesson for employees too If you don't produce and you're not good you are not guaranteed shit because yeah, you might be able to unionize You might be able to get a group of people to say we demand this but eventually the company's gonna figure out how to say Fuck these people and they're gonna put people in that will actually work for a regular wage and actually produce a good This is free market capitalism all of you guys who fucking hate capitalism and say this and that and this Well, that's what you're seeing here. You're seeing a company who's saying we can't afford to pay these people They don't produce enough. We can't afford to pay these people. They will produce enough and they'll be grateful for the opportunity So from their perspective, that's why they're doing it. Is it right? No, but it's also not right for the American worker to demand wages that a company can't pay Just so they can show up to work and not produce. So there's two sides of that coin and you know There's ethical entrepreneurship and there's unethical entrepreneurship and I think that falls into the category of unethical But to say that the American you know mentality around work and the entitlement around work doesn't affect these decisions This is what you get when you demand 15 20 dollar minimum wage to work at fucking McDonald's You know what McDonald's is doing oh, they're automating their entire store. So they don't have to deal with none of you fuckers Okay, McDonald's wasn't designed to be a fucking career It's designed to be a out of high school job or even a high school job that you use to make a little money To get started in life and you know what for some people it can be a career But it's not going to be this ultra lucrative career that there's a delusion in this country about What you deserve? Okay, you deserve A fair exchange for the value you provide making a fucking cheeseburger at McDonald's is not valuable work Okay, this is why you have to invest in yourself. This is why you have to learn skills This is why you have to be great because if you're great you can do high-value things which demand a high wage The average person doesn't get this and their minds has been polluted by this democrat bullshit that goes out the boundaries Outside of the boundaries of mathematical realities in business So you know expect more of this unless you know Americans start to figure out But see Americans are buying into this works perfectly because What's happening is the working class Americans are buying into the communist propaganda about Dude you can get on universal basic income and just stay home and not work right and they're willing to take Whatever that is thinking that it's going to be livable. It's not going to be livable. You're going to starve all right But they've got those people Said okay, fuck it the companies know they need workers to fucking compete So they're like well fuck it will hire the migrants So right now people are leaving their careers and going on government assistance and government aid while the same companies are then Backfilling with people who are actually going to work hard and due to over the course of the next 20 30 years That's going to create a new demographic class of people the migrants who are working hard. They're going to earn a better place in life They're going to become more successful. They'll become the new middle class and the old middle class Who didn't want to work for less than $20 an hour McDonald's is going to be fucking starving? And that's what we're doing. We're seeing an exchange I mean it's a flip. Yeah, it's a flip. That's what's going to happen And dude, you know, and you can't talk to people about it because they'll argue with you Oh, you don't fucking think that somebody should be making $20 working in them. No, I don't know You're making a fucking shitty ass cheeseburger, bro You're not conquering the world. You're not splitting an atom. You're not solving a real problem Yeah, this is you're doing the kitchen You're doing the bare minimum and you expect something livable. That's not how this works You don't get to live by just existing man. That's not how the fucking world works It's never worked that way not for a thousand fucking years So you think that because you think that would be more fair that all the sudden the world's going to adjust Because you this little speck of dust Things that it would be more fair to be this way. It's not that way. It's never going to be that way It's never been that way in the past and it's never going to be that way in the future And what we have here is a very real scenario of people who are willing to work who are willing to take jobs And we have people who are unwilling to work and unwilling to take jobs And in the history of earth the people who are willing to work and willing to take jobs are the ones that prosper and the other people starve This is the reality of life It's always been that way and here we are It's getting worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and yet at the end of that video They're correct your tax dollars are paying for it So not only are you being replaced you're paying Half of your money to replace yourself and make yourself irrelevant. So Sit with that for a minute because it's your fault It's your fault for staying quiet It's your fault for sitting there and not saying anything It's your fault for watching this happen and never speaking up And if you wanted to change you better start with all that shit right now because the window of our ability to fix the problem is closing And it's closing fast and for us to fix this problem and And any real way for real It's going to take like legitimately a very difficult ugly mass deportation event that will get violent Because now they're letting these people have guns You're fucking insane and that's a whole another conversation Okay, so you're telling me By saying that an illegal immigrant who is not a citizen is protected by The Constitution of the United States of America, but our own citizens aren't Okay, so what is that creating? Well, that's creating a situation of complete destabilization of our country Because if some laws apply to some people and some laws apply to other people How do we know which laws apply to which people which creates a lawless society and a selective prosecution environment for the government Which means they can come to your door for any reason what so ever because everybody will be breaking the law And they will say it's okay that you it's okay that you did it. It's okay that you did it You're going to fucking jail and that's what we'll end up with and that's what we're gonna end up with That's kind of what we got already And it's gonna get worse and worse and worse because people are too fucking afraid to stand up and say Anything or demand anything y'all a call these people about tiktok you'll blow their phones up You'll say no fucking don't ban tiktok you you'll care about that But what will you do for this? Oh, how many calls if you guys made to your congress people about this? Yeah, I mean listen What people all gotta go They're setting very dangerous president. Yeah, and and dude do you know that first dominoes? I would start it bro brother Do you do you think that people who are afraid to speak up have the courage to stand up against these people when they come to their neighborhoods? Fuck no, that's what I'm saying. No. Yeah, they're not prepared bro. They listen the They're not prepared. Well, here's what I can say at the end of the day These people will not fuck up my life one fucking out Not one ounce because I will handle my fucking life and I will handle it appropriately And all of you that are timid and you're afraid and you're meek and you're scared when these people come to your neighborhood You ain't gonna do shit Because you think this is all fake you think this is overblown you think this is not coming for you It's coming for you and The the migrant the military age migrants that have come across over the last four years outnumber our military six to one Military age males to our American military legal migrants six to one six to one And you think this isn't something this isn't a big deal I was watching I was watching a bill burr last night who I think is one of the greatest fucking comedians in the world All right, but I watched this stand up of his from 2015 or 16 I can't remember what it was and he gets into his jokes right away And the first thing he starts talking about is laughing about Trump because he's a racist And he wants to build a wall for go watch it. It's on Netflix. It's from 2015 or 16 And I love bill burr. I think he's fucking hilarious, dude But he was he was just like everybody else He was making fun of Trump calling him a racist saying, you know This guy's this guy wants to build a fucking wall. What a piece of shit like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah oh really How that working off yeah, that's right. How's that working out for all you fucks Who fucking busted this dude's balls and didn't allow him to do that what what would our we wouldn't even be This is why it's almost good that it's happening because now these people are realizing how fucking stupid they actually are You're the stupid ones you guys who stand up and call everybody else stupid for thinking this shit is real You're the stupid ones Because it is real and it is happening and it's going to affect you And it's going to affect your country and most of all it's going to affect your children Because you're a weak person and you fail to stand up for what's right and now your children are going to have to fucking deal with it I can't think of a bigger fucking failure than that in life And I will look back on this time and say you know what bro We may not have won. I don't know what's going to happen We may not have won we may not have got our way But you and me and our fucking people the real motherfuckers we stood for the truth the entire fucking time and did not bend on it And I'm proud of that yeah Not everybody's going to be able to say that So that's my take on it dude. Yeah, I think it's super dangerous I have people have no idea what the fuck is going on and how bad this is going to be and if Trump does get in which you better pray That he fucking does you better fucking pray that he does And they start deporting these people the same people are going to come back out and look how fucking racist Do do do no Fuck these people they don't belong here if they really want to come here They can leave and they can come back through the proper channels and we'll give them a big ass hug when they get here We make sure they're not ship bags. They're not gang members. They're not criminals. They're not a cartel member They're not a member of organized crime. They're not they're not a blight or a fucking liability to society will give them a big hug would say welcome to America Just like we all got when we came here. Here's a hot dog in the boat. That's right bro And you could be part of our crew. Yeah, but right now you ate part of our crew and you got to go back out the door And come in the right way and people are not going to like that no, but it needs to happen And and I don't even know that Trump will do it the right way because you know when all the pressure came out about COVID Trump folded on it Real talk and I can understand because that's immense pressure He didn't have he was being lied to lots of shit. I give him a pass there But here's the reality um, this is gonna take some you can he still continues to talk about the fucking vaccine being a victory Which is not so I'm not sure what I think about Trump. I don't know if he'll actually do this It makes me scared because like dude. He says he's gonna do a lot of shit that he didn't do He say he's gonna put Hillary and jail. He said he's gonna do you know drain the swamp. You didn't drain the swamp We're all dealing with it now.

They're causing massive fucking problems They're gonna turn the country into a third world country because the infrastructure of our country simply cannot support it The physical and the economic infrastructure cannot support these fucking people Okay, and bro I still stand by what they're I think they're pushing us intentionally towards a in An on our soil war between the migrants and the citizens. That's what I believe the big quote-unquote 2024 surprise is gonna be like how COVID was the 2020? Yeah, I think that's where we're going with this. Yeah, that'll be the big thing I get to it. They tried it with the rampant it up. Bro, they tried it with the fucking wars nobody bought on the wars Okay, they tried it with Ukraine nobody wants to go to fucking Ukraine. They're still trying it with Ukraine So they can longer more money, right? Let's just be real They tried it in the Middle East All the fucking progressive leftists turned on the people that we're trying to get everybody to go to war Which they weren't counting on that was a fucking disaster.

So now those didn't work the pandemic remember they tried last September They tried to get the pandemic going again and people like fuck that we're not doing that So we're like, oh, that's not gonna work. Okay, what will work? All right. Let's just keep important everybody and let them come across And then we'll give them guns. There's no leader coming in on a white horse to save the day. It's not happening Not one person can fix this You know, I had a conversation with a couple buddies of mine and they said well, I said why are people doing it? tolerating this well, they lack leadership know the fuck they know there's been plenty of leadership People have refused to join up and say it and share and and even think they're relevant so It's not lack of leadership because you're the leader of your own little community of your own family It's only lack of leadership that's happening is coming from the individual and they're refusing to lead themselves to a solution Yeah, that's real shit man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments Let us know what you guys think that being said, man. Let's head over to the comments. Let's check this coming out This comes from at peace on earth Uh, they say I literally have no words for how thankful and appreciative I am that this podcast exists This content is what I listen to doing workout on repeat beats any garbage music. That's right Drake Huh, what? That's fucked up I like Drake. I'm just teasing. I like drape everybody likes Drake. Yeah now Future is trash Yeah, no, we appreciate it though, man. We do appreciate we know you guys are out there Um, but we do need to get more active guys like this this message is important to things We talk about in the shows important. We are waiting for an organization to come along so they can join or a leader to come through and say I'm starting the revolution join me. That's not what's going to fix the problem What's going to fix the problem is every single individual deciding that they are the leader of their little tribe and leading their little tribe with the same messaging and the standard of living okay, how are you living? How are you behaving? Are you falling into the narrative? Are you in the matrix? Are you a fat? uninformed lazy apathetic human being that doesn't contribute to anything positive and you just consume data consume food consume pharmaceuticals consume consume consume because if so you're their fucking hero That's what they want. So how are you living? I see a lot of people saying I what can I do and then they're 350 fucking pals are not making any money. They're consuming bullshit on the internet every day They're doing mindless activities. The look at I do. What do you mean? What can you do you're not even doing anything? You can do a lot. I have a lot you can fix your own shit and everybody's gonna follow the standard goes up The standard in your household goes up the neighbors household goes up the community goes up People have been indoctrinated believe that they are so powerless and so irrelevant that they aren't even willing or even able to recognize the own importance of their individual influence in what's going on This is a culture war the culture has to change for everything to change Do you really think your 350 pound fat ass can go out and run a fucking down the street with an AR and do anything? Bro, you can't even get to the driveway without being out of gas You see what I'm saying? So like let's quit the delusions What could I do? Well, you could get your own shit together and start with that that solves a lot You can also use your voice have you ever thought about why they have things like political correctness and cancel culture and Silent majority and all of this shit that they put out here Oh, it's to keep you quiet Why do they in the censorship that's out here? Why do they want to keep you quiet? Have you ever thought about that? You're over here saying oh, it doesn't matter what I say These motherfuckers are spending trillions of dollars to keep you quiet to keep you from Why are they spending trillions of dollars to keep you quiet and you're over here saying my words don't matter What the fuck is wrong with you? You can't fucking see what's going on They're scared to death of your words. They're scared to death of you contributing. They're scared to death of you becoming a high level high Standard excellent human being they are scared to death. That is why they pour all their energy into keeping you suppressed And we'll do anything no motherfucker. You can you choose not to It's real shit, man. The guys is get back to this cruise head on number two Hey, let them two reads now now This is this is happening, but there's been some updates on this so I'm sure everybody's seen the Missouri V Biden case That's going on right now. We've got a couple of buddies that are Down in DC fighting a good fight right now But there's been some some updates right so this case is all about the censorship It uncovered the Twitter files right of how our federal government and a few different federal agencies were intentionally Putting their hands inside of these social media companies to affect and change the narratives that were going on both around COVID the elections I mean literally any main narrative that we have As people And they were they were manipulating that so that's what the the basis of this case is about Did you see what judge Jackson said I did about this shit. Yes, holy shit You have the recording. I got the recording man. Well, how about a fucking moron So She got her job because she was a black woman Let me start there. So let's start. No, listen that no it would she got that job was handed to her There's no she no no qualifications. That's a d.i. selection to the supreme 100% And then she's up here trampling over the most fundamental basic the first What what if something's first it's for a reason right the most important Fundamental constitution or right we have as Americans. She just shit all over it. Let's talk about it Um, let's tell her is justice Jackson ripped for worrying about the first amendment hamstringing government Yeah, literally the point Literally the point let's dive into this so social media users were shocked And slightly abused at supreme court justice katana g brown jaxson's comments on the first amendment monday Supreme court heard murthy v mizuri a case challenging the Biden administration's alleged coordination With big tech to censor certain messages the case Stimmed from a lawsuit brought brought by republican led states mizuri and Louisiana That accused high ranking government officials of working with social media companies quote Under the guise of combating misinformation That ultimately led to censoring speech on topics that included Hunter Biden's laptop Cova 19 origins and the efficacy of face mask vaccines you name it that it should be stated before you continue that Topics included hunter Biden's laptop um, that's What what what what what what are the topics on hunter Biden's laptop? Oh you mean Joe Biden Taking money from china to deconstruct the united states of america It's the evidence that we have a compromised leader In the office of the united states of america People don't understand that deep. They think it's oh well fucking hunter widens doing coke so what Well, what i do care about is our highest office taking money from china and then all the sudden We have an invasion of illegals. We have our military equipment all over the world We have our strategic oil at the lowest level fucking ever We have our inflation out of control and we have more money being printed It's ever been hit printed in the history of this country in the last four fucking years We have crime waves we have we have social uh demoralization destabilization by letting grown men who Dress up as women shake their balls and try to little kids. I care about that. Yeah, I care about all that We want to hear yeah, okay, well the strategic thing is to see that that that's all part of the fucking thing right That falls into the category of hunter Biden's laptop right and the important thing behind the two is like the effects that had on The election because that came out right before the election, but then it was all suppressed All right, it was all fact check and they tried to delete it off the internet because people forget that That's what i'm saying like shit came out in October of 2020 right and fucking the new york post got their shit deleted from twitter right and guess who did it? Oh the federal government Isn't that crazy? That's what this case is about you know, and so it's so it's a big deal It's a massive deal Um now as the justice is questioned whether the Biden administration crossed the constitutional line jackson Appear to suggest that such such actions can be justified Quote my biggest concern is that your view has the first amendment ham stringing the federal government and significant ways In the most important time periods. She told the lawyer representing Louisiana, Missouri and private plaintiffs. Here's the clip. Let's watch this Justice Jackson, so my biggest concern is that your view Has the first amendment ham stringing the government in significant ways in the most important time periods Um, I mean what what would you have the government do? I've heard you say a couple times that the government can post its own speech But in my hypothetical You know kids this is not safe. Don't do it Is not going to get it done and so I guess Some might say that the government actually has a duty to take steps to protect the citizens of this country and using to be suggesting that that duty Cannot manifest itself in the government encouraging or even pressuring Platforms to take down harmful information So can you help me because I'm really I'm really worried about that um because you've got the first amendment operating Um in an environment of Threatening circumstances from the government's perspective and you're saying that the government can't interact With the source of those problems And you're on right under similar incident. I guess what I tell you is. Yeah, so let's clip now yo kids Uh, don't do that Right, that's not gonna work. So you know what we'll do. We'll just lie to you and we'll just make shit up and there's nothing you can do about it Nope And if you point out that we're lying Fuck your Instagram fuck your youtube. You're fired. You're fired from your job. You're a conspiracy theorist You belong in jail. You didn't get the vaccine. You belong in a camp and you know what we're doing good Right, that's what she's saying. That's exactly what she's saying. We're we can we we should be able your hamstringing us because we can't force people Through our lies and our propaganda to do what we want them to do and when it's found out that it's not The the whole truth and they see it destroys our narrative and we can't we can't fuck with people anymore Right, that's what she said and like let's be very very clear What are we talking about that they're you know the actual hamstringing going on Um like the censorship of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine being effective therapeutic Yeah, that was deleted off the fucking internet anybody that talked about that or the hunter-by-laptop or the hunter-by-laptop how many lives or the vaccine how many lives Were destroyed how many people died because they couldn't have access to those therapeutics how many people And you and the this fucking lady sits up and has a nervous thing that is hamstringing the federal government They knew that they're a punic work before They didn't want the therapeutic to get out because it would destroy their state of emergency The only way they could have a state of emergency and continue to rob and pillage the economy of the United States And to force this level of compliance was by creating a situation where there was no treatment Which created the state of an emergency Well, there was a treatment that they knew about the entire time and they are pissed because now they're being challenged to not be able to straight up sensor delete And lie to the American public to get their way you this is this is incredibly anti-American and the biggest problem that we have here, dude is that they're treating us like we're stupid fucking children Okay, they know better for they know what this new fucks no all that shit should be on the table our entire government should be declassified Every single secret every single data point every single fucking thing should be on the table And then we decide as citizens what the truth actually is and because they've been lying for so fucking long And creating a false reality for our citizens for so long And they are losing it now they are freaking the fuck out I like what our our Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey what he told Fox News Digital He told them that Jackson was absolutely right about the first amendment restricting the government That's the point he says quote it is hamstringing and it's supposed to the whole purpose of the Constitution is to protect us From the government and the government exists to protect our rights But here the federal government is ignoring our first amendment protections and weaponizing the federal government to silence our voices And she's right it limits what the federal government can and can't do and that's a good thing he added So the Supreme Court is going to decide whether a temporary injunction preventing the White House and executive agency officials from meeting with tech companies About moderating content can remain in place as the case is being litigated. I think it's about it's not They're not they're not even talking. It's not these agencies just meeting With these fucking social media companies. That's not what it is. It is much deeper than that They had a direct portal and access to these fucking agencies to these social media platforms. Elon Musk just revealed this Uh Elon Musk reveals Twitter had FBI portal that although deleted all communications After two weeks Now what's the problem with that if they were doing this and the best interests of why would they have to delete everything They wouldn't they would want to show people why would they delete it? Look what we're doing for you Why would they delete it because it's not in the best interest and they know it's not there's something sinister there Listen to this clip from Elon Musk real quick You know there was uh And this is coming from multiple parts of the government for from the state department the FBI Homeland Security from really Many many parts of the government wasn't just one arm of the government Um There was this FBI portal um that auto deleted all communications after two weeks So we actually don't know what what what what was said there in fact that this tracked me as a FOIA violation freedom of information act violation Um because you shouldn't be able to Delete to auto delete things after two weeks um There was uh, there's a little known agency in the state department called the Global Engagement Center uh, which Uh, most people will never heard of uh, but they they might have been the single worst offender uh because they Uh demanded the suspension of Uh, at one point over 250,000 accounts um, which I think all Twitter largely complied with um but they they they The the the suspension demands were so broad that they accidentally demanded a suspension of a journalist on CNN and And elected connect Canadian politician. It was just Incredibly uh, broadsweath It's much deeper than just fucking meetings Anyway, we got on this i think you hit it perfectly bro. That's it's it's not about they weren't advising They weren't meeting they weren't suggesting they were in control fully of the censorship on all of the social media platforms Mark Zuckerberg tried to talk about this on the Joe Rogan show. Mm-hmm. You know Zuckerberg Comes on the Rogan show and says well, you know the FBI called me and they said this and this and this He didn't reveal the full extent because probably he scared they'll put him in fucking jail and They now are controlling our ability to set the dude. Do you guys not notice which shows a mind gets censored? Do you not notice that when we're still doing it when we talk about um We talk about making money and kicking ass in life, you know, oh no problem fucking here's the traffic. Oh Talk about what's going on in the world what these fuckers are doing. Oh, hey, guess what no traffic for you And it gets worse and worse and worse. How you know These people are shitbags. That's the bottom line and they have forgotten their place They have forgotten what their role is they have now adopted the role that they are in charge and we live in their world Which is the exact opposite? We are in charge and they live in our world and they have forgotten that and we have forgotten that and for us to fix that We are going to have to remind them of that in many different ways and that means whatever the fuck it takes So that's what I think yeah guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think Shout out to Schmidt and Andrew Bailey standing up from Missouri two men that we both personally know who are good men who are actually up there Trying to win trying to win this fight for America. They're actually fighting for us And it's nice to have that and I do appreciate that shut out to those guys man guys So it's what you guys think down in the comments I was that big said let's get over to our third and final headline headline number three You know just a little interesting thing that's coming out of Brazil right now. I'm not sure if you're seeing this That's how long reads Brazil police accused Bolsonaro of fraud and vaccine records Dude isn't it weird how like they're doing the exact same shit in Brazil As they do here bro exact same with with trump is like it's like the exact same storyline. Yeah, it's like the exact same It's like January 8th January 6th yeah right right right right right right It's fucking insane right yeah, so so so Brazil's federal police formally accused former president Yabbal scenario of fraud on his vaccination records opening the door to criminal charges according to a police report seen by Reuters on Tuesday and investigation by the Comptroller General's office had already found that Bolsonaro's vaccination records were falsified To suggest he was vaccinated against COVID-19 in Sao Paulo You know in July of 2021 when he was not in the city Now police found in their report that Bolsonaro could be charged with falsifying data in the country's public health system And forming a criminal organization to evade public health rules One of his former aids Mauro Cede Who was arrested in May in the investigation and released as part of a plea bargain who was was also formally accused in the police report Police found that Cede fraudulently obtained vaccination records for Bolsonaro and his daughter Laura at the request of the then president Uh seeds plea bargain testimony was used as evidence against this former boss Stitches get fucking stitches, bro. Yeah snitches get stitches Fuck you seed Bolsonaro told routers that he had not taken the COVID vaccine Or done anything wrong quote. It's a selective investigation. I'm calm. So at the former president Uh quote the world knows that I didn't take the vaccine Now the police said that fraudulent certificates were issued quote to obtain undue advantages related to the evasion of sanitary rules Established during the pandemic period during his tenure Bolsonaro repeatedly downplayed the importance of immunization and social distancing measures during the pandemic Which killed more than 700,000 people in Brazil? Did it did it kill 700,000 people in Brazil or did 700,000 people that died the year before and died the year before that and died the year before that Die that year too, right and they just assigned it to something else. How many people are dying in Brazil now? Probably 700,000 probably a little bit more with all the vaccines. No. Well, yeah exactly You know what I'm saying bro. It's so insane like people people still Want to argue about like when this fucking COVID shit came out I don't know a week or two ago What was the news that came out that was the big news for the last? Oh, you could just treat it like the flu Yeah, yeah, yeah that when that came out and then you had all these people say That's cuz COVID was so much stronger in the beginning What what happened to the flu during this time genius Where did the flu desk? So your tell like they still don't understand Everything was made up in terms of how they were tracking was COVID a real thing was like were people getting sick Yeah, but they were counting deaths with people who had COVID and the way that they were tracking people who had COVID was by Testing them with a PCR test that had a cycle rate that was abnormally high Intentionally to pick up any virus strand that existed in your body Which gave a false positive test and so these people were dying of other Causes and they were being labeled as COVID deaths that happened the entire time There were lots of people that try to tell you this you didn't listen Then on top of it where did the flu go? So the flu just shows up and says Well fuck covids here. They're gonna do our work. I guess we'll be on vacation. I'll see you guys will be back I see in a couple years So I don't understand how Listen, I have I have a very hard time Understanding how people cannot connect all that data. I just really I like How bro, do you remember the um do you remember the headlines bro? We were connecting that data in March of 2020 Yeah on a fucking show. Yeah. Yeah, bro. Listen, I you know what fucked me up, bro, and I remember I remember a headline that came out. Um, it was a medical examiner. I want to say a Michigan somewhere He said that he had two deceased People come in coming to the morgue. He has to do the autopsy And he said the farm that he got from the hospital is that you know the suspected cause of death was COVID right they two people died from COVID they go to the fucking more right he looks at him Um, and then in his medical examiner report, you know when he's going through this He said it was very very obvious That these two people had in fact died of very very obvious gunshot wounds These people were died from gunshot wounds. Yes, but they the hospital labeled them as COVID deaths now Why? Why would they label them as COVID deaths? Oh It's because the hospitals and the hospital systems were getting paid up to 30,000 dollars per death that they labeled as COVID under the the same emergency authorization like dude How y'all got played How? Yep, well, cause we were conspiracy theorists and they were smarter than us Listen, they weaponized people virtue against them. That's what they did They weaponized people good heart and they're virtue against them Yep, and they're trusting hearts and they're who they believe They're these people as fucking pissed off as I am about how I was treated by those people during that time I still don't hold it against those people because those people Have a reasonable expectation to believe that when Anthony Fauci or some other trusted medical professional Goes on television and says certain things or when an organization like the WHO goes on television It says certain things, okay, and when our government officials go on television say certain things the news certain things that these things Should be true, right that is that is a reasonable expectation From a person who is busy living their life Okay, so if you're living your life and you're working a job and you have kids and you have you know an intentionally hard economic situation from the government meaning they oppressively tax you and make you Like we wouldn't have to work the way we have to work if our government didn't abuse us the way that we are abused People don't think of it like that, but that's the truth so they put these people in these crazy stressful hard to make ends meet situations, okay, so they're already busy with their attention trying to survive over here And then they prayed on the trust that those people should and rightfully have a right to have From their own government and their media sources To not you know Those people aren't gonna question. They don't have the ability to sit down and look at this and connect the dots and do the work This guy has a couple of other guys name you shouldn't have to dig below the surface to figure this out like that's a reasonable expectation But the problem comes in is that when people those people refuse to recognize that you fell for it And those people that you hate that foot like like me and you and the other people who stood up the entire time And took all the fucking arrows from everyone because we were one of the very few people speaking up guys like Ian Smith Tommy Vex a few people in the media who lost their entire these people there was a there was a fucking There was two dozen people that got their fucking lives ruined Because you guys hated them and they were trying to save you and the problem that actually comes into play here is that They're still not recognizing who The actual enemy of them is It is not the people like me who said don't do that here's the data here's the this It was it was the fucking government dude and it was the media and it was all these people that colluded against you And now you're walking around you're seeing all these people fucking fall over dead and have all these complications from vaccines bro have you seen these vaccine posts on Instagram dude Like where someone like like there's pages pages and posts I mean miles long of people who have adverse side effects and dude nobody's given him any press nobody's talking about it And I'm gonna predict this is gonna be my and I already predicted this but this is what's gonna happen So they're not gonna be able to keep this under wraps I think they're intentionally ignoring it right now and then as the election gets closer They're gonna come out and be like study show the vaccine kills people. Oh and by the way Trump did it look here here He's been bragging about it bro. He's been walking into that trap for three fucking years Because the people around him are not as good as he thinks they are Okay, and they're gonna use that trap that trap is coming and Trump's walking right into it And when they reveal data that people got this vaccine and are fucking probably sick as fuck or have a high potential to get sick as fuck And they actually admit that's the truth They're gonna put it all on that dude all of it and he's not doing himself any favors by continuing to talk about how awesome the vaccine is Every time the dude talks about it. He gets destroyed bro read the room Like if you want to critique no seriously if you're on Trump's team and I know a number of you listen to the show, okay What the fuck are you doing You need to come up with a fucking story right now and come out and say hey they fucking fuck to me They gave me bad info we did this and it's them because I could promise you that's what's gonna happen as the election Fucking comes up and and bro I Everybody ruin if I was them. That's the move I pull it would ruin them They're ruining them man. Yeah, cuz people have short memories dude They don't remember the amount of pressure. They don't remember and and and Trump keeps talking about it He keeps bringing it up Dude The ruin them how much you want to bet that happens. Oh, it's happening. They've already started like bro I remember when they started like they did a couple of tip checks on it. You remember that like they pushed out a couple of temperature checks Don't forget you know operation warp speed Trump deserves to credit like they've already started doing Check on the ship in Yeah Won't be good for him guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think How are that being said? Let's get to our final segment of the show as always Thumbs up or dumb as fuck. This is where we bring a headline up to talk about it to get one of those two options Um now I've done some dumb shit in my life This is pretty dumb Let's get into it headline reads bartender serves drink along with a slap to the face she makes $6,000 a night This takes punch drink to a new level Our spring breakers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida are cramming into a local bar for shots and slaps But it's not a bar fight bartender aiana callus whose 26 serves her signature quote hurricane shots at backyard Fort Lauderdale for $30 every night Of the popular party season for $30 a shot.
