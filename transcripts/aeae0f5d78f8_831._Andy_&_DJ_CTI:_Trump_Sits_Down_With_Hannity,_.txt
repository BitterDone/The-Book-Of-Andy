People get a little mad. It's not media. No, no, no, because everybody has come to their senses except the literally mentally ill people. I feel like it's the same amount of people that are mad that were mad in like 2020. You know what I think? You know what I'm saying? Fuck them. Yeah, I agree. I agree. I like seeing them mad. Yeah. Well, you know what I figured out about myself. I've always tried to be this nice person and make everybody like me and I'm just figured out I'm a natural villain. I am. It's easier for me to be the villain. People want to fucking hate me. Yeah. So I'll fucking fuck you. You enjoy watching paintings. I've just except I've scepted it now. Yeah. Bro, you know what I said? People fucking always trying to tear me down. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck with me and shit. Now I'm just like, you know what? I get it. Fuck you. Bro, when I was younger, you know, like those like 2 a.m. commercials and shit would come on when like the fee that children commercials come on. I laugh. You know, since I kind of know where you coming from. What were you laugh about? Like the fact that I had food. Dude, that's fucked up. That's fucking wrong. You just said the same thing. No, I didn't. I said I'm just accepting that I'm the villain. I was actually going to be it. I know. I'm saying, but like you get like that's actual village. I'm just saying I'm accepting the perception. Right? I read the comments of some of these clips that go viral and I'm like, Holy shit. And I was young. Yo, motherfucker. Don't like me very much. You know, fucking say something on the show. Get yelled at. Everybody hate you. They want to take all your shit. Right. Well, they're fuck off. I get it. No, I mean, the same thing. I get a little kid star. It's all the same. Fuck, dude. I'll be eating the bag of Cheerio. The so much. You were even happy. We're happy. That's it. Cheerio. You had like the fuck whatever that fruit circles. Yeah, fruit circles. Yeah, but I mean, I had them. They didn't. You know what I'm saying? Like it is what the fuck it is. I'm sorry. I thought I thought we'd be invulnerable. You tell me. I'm just you know, fuck. I'm saying I'm saying something different than you're saying. That's okay. Same thing. What's going on, man? We got a lot of stuff to cover, guys. Dude, let's have some growth today. Man, there's a lot going on. A lot going on. We're going to cover just about all of it. So let's get this, this cruise on the road here. I want to bring up something. I got a couple of things for you. But first, you know, that tick-tock situation is interesting, right? Is it still going? It's like, yeah, it's still up. Well, kind of. If you had it, it is. If it's if you didn't have it, it's not. So like you can't go get it. Can't go download it, right? Really? And you know us, you know, this country is America. It's a great country, right? People do some wild shit. And I guess it all results to capitalism, right? Go capitalism. Bro, people are selling their fucking phones on eBay with the tick-tock app. Still downloaded on their phones right now. And I'm not talking like for just for a little bit. How much? Well, let's dive into it. Some iPhones with the tick-tock app, which is currently unavailable in the Apple and Google app stores, are fetching big bucks on eBay and the wake of the video sharing apps brief ban in the United States. Some iPhone owners who didn't delete the app are now selling their devices on eBay with some asking thousands of dollars for the phones. At least two iPhones listed as containing the app were sold after being listed for 10 grand. But it was unclear what some was actually paid by the buyers as completed listings, note, best offer accepted. One iPhone 15 was sold after two bids for a price of $3,100, bro. I'm going to sell my phone. Yeah. Without anything deleted off of it. All the pictures. All the pictures. Everything. What were you going to ask? $10 million. Okay. You wire me $10 million. You can have my fucking phone with all the shit on it. Do it every one with it. Damn. Nah, that's that's I think that's a little bit of a million. That's a little low. I need a hundred. We can negotiate somewhere between 10 and 100. Yeah, bro. Yeah, we gave it. Let's see. Hunter Biden's phone got got got got so he was shit out of it. He got the rumor of having a huge dick. Yeah, it's about it. Yeah, you got me. Yeah. Shit, man. So he's going to be 80's rumor. Well, if I was afraid, I wouldn't be selling it. I'm just saying get paid a whole bunch of money and start some good rumors about yourself. That sounds like a good deal. Is it win, win? Yeah. It's a win, win. Yeah. But people are selling their fucking phones, man. Some apparently there's some that out there going up to 35 grand, bro. 35,000 dollars. I'm a fucker. 35. I'm not 35 million, man. Yeah, bro. Fuck. We think it's a fair price. We think I should take to shave my beard. Oh, for charity. Oh, five million, five million. I think we raised five million. I'd fucking I do it. Yeah, five million dollars for charity for charity. Yeah. Now, which charity? The Andy Priscilla World fund the Andy Priscilla Foundation, like the Clinton Foundation. Bro, that's all these fuckers do. Oh, and then we can use that money to go to the fucking starving children. I left it. Yeah, I get to a full circle. Yeah, that'd be great. That's what these fuckers do. They start some sort of foundation. They buy like a couple planes on it. They don't employ all the people they know. Yeah, it's totally legit. And destroy the fucking world. Yeah. I don't know. I just thought this was interesting, man. That people are doing their wild shit, man. It's wild. But I got something else. We got a segment. We all we have bringing back, you know, since the start of this new year, that might be racist. It might be. That might be racist. Wait. So you're going to love this segment. Huh? I'm not qualified. I know I think you are. I think you are. I think you're the qualified most qualified in the room. Yeah, we got that might be racist, guys. We got a video here that has come in. Okay. Now, I don't want to give too much backstory. I just want first impressions. I want a raw genuine, you know, first impression of this video. So here is the video. Here is video. Half people. Which one are you? Which one are you, bro? I was the last one. That's you and your homies. Yeah. Squat pulling up. All right. Dude, what? So for those of you? Is this real? This is fucking real. This is real. For those of you on audio, this is a video of the KKK apparently. Yeah. Fucking cruise ship. So it's a cruise ship company. And these are employees of the cruise ship. Okay. They're workers like, you know, house cleaning staff and stuff like that. They're in these all-white uniforms with some interesting tops on their heads. Now, the cruise company made a statement. Okay. They said that the workers were dressed up dressed as upside down snow cones. I'm sat down snow cones during a Christmas themed event on the Pacific Explorer voyage from Melbourne to Hobart in December. Okay. Dude, have you seen that fucking video? Have you seen that video of all the black people on the cruise? And they're all dancing? Yeah. Have a good time. Yeah. And there's like two white people over the corner. They're like, they're like, fuck, I guess we should like bounce a little bit or something. You know, they didn't quite know what to do. Is this the retaliation for your lab video? Dude, what the fuck? Imagine having to be the PR for this company. What we gonna say? Tell them snow cones. I'm sat down snow cones. I'm so pissed. Dude, well, so there was a little bit longer of a statement that came out. There was a spokeswoman. Her name's, uh, uh, lean scribbens. Okay. She is the spokeswoman for PNO Cruises Australia. She says, quote, we regret if a recent incident on a Pacific Explorer cruise offended any guest. Um, the cleaning crew had never heard of the KKK organization before the incident. Uh, no one can seriously think that was their intention. Um, now again, upside down snow cones is what they got. Um, how does that relate to Christmas? I have no fucking legal. That's a lie. Now, I think here, here's the worst part about it, bro. The dress up is KKK on a massive boat. Uh, I think that might, we're all black people. They're still downstairs. That might be racist. Fun fact, KKK was founded in Tennessee, uh, 1865. A little history knowledge there for you. But I mean, I don't know, Andy. Yep. I don't know either, man. That might be pretty racist. It's one of the more racist things I've seen on the show. That's saying something. The next time. Yeah. Next time I say we go without the man. Next time we're going to full regalia. I'll wear my red one next time. Bro, it's so bad. Oh, fuck, dude. Bro, they had like a little leader there in the red one. Oh, they did. They did. That's the fucking grand wizard. Bro, grand wizard clause. Bro, fuck, bro. Dude, it's just funny. Look at that. Like who the fuck thinks has a good idea. But see, and there's going to be some fucking idea. See, it does fucking things. Bro, I saw this already on the comments and people were like, dude, the white people get pretty bold. Right. Pretty bold. First of all, I'm Mexican. First of all, my fucker was like six. That's like six people. That's like six motherfuckers. What? What did you say? They're all Mexicans. Are they probably? I mean, you know, I don't know. Probably don't say that. I don't know. That might be bad. You're going to say something about them cleaning or something. Orchia. Yeah, you are. That's all right. We were all taking it. Bro, oh, man. Yeah. It looks like they got a little KKK patch on their outfit. So they got something there. Yeah. Man, they're wine. I don't know where they ordered those from. I think that's the actual KKK on a cruise. It might be, bro. I listen, there's no black people in sight in this video. Well, it's Australia. Australia have black people. No, they don't know. They have aboriginals. They keep them like in the outback. They keep my mouth back. That's where that term came from. Well, outback, outback, not the steakhouse. All right. Let's move. I don't know if that's true. I'm just moving on. Well, should moving on. That might be racist. I'd say that it could be. Yeah. Well, guys, tell us down in the comments what you guys think. Let me tell us, get to our cruise. Got a lot of interesting stuff to cover. If you want to see you ask where they got their outfits, no, I know exactly where they got them. Where they get them. At the same place I got mine. Yeah, I can give up my fork and my my my my source, man. Oh, man. But if you want to see any of these articles, pictures, links, videos, go to AndyFacela.com. You guys can find them all linked there. That makes sense. Let's dive into headline number one. Hellenium One reads Trump says US problems all solvable in first interviews since returning to White House. This president sits down with Sean Hannity. All right. So a lot of interesting things have happened. I'm going to kind of break this up over the episode here. But I don't know if you see clips from the interview. Hannity starting to piss me off a little bit. You know, no offense, but he's just not my cup of tea, bro. Bro, you such a fucking typical rhino warmongering fucking Republican weirdo. And then he talks about his crabmagon, all this shit, but he's some kind of hard ass. Like, bro, you're 150 years old. You say the same shit every day. And I can appreciate some of the shit you say because, you know, you're not some communist leftist weirdo, but like fucked it. Like he's a warmonger. He's just weird. What's war? He wants, you know, he wants to, it's just, yeah, it gets old. It's very old. Now, a lot of things have changed. Also to like if you go to WhiteHouse.com, they've completely re-vent that entire site. Have you seen the new video that pops up when you go to White House? Let's check this clip out real quick. So you go to WhiteHouse.gov, you're gonna be, you're gonna be showing this clip here. It's fucking bad ass. That's fucking sick. Yeah. That's fucking sick. That's what it should be. It's sick. It should be some bad ass shit. Our last one was a bunch of fucking dudes dressed up as chicks figuring out like where the fuck is this? They should cut their dicks off or something. Like, you know, oh, diversity. You're right. Shut the fuck up. Right. That's how it should be. It's fucking bad ass. American power. I like it. I'm eat jets, bro. Helicopters. Fucking sick. Fucking Donald Trump. I give it to him. Yeah. It's bad ass. That's pretty fucking nice. New logo looks good too. Wait, wait, wait, the, it makes the old logo look like shit. This looks good. That looks great. Look at how Trump's got it eye for cool shit, bro. That's why his brands are so strong. They are. That's a good branding guy. They definitely are. But yeah, so that now you got the first interview. Okay. In the White House first sit down with President Trump and it's Sean Hannity. Now they had a very interesting exchange and I want to show you guys why I thought that Hannity was subpar. I thought they could have did somebody better. Honestly. Fuck, Dana Bush might have did better. I don't know. But they had a little interesting exchange here. Let's check this out. A bunch of losers. Joe Biden has very bad advisors. Somebody, somebody advised Joe Biden to give pardon to everybody but him. They wanted to take care of him. Yeah, but Sean, they wanted to. I don't care. This is more important because right now the economy is going to do great. I want to know. I'm here. So the, but you have to understand he had bad advisors on almost everything. It's like in the old days when the Secretary of States that he never made a correct decision on foreign policy. Joe Biden got very bad advice. He went through. Is that kind of off there? Specifically talking to my Biden's pardon. Why he didn't pardon them first of all. These reporters have gotten so comfortable. Yeah. Like talking to the president and the president's people interrupting them and all this shit. Like dude, ask the question. Shut the fuck up. Okay. You're Sean Hannity, bro. You're on fucking TV. Who gets a fuck? I know 50 mother fuckers get more views than you on the fucking internet. Okay. Shut the fuck up when he's talking. I can't stand it. And I love that Trump's starting to tell them to shut the fuck up. Well, you know what it is. It's because they haven't had a chance to do interviews and last four fucking years. It's not even just their manner. It's not just that, bro. They don't have to respect the previous administration. And I hope Trump continues to put these fucking journalists in their place. Yeah. You're a fucking reporter. Okay. You ain't shit. Shut the fuck up. You know, like that's it. No, he's got amount of futile suit. I know. I know one exchange. I forget who it was. I saw it. I'm talking. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've been interrupting. It's rude. It's fucking rude. And like, I mean, come on. Um, bro, I guarantee you my fuckers don't interrupt Putin. Right. Right. Yeah. No shit. Because I get taken out back the fucking head shop. Right. Right. Fucking some journalism tool bag major. Right. It's weird. Um, but you know, I thought this little exchange was weird because Trump was what Trump was trying to talk about was, you know, their friends, till you know that. Yeah. Yeah. But what Trump was trying to talk about was like, why? You know, he pardoned all these people. He didn't pardon himself. And he had to be immediately wanted to get off that conversation. Yeah. He's like, why would you want to get off that conversation? Now let's talk about it. Let's talk about it. It was just interesting. Because these guys are all pushing a genus brother bought and paid for. Why did Tucker Carlson get fire for telling the fucking truth? You know what I'm saying? Like, dude, you, Hannity could pretend all he wants. But someone who's the, the people who signed his checks own his ass. That's it. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's good to see that, you know, Trump is back in and he's handling these people like you should. And he has not stopped calling out some people either. Um, he also, uh, sent a message to Davos. So Davos they're convening right now. Trump unleashes on Bank of America CEO to his face for blocking his supporters, using his bank. And I didn't even know this was a big deal. Apparently it's a pretty fucking big deal. Uh, President Donald Trump attacked Bank of America for failing to land to conservatives during a sudden attack in his live stream speech to execs and, uh, elites and Davos. You know, I expect it blast came in an angry video appearance with Trump vowed to slap tariffs on countries that don't manufacture inside the US and demanded OPEC lower oil prices. Um, let's check this clip up. And by the way, speaking of you and you've done a fantastic job, but I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives because many conservatives complained that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank. And that included a place called Bank of America. This conservative, they don't take conservative business. And I don't know if regulators band data that because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody, I hope you're going to open your banks to conservatives because what you're doing is wrong. He's how I Jamie diamond. Mm hmm. Yeah. Mr. President, I'll say that your friend Gianni was sent a low told me to tell you a low, and we look forward to sponsoring a World Cup when it comes both this summer for the club and next year. So thank you for getting after the United States. Said nothing on what you don't say, though. You say, like, I mean, that's a diversion there, right? Listen, these people are scared shitless. Yeah, bro. Okay. They all know this is why you see all these people getting behind him. You see the, the open a Ag as you got fucking all the billionaires who put money against him. All these guys are falling in line now because they're afraid of what he's going to do. And I don't think Trump's going to fall for them falling in line. I think their true colors have been shown. They counted on the fact that they believe that Trump was done and not coming back and they were getting rid of them for good. If we remember back in 2019, 2020 when the election was coming up, how confident these people were about him not getting back in office. I don't know if you remember that. I remember them being on to you. And they would say, there's no way Trump's going to do this. Yeah. It's not happening. It's not going to happen this time because they all knew and they were all in and they were all aware of what was going on. And now we see all these dudes falling in line. You know, people like to be on the winning side. And hopefully, it's remembered where they were when things got really bad because that's generally the people's character. You find out people's character when things get hard and when things get rough and when there's hard decisions to make. And a lot of these guys, you know, at the very top of capitalist, which is an argument that, you know, socialist make, which I actually think they're right about, a lot of these guys at the top of the game and capitalism are greedy and they are unethical and they don't have standards and they don't have integrity and they will do whatever they need to do to make more money. They're slaves to the money. And I don't believe in that kind of capitalism. I believe in ethical capitalism. So, you know, I think you're seeing the slithering slimy, you know, underbelly of what the very, very, very wealthiest people live in. It's cutthroat. It really is. It's not, it's not, it's not mutually beneficial. That's not how business is done at the highest level. At the highest level, business is how can I figure out how to fuck this guy? And that's what these people do. And unfortunately, it's reality. I mean, because like I said, on the make of America thing, I haven't heard much about that. You know, yeah, inside of you have friends who have been affected by that shit? I mean, yeah, I've heard of a few people who had their accounts frozen. Yeah. Okay. You know, they didn't fuck with mine. I have plenty of accounts at that bank and they were great to me. So, you know, I'm one of the most outspoken people in the world. It's true. So, they treated me fairly and they treated me good. But I have heard that happening to other people, but it was just hearsay. I didn't, I wasn't able to confirm it. I don't know how true it is. And it seemed weird to me that they were getting their shit messed with, but they didn't mess with mine. Right. You know, if anybody shit should have been fucked with. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Not being so like, I don't, I don't know how much, how much, you know, I don't know, I don't know how much that their truth or is that because I, I have people that are high up at that bank that I know very well. And I asked them directly about that and they were like, what are you talking about? So, I think there's a lot of shit going around that might not be true. Well, it could be like like, like, geographical too, right? Like, I mean, we're in Missouri, right? Like, our people are pretty decent here, but like, I don't know what it's like in LA or California or New York, for example. Well, in the people I heard getting their, their accounts messed with, these are not like powerful, wealthy people. I mean, these are people that, I mean, they're not broke, but they're not, they don't have hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank. Right. You know what I mean? So, I don't know, I don't know. It's interesting, man. Well, that's stuff that's been going on most recently. I want to push our attention to. You got hundreds of J6ers have been released and partened. This is causing a little bit of an uproar. To the tune of almost, I think over 1,500 people. Okay. Hundreds of Donald Trump supporters have been serving prison sentences for participating in the J6 2021 attack on the US capital were freed on Tuesday after the new president pardoned more than 1,500 people, including some who assaults the police officers. The federal bureau of prison said 211 people have been released from federal facilities following Trump's order, Trump sweeping pardon, which went further than his allies had signaled they expected, drew condemnation from police who battled the mob, the families and lawmakers, including some of the president's fellow Republicans. 1,500. They have 1,500 total. How many, how many people were released from prison during COVID that were violent offenders in state of California or state of Pennsylvania or state New Jersey? Right. Fuck nobody wants to talk about that. Nobody's even brought it up. Make our community safer. Nobody's brought it up. Remember when they emptied the prisons because of COVID? Yeah. And what happened to the crime rates? And those are all levels. Federal, state and local. Yeah. What happened to the crime rates in this country after they did that? Right. What's the crime been like the last three, four years? Okay. So I don't want to hear fucking word about patriotic Americans. First of all, 1,500 being arrested. Like there was probably like five that should have been arrested. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Right. They started arrested. Those were FBI agents. They I know. They started resting people for being there. Right. For being in the vicinity. That's right. That's come. Those people should all be paid millions of dollars. Like I don't even know what it should be. Like it's it's it's it's fucked up. And then you don't hear anybody say shit about I don't even know like dude, I don't even know what the I can't even wrap my mind around what these people are. If they're not like literal hardcore communists that meet together and you know and fucking gymnasiums or something somewhere, I don't fucking know because like you can't tell me that you're upset about 1500 patriotic Americans who were walking through open doors of the Capitol. They were open by law enforcement and just let they were let in. Right. Okay. And then act like the the thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands of inmates that were released during COVID that were violent offenders. And you don't care about that. Right. Like you do this bullshit. And like these people are I don't I can't understand like how could you logically you can't logically think that that one is okay and one is not okay unless you just have an agenda to destroy the country and that's your fucking whole goal. And unfortunately I think that's what we're dealing with. Yeah. I think we're dealing with a large segment of our elected population of our elected officials and a small segment of the population who want to see America burn. They want to see it burn because you can't be upset about about this and not be upset about these other things logically. You just can't. Yeah. They can't. Yeah. 400%. Well, I was also seeing some some stuff. I was unable to like truly confirm it. But I was seeing something about like some of these locations, these federal facilities and the state facilities. They were not like they were trying to block the release on some of these people coming out. I wasn't able to really verify that I saw some you know, hears and ears talking about it. But was I'm able to confirm that so I don't I don't really know. But I do know that nothing happens quickly, right? Like even though the executive order comes down, there's still a process of release and process to actually get them out. You know what I'm saying? So give us some days should be fine. But why her I was told that the reason that they were delaying the release of some of these J6 prisoners is because of the poor health conditions that they've been. Oh, fuck yeah. And those people would definitely deserve some millions. Well, I mean, dude, that's that's what I've heard that from people that would know. And I've also heard that these people were abused and potentially tortured in this situation. Yeah. Geez, man. There's going to be a lot that comes out on this. Yeah. Well, I mean, I hope so. Another stuff going on. You know, this one this one's interesting. This is a new report coming out because there was a lot of pardons that Biden did push out that I feel like he definitely missed some. And as I'm interested to see what happens in here, especially like when we talk about the shit like insider trading, always like to give these update Nancy Pelosi, right? Nancy Pelosi's husband made $38 million worth of stock trades in the weeks and weeks leading up to Trump inauguration. $38 million fucking dollars in weeks. They shouldn't even have $38 million. No. That's that's my like, how? Yeah. Well, I mean, obviously we know how, but I'm saying like, like it makes no sense to me that you're a public servant. It's supposed to be representing your people. And you just fucking say it doesn't make sense to you because you're not a shitbag. No, thanks. It makes sense to people who seek these positions of power to exploit. That's why they do it. You know, why they hold on until they're 85 years old because bro, they understand what they're gaining from it. Yeah, it keeps squeezing them all. That's right. Fuck. That's an insane amount of fucking money, man. Yeah, they should be in prison. And unfortunately, they're so old that it's not going to matter anyway. Yeah. Now other big changes that have also happened too, did you hear about Trump cancelling the security clearances? Yeah, those spies who live, it was 51 total. He did cancel them. Cancell all of them. Good. Well, you're going to have some crybabies. Why any ex CIA chief behind infamous spies who lied, Hunter Biden letter makes pathetic claim after Trump yank security clearance. So this is the former CIA director, John Brennan. Okay. He had something very interesting to say. And I want you to watch this clip. You did an interview with MSNBC. Let's check this out. The only reason why I still had a security clearance as I have for the past number of years since I left government service was for the benefit of the government so that if the CIA or another government agency wanted to call me in to discuss the classified matter, they could do that. And so it was really for the government's benefit. It was facilitate those classified discussions with myself as well as with former directors as well as other former members of the Intel's community that had those clearances. So again, yesterday's EO is a bizarre among many bizarre executive orders that he had signed out. And as you point out, he misrepresented the facts and executive order because it said that we have suggested that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation. No, we said it was for the hallmarks of Russian information operations, including the dumping of accurate information, which is what we said in that letter. So again, this was just, you know, his effort to try to get back at those individuals who have criticized him openly and publicly in the past and I think very legitimately. That's what it was. He misrepresented what actually happened in the letter. Listen, these people take your money and figure out how to steal it. And then when you say something about it, they put you in jail. Right. Okay. Or if you say, I'm not paying them anymore, they put you in jail. Or if you make too much noise, they put you in jail. What about that is free. You see? Yeah, right. So these people deserve whatever the they deserve way worse than what I think he's going to do. And I don't even understand the point like why even broke you leave the government. You shouldn't have your security clearance. Well, I mean, what do you say? And it like that would be like, if I resigned as chairman of the board, right? And I knew all this shit. And the new chairman comes in and he wants to call me and say, Hey, what about this and this and this? I should have the ability to discuss that so that it helps them. That's what he's saying. They don't they don't do. You can't tell me that your corrupt fucking ass is the only one with the information to save fucking America after you've done so much to destroy it. Right. That's what I'm saying. They're not using it for that. You know, I'm saying my thing is you still have the fucking influence with that right that clearance. And that's where it gets abused. Like there's no rebro. You're fucking retired for fucking 15 years. You know, I'm saying and yet we're supposed to be like, like, no, no, I'm sorry. I'm not with that shit. Get him out of there. All those people should be kicked out. Yeah, man. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. That being said, let's go check this chat out. Shall we? The chat. Let's go cruise the comments. This first comment comes from at exotic WRX. Best part of any of these shows is DJ's Windex Squirtbottle Life. What's that? I don't know. I don't do that. Windex Squirtbottle. Do I have a Squirtbottle Life? Oh, okay. I got it. Okay. Yeah. More like a bad catalytic converter. You know what I'm saying, maybe. Yeah, like I'm trying to crank a old Chevy. All right. That's fine. That's the best comment you could come up with. I'll talk to you. Oh, I didn't come up with this comment. This next one, Heart Knocks Outdoors. He says FYI, DJ not being allowed in the hospital to see his newborn daughter had nothing to do with COVID. They just aren't you so that sort of thing. That's a good one right there. Hashtag. Racist jokes funny again. Hey, that was a good one. That's pretty good. That was funny. That's pretty good. I should have said that to them. Hey, I know you guys right here. Oh, that's funny. That's good. And I agree. Racist jokes are the funniest jokes. They are the fun. You know what's funny is how many people fucking don't realize that our show is at least like 80% bullshit comedy. You know, I mean, listen, we're funny. Did you see that clip that was going viral about how I said, if you aren't American, get the fuck out of here and all of a lot.

Make sure you guys hit that bell notification on the YouTube. Stay up to date with the latest episodes from really if that being said, let's keep this cruise moving. I got headline number two. Uh, mama, we've been waiting for. It has begun. It has begun. Ice arrest. I rate Haitian gang member. Murder and rape suspects in Boston. Fuck Trump. Biden forever. It's starting. It's fucking beautiful too. I fucking love it. I love it. Now, and I'll say this too. I didn't, you know, I know they're just getting started, right? But like it honestly doesn't look that bad. I thought I was going to be worse. You should be watching their stations. They're they're putting like the crime. See you again. Yes. They're putting like the crying migrants on the fucking top bro who gives a fuck. Not me. Yeah. Fuck. Cry. Cry me a mother fucking river. I fucking love it. I did think it was going to look worse, but it's not bad, bro. It's palatable still. You know, I'm saying, I'm sure it will get there. You know, hopefully. But for now, it's palatable still. Immigration and customs enforcement officers hit the ground run in this week, arresting multiple violent offenders in sanctuary cities, including a hostile Haitian gang member with a lengthy rap sheet who said, quote, ain't going back to Haiti and Ray, uh, raised fuck Trump, Biden forever. Ice officers in Boston made eight note, uh, noteworthy arrest, including multiple MS 13 gang members murder and rape suspects. And the Haitian gang member with 18 recent convictions. According to Fox News, who wrote along with I say, for the rest, check this clip out. I'm not going back to Haiti. One of those threats is this illegal alien from Haiti. I says he's a gang member with 17 criminal convictions in recent years. So you feel me, you're biting forever, bro. Take over, bro. I'm a for everything that he said for me. So I spot in quickly takes down its next targets, including this illegal alien from Brazil, who has an inner pull red notice for armed robbery. This Salvadoran illegal alien charged locally with rape and released by a sanctuary jurisdiction. You know, come and say hello. And this Dominican illegal alien charged with assault with a deadly weapon and heroin trafficking. Officers also arrested this Guatemalan MS 13 gang member facing gun charges. Ice says he was released from local custody just the day before. Their detainer request was ignored because of sanctuary policies. And in a sign of shifting priorities with the new Trump administration, this man who was in the same apartment as the target was also arrested. After ice determined, he's also in the US illegally. This is what ice calls collateral. It's awesome. Yeah, I mean, it's awesome, except there's fucking 16, 17 million of these people and they arrested 300 yesterday. You know, I don't know what they did something. Yeah, that's the standard like going right per day of arrest that they make anyway. You know what I'm saying? So how many how many how many years is that going to take to get rid of a third or 17 million people? Gotta move faster. Need a little bit more. We're for sure. For sure. I like I said, this is palatable. I'm waiting for the shit that ain't gonna be palatable. I mean, dude, you just do that math. You asking me to do math? Oh, so you know, that don't work out well for me. If that rate takes 155 fucking years, oh no, yes, no, yes, no, 155 years to get rid of the people that Biden led in. Fuck. Yeah, so they better figure it out and know, you know, that's not the cops fault. That's something the military is going to have to get involved in. Well, it's logistics, right? I mean, it's a logistical thing, right? And like, I mean, here's the other piece of this too, you know, is that you got some of these states and some of these sanctuary cities not playing ball and trying to fucking hard ball federal orders. People go to prison forever. That's what they need to do. They should go to prison for life. Illinois and Chicago to five federal deportation every jacked effort by Alderman Raymond Lopez who assists. So listen to this shit. Illinois has been passing state laws in the last few years than not only protect illegal migrant immigrants, but help them avoid detection altogether. This month House bill 5164 pass both houses of Illinois Congress and is now awaiting signature from government of JB Pritzker. The bill addresses resident name change. It lowers the residency requirement from six months to three and allows petitioners to keep these name keep these name change documents from being public in the case that it can cause hardship or harm. The petitioners would also be able to keep address information from be coupling public. The bill would be applicable for criminal offenders as well. To me, that's treason. It's treason. Now, introducing to the conversation here, we got Alderman Raymond Lopez, that's just this guy. So that's Tom Holman. And then that's an Alderman from Chicago. Alderman Raymond Lopez. Now he's trying to help. He's trying to help. Yeah, he's trying to help Holman get this done. Exactly. Good American, right? And I don't know much about this guy. I was doing a little dive on him, right? But for me, on the service, he seems like the true Chicagoan who cares about his community tweeted this out yesterday. If you don't want ice going into churches, turn over dangerous criminals. If you don't want ice going into hospitals, turn over dangerous criminals. If you don't want ice going into schools, turn over dangerous criminals. If you don't want ice going into neighborhoods, turn over dangerous criminals. Seems pretty reasonable to me. Now he's gotten some flat back. This person Jackson Potter tried to tweet him saying, you're willing this to subject your constituents or neighbors, sanctuary spaces and young children to militarized forces isn't protection. It's a form of child endangerment to which Raymond Lopez clapped back. He said, you're willing this to lump criminal migrants with long term undocumented, who otherwise love our city and country is disgusting. And since we are talking about child endangerment, how many of your C.T.U members have prayed upon African American and Latino children in our public schools? Ooh, sounds like some tea. A little shade room in there. What's C.T.U? So that's Jackson Pity runs this group called C.T.U. And apparently they've had a few pedophiles. Yeah. Well, that guy Jackson Potter is a fucking moron. Yeah. Okay. So you're going to justify children seeing militarized forces. You're going to compare that to them being raped or murdered by migrant military officers. The fuck do you know? Let's do it. That's what I'm saying. What is wrong with these fucking people, bro? Like it's they're so listen, all they want to do is have their way. They don't care about logic. They don't care if it's intelligent. They don't care if it helps anybody. They just want to be right. And like, dude, when these people continue to push this insane shit, you know, I don't know. I would like to see this picture come true. It should be true. Yeah. That's JB Pritzker and Brandon Johnson mayor of Chicago. They should go to jail, bro. They should go. And apparently somebody leaked. So like Tom Holman, right? Who's trying to run in this operation, can link this deportation. You know, there was he been coordinated with some local agencies. And somehow the information got fucking leaked from these local agencies about the plans and where they were going and how they were popping up. He got leaked like two days before it. So that's another reason the shit got slowed down is because these ship backs somebody in their offices. I'm not saying it's them directly, but somebody in their offices is allowing that sensitive information about the ops plan and plan of attack and stuff like that to get fucking like that's that's treason. Yeah. It's fucking treason. Yeah. I just love that fucking guy's face. The Haitian guy. Yeah. You are going back here. You are going back there, bro. Well, apparently Trump's in in like 10,000 troops active duty troops to the border and deploying even more resources to the federal agency law enforcement to help with these deportations. But yeah, I mean, to your point, we ain't got 155 years, bro. We got like a we got like 155 hours. Well, I mean, they need to they need to get this done. Yeah. On a mass scale. It needs to be done in the next four years, like done done. Yeah. And you can't care about optics. No. I think that's the other piece. I like, I mean, you're already trying to do that. They're already trying to paint this sob story. The same thing they did with AOC where she went down there and cried at the fence. And there was nobody on the other side. Now they're now they're taking videos of these people who are still in Mexico, but can't get into the country. We have a fine. Well, tough shit. How'd you guys get over there? Whoa, this isn't fucking playground for the world's most disgusting criminal element. I'm sorry. Well, it doesn't happen really anywhere else. But like these westernized cultures that try to lean themselves as fucking being. Oh, they don't do themselves that. They're forced to do it. Yeah. That's right. The world economic forum and all the people that run that are the ones that push for this fucking shit, George Soros, open society foundation shit. Like, bro, we have we have 15 to 20 people in the globe ruining every single western country. What's your top? What's your thoughts on the because another one of the things that Trump did was executive order in the birthright citizenship and I had a combo with Alex last night talking about this. But I mean, it makes perfect sense. Right? Like no other country in this world can an American citizen go to that country and let's say have a baby and that baby just automatically becomes a citizen of that country. No, that's still a fucking American citizen. But why do we allow that here? It doesn't make sense. The point was like it was never meant to take care of like, you know, migrants that are coming here using that loophole on the system. Right? That's just saying like, hey, if you're born here in this country, yeah, you're American, of course, like, but they're using this fucking loophole. You know, I agree. I agree with Trump. Yeah. No, 100%. Like, yeah, no, that doesn't give you the fucking right. Like, no, no, no. Yeah. I've just seen some people up there. Listen, dude, this is the United States of America. Okay. This is not third world shit hole fucking. And this is Pakistan or whatever the fuck you came from. Okay. If you want what we have here, then you go where you from and build it there. That's it. No, very simple. We're not, we're done with all of these people coming over from these third world shit holes and telling us what we're going to do and how we should be running our country and what laws and what rules we should be having here. Go ask people in Minnesota about that shit. Okay. Like, bro, we ain't doing it. Fuck you. Go back to where you came from. If you don't like it here, you don't like the way we do things here, eat a dick and go back fucking sucking on cow's nuts. I don't give a shit. Yeah. Whatever it is they do. Yeah. Go go fucking. Oh, care. Like, bro, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care at all. I have zero fucking care about it. Yeah. This is the United States of America. We people who founded this country and who have come here legally and gone through the process legally have built an amazing country. We've gotten along. We get along really good until people from foreign interests start putting their fucking hands in the in the Kool-Aid and fucking it all up for everybody. Right. Everybody here gets along. It's no, it's people like George Soros and these fucking world economic forum fuck bags that ruin our country. They don't even give a shit about our country. You got to deal with it. Yeah. Well, dude, they want. Listen, to have a global government, all the countries got to be on the same level. So they can't have one superpower oversee a bunch of mediocre countries. Right. You also can't have individual countries cultures can have French culture can have Italian culture can't have English culture or Irish culture or fucking Norwegian culture can't have that because you got to have a global culture. So what they're doing is they're trying to intermingle everybody to remove the cultures of all these other countries so that people can have pride in their one world government slash new world order. And you know, that's why they deem someone saying, well, France is for French people as racist. It's not fucking racist, dude. Yeah. America's for Americans, bro. And if you ain't American, get the fuck out of here. Yeah, I'm with the bro. I'm with it. Go fucking. Uh, you call me. I've grown that. I can't lie. Bro, a lot of these stir what listen, man? I don't give a no, the shit that they do. Oh, it's fucking what was one lot of these stir world countries are savage fucks. Okay, they do not belong in civilized society. If they want, if they were to have a civilized society, they would have built it over the last 4,000 years, but they don't. They're living the exact same way that they live back then. Why is that? Okay, that's that's not because they're these amazing people who fucking are going to come in and, you know, bring all kinds of bro, you're asking people to be brought into your country that are literally all they're going to do is take from you. They're not and I'm not saying there's not people that come here and make a great life as immigrants. Most of those people come here the right way, right? This dude and that dude right there and, uh, you know, pretty much all of our family members and everybody that's ever, you know, I'm just tired of it, dude. I'm tired of being told I'm racist for thinking that America's fur Americans, you know what I'm saying? I'm fucking tired of it. I'm not racist. You're not racist for saying that you deserve a place to be that doesn't need to be infiltrated with a bunch of third world fucks. It's not racism. Hey man, and that brother, you know, it's so weird is that the people who advocate for those people to come here, they wouldn't even go to those countries to visit. But yet they're saying, hey, bring bring all the military age males from those countries here because I feel I don't want my neighbor to think I'm racist. Right. And they, and those people come here, they do the same exact shit they would do. No shit. They do. They fucking kill the dogs. They kill cats. They eat the cats. They eat the ducks. Yeah. You know, like, I love how everybody tried to brush over that fucking story too. They rape the fucking actually doing the shit. Listen, there's 17 million people that came and fucking 15 million or fucking dudes. What men have primal desires? Where are they going to fulfill those desires? With your fucking children and your ants and your fucking sisters and your wives. You guys are fucking stupid as fuck that fucking advocate for this. Yeah, so it's fucking like literally the dumbest element on the planet. And real talk, people who advocate for it should just be sent there. If you care that much about those people, go there. Care about the culture so much. Go over there. Go live that culture. Yeah. One way ticket. No, I'm being serious. No, me too. AOC. You should go live with them. Mm-hmm. Well, you won't even last a fucking week over there. Mm-hmm. Nope. Listen. Do I think it's right that certain places of the world are wealthy and have money and have restaurants and civilization and then other places in the world are completely forgotten about and they're savage. I don't think that's right. Okay. But it's not like it hasn't been tried, tried to be fixed every way. Mm-hmm. It's tried to be fixed by sending people there. Now it's tried to be fixed by sending them to other countries. We have to address reality. And here's the reality. A lot of those people that come from those places don't want to live a different way. They don't want to live under different rules. That would be like you being brought up a certain way here in America and you go into one of those places and wanting to live how it is here. They're not going to accept it. We're not going to accept it either. All right. So this whole idea, like it's not like I don't feel bad that people in other places are poor or don't get enough to eat. I think that's a terrible thing. But I think it's a more terrible thing when our own people don't have places to live and don't have food to eat. And once that problem solved, then we can maybe talk about them. But I ain't talking about them over us. We're going to talk about us first and then them. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. And like, dude, you know, you could judge people for saying that all you want. But there has to be a certain level of tactical decision making about what the priorities are. And you know, people are going to say, well, that's heartless. No, it's not. It's just logical. It's just practical. It's reality. We have to take care of this before we can take care of that. That's that. Yeah. Okay. And are people, is that going to make, is that going to cost people their lives over there? I don't know. That's not my fucking concern. I'm not concerned about it. That's shit going on here. This cost me. Hey, motherfucker, we only get 100 years on this earth. Right. I'm trying to fucking do the most good and live the best quality life that I can when I'm here. Okay. I care about my fellow citizens. I care about my neighbors. I care about the people in my community. I don't have enough time or energy or resource to give a fuck about, you know, dude over half across the world who wants to eat my fucking dog. I don't know. Stay the fuck over there. And we'll stay here. And then when we get to a place where, you know, things are great here, then maybe we can talk about it over there. But I have no interest in it. And nor do I care. Yeah. I feel like anybody who advocates for that shit, they should be made to like go on a stage in front of a room full of like homeless vets, for example, and and and and argue for their position. Well, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. Or like, dude, the people who have been completely like, dude, look, let's talk about it. Let's talk about the black communities here in the United States historically. Okay. The black communities in the United States historically have been severely handicapped by the party that they have been convinced of vote for over and over and over again decades. Okay. And they've been made promises to they've been lied to. They've been told that their schools were going to get money, that they were going to get economic impact in their neighborhoods and all and it never happens because the people that convince them to vote for them are the most conniving, snaky, dirtiest politicians in the world. And they steal the money. And then they leave the black communities to flounder. That's been going on for 60, 70 years. Okay. But those same communities, because that person who they trust, who they shouldn't trust, says that white people are the problem or Donald Trump's the problem or, you know, Republicans are the problem. They still haven't figured out completely that that that it's the own people doing it to themselves. And that should be fixed before we go over to, you know, some place and some other part of the world and try to help those people. Like those are American citizens that need to be fucking handled and treated just like every other American citizen. And this shit of, you know, sending resources to you, like, dude, if I was a minority, if I was a black person in America, in a black neighborhood, a black urban area that's been run down typically in these Democrat run cities. And I see them sending hundreds of billions of dollars to other places like fucking Israel and fucking Ukraine and wherever else, what the fuck, dude? Look at my fucking neighborhood. Look at my community. Look at the jobs that are offered here. Like, dude, that's fucked up. And dude, these white suburbanite women who fucking advocate for helping all these crazy fucking causes all over the world, you look right past the fucking neighborhood right down the street. Why is that? If you're, if you're not racist, why are you looking right past your fellow American citizen? It was right 10 miles down the road from you. You see what I'm saying? We have to look at it. Listen, dude, they won't go in the neighborhoods, they won't help them, but they'll go to brunch and they'll talk about how good it is to help these motherfuckers come across the border because they deserve a better life, right? But the minute that one of those people want you say, hey, you should take one of these people in their house. No, no, okay, this is I can't do that. I'm going to have an, I don't have any room. Well, they're, they're putting 13 people to a room over there. You don't, I'm sure you can't squeeze two or three. No, right. Right. Right. And so here's the bottom line. Is it if you're not willing to get your hands dirty to help these people, they shut the fuck up. I agree. Because I'm going to tell you this. I'm not, I'm not getting my hands dirty to help them. I got my own responsibilities. And so do you. And at least I'm real enough to fucking say it out loud. Okay. I'd much rather help our American citizens, black, white, Latino, whatever, then help a single motherfucker from somewhere else. It's just a way. It is what it is. It is what it is. Yeah. Oh my guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think. That was a big set. Let's get to our third and final headline. We got headline number three beautifully stated Andy. Beautifully said. We got headline number three. This is like a little, just a little touch of a conversation before we get to the big news. I just thought this was fucking hilarious. So the headline reads, government agency is caught deploying sneaky tactic to get around Trump's anti-woke purge. Have you seen this with the ATF? Is it where they were renaming their titles? Yeah. So the bureau, we got buddies there. Yeah. Good buddies. Good buddies. Listen, the thing about most of these agencies is most of the the field workers and the guys who actually do the job, they're great people. The dudes. Yeah, it's the people that the top that are fucking corrupt. That are fucked. Yeah. Yeah. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and Explosives appeared to try to avoid Donald Trump's anti-DI executive order by switching the job title of its chief diversity officer. So here's a picture before. This was January 20th. Okay. Some of these guys look weird, but specifically here you got Lisa T. Boykin. All right. She's listed as the chief diversity officer, office of the director that she should report to you. Okay. Trump releases that. Then there's a little update on the website. They renamed it. She's just a senior executive now. That's all profiled at my fucker. She got to be fired. She got to be fired, bro. It's not going to work. No. There's no drugs in here. The fact that they think that that would work shows that they're the fact that they think that that will work shows their understanding of how much they get away with. That goes unnoticed. Right. If they think that that little trick is going to get them through, then they have a complete understanding of all the little tricks that get them around all the regulations. They know the loophole because they write them. Yeah. That's right. They write them, bro. I just thought that was fucking hilarious. I mean, like, good Lord guys. We're having that guy. That guy. I have the time to get fired. Yeah. I think he got fired. Yeah. They banned the eyes. They said, all right. Let's ban on top white guy. Yeah. Oh, shit. Steve, you're out, baby. Yeah. Yeah. At least he's spelled Steve in the right way. Wait, go to the second one again. Oh, he's still deputy director. Yeah, they just haven't given the title yet. Guaranteed already put his nutsats on the desk. Guaranteed. Yeah. Yeah. That's just like, fuck. But at least Steve did spell Steve the right way though. You know, like STVN versus like the P, when my fuck store P's in there. Steepin, steepin, steepin. Damn, steepin. Stepping. Damn, stepping. What you doing? Stepping out, baby. Yeah. Yeah. Now Demarco's in. I mean Marvin. That's Demarvin. Demarvin. Oh, shit. Stepping got demoted by Demarvin. Okay. All right. I want to the big news though. DGIT released a new thing. Trump signs executive order to declassify files on JFK, MLK assassinations. This is how to off the press right here. Yep. It's a big deal. Yep. Now, I don't know. Like I'm hoping they don't just release the fucking page and it's all redacted, right? Because you know, that's not what I mean, the executive order was pretty fucking clear. So here's the video of it being announced on Trump's desk. And let's let's check this out. Lastly, sir, we have an executive order ordering the declassification of files relating to the assassinations of President John F Kennedy, Senator Robert F Kennedy, and Reverend Dr. Martin who kicked you. Now, that's a big one, huh? A lot of people are waiting for this for a long few years, for decades. And everything will be revealed. Okay. Give that to RFK Jr. That's nice. Give that to RFK Jr. That's pretty cool. The penny sign the fucking order with you. I mean, and listen, he said, everything's going to be revealed. All right. Now, I'm hoping that that's fucking everything. Because you know, up until recently, bro, like I mean, like maybe five years, you know, the narrative was that JFK was shot once in the head. He was actually shot like two times, right? And if you watch the clip, when you slow down and watch the fucking frames, he was shot before the actual final one that blew his head off. Um, and like that wasn't even common knowledge until like 10 years ago. You know, so I mean, it's interesting. I'm hoping that it's everything. But going full circle here, back to that interview, he did with handy, they talked about this specific topic and like why now, why is it just now being released? And Trump had a very interesting thing to say on this. Let's check this clip out. You stated that you will release the files, all the files as it relates to the JFK assassination. And by the way, this is his desk. Yeah. That's right. This is where that's on Canada, a little down. It's a movable door. Yeah. So the door there, let's wear John, John, John, John, yeah. And RFK and also Martin Luther King Jr. and that you will be transparent. This was going to happen in the first two people of Espigiativ. And I did, I did it with Kennedy to an extent. But I was asked by some of our government officials not to. And you know, you have to respect them. I was actually asked by Mike Pompeo, a secretary of state, not to. And he, I felt he knew something that maybe, you know, when he asked you not to, he sort of say why. And he felt that it was just not a good time to release them. And you might ask him why, maybe he'll deny that even. But he did, he asked me. And some others also though, they didn't want the Kennedy stuff released. And they're professionals. And I respect them. And they're working for me and the country. They're working for the country. And so I didn't release. But I'm going to release some immediately upon getting, we're going to see the information. We're looking at it right. Well, how would they want that stuff released? Because they understand that if what people believe happened actually happened, meaning our three letter agencies had them assassinated, all three of those people, that it gives Trump tremendous leverage over the traditional government system slash, cabal slash establishment. So people are at a point now, my opinion, where they don't trust the government at all. And if Trump wants to truly gain the support of the people, he would pull the bandaid off of that exposed that fully so that people had zero trust in these agencies, which were making it easier for him to dismantle them. That's what you see the play is. So what do you think? Because this is a picture right here. If you're an audio, I've got to picture up here. Because if he starts dismantling these things without that evidence, people are going to say he's a fucking dickhead or yes. I mean, it makes sense. It makes perfect sense. So for those on audio, I've got to picture of, this is Lee Harvey Oswald, right? This is the man that allegedly, I mean, they convicted him of killing JFK. So what do you, so what do you think his role in this was? I mean, was he CIA? I don't know. Yeah, what do you think his role was? I guess it's a question. The same role of some of these antifa dumbasses, you know, where they pay these people to do crazy shit and then tell them they're going to get off the hook. And you know, I mean, look, dude, Thomas Crookes, same as all of you talking about. That's right. Thomas Crookes, okay? Perfect example. We're going to make you a hero. You're going to be a national hero. You're going to, you're going to be well-known blah, blah, blah. It's convincing them of all this shit. I'm speculating obviously. Convenient to do the job, equip them to do the job. And then when the job's done, they kill them, right? So there could have been the same kind of thing. I mean, dude, you can't tell me that all these school shooters were acting alone. You can't tell me that. They're all, they all fit the same profile. They're all leftists. They're all fucking communists. They're all fucking trans people. They're all, you know, mentally disturbed. They all had, you know, allegedly GPS coordinates and contacts with many members of three letter agencies before. Why would a three letter agency be talking to any of these people at all for any reason? Do you ever, you ever had the FBI or CIA come to you for anything? Right. Exactly. But they're going to go to these fucking kids who happen to end up shooting up schools. Fuck out of here. And they all knew about the possible, listen to that before they happen. There's so much corruption in these agencies that it has to be exposed for us to ever have peace here and at least start the peace because it's not going to fix it all, right? But it is definitely the start to that. Like I said, I think it gives Trump, it gives Trump a skeleton key to every door that he wants to open from here on out. Because when people realize what's actually happened to these people and how it happened and who did it and why, the trust in these agencies is going to be zero, which will lead to the dissolution of these agencies, which is eventually where I think he wants to take it. My only fear though, man. And like, maybe I'm being too naive on this, but my only fear is like, you know, let's say that it was a three letter agency that did these things that are behind these things, right? Let's just hypothetically here say that that's the truth. Would they really like do we really believe that they wouldn't at least attempt to cover their tracks and like not leave, you know, shit like that to be discovered or even the risk of fucking being declassified? Well, I mean, you know what I'm saying? But then on the other hand, I'm also like these people, they are all they do what it's you rules. No, right? Look, you got to think of it like a gang. Okay? If you're in a gang and something needs to be handled and it's very bad and it's going to be incriminate a few people to do it, but it has to be done. And then it's done. It's best that that information be kept from everyone for the continuation of the gang to be able to operate. You understand? Right? So in my opinion, what's happened here is a group of individuals at some point in time on all three of these cases decided that these three men were a big enough threat that they needed to be killed. All right? And that was probably a decision that was made amongst five or six people. And when you classify a situation like that and you say, hey, five or six people were responsible for this. But then you have a, you know, a broader scope of individuals that then learn the truth. Well, those broader scope of individuals can't tell the truth because it would mean that their income and their job and their place in life would be dissolved. Right. So the the heinous nature of the act itself being so bad that people would reject it if they knew the truth completely and want everybody involved held accountable, protects, protects it from ever coming out because anybody that would know it would be part implicated in it. Right. You see? So my thinking is what I said before. I think Trump was to radically transform the government. I think it needs to be radically transformed. I think for him to radically transform the government, people have to know the truth and they have to realize how sinister the truth is so that he can do what he's supposed to do and what he needs to do for the country's long-term benefit. Otherwise, if he just started disbanding the FBI or disbanding the CIA, you know, who's to say they're not going to try to arrest him or fucking kill him, you know, and who's to say they didn't already try to kill him? Exactly. Which a lot of people think they did a couple times. So I don't know. I think we're at a very dangerous time in the country. I mean, you know, these situations, you know, the black swan event and all the things that I thought were going to happen before the election, they could easily happen now too. So it's going to be interesting. Yeah. I mean, we shall see. Yeah. We shall see. Now, I mean, again, like going back even with the J6 release, right? The executive order has been issued. There is a time process that goes into that, you know, I'm saying paperwork. Other paperwork has to be signed and actually going through and releasing the shit. So my hopes is that by Monday, we hope we hopefully have something on this that we could start talking about next week. But I mean, the sooner it all comes out, the safer it is for Trump. That's the truth. If it drags on for weeks and weeks and weeks, that gives them an opportunity to stop it by doing something bad or Trump and his administration. If they were smart, they'd let it rip like tonight. Right. Right. I mean, well, here's my other thing too. I mean, I just want to classify on that. That's cool. I want the abstinence list. Yeah, why is that a yeah, we're I agree. Where is that maybe this has to go first because that maybe they're tied together. I don't know, but I need the abstinence. Well, Trump said that he was going to declassify the JFK shit this week. He didn't. Yeah, we'll see my guy stay tuned and let us know down in the comments, what you guys think. With that being said, let's get to our final segment as always. We got thumbs up or dumb as fuck. That's where we bring a headline in. We talk about it to get one of those two options. No, no bears today. No bears. No bears. No, no, no crap monkeys. No Indians. No monkey. Investigation. Nope. Uh, little something little, little different. This is different. Yeah, this is different.

You know what bro, they do this shit. Just for me. hilarious TikTok video. Yeah, hilarious TikTok video with more than 2.4 million views. The boys got pop off. Monika Long exclaimed in the clip while describing their alleged grandpa slam breakfast. The single mother of three claimed she left her two toddlers ages three and two alone for a moment in early January so she could use the bathroom while prepping for a birthday party. The color audience was only in there for several minutes, but when she returns she saw the boys were playing in what looked like white dirt during the four minutes she'd been gone. The two hellians had managed to smear the sit all over their faces, bodies and the floor. Check the slip out. The boys got pop off. They got them and they dumped them out all over my carpet and I didn't realize it was pop off and I vacuumed him up. They may have eaten some of them too because Rami had the cap in his mouth and Jesus Christ. Yep. Pop-paw shark. These are the culprits. Asaya and Rami. I'll give you one guess as to whose idea it was to unscrew pop-paw's canister. Whose idea was it? Hit me with pop-paw. He threw it in the mouth. No, you got to fucking... is that his name Brownie?
