Welcome to cruise the internet. I'm your host Andrew Priscilla. Today we have CTI with my co-host EJ Johnson. Greetings. Namaste. Welcome to cruise the internet. Don't be a hoe. Show the show. All right what's up dude? Hello. That was a probably most fireist fire you know I had you know I'm trying to keep everybody's keep everybody calm. Just lots of stuff going on. Just wait to hit Lion 1. Somebody asked me this weekend about Q and A F and CTI if I knew the questions ahead of time. And they also asked if I knew the show heads. You guys got to understand I don't know I walk in here from doing my job and walk in here and do the show. These guys produce it so I don't know what's going on. I just kind of sit here and talk. Yeah no I mean it's a process. You know it's definitely a process because I mean you walking here around like 12 I got 50 fucking headlines pulled up and I'm going through and you're trying to go down to three. The fact check to get it down to three main core topics you know but no you don't you have no insight on any of it. I mean the stuff you like you know again like you'll see some stuff I mean some stuff just made your stuff and like yeah we're definitely covering it. Well it got me thinking about like the traditional media. You know we see guys like Gavin Newsom and these these other political figures so rehearsed. Trying to start shows and like dude they can't do it without a teleprompter or without like someone someone being told to tell them what or somebody tell them what to say. That's why I fuck up reading all the time. I got never heard of this shit. Yeah. Oh Sam. That's why it's too it's too it's too it's too it's too it's too much because you can't read. Yeah it's too very and I got me that's it's authentic views here you know. Well I'll just say it like excuse me it's interesting it's interesting how handicapped these people actually are man it's like they're actors for real. No they don't know that's exactly what they are yeah they're all actors man. Hey what's going on in the world don't don't don't forget to pay the fee don't be a hoe. Show the show two times there. Yeah. Yeah man. I got a lot I think our whole numbers are going down though. Are what our whole numbers? Yeah. I guess good. Yeah it can't be a hoe bro. Yeah. Yeah but we do have a lot of stuff to cover though man it's this is a very girthy episode I'd imagine. I'm sorry Joe had a time got it I don't have that many videos today though but but yeah it's a girthy episode. There's a lot of shit going on. A lot of stuff. Sorry. Yeah let's get into it before we get to our headlines got a little something going on for you this is a this this this topics pulling up some virality. There we go some what virality. Morality virality virality virality virality it's going viral viral yes and so let's talk about it I love to get your opinion on this not sure if you guys have seen this high school runner who hit a opponent with relay baton says she's now victim of racial slurs. Shocking death threats at well I mean have you seen the video have you seen it yeah also you did see this insane dude have you seen her her reaction to it now okay well let's dive into it guys this is a high school track athlete who smacked an opposing runner in the head with a relay baton says she didn't do it on purpose. Oh that's what tough one even for me. Alayla Alayla Everett a senior Evgenia's I see Norcom high school says she's been the victim of verbal attacks and death threats following an incident where she struck an opponent in the head with her baton and injured her during the VHSL Class III state indoor championships at Liberty University on Friday so this was the four about two relay and Brookville high schools Kayleen Tucker was attempting to cut into the outside lane during a tight battle for second place during turn four when Everett appeared to wind up and strike Tucker in the back of the head let's check the video out okay I'm bias reaction here's the video bro yeah I'm gonna smack that girl right in the head with a fucking baton in the middle of a race bro I mean I'm clear as day you're competitive and let's be real no let's be real bro this is the shit that people say every time they get caught doing something fucked up and the world comes down on them they say oh I'm the bit they start playing victim you don't get to play victim anymore we're fucking done with it that was five years ago 10 years ago we're so far past the victim mentality of people who do terrible things like oh I'm getting death threats well oh I'm getting called names well maybe you shouldn't hit people in the back of a head with a baton okay and let's see the death threats by the way like this dude I'm so back when I ran when I did the internet yeah I would put people on blast in my stories and they would have to broke my people are you guys are vicious as fuck you know and they would just go right after these people yeah and then they email all your people are giving me death threats well let's see him well you know I erased them right because dude it's just a lie it's a lie to create sympathy for someone who deserves the backlash that they deserve and this woman deserves everything she gets everything I don't give a fuck what people say to her it this is disgusting it's I can't stand I do I I can't stand it let's hear out let's see what she had to say maybe maybe maybe her side can give us some clarity now you could see very clearly from the video she did it on purpose and then right after she did it she's like oh fuck what I do she realizes that she did it immediately yeah and she went and like tried to act dude you you wound up and you were gonna hit her again until you realize what happened first one was good enough yeah bro let's see what she has to say let's hear out Andy innocent until proven guilty right guilty she's probably guilty a whole bunch of other shit to you being real I mean listen somebody who does she's guilty of being a sore loser that's that's fucking trash yeah yeah well let's hear what she has to say everybody asked feelings so you're physically hurt but you're not thinking of my mental rate no one cares off of one angle the couple tries to hurt my baton got stuck behind her back like this and it rolled up her back I lost my balance when I pumped my arms again she got hit I know my intentions and I would never hit somebody on purpose there I saw my character calling me ghetto racist slurs death threats all of this just because of a nice second video yeah a 90 second video that where you hit a chicken and back of the head very clearly didn't on purpose that was meeting you and now you're upset because there's consequences that you are not used to having with anything that you do that's it you're just something in that video nobody asked feelings so you're physically hurt but you're not thinking of my mental rate they're going off of one angle they're compensating her my baton got stuck behind her back like I swear to God I didn't put that in I swear to to I swear I did not you put that I swear to you guys put that in everything that I fucking love I just I just cuz you know like it's a Nate and my being to like you know this at the smoke detector yeah like you know I'm saying yeah and it must be hard man it is what it is look dude I feel I feel no remorse for people like this at all like dude you know what that's the real victim okay come out and say you know what I don't know what I did I got locked I was in the heat of competition I I hit her in the back of the head I it was clearly wrong I can't explain it and I'm sorry I'm a barrist and it makes me sick that I did that how about that because we all do things in the heat of things that event that sometimes we regret I think every single person in the history of the world has done things when they're in competition or highly emotional or highly intense that they're like oh fuck I shouldn't have done that okay but this is not what she did you know she's she's crying and you know dude if you're gonna do big people shit take big people consequences and real talk to you we are a problem with people that are young in this country that have been able to do and say and act any way that they want with zero consequences whatsoever and you know that's that you know you know I dude she should be brought up on assault charges for real you hit this girl in the back of the head with a metal fucking rod and dude we all know batons aren't that heavy I mean they're pretty light but the point is you did it and that's that I don't want to fucking about that I'm sorry they're saying that they're treating her for a concussion and the possible skull fracture I don't I doubt that I mean row everybody's got whatever now yeah I don't know man that sounds what you guys think I mean it looked pretty purpose like she did that shit what do you mean pretty I mean she didn't know purpose there's no now she's crying and playing victim like everybody does in society like I can respect someone who comes out and says fuck you fuck that up I shouldn't have done that yeah I really regret it I'm embarrassed I apologize to her I apologized to everybody it's my fans that's embarrassing that's how she did she fucking tried to make an excuse and dude that's you know I'm dude I'm tired of hearing it yeah wax shit man guys let us know down in the comments what you guys think she said oh they're calling me racial slurs but you mean you mean the other the girl that you hit was black you're right okay so you mean the the that their families calling you racial slurs like they always do and it's acceptable for you guys to fucking say that shit back and forth so now it now I hurt you you understand bro imagine no I'm I'm making a point here of double standard bullshit no that's what I'm saying I'm saying that was a white girl that did that shit no shit bro fuck fuck if it was a white girl she hit it wouldn't even hit made the news now I'm saying that did that I understand that if a white girl hit a black girl they'd be burning the cities down bro if a white girl had been hit in the head with that baton it wouldn't be on the fucking news I'm surprised that's on that is a fucking fact it's a fact yeah I'm surprised this is on the news bro we don't cover black on white ground man it's crazy yeah well I hope she's all right and you know this is fucking bullshit wild she shoot wild everybody's calling me names yeah you fucking cheater that's dude that's a problem of that's a deeper problem than cheating like imagine how she reacts when she gets pissed off or loses her temper she automatically goes to violence like bro that girl's a ticking time bomb you know what I'm saying oh yeah oh yeah man guys let's know what you guys think down in the comments I'm interested to know with that being said let's get on with the rest of the show I do I okay I hate the double-stater in this country I fucking hate it well I mean just the victim shit and that's what I'm saying like bro I'm not talking about the race shit I'm talking about the fucking victim shit yeah like bro real talk if I had done that the fucking world be over you know I'm saying it's just you'd fuck all this shit I'm tired of the fucking fake performative outrage bullshit you hit this chicken ahead with a baton in a race on purpose and now you're crying because you have to deal with consequences and you probably never had to deal with any your whole entire life and to be completely honest the consequences for what you did should be so harsh that it teaches you a lesson that your actions have consequences otherwise you're gonna go out and do some worse shit and you're gonna end up in prison and that's what's gonna happen this is what happens when we don't teach our children that there are consequences for their actions okay you don't get to fucking play the race car to avoid consequences for your actions anymore that is over nobody cares anymore nobody's with it anymore nobody's hearing it anymore that didn't even involve white people and you're saying oh they're calling me racial slurs the fuck you talking about yeah right every group of black people that gets together calls each other fucking the N word nonstop so now it bothers you but it doesn't bother you when they do it at other like dude shut the fuck up you don't get to pick and choose what's what when it's convenient for you it's just annoying dude I did it yeah man well let's get into our crews man we got a lot of stuff to cover so guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them all linked there with that being said let's get into our first first set of headlines Twitter's down X went down it's back up kind of sort of yeah X crashes for thousands as fresh are the users turn to medis threads so thousands of social media users reported outages on Elon Musk's X formerly known as Twitter throughout the day on Monday according to now detector.com more than 40 thousand users reported a crash on the app by 10 a.m. after reports that started pouring in at 6 a.m. according to the crash tracking site. Here's a map it was kind of all over most of it was coming out of L.A. which I believe is where the majority of Twitter servers are if I'm not mistaken I know he moved a lot of them to or isn't the process of moving to Texas I don't think all of them have gotten there yet but East Coast West Coast if you're on your mobile phone this is probably what you saw I was know I was having some issues earlier this morning pulling some videos but but Elon's tracking it obviously he tweeted this out quote there was still is a massive cyber attacking its X we get attacked every day but this was done with a lot of resources either a large coordinated group and or a country is involved tracing so they're gonna figure it out maybe interesting to see who it was I saw some stuff they were trying to like you know this group apparently it like tried to claim responsibility but none of that has been verified at this time but it's weird with this Elon Musk stuff right because you got Twitter it's not just you know Twitter that's been attacked and you know been having issues like so they I mean they get attacks every single day right to it's a tech company it happens but Tesla's also been getting under a lot of scrutiny N-type Musk demos grow across US as protesters attack Tesla showrooms with the Molotov cocktails and guns and then I mean again this is all over the fucking country what are they demonstrating what are they against yeah I mean they're apparently just they know what they're against no I don't think they know is this paid NGO nonsense dude I saw one guy there's a video I tried to find again I couldn't because Twitter was down but there was a video of a guy standing outside of one of like the federal buildings or something with a sign that says doge must go why and they went up to him and ask him you know it's like you know how why are you here he's like I'm getting paid to be here yeah like they're all like like the great protest so that's what's going on there's paid for it we're still doing it you know if if Elon and these guys at doge instead of cutting all this funding and they're like oh where's this money going where's that money going we're here how about this dude how about you just make NGOs illegal that way all the money doesn't go to any of them that would solve all of our problems then we come up with a new system where people who are actually doing good things here in the United States and actually the money is flowing through to the intended project we could fund some of those maybe but all current NGOs should be made illegal every single one and it would end all of this shit there would be no protesters we'd have none of this bullshit it would be over no I and not only that I mean even you know if we do get the new system you know regarding these organizations like I don't feel like anybody that any elected official or any bureaucrat should have any ties or connections to any of them because I mean that's how it's set up right now right renom's in you're in congress you can get in for 10 years you get you know you're able to open up your NGO with your your cousin or your brother or whatever the fuck it is and then you're you know voting to funnel that same fucking money out like bro like sorry I don't think any of them should have any ties at all and if you're caught it it should be held very just make it illegal to say hey NGOs are not a legal entity yeah it's very simple I NGOs as well I mean because bro I mean that like they just uncovered a bunch of them that are here there's international not government I mean all of them yeah all of them we shouldn't be funny any of that shit no but yeah I mean there's some going outside of New York City right now there's roughly 250 activists gathered outside a showroom in New York City holding anti-musk placards that read block fascism now and musk musk go as they shout at Elon Musk is not elected democracy must be protected you know they do be having some pretty nice catchy slogan Kamala wasn't elected either it's true um you know George Soros wasn't elected yeah George Soros hasn't been elected Alex Soros elected yeah Claus Schwab wasn't elected Chelsea Clinton has been elected yeah I mean there's a bunch I mean yeah we go way down the list here Hillary Clinton's not elected yeah I mean do a bunch you know I mean do they they've been doing some crazy shit here's some some pictures of some of the devastation they've been going to test those lot and just blowing them up you know they got surveillance bro what's happening to these people are they catch it up I haven't seen any information that anybody's been caught at this time well until people start getting caught and the examples of the bullshit will continue yeah I don't understand how hard this is the the only way that this is allowed at this point is if it's intentionally being a lot that makes sense is he showing you doing anything different with your Tesla yeah now he's just letting him hang it's a ballsy bro but I mean do it it's wow it's wow you know what's funny dude what I find ironic is that all these people who bought into green energy and the environment and all these people that think they're doing something good by driving electric cars which by the way you're not electric cars cost they cause much more damage in the environment the production of CO2 is necessary or CO2 is an all-time low for since it's been to store it yeah okay so we actually need more CO2 to feed the plants which produce the oxygen and when you really understand the science it makes sense that they push this green shit because they actually want to depopulate the planet that's their fucking goal and the reason they want to depopulate the planet is because AI is coming in and they don't need these working class people anymore you know fucking need them and it's interesting and ironic to me that all the people who bought Teslas were all like these you know hyper you know virtue signaling environmentally friendly some probably with good intentions that think they're doing something good paper straw masters pretty much bro these are all leftists that own Teslas and and they're so heavy in them because the cars are expensive they can't get out of them so like they got to go every day and fucking getting this car and drive it that the tax credit oh dude yeah it's awesome that's always been my thing like anybody like you know listen you drive a Tesla that's fine right like okay cool right but don't tell me is because you're trying to save the world bro just say you just you know you're gay just say that like it's fine I mean like just say you like you know I'm saying just say you like the out the same sex it's fine yeah you know I'm saying but don't try to give me on a environmentalist high horse you know I'm saying I ain't going yeah dude they are fast though they are fast they're quick yeah okay look you know that's the other thing these dudes that got them little drove yeah I don't fuck a faster than anything that you own yeah on fucking look do you know how stupid it is to drive fast on a fucking little donut tires like that I wonder how many people fucking kill themselves in these Teslas for real bro for real you remove that video of them kids jumping jumping that Tesla yeah fucking yeah was a California somewhere and dude let's be real the cars are not built for that kind of performance you know and that is whatever you know people don't understand cars talk that shit they don't yeah cars is like a visceral experience bro it's it's a completely different thing than driving a Tesla you nerds that drive Teslas and think you got some cool shit I can't help it that you're fucking you're born without a dick all right I can't help it right here man that's different he's from India he don't know no better he don't know any better bro well he he was over there shit in holes and stuff he catered he can't he saw a Tesla he thought it was like fucking the greatest technological thing in the whole world oh fuck me it actually is pretty cool but like I'm not driving this yeah I like women bro it's like it's like a mo pad you know you'd be you'd be fun to drive you don't want to be seen on it yeah yeah man it's crazy man but yeah so that's stuff's going on with Elon Musk he's getting some heat but it's not just Musk that's getting heat Trump's starting to get some heat now oh starting starting to get some heat but I'm seeing some some some similar cycles that we've already seen which is scary me US Secret Service shoots armed man near White House after confrontation do you see this here about this um this is interesting story so an adult male brandishing a firearm were shot by US Secret Service officers near the White House in Washington DC shortly after midnight on Sunday the agency said the encounter happened near the intersection of 17th and F streets um MPR reports local police had earlier reported a suicidal individual possibly traveling to DC from Indiana the agency said the full statement by the secret services below on Sunday March 9th and adult male was shot by US Secret Service personnel following an armed confrontation with law enforcement in Washington DC earlier on Saturday local police shared information about a suicidal individual who may be traveling to Washington DC from Indiana around midnight members of the secret service encountered the individuals parked vehicle near 17th and F streets they also saw an individual on foot matching the description nearby as officers approached the individual brandished a firearm an armed confrontation ensued during which shots were fired by our person now suspect was transported to an area hospital in his condition is unknown remember reported injuries to secret service personnel the incident is under investigation by the metropolitan police department internal affairs divisions force investigations team got lowered which investigates all law enforcement officer involved shootings in the district of Columbia interesting stuff i mean but like the the must-off even this right like who are they who are these people who are these people i mean brother assuming you have the answer yeah we all know who they are but why won't they just call it like it is like what why is this not considered insurrection you got people shooting up fucking Tesla stores and stuff like where we don't call that insurrection we don't call like i mean these are not insurrection it's just being a criminal you know it's destruction of property you know i don't know what the charges would be but that's not insurrection Tesla's not the capital it's true but i mean yeah but like listen dude they're upset over a listen there's been a double standard of justice in this country for many years okay many many years all right if you're conservative or you're right leaning or you're white there's one set of rules if you're a minority if you're left if you're uh you know trans or any of these there's another set of rules and and that's that and and dude that is part of the communist playbook it's written about in rules for radicals written about in Karl Marx it's written about 1984 by George Orwell um you know they make the criminals into the heroes and they make the heroes into the criminals and we see this look at Daniel Penny a year and a half in jail for standing up for people around him by the way he was standing up for black people so like you know i would be surprised if they didn't like try to blame the guy who actually did the shooting here you know this is it's insane shit and you know it's got to change yeah well i mean this Monday the show's been recorded i mean dude it got started off on a very very interesting foot so you got that happened in last night you wake up twitter's being de-dost basically um and then at the same time United States Air Force uh to scramble f-16s again after two aircraft violates airspace in a trumps morning that was today this morning yeah that happened yesterday yeah the second time yeah uh first Air Force America's AOC uh tweeted this out saying for the second time this weekend at norad command fighters intercepted an aircraft violating the Palm Beach uh TFR players were deployed during the intercept the FAA and norad urge pilots to check no dams before every flight um so i mean dude it's just it's now it's a test they're testing the seats yes they're testing to see how close they can get and what the response is 100% dude it's wild it's wild so you got all this going on but there is some good news today um it's a great day um DC to begin reconstructing black lives matter plaza did you see this yeah so the work began uh this morning um in DC um to basically destroy the black lives matter plaza uh get it out i didn't know there was one yeah oh that was you remember that uh the one here's a picture of it um you remember they did those do they wait they that that's still up yeah it's still hold on that's still on the road that's still paying on the road DC paying on the road the b- shut the fuck all of that stuff that's still there still there well it won't be after a couple of days but yeah well remember when they put that black lady in jail for vandalizing it mm-hmm she gonna she gonna get hurt justice to 40 acres in the mule yeah yeah i mean what what's crazy i mean so this all came from trump right because trump pressured the DC mayor to do this it's basically saying he's gonna withhold some federal funding to get rid of this um and so their construction started today here's a clip you know so they're going like so they're removing the the the ballerge to open it up the street that's not just like a solid paint like i mean that's embedded into the concrete um that's in there um and you know it's interesting because i did a little digging um i found this lady tweeting about it she says right now the department of transportation says removing bel implaza is estimated to cost about six hundred and ten thousand dollars in local funds um seven news is asking why now and what happens next well i thought this was intermittent right because i'm like okay yeah why now why didn't why didn't they already do this yeah it should have been done years ago it should never went up that's correct but you know a little over half a million dollars to remove this uh well i mean i think that's accurate that's an accurate uh from the size of that and i mean all right it's massive that seems like what it should take you know what it would typically take if doge and trump weren't office it would be forty seven million dollars right right well you know how much they spent to put this thing there probably a good example of what i just said four million dollars yeah that's right four i mean that's not like what two maybe one block total right it's like half of one block yeah i mean one one square block maybe not even a square block i mean one fucking street four million dollars for that four million dollars but it just made me it's you know made me made me think about this you know because i'm sure a lot of people are upset a lot of a lot of uh by-pack people are upset at this um but it just made me think man who by-pack by-pack and then what they're called who or who who who who is called that huh what is by-pack i don't know what it means i just know they say it all the time it's like something like black indian people of color so i'm sure like that i think i've heard it before i just i've never been always came out of the mouth of dumb mother fucker so i listen to it i never heard anybody smart say by-pack yeah that's i mean that's what what is it black indigenous and people of color that's how you it's like you know so you got like a flock of words the white people in there we call that clan yeah so you got like well hold on how come white people are excluded from that that's racism well no i mean yeah no i mean it's like you know like a flock of geese yeah right so you got flock of geese group of black people is called by-pack group of white people is called a clan you got you know but it made me think man maybe because i'm sure a lot of people have said about this but it just made me think about you know like now they know what we felt like you know when they were going around turning down statues of motherfuckers that actually fought yeah like general grant right president grant you know like a dude who was on the ground freeing slaves killing slave owners then became president of the united states they're tearing down a statue that's the iq capital of the people doing this um fucking morons it's insane it's insane it's dude stood for the same shit you're standing for you're right right right radically not only dude you got my foot he started the radical republican party which became the republican party which was the party that actually was for unity and not for slavery and it's interesting you know oh it switched in the 60s now the fuck you didn't now we still have democrats saying the same as shit what are we gonna do to port all the uh the migrants so we don't have anybody pick our fruit only back then it was what are we gonna do let all the black people go so we know anybody to pick our cotton like it's the same fucking thing the same thing bro so and it's the same people and they manipulate minute dude these are the same people that used to go to slaves you know life's much better here it's much better here than it is out there they want you gone yeah yeah these guys over there they'll kill you we're at least taking care of you man that's what they fucking tell these people it's crazy and like you know the whole thing about grant being a slave owner he never bought a single slave he got them through marriage his father and I gifted them you know their their slaves quote-unquote and what happened to that slave it was freed within a year then he won the civil war prosecuted KKK members the ones he didn't kill they were still alive prosecuted them did you know he's also one of the first presidents to appoint African-Americans to prominent roles in government I mean like and then they tear like they tear statues down you know I'm saying so like yeah get rid of this shit I'm fucking over it um it's wild it's stupid last little bro this is what happens when smart people allow dumb people to have their way like we can no longer as common sense Americans black white yellow red fucking I don't care allow stupid people to have an inch on anything because they clearly take a mile that's that right um um we got to stop feeling sorry for people because and and by the way I don't know if anybody's noticed but guilt is the main weapon of these people okay these people who break all the rules and cause all the destruction and do all the damages society and then they use guilt against you when you say hey that's not right then they say well they're having a much harder life than you you know they don't know any better right like if whatever but they make up some stupid ass excuse for all these people you know like I saw this video uh of this naked woman running up and down a southwest airline fallout saw that yeah and nobody did shit there's little kids there's this there's that she's going insane nobody did a fucking thing okay and that is why we are here because no people out in public will stand up for what's right anymore they won't stand up they won't say it's wrong they're afraid getting yelled at on the internet they're afraid to get in fire they're afraid to be in called names and so they look the other way when all this crazy shit happens or worse they pretend to play along with it and if we're ever going to get back to reality in this country we're going to have to stand up and say no that ain't right we're not tolerating that when a naked lady runs up and down the plane somebody is fucking tackler okay I don't give a fuck who does it that's not appropriate it's not okay and it is dangerous if someone's willing to run up and down the plane naked what are they willing to do probably anything okay so I don't give a fuck of a man does it or a woman does it but I could bet you could bet a million fucking dollars if a dude stands up and tackles that woman the defenses she's gonna sue southwest a defense attorney's gonna say oh she's the victim she's having mental health she's yeah clearly dude that doesn't mean we should all tolerate it and let him do whatever they want so just let her run around the fucking plane bro and and these people feel sorry for criminals like they feel like you feel like bro if you

crumbling of civilized society the people who enable it all right real bro grant wouldn't be standing for this shit I'm not standing for this shit I don't think anybody else that listen to this show

have a right in an expectation to be able to enjoy the fruits that their tax dollars produce not have them filtered out of the country or embezzled in the politicians pockets I would like to go downtown and see a beautiful city with many businesses and entertainment and things to do and a thriving local economy where there isn't a bunch of people throwing Molotov cocktails and burning the mother fucker down and then being allowed to do it like bro criminals or criminals that's it and anybody who does shit like that needs to go to fucking jail and and they need to go for a long time and and once we start putting people in jail for a long time for doing some of the shit that's been allowed for the last five six years ten years people guess what guys people will stop doing it because they'll say fuck they put me they put fucking Steven jail for 15 years for throwing that Molotov cocktail they put you know Joe and jail for 20 years for punching that cop in the face I mean bro let's make some fucking let's make some consequences for the actions and the things will take care of themselves 100% man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think in the chat did you see that thing where they're making it they're trying to make it a death penalty to a to kill a cop yeah so I fucking love that it's great but it should be like that if you kill anybody yeah it's right there yeah yeah no that's a good point man yeah guys let us know without being so let's go check some of these comments out let's do it let's do it in this first comment bro I'm riled up now now you got me up fucking upset dude I'm so tired it's not it's common sense bro listen I've worked my balls off from my whole adult life okay I've worked my ass off do you know much money I've paid in taxes bro over course my life especially considering like my companies and everything bro it's not it's it's absurd amount of taxes I can't even go downtown my own city that's not okay dude but I remember I was downtown when Alex and I took our engagement picks yeah remember dude call me yeah dude cuz I got stabbed bro right in front of us yeah like you know I'm saying yeah you moved into my guest house because during the George Floyd riots they were fucking shooting guns on your street every night okay that's not okay no you shouldn't have to move and by the way it's not like you had some shitty place you had a nice loft apartment it was fucking nice and that dude this that kind of like there's so many things that good people have to do to work around the criminal element in this country because it's been enabled by people who never have to be around the crime and it's it's it's shitty dude yeah and dude all of us who pay taxes we should be able to go in our city and enjoy our city without being threatened or car jacked or fucking harass bro I can't walk down the street and and and and St. Louis I can't walk down my own street and I think everybody wants what I'm saying yeah I don't think anybody doesn't want it so why aren't we fucking demanding it why aren't we demanding law in order why why is it like that there's still groups of people out here that make excuses for any crime that can be committed like dude it's really kind of a black thing it's a black thing yeah what is it about the black culture where cuz like dude in white culture I'm being serious dude I'm I want to know this question I want to answer this I'm not I'm not joking if a white dude has a cousin or an uncle or somebody they know who like cooks math or which happens bro or shoot somebody which happens okay we don't sit there and say oh poor fucking Steve you know they're picking on him that's now we say we say fucking Steve's an idiot bro he deserves to fucking go jail sorry man that sucks for him he shouldn't done that or when Steve gets his ass beat by cops for fucking you know you you're like fuck dude I'm kind of glad they beat his ass because otherwise he might do something worse next time right but not in a black communities zero and we see it on the fucking community pages right zero accountability a kid listen a young kid commits a crime 17 kills people oh they're picking on him this is no he's fucking killing people those people had families that was a brother sister or mom or dad like what the fuck are we why is it that why is it that way what is that I don't I don't know the specific answer brought me is it is it am I accurate in saying that that's true 1000% okay no brothers and like there is definitely a lack of accountability when in the black community specifically now I mean why I got that way how I got that way I think for a couple of reasons brought me and it's been allowed to get that way you know I'm saying like when you have you put those prosecutors in that don't fucking prosecute the crime to the point even when people come to agree with that confess the crimes yeah they're not prosecuted you know I'm saying like I mean that fucking seven-year-old kid and no size of the list killed in the fucking drive by I can test to do turns himself in a week later after seeing all of the fucking shit like hey I did that didn't mean to do it it was a fucking sorrows prosecuted attorney drop charges yeah not enough I filed it not enough evidence you know I'm saying so I mean it's like you know yeah but I'm talking about the community like why doesn't the community want to hold people accountable so that they have a safe community well I think that's part of it I mean like because they they kind of like I mean this new the prosecuting thing that's not new it's been happening for a long time right and when you look at the fact okay well like if I know that I snitch on this person I tell you on this person and like yeah he did it he's coming right back out now I'm in a threat from my life bro you see it on the community pages that we follow like dude they'll show a mug shot of of a white dude and there'll be 400 comments um fucking blah blah blah blah and that's fine cool yeah that's fine agree because that guy is a piece of shit and he did do those things fuck that guy I'm with it but the minute that there's a black person I hold on yeah the minute there's a black person in the fucking post two comments yeah nobody's saying shit hashtag free my boy yeah and then if you go on there and say well why isn't everybody upset about this then you get yelled at you know it's just dude that has to be fixed if if we expect to fix what's going on in this country the the black communities are American citizens it's not like they just live here yep dude I just yeah I just don't get it yeah I don't know man yeah I don't know I don't know but uh let's go to cruise some comments yeah this first comment comes

crats demon crats demon crats yeah he came and told me that and he's like hey hey hey hey hey I got a really good idea yeah I thought it's something yeah I was like okay he's like you know like Democrats I'm like yes demon crats he's like oh that's this fucking this great he was so proud of yeah he's so proud like he thought he really fucking did something man he's like you're gonna copyright the shit yeah yeah I was like yeah dad all right demon crats demon crats yeah demon crats yeah now it's spiral demon crats they're calling out their own now CNN star van Jones gives blistering on air diatribe about why dims apocalypse is only getting worse so we know van Jones he cries a lot on TV we've seen him you just have to jump in and start ripping people now he's a former Obama advisor okay this is I mean you don't get more of a demon crat than this guy I mean he's he's bought in okay he's he's 100% in but he warned the Democrats don't know what to do due to discord within the party he then framed the situation as a nightmare worsened by its loss of the house of representatives to the republican party let's check this out where's crude I mean we don't know no democrats don't know what to do this is this is a nightmare you know somebody like Donald Trump we thought we'd at least have you know he came Jeffries and the speakers chair to hold them back if we didn't have common in there to do the right thing listen the democratic party is going through a massive set of internal crises you have a party they got trapped two ways one defending a broken status quo that nobody likes because they thought the Donald Trump was going to make it worse but when you're defending the status quo you're going to lose and then offending most people in the country calling everybody sexist and racist and transphobic and every other name what else they please follow us that's not a good strategy folks defending a broken status quo and offending most of the country turns out it's not as popular as my party thought it was going to be no shit you don't say what let's not forget Kamala coming out of week before the election calling everybody fucking Nazis okay let's not let's not forget you guys wanting to normalize the sexualizing of children let's not forget uh you know the status quo of you sending trillions of dollars and printing trillions of dollars all over the fucking world right okay let's not forget um you know grown men competing in women sports and then celebrating it let's not forget all the backwards disgusting culture that's promoted by your quote unquote party okay your party lacks leadership and the reason it lacks leadership is because no fucking decent leader wants to lead an army of dumb mother fuckers represents that okay they're gonna lose all right and here's the other part they continue to hammer that same message down people's strokes people have rejected this the woke culture all the shit it's over okay and this sympathizing and sit dude guilty people into certain things only works when they're in a good situation and the other person's in a worse situation but when you guilt people when they have trouble buying fucking eggs and the reason they have trouble buying eggs is because your administration killed hundreds of millions of chickens for no reason okay to create a shortage right now so that you could talk about it everybody's caught on to what these people are about you're about creating the problem promising the solution ignoring the solution letting the problem get worse and repeating that cycle over and over and over gather news has been talking about building the high speed rail train in California for 20 years and every year he comes in and he says we just need a few more billion dollars and we can finish it dude you could have built a high high high speed rail system around the fucking countries around the world under the oceans and all that shit for the money I spent all right you guys are stealing the money you're all getting rich and we all know you're stealing the money because you're all too fucking stupid to get rich on your own all right like let's be real about what's going on every the Democrats I know that I've known my whole life they are embarrassed by the shit that gets pushed by you guys but you continue to hammer it in people's faces and you think that you know he says oh well you know the apocalypse from Democrats was only getting worse no shit right because we've already said no we don't want that we are tired of d.i. we are tired of the green energy we are tired of the woke cancel culture nonsense where you can't say anything can't tell a joke can't do this or that and being beholden to these laws as business people that force us to put people in places that they don't deserve to be in just dude all of it all of it okay it has to be fucking stopped and you guys coming in and saying about you know hammering the message even harder is just gonna make it worse and I'm glad they're doing it like dude there's a you know there's this thing they never stop your enemy from making mistakes bro bro they just you know when they when not one single fucking Democrat voted to ban the the dudes and when the sports are not only that dude and then you want us to still like they fucking wouldn't clap for a 13 year old kid right who who who has brain cancer like come vote to real talk your fucking party is filled with a bunch of corrupt immoral pieces of shit and there might be a corrupt immoral pieces of shit on the other side too and I know there is but you're full of them yeah every single one of the motherfuckers all of them there's not a single good Democrat in fucking office all the good ones have switched sides okay there's not in that Congress in that Senate there every single one of them if you want Democrats if you want your party to ever come into power again you shouldn't hang your hopes on aoc and had came Jeffries those people are communists and America's not gonna fuck with that so if you truly care about getting your party back you have to find candidates that actually represent classical Democrat values which by the way are going to sound a lot like Republican values because the over 10 window has shifted to the left conservatives are now what you what would be called a moderate 10 years ago they're not conservative anymore which by the way I don't mind because I think the fully conservative shit is is is just as bad as their shit we have these people do not have the right to control our lives in any way shape or form period the government exists to defend us and to protect us and to serve as a facilitator of progress and allocation of our tax dollars into productive causes that make Americans lives better that is not sending money to Ukraine that is not sending money to Israel that's not sending money to Black Lives Matter that's not stealing the money and coming in with a $300,000 net worth and leaving with $80 million all of this shit has to stop it all has to stop and you know this is what you get for being fucks yeah 100% well I mean other interesting things with the you know the start to come out now too is this new report that comes in that the majority of Biden documents were signed by auto pin signature raising some eyebrows yeah you think he could write his own name I mean now I mean it's interesting dive into you so let's let's look into this a little bit so it's the heritage foundation they released a report which found that the majority of official documents signed by president Joe Biden were auto pin signature raising questions over if he actually ordered the signature a relevant legal documents now the oversight project on Twitter they wrote this saying whoever controlled the auto pin controlled the presidency we gathered every document we could find with Biden signature over the course of his presidency all used the same auto pin signature except for the announcement that the former president was dropping out of the race last year here is the auto pin signature well first let me show you the real his real signature so this is his authentic signature again when he was dropping out of the presidential race this is the signature he signed on that release here is the auto pin signature okay so clearly not the same not the same right more importantly all of the the the seven partners that he signed on January 19th and the consecutive ones he signed on January 20th hours you know minutes before he actually officially left the office they were all auto pin all these people in his administration deserve to be in prison so I mean now that that's not that's not okay it's not okay no no you know I'm saying I mean because like listen we can joke and say that this man was you know had cognitive decline and we can say he wasn't all the way with it right but I mean if he truly wasn't all the way with it then who was signing all of this that that's I mean I think that is a fair question to ask and well I don't think it's a secret dude I think everybody knows that everybody in the White House reports to Obama I think reported to Obama I think everybody knows that Obama said himself that you know I don't I would never want a third term but you know if I could never get another third I could ever have like a earpiece and basement and like tell people what I would like to do that well that's exactly what he did and people are afraid of Obama for whatever reason I don't know why and you know he's been calling the plays in this country since 2008 except for that four years span when Trump was and I still think he was then I think he has so much power and so much control and I actually think he's tried to go I think he's trying to go away now because I think he understands all going to come out it's going to implicate him but this motherfucker's been putting down communist ideology in this country for nearly 20 years all right and you know maybe he wasn't the one using the auto pen but I bet he was telling you know I don't know KGP seems to have been awfully fond of Biden in a very genuine way and I you know it makes me wonder like is Biden calling her and saying hey use the auto pen here here here here here right I mean dude we don't know yeah but I have my speculations I mean I've always thought too like I mean like even with you in business right like you know I've seen you mean like there's things that you actually have to fucking sign and I'm saying like you can't just auto pin fucking everything yeah you know I'm saying and I would just you know like to think that you know the president of the fucking United States of America the leader of the free world you know I think I mean you would hope I'm sure he has to sound a lot of shit too but I mean fuck I mean you're giving away presidential parties preemptive parties for shit that you know people allegedly never even done you would think that that would come with a little bit more weight they gave pardons out for things that they said for years and years and years never happened never happened never happened and so if they never happen what do you need a pardon for right wow you know Trump is Trump is Hitler so he's gonna prosecute well if he's actually Hitler he's gonna give a fuck about your partners so what difference is a pardon make then make any then make any but you know this being the great state of Missouri we got a lot of great people here yeah like Andrew Bailey Andrew Bailey is in on the action maybe he sent this in this is a letter that he he sent out a few days ago regarding the legality of presidential actions and might have president Biden's mental decline and he sent this to the Department of Justice hoping that they they start an investigation into it to even see if any if not just these pardons but anything was fucking legit which we're bringing a lot of stuff into question every single executive executive action that he's done I mean brings into question a lot of that stuff if Biden was actually the one you know doing that and if he had the mental capacity I mean shit they didn't prosecute him because they said he didn't have mental capacity you know I'm saying like that I think that's a wrong it's another example of the cultural double double standard okay when it's convenient he has no mental problems when it's inconvenient he has mental problems you see right right it's interesting so we're gonna keep our eyes on this man this is uh look forward to see what happens with this but let's shift let's let's go north of the border um what do they call it snow floored up no wait they have a what do they call it call it something up there let's go to Canada um interesting stuff happened up there Ontario slaps 25% tax increase on electricity exports the United States in response to Trump's trade war I like how they'd like to call this a trade war it's it's interesting um but yeah Ontario's premier the leader of Canada's most populist province announced an effective Monday that's today it is charging 25% more for electricity to 1.5 million Americans in response to US President Donald Trump's trade war Ontario provides electricity to Minnesota New York and Michigan quote I will not hesitate to increase this charge if the United States escalates I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely um Ontario premier Doug Ford said at a news conference in Toronto okay let's see how that goes for you um now what's awesome I mean we probably just go take it rather than saying that shit so much in comments lately no I'm just being real like okay well I mean dude if I was Trump and they did that I just go take it yeah the fuck you gonna do well that's like what's with all of these people thinking they can just openly threaten like like well that's my point is that they they they're not living in reality dude they're not living in reality your week we're strong that's it that's natural order that's how the world's operated for fucking 13,000 motherfucking years conquerors some people they get that's right that's it that's it and that and they could dress it up and they can say it's diplomatic or uh you know we're gonna be gentlemen and we're gonna treat each other it's all the same it's the same as it's been and unless we understand that it's that way then other people will do that to us which they have been doing they've been doing that to us for years the reason you pay the taxes you pay is because other countries have been doing that to us and you know our politicians have agreed to it so you know it's a big it's a big financial uh fuck job you know they charge us the politician send it overseas for some bullshit the politicians keep get a kickback or keep part of it or a lot of it and we pay for it and that's been going on for as long as I've been alive all right so we have to get into a situation where uh reality is reality again and the reality is this you shut off electricity to to 1.5 million of my people I'm gonna fucking come take your little electrical plant and you ain't gonna have it you kind of off to one person yeah so I would imagine that that will be some Trump's response will will be as harsh or harsh as that dude so what you can't let this shit fly no dude listen listen people don't understand average American doesn't understand because we've all lived in in our whole lives how big and how bad the oppression and the financial uh you know slavery is imposed on us bro every country benefits from our labor every country gets some sort of not everyone but a lot of them most more than us yeah and um yeah so what did Trump say anything about this I haven't seen a response just yet I haven't seen a response I mean at least at the time of the recording um but I'm I'm sure he's not gonna let this go and check now now Canada also did something else into it and here feel free feel free to come you know try to take our shit yeah because that's the rules okay the rules are everything is on the table yeah do you think you can come take it if you think you can come take it one point of you think you can stop us from taking it they can't and they can't come take our shit and that's the reality yeah now now Canada did something else uh in a in a uh go with the flow communist fashion um not sure if you saw this but um this just came out Canadian Liberals select globalist techno crack mark kerni to replace Justin Trudeau as prime minister um now they have a different set up of government they did this with it out without an election of the people yeah I saw that right um so the Justin Trudeau era is coming to a close in Canada with the governing liberal party selecting former central banker mark kerni as his new leader an eventual prime minister on sunday the leadership contest sparked by prime minister Trudeau's resignation in January came to a close on sunday evening with former bank of Canada governor mark kerni winning the internal party election having 185.9% of the vote kerni bested former finance minister and deputy PM Kristia Freeland at 8% former cabinet minister kerni a gold at 3.2% and businessman and former MP frank bailess at 3% cbc uh reports perhaps demonstrating a lack of enthusiasm of the approximate 400 000 liberal party members which that's insane like Canada is so it's such a weird setup they're going to have a really hard time adjusting to the uh our representative democracy we have here um they're going to have a hard time adjusting because uh their parties completely run the show tops about them left to right um but yeah so they have 400 000 people in this liberal party that that get to make up these decisions um and a little bit over 150 000 actually voted for it um votes being cast um so there's the results again 85.9 almost 86% of the vote went to mark kerni but who is this guy I mean we know he was a banker right um but there's some some interesting stuff that just came out breaking right here on really f uh kerni campaign pushes back on Maxwell photo says they are not friends however they looked like friends in the photos they're friends that's his wife in the white shirt that's nice even black there's even better ones than that oh yeah them laying on the beach together that's right oh yeah um there's definitely something and there's definitely some close to us now listen up you know let's play devil's album no let's let's just tell the truth all these global foxer pedophiles and they all fucking go fuck kids and there's very few that don't and they run the fucking world and we sit here and and allow ourselves to get lied to and gaslit and be made to think we're assholes for looking at all the obvious things and pointing them out okay that's the truth so let's just say what it is these people if you associate with pedophiles you're probably a fucking pedophile okay and these people all associate with these people and it's funny because they all make the same decisions and they all get on the same train and they all have aligned political beliefs and they all go to the same world conferences and we can go on and on and on they go to the same private parties on and on and on and on and on why do you think that is it's not because they're all aligned it's because they are told to do this or else and then all the while the or the do this comes with money fame power prestige running in the highest quote unquote elite circles in the world private jets nice cars big houses all that shit that's what doing it comes with and then not doing it comes with embarrassment and rejection and prison and probably death okay so best case scenario you just become a fucking nobody well you mean that because these people like pride themselves off of power look dude we have to start saying what it is we cannot continue to dance around and pretend this isn't what's going on and it's not conspiracy it's not conspiracy it's not oh this is some crazy shit I saw on the internet it's real shit it's been happening for a long time it's how people who develop communism rule the world and it needs to stop and dude whether Trump stops it or not it needs to stop and if that means all of us who are regular citizens that don't fuck with kids needs to rise up and fucking overthrow every motherfucker on this planet then that's what needs to happen that's it okay so let's stop dancing around the fucking problem either Trump's gonna fucking fix the problem or he's not and if he doesn't we have to and that's that real man guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think man that being said cruise full steam ahead am I wrong no no no no I mean that's definitely give me back on the list I don't give a fuck I don't fucking these are kids dude we can't we can't we we can't come together over the innocence of childhood well we're not even free it's not even a free country it's we are so far away from a free country it's it's laughable it's laughable that we believe that we're free just because you can come and go as you please and you're not in a jail cell doesn't mean you're free all right we don't get to keep our money we got to send it to them we and if we don't what happens to us we go to jail all right if if we ran our companies like they run the government the people who run the companies would be in jail there's they get to do things we don't get to do things that's not free that's not equality that's not that's not equal opportunity okay they live off the backs of our labor no different than fucking source did it back in the dark ages bro they're the kings and queens we're the fucking peasants they're in the club we're not in the club and the reason those people all defend each other is because they all do disgusting shit that's all on camera or recorded or blackmail to the point where they are willing to die on that hill for everybody else it's actually brilliant how they did it it's brilliant how they did it but that doesn't mean that it's right and I'm quite honestly I'm really sick of people pretending like it's not what's going on so yeah they all I'm not going to fucking I'm not going to my deathbed saying that I was too big of a pussy to fucking talk about what what's actually happening it's real man it's real guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys what you know don't hold on dude like you got a lot of you guys are reviving Christianity and you post about your bibles and God and all this you what would God think of you for not speaking up for fucking children that are being molested and used in blackmail operations do you think God would approve of that right you think you're a good person by staying out of it no you're not a good person by staying out of it that actually makes you not a good person you know something's wrong and you're staying out of it that means you're complicit in it period yeah man don't shoot the messenger it's a truth it's a truth it's a truth it's a truth if you if you walk by one of these people doing this disgusting shit to a child and look the other way what like if I said that to you hey would you walk by one of these disgusting people doing this disgusting shit oh no no I would never do that except you do it every day because you all know what the fuck's going on but you don't say shit it's the same thing anyway yeah man well guys let's go down to the comments what you guys think that being said let's get to our third and final headline we got headline number three now there's been a minute on this topic but there's some some new interesting stuff that's starting to come out let's dive into this just a little bit headline number three reads a former CDC boss reveals bombshell new evidence of COVID cover up and says father of the virus Fauci concealed Wuhan lab leak to protect us spies embedded in China this is now there's a lot to cover here I mean this is this is this is this is weird okay this is weird but let's talk about it we got Robert Redfield this guy he is the former director of the CDC and when he was the director when the pandemic erupted has accused American and British intelligence agencies of orchestrating a clan desktime campaign to shut down concerns over a possible laboratory leak in China and an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail the well-renowned virologist says he is now 100% convinced that COVID-19 was the result of scientists becoming infected while carrying out high-risk experiments to boost the infectivity of bat viruses amid low bio security and laboratories in the city of Wuhan he believes that Fauci former chief medical adviser to president Biden worked with the heads of us in UK research funding bodies to push a now debunked theory of natural transmission from animals on sale in the Wuhan wet market to humans now he says this was all a bit cover up to for the support of controversial gain of function research which was banned in the United States between 2014 to 2017 and any dissenting scientists were labeled as conspiracy theories now redfield he fears security services secretly pulled a lot of strings to protect their agents inside China's military linked laboratories pointing to Fauci's ties with intelligence since 2004 while running the 38 billion dollar a year US bio security program now these are the four main points that came out okay from this interview was hours long he called Fauci the father of the virus and saying that it was basically his idea all the way along to do this shit to violate US law to continue to push this stuff redfield said he believes the lab leak occurred between mid-August and september of 2019 when scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Biology became infected and then spread the virus around the city he argues that China's leaders covered up the lab leak from mid-September when their military took full control of the lab on the same day the lab took virus databases offline in order to new ventilation system he suspects that October 2019 military world games when thousands of athletes converged on Wuhan that played a significant role in spreading of it he also reveals he received fake anthrax threats death threats after saying he suspected a possible lab leak immediately after this was back in 2020 early 2020 and he calls for investigations into what he says was Fauci's cabal he's still lying he's scared you're scared okay you're telling me first of all this motherfucker shit was developed in the US which we covered in months ago the no not months ago in 2020 years ago yeah okay we said it and they deleted our mother fucking episode off the fucking internet okay then they shipped it from the United States to Wuhan because it was illegal for us to do any of the shit here but in China it's legal so then you're telling this is where I have a problem so you're telling me that this was it intentionally put out in the world even after event 209 201 yeah 201 which was a which was the I for it's been so long I've got simulation the plan simulation that happened in October of 2019 of this exact scenario down to how they were going to respond and who was going to be held accountable all of the shit so you're telling me that that was just a coincidental you know oops that it got out of the lab no motherfucker it was it was purposefully let out of the lab in the time frame when the world military games were happening because they knowing how they think we're thinking well if we kill the fucking militaries around the world or we get them real sick then everybody will be powerless to this globalist revolution that we're trying to throw so you're going to tell me that that's not actually what happened right or even just a vaccine response get them out of the look though after watching all of this and hearing Klaus Schwab and hearing all these people seeing Klaus Schwab write books about the great reset COVID-19 the great reset literally wrote a book about it wow the book came out in the beginning of COVID all right so you're telling me that it was just a coincidence that the world military games were there and that you know this guy here thinks it just accidentally got out no motherfucker they put it out during the world military games that's the likely scenario and to spread it around everybody's military they know that everybody's going back home dude it's crimes against humanity does everybody involved in it deserves death penalty 100% now I want to switch everybody the media the propagated the people who told them the fucking the people who funded the propaganda everybody all of them I'm not talking about the local doctors I'm not talking about people who were lied to who thought you know hey this is crazy this is crazy but this is happening you know I'm not talking about the people necessarily on TV because they're told to read a script or they lose their job I'm talking about the motherfuckers at the top that we're making the scripts and telling them to read it and putting their money behind dude those people legitimately all deserve to be held accountable for crimes against humanity and to be executed because if we don't they will do it again 100% now I want to switch gears a little bit because here's another thing some more information that just came out switching gears a little bit from covid the JFK files okay there's some interesting stuff that's coming out with that check this out this is an exclusive secret service bosses ordered JFK's motorcade to slow down precisely where Lee Harvey Oswald was waiting and another bomb shows about two foil assassination plots days earlier so this just came out like to a lot of the stuff is coming out sounds a little bit similar to you know we had two assassination attempts oh we have airplanes flying over more logo oh we have dudes with guns coming to the White House this should get heavy I've heard this I know exactly where this goes but please yeah so you know the article kind of goes into it but it gets into the to the meat and potatoes a little bit further down they talk about you know the the wiretaps of the FBI was conducting about this mafia boss leader I mean that that's been floated around here in there but I don't think it was about any of them because you got to keep going through this and it goes it goes down to to November 20th okay there was a articles saying there's a stripper who worked for nightclub owner and mafia fixer Jack Ruby who would become notorious for killing Lee Harvey Oswald she was thrown from a car near the town of Eunice Louisiana Melba Christine Macarties who stage name was Rose Cherimi Charami she was beaten up by her traveling companions and then dumped okay she was rescued by a state treacher where she you know it was taken to the hospital and she claimed that she had been on her way to Dallas to pick up some money and pick up her baby and kill Kennedy um it's interesting and she claimed that these two there was two men who beat her up they were Italians and they were making a drug run for Miami to Houston and that they told her after Houston they were heading to Dallas some murder of the president so this is she's she like this is all documented this is in the releases she told this would actual state treacher it's all documented okay um and it's interesting now on the morning the story continues on the morning of November 18th 62 year old forest sorrows the man in charge of the secret service detail in the city was instructed by a superior to make a slight but important change to the route of Kennedy's motorcade having turned right onto Dele plaza it would now make an abrupt left turn a tweak that would dramatically reduce the speed of the president's limousine between the Texas school book depository building where Oswald worked and they stockade fence at the top of a grassy nole peering down on the plaza um now where what really gets crazy is they talk about why Kennedy was in Texas to begin with and why he was down there he was down there um he flew to San Antonio Texas where he was met by vice president lend and b johnson who is from Texas um but it comes out that apparently Kennedy uh believe that president johnson and jager Hoover director of the FBI at the time um they he thought Kennedy thought they were all corrupt um and of course a powerful political rival Bobby Kennedy wanted him out of the way and i was just as pardoned as trained its uh search lights on the vice president's crooked friends thought that he was tied into the mafia um and Kennedy was basically you know going down there was a surprise trip to basically check in and see what the fuck was going on why his vice president was even going to begin with um and that uh apparently there was a secret uh special investigation into vice president lend and b johnson and jager Hoover that was all happening in the senate um but then we know what happened that morning they changed the fucking route slowed down the motorcade Kennedy is killed 30 minutes later lend and b johnson sworn in as president and the senate investigation committee is done what what what like you said there's been some some attempted assassinations on president trump yeah i believe he's doing some type of covert investigation or malice corruption and shit uh yeah i think everybody knows that bro i think they tried to kill him um twice and i think they're still trying to figure out how to kill him and i think there's a good possibility that some of the people closest to him were in on it dude so i you know this is up is crazy i like and that's the danger of transparency when there has been no transparency that no there's not there's no danger of transparency we're in the in the sense of like i mean how do we even know what they're releasing and calling transparent is true that's the danger of it we we don't we don't you know like i've seen some crazy theories on like you know he was shot by his driver actually and some you know like a weird video angles and stuff like that i don't know um i don't know but it is it's eerily similar to what's happening right now and if the play worked before why change the play run the same play well i mean there is an argument to be made that if they kill trump they got to kill vans too because vans is probably even harder than trump i think he is too i think he is so you know it's a different job than what they did with kennedy uh but i mean i don't disagree that these people that that's all i don't think anybody that's reasonable would disagree that that is on the fucking menu for these people right now i don't think anybody would yeah and um um the faster trump gets accountability done the faster things are gonna get better uh you know this this whole you know i see a lot of videos where people are like you gotta keep giving them time and time and time yeah okay 90 days bro you could do anything in 90 days okay um at some point somebody's got to pull the trigger and fucking say these people did this they're under arrest this is what the fuck they did here's what it is and uh here's what the accountability is gonna be and it's gonna be real harsh you know and that has to happen that if that does not happen we're gonna deal with the same shit in four years we're gonna our kid will be in the same position that we were then all right and i'm not doing that and i'm also not gonna fight for this for my whole fucking life all right like i should be on a fucking yacht real talk so like people are gonna have to make up their mind that this they need to call for accountability because eventually all the people that could and would and should stand up are gonna say fuck this i'm trying to get people to do something they're unwilling to do and if they're unwilling to do it it can't be done and this has to come from the people this has to come from you and me and everybody listening and everybody else that you guys know and if we don't call for accountability and demand accountability at scale there will be no accountability and we will be dealing with this communist shit which is what this is like people are forgetting this they're that now they're going back to talking about it like it's democrat verse republican bro it's not that it is a communist infiltration subversion that's been happening for probably close to a hundred years little by little by little by little and they're in the end stages and unless those people who are the leaders of this are held accountable we're gonna end up dealing with the shit again and only next time when they get everybody to believe they're a little sia up like covid it they'll fucking kill people that's what they do they killed what 60 80 million people in the in the hole in the morris nobody even talks about it nobody even talks about it okay nobody nobody even talks about polpot nobody even talks about mal nobody talks about Stalin why what were they communist okay so who do you think's in charge now that they won't talk about those things but they'll talk about the one thing that actually killed the least amount out of all of those things why were they talk about that but not talk about the rest of the things because the people who are at the top of the world power center are fucking communists and it has to change or we're all gonna fucking be killed that's it and this they use guilt and they use your feelings against you they say look how good your life is and look at these poor people over here and you're a bad person if you don't want to give up everything you have for that and that's how we got here and if we don't stop that shit and kind of harden ourselves a little bit and say no fuck you then bro we're gonna get what we deserve and history will repeat itself guys let us know what you think down in the comments man let us know a lot of step to cover on the show man but that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we
