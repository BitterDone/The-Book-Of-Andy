I hope so. I think we are I'm down. It's the only logical place that is going to lead It's it's where everything's leading to Right now we live in this era where there's AI and fake news and we don't know what the fuck is real or fake You know people are making up quotes like You know all these little quotes you see that look like they could be from a news agency Half of them are fake and eventually everything's gonna become so fake that nobody Can tell the difference and they're gonna unplug from Just completely turned off from it. Yeah, and that's like the downfall of oversaturating technology Like these people we were not prepared for humans were not prepared. They're not supposed to live that way dude This is why depressions at an all-time high This is why people think they're fucked up You know, it's lifestyle bro. It's not you're not supposed to do that like you're supposed to be out That's in grass.

So stay tuned for that. It's ready. It is ready But guys, we do appreciate you guys for being real ass fans Um, but that being said, let's keep the cruise cruiser have on to um gotta go to dc a lot of update tapping in there All right, um a lot of interesting things coming out of there. So um one of the biggest things that just happened Senate passes trump backed recision plan To defund pbs mpr and slash bloated foreign aid So the republican controlled senate narrowly approved a sweeping trump endorsed recision bill that slashes nearly nine billion dollars and previously approved federal spending including full defunding of pbs and npr and deep cuts to the us foreign aid by a razor thin 5148 vote during a late night vote the measure advanced through a late night vote arama I was only two GOP senators Susan Collins and uh Lisa mccalsky um side it with democrats to try to block trump's efforts to restore fiscal sanity um democrat senator tina smith was notably absent from the vote her staff citing a hospital stay out of abundance of caution according to politico But you know, you know who that's gonna hurt though Andy That's gonna hurt all the rural people because that's who who listens and watches pbs and npr um This is a CNN article saying that that that's what Brian stelter You Totally credible you know hurt all the rural folks bro Do the beat off on a fucking television? No, no, that was to me. Oh, okay. They zoom in to me. Well, they look the same. They do look alike I do look alike um be either saying that uh nearly three and four americans Say that they rely on their public radio stations for alerts and news for their public safety um That would they they actually literally just four people and three of those four people said that let's be real dude npr this isn't about the funding uh and cutting budget Okay, like the They wrote ending the fiscal insanity No First of all it doesn't take nine billion dollars to run those fucking organizations, okay So there's a bunch of people on the take that's the first thing the second thing is is that these organizations are completely 100% propaganda, the state run media absolute 100% state run propaganda no different than North Korea no different than China The only difference is in China and North Korea they know it's fake Here people think it's real so This has nothing to do with the money. I don't give a fuck about the money clearly What they care about is the propaganda that's coming out of these uh Organizations which is completely biased filled with non-truths And uh it's about eliminating propaganda complete bullshit. Yeah, complete bullshit Now here's another thing that's been happening in DC is there's been some layoffs There's been some people getting fired from interesting positions One of the most recent is a lady named morine comey And she warrants her former colleagues fear is the tool of the tyrant Um, so one day after being fired by the justice department morine comey told a former colleagues that fear is the tool of a tyrant Appearing to take aim at the upper ranks of the DOJ and perhaps the president according to a copy of a message She sent to the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office that was shared with politico um referring to the offices longstanding motto of operating quote without fear or favor Comey who is the daughter of former FBI director James Comey And who prosecuted both Jeffrey Epstein and his associate glean Maxwell she also prosecuted diddy Um or failed to prosecute diddy Is really what it is um, she told a former colleagues in a note thursday that quote uh, we have why is it why is it that she prosecuted Epstein Maxwell and diddy hmm. Isn't that weird? Yeah, that's weird. How many how many it's like she strategically put in the plaza how many prosecutors in her position are there? Hmm. Can we find that out? Can one of you guys look that out? What is she a federal prosecutor? Yeah, how many federal prosecutors are there 93 so there's 93 federal uh prosecutors correct? Has that total across the U.S.? What was that man head? Says United States. Okay, so total okay, so one person happens to get all three hmm All three are thought to be related. That's weird. Oh man. That's a different light you're putting it in the Yeah, because people are fucking stupid. Hmm. And you know what's here's what i've come to realize yeah talk to me I've come to realize that most of these people on the internet Who have little videos and podcasts and shit they don't want to fuck their talking about Okay, they're either getting paid to say shit or they can't comprehend things critically Further away than one or two steps, right? And they'll just like you know, regurgitate if you've been a listener of the show And i don't say this to fucking throw shade, but this is just facts We've been so far ahead of everybody else that by the time the thing happens people forget that we said that And somebody listens to your episode puts out a new podcast and people think that's their original stuff Yeah, that happens a lot too all that time, but the point is is that It's one thing i have learned bro and it's like dude a lot of people lack the ability to see things They just can't fucking see more than what they're presented right in front of their face. Yep, and uh I don't know like i've always been able to do that So i guess like when you've always been able to do something You kind of assume that other people can do it too, but they can't you know because there's very obvious things happening And i'm gonna talk about them more on the show here I'm sure that people can't fucking see you know, and it's so it's very frustrating To be able to draw these conclusions and be correct about most of them While everybody else is just like It's like what the fuck you guys talking about dude dude. It's so crazy man It is so crazy like how's nobody talking about this yeah, how's nobody talking about the same woman Try it all three of those cases. Do you have a point that's a 1.08% chance yeah out of this means it's fucking impossible almost yeah And then yeah nobody's talking about it and it's so dude. It's so weird and like i know we've been talking about the Epstein stuff Because i mean even if the even if the court system Like let's say oh they're all in Manhattan and they're tried all in Manhattan Do you think that it's right that the same attorney has all three of these cases? There's nobody that could think that was right Yeah No It's intentional So anyway move on with the stuff. Yeah, I mean I've got stuff even with that like brother. There's gonna be some implicit bias here No shit especially because you know the prior to getting nothing happened. You have the diddyk nothing happened Like it does it no it's not it doesn't smell right, you know it Don't look good bare minimum um, you know but but along that that talk let's talk about the Epstein stuff because there's some developments there Dude, this is i believe the fourth double down we fat from trump Uh trump tells those focused on Epstein. He doesn't want their support. Um, so this comes out Um president Donald trump on Wednesday trashed many Mago members condemning their ongoing push for files related to Jeffrey Epstein And bemoaning that they are playing into democrats hands So he post this truth out Um on Wednesday Um 843 in the morning I'm saying the radical left democrats have hit paid art again Just like with the fake and fully discredited steel dossier the lying 51 intelligence agents the laptop from hell Which the dem swore had come from russia. No, it came from hunter-bottom's bathroom And even the russia russia russia scam itself a totally fake and made up story used to cover Used in order to hide crooked Hillary Clinton's big loss in the 2016 presidential election. All right, stop right there Before you continue. Yeah, okay, if that's all true then why the fuck if you not put him in jail? Right? Why have you not arrested him? Why are they still walking out? Why are these people still fucking breathing? Okay, if we can say that all right, so if you're saying that yeah, then what the fuck have you done about it? The answer is nothing Okay, continue. Yeah, it's all they have They are no good at governing no good at policy and no good at picking winning candidates Also unlike republicans they stick together like glue their new scam is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein hoax And my past supporters have bought into this bullshit hook line and sinker No, no, no, no, no You talked about it for years Your son talked about it for years Everybody in your administration talked about it for years Bonsino cash Patel Pambondi Every single motherfucker associated with you including you talked about it for years so When you say That we bought it or other people bought it or whoever you're talking to bought it hook line and sinker You're the one that fucking put the bait in the water motherfucker You cannot just look at people and say oh, they're stupid. They're weak. They're this they're that Because they're not believing your message That you put out now If there's other things going on such as what I believe is going on which is this S I'll get to that in a second if there's other things going on Then Why aren't you explaining it a little bit differently instead of just throwing a fucking fit didn't happen Okay, like I have an opinion on this on this whole thing You want to finish reading it and then I'll just know we're going to finish it uh it says um They haven't learned their lesson and probably never will even after being conned by the lunatic left for eight long years I've had more success in six months and perhaps any president in our country's history And all these people want to talk about with strong pride in by the fake news and the success star of dames Is the Jeffrey Epstein hoax that these weaklings continue forward and do the democrats work Don't even think about talk talking of our incredible and unprecedented success because I don't want their support anymore Thank you for your attention to this matter make America great again. Okay All right, and we bought it you sold it bro hold on First of all Let me get this straight You have and you mentioned the steel dossier the laptop from hell Russia R Usher gate scandal all totally fake crooked Clinton did it all this stuff blah blah blah blah blah but yet There's still walking around there has been no accountability. There has been no arrests. There has been no anything To fix that and we as Americans have had to sit here and listen to this shit for fucking 10 years Okay, we had to be told that by the way We were all standing up for you And we had to be told we were fucking Russia propaganda and racist and all this shit all these people Took all this fucking abuse their family not talking to them their friends fucking disowning them then get for for you To now tell them Fuck them, okay, because that's fucked up. That is a fucked up thing to say but I think there's more to it And I have an opinion on what's going on here and a lot of people don't like it But I don't care because the truth of the matter is is that There is more going on here than what people think All right, and there's basically two options that are going on here After watching this for when we brought this up last Friday people got all pissed off Your fucking stick a note for Trump and his his fucking pedophilia. No Nobody is But people think that there's other things going on and and to think there's not is absurd Like you have to be a special kind of dumb mother fucker to think that Donald Trump and what's going on on the surface here Is all that's going on yeah Wars and battles and strategy they are not thought on surface level that is PR that is Relationship management that is crisis management These people work all day long behind the scenes and they only talk to you to get you to calm the fuck down They don't want to tell you shit, which is a fundamental problem in our government the reason that people are upset Trump is because now he's taking this thing and comparing it to all these other things when like I said him his family his Cabinet fucking everybody close to him has been selling this shit the entire time all right Now how I want someone to explain this to me how does the Jeffrey and steam Hokes Become a Democrat hoax to get Trump When because all those other things he mentioned were Democrat quote-unquote hoaxes To get Trump which I agree with right so how Does that become the Epstein thing become a Democrat hoax to get Trump yeah explain that to me Something that they've never even talked about hold on what do they how what what do they have to gain Okay, if if this were true then Explain it. Yeah, okay, cuz like it doesn't make sense. Where's the videos of Hillary Clinton saying it doesn't the Epstein No, why would they do it? What do they gain? What do they gain by fucking making this about Trump do you understand what I'm saying you have rush a gate you have the laptop You have all this the line 51 it tells you if all this shit over here on the left Okay For the last eight years there's been this thing on the right with Epstein all these people are leveraged They're all being told they're all coordinated. All right, so how does this thing go from the right to the left And now it's about getting Donald Trump. I don't understand what the fuck he's trying to say and most people don't either And I don't think he even knows that he's That he's saying that or he does know he's saying that So we have two fucking options here to believe one Trump's Completely implicated and in on it and trying to fucking hide it which you know That's what a lot of people will fucking believe and those same people believe that this is about child trafficking or sexual trafficking which Is bad enough but at the end of the day that's not what this is actually about what this is actually about is that The Epstein and people understand this okay That the Epstein situation is about a power structure that controls the world through blackmail Whether it be underage or not underage whether it just be I don't know Whatever whenever embarrassing they have so People don't want that people don't want to live in a situation where everything is fake and staged and blackmailed and magically, you know, the same group of people keep getting richer and richer and richer and richer They avoid accountability. They avoid any payback and Trump you were put in office to fucking fix that whether you what no matter what you do from here on out If you don't do that you will be the biggest fucking joke that ever existed in the history of the fucking United States Period he will he he can either be the greatest thing that ever happened or the biggest fucking joke that ever happened And that's that's his options. Don't okay now. Let me ask you this Do you think That Donald Trump understands that when he says This didn't happen and this is fake and I don't want these people and this and that and this do you think that he understands That he is Going to create a big buzz around this topic. He's making people look at it. Okay. Hold on. Yes or no. Yeah, does he understand absolutely I think he does. Do you would you understand that? Yeah, okay. I would understand that I think these guys here would also understand that if we were in a room and we were running the country I think it's reasonable for us to be like well, fuck dude if we say that people are gonna get fucking pissed It's pretty much like the worst way he could go about saying it Do we agree or not agree? Couldn't he have done it a bunch of different ways like couldn't they have Let it die out slowly Couldn't they have he's making it live hold on yeah, bro Couldn't they have done a bunch of different ways to make this go away? Couldn't they have made a softer? Could why all the sudden why all the sudden that he come out with this harsh This very harsh statement that the Epstein files do not exist It's fake and anybody who believes it's dumbass and all these things Why? Why would he do that? Okay, why did that just happen out of the blue over the fourth of July weekend? Why why the urgency yeah, all right like if that were us and we were leading the country and we had to make something go away We would probably come up with the idea of like hey Let's just fucking kind of let this die Don't keep stoking the fucking when it comes up. We'll talk about it some more. Yeah, but None of us would say We got to go out and fucking tell mother fuckers. This is fake a shit. We wouldn't come up with that. That's not the plan We would come up with and that's us, okay? I According or you know I know a lot of people think Trump's a fucking idiot All right, but he's fucking not an idiot the guy's not an idiot You took a million dollars to turn it into fucking billions dollars Yes, he's gone through some financial hardships where he had to be bailed out That's pretty normal. There's pretty much every success story that you've ever heard ever the people who Were in it had some hard time where bad things happened and they had to get help It's just part of building something massive Now take this guy who fucking puts his name on his jet puts his name on his buildings puts his name on his resorts puts his name on wine bottles puts his name on socks puts his name on golf apparel All right, you have to pretty big ego to do that think yes, yes, okay, absolutely So you got this guy the biggest okay, you got this guy who thinks very highly of himself mm-hmm and He's been navigating the media for Fucking 30 years 40 years 50 years all right And we're gonna we're gonna sit here and pretend like he doesn't know that the way he's addressing it is going to stir up a whole bunch of shit Really right that that doesn't that's that's that's not a fucking accurate conclusion Regardless of what you think about him that's not that's not accurate Okay, so what I see happening here We see Netanyahu come into the fucking White House the day after Then all of a sudden we see Trump going hardest fuck like this, okay You have Israel whose lost the support of every other country in the world Because they're indiscriminately killing children and now attacking Christian churches And sending missiles to fucking Syria and Iran and mask is all these places, all right They're out of control Period Netanyahu was supposed to be in court yesterday. You know what he did He shot missiles into fucking Syria. This is the third time He was supposed to be in court and then some sort of attack happened October 7th he was doing court The fucking Iran battle he was doing court now all the sudden he's doing this So what does that tell you about him and his cronies? They're desperate They know that if they use if they lose the United States support The world will fucking destroy Israel. That's how pissed off the world is Adam Everybody China Russia all the Muslim nations fucking everyone is like fuck these mother fuckers We're the only thing keeping them from being destroyed All right, this guy's getting ousted by his own people He's desperate. That's a desperate desperate position to be in If I get ousted from government, I go to fucking jail probably be executed if I get We lose America We're gonna get killed So either way he's loses power maybe the whole country So do you think it's a fair assessment that if it came out that Israel Was blackmailing Along with the United States world leaders world influencers media actors musicians etc etc etc Take away the child trafficking shit everybody keeps talking about the child trafficking There isn't a lot of evidence that suggests child trafficking Okay, there's not no, but there is a lot of evidence to suggest blackmail So Take let's just for example I'm not gonna argue that point Because there's people that know more about that than me and even one underage is too many okay sure So but let's remove that from the discussion so we don't get caught up there because everybody's getting caught up there So now you have a situation where you have a desperate person who is colluding with potentially the United States to commit blackmail and crimes and all kinds of things on United States soil Okay, world leaders actors musicians people of influence wealthy people etc All for what so that they can have a major say in controlling everything in the world now If Israel loses the United States now do we think it's fair that if that were all to come out as true That the people in America would say fuck Israel I'm 100% okay because they're already saying it. Yeah, all right everybody's fucking saying it anyway They're tired of the fuck they're not they're tired of Netanyahu and his fucking criminal buddies all right so If it comes out in Israel loses support Israel has this thing called the Samsung option All right, which is basically if Israel were to fall Their Procedure is to shoot nukes all over the world and burn the whole world so how many okay so If Trump reveals the Epstein shit Netanyahu flies them to Washington and says guess what If you don't fucking stop this and I mean stop this right fucking now I'm gonna fucking pull the trigger on this option and you're all fucked hundreds of millions of people will die if not billions What would you do if you're Trump You'd have to put in the power of the people okay so When we look at The way that he is inflaming his base intentionally the way that he's talking about this intentionally abrasively It appears to me that he is intentionally getting people fucking stirred up about it So that he can then look at Netanyahu and be like bro I did what you said and this is what the fuck happened So it's a way of Trump sort of forcing his hand but also putting Netanyahu in a position where He can't really like say that Trump didn't isn't doing what he wants him to do yeah, all right Yeah, and if you think about that demand in general that demand makes sense because of the desperation That's a desperate thought like when people are emotional and they're fucking scared they do stupid shit They don't think logically they don't think like what fuck let's let this calm the fuck down They make a response they say something and then a lot of times it ends up making it worse So How I'm seeing this Because of all that I just explained There is some sort of credible threat Against the United States and I'm not talking about against Trump people keep saying Oh, they're threatening his family no shit. They've been doing that the whole time That hasn't stopped them you don't think they've been putting threats on his family the whole time exactly So What I see Is and this is what I believe is going on I believe that Trump is dealing with a very real incredible threat to the United States where millions of people could potentially die Because that's what it would take for him to squash his ego and go along with this fuck That's what it would take Whether that's the Samsung option saying hey, you know, you're gonna lose support And I'm gonna kill everybody Netanyahu right saying that or You know the fucking border was open for fucking four years bro Who's to say they didn't bring in a bunch of nukes and plan them and fucking every city and You know Just sitting there. Yeah, we got we got nukes in your 10 biggest cities if you fucking don't do this. I'll fucking kill them all All right, and then you got everybody who has lack of foresight And lack of critical thinking just saying oh he's in on it simple. Yeah, simple service listen broke Could that be true sure? But that's not what I'm seeing yeah, we know that because that makes no sense because if he was in on it this whole time He would fucking he wouldn't be agitating people the ways agitating people 100% we're not only that but like If he was in on at the entire time then that means the Biden administration would have been privy to that same incentive right Why don't they really see yeah, right not only that I mean to your point of making the people Talk about it because what are we seeing online bro? We're seeing a bunch of people and all they're doing They're constantly putting out the fucking facts of things that we do know at this time They're constantly putting out there the people like the facts are overwhelming on the internet right now We know what we know the connections are and you know the certain information that's out there People are letting them go People are doing a disservice by getting caught up on the child trafficking part of it Yeah, and not the blackmail part of it right right because dude it could be because if you listen to them your old granny's doing blackmail That's right if you listen to them say it If you listen to them talk about it people are like we want the list we want the names No, that's not what this is about yeah, we don't want that we that's not what this is about you know what this is about This is about fracturing the blackmail operation that controls the narrative of the thickness that we live in every single day That causes the division that causes the oppression that causes the lack of peace and the massive amounts of anxiety And all of these changes society they're apparently nobody wants but they happen anyway all right We are in a situation where a small amount of people are controlling the entire earth for their benefit All right, and we have to stop looking at this little group of people and saying oh well there it's Israel or it's this note what it is Is it's a gang it's a criminal enterprise who Prince money whenever they need it and then gets paid part money back For loaning it out that's that doesn't make sense Okay, and these people are wanting to protect their entire banking system their entire enterprise They're their power their importance their prestige and they're willing to do anything to do it By most accounts at this point in time most people believe most people don't believe that'll some have been lied and Just decided he's gonna knock the trade centers down most people believe that Israel and mason help coordinate the activity, you know the dancing Israelis Uh, you know the fucking insurance scheme building seven all these things And most people believe that Israel created that event to pull us into a war in the Middle East So that we could eliminate people that were threatening them or were a threat to them in any way And I mean who who gave the talk in front of congress that it was fucking Danielle Danielle who's the one that was telling us that weapons of mass destruction existed. I mean So we got this one guy who's basically fucking up the entire earth Okay, and how does he have the power to do that? Unabated How unchallenged how checked because they have everything on everybody And for for this to be ever conquered real talk You're gonna have to be like Conor McGregor and be like fucking. I don't give a fuck pull the cock out Fuckin let me know whatever you got on me, bro. Let it rip. I don't give a shit fuck you And it went severed and by the way, that's kind of biblical That's what revelations is Everything will be all the truths will be told that's what apocalypse means the revealing Right like when we're talking about where we are You know, it's it's not what people think in terms of biblical revelations But the if you really think about it the only way for human beings to break free of This power structure that they've created is to not care if they try to blackmail you and be like yeah, whatever do you don't give a fuck There's no I'm saying. Yeah, so they created cancel culture They created all of this way to leverage people Then they blackmail people and have it ruin their lives Sayin dude like it all fits together And people will say oh, it is this 87d chest no I don't really care And nor do I Nor do I follow or worship or Even really truly give a shit about Donald Trump. I really don't I care about this country and I care about The corruption being ended which is what most Americans care about and If Donald Trump I said this again if he doesn't rip the corruption out of The system he will be a joke for his and the rest of bettabia's like yeah, that would be But I don't necessarily think that's what he's doing I think by the way he's handling and it's very clear that he wants people to be route route up about it You know, I'm saying don't let it go. I don't think he wants people let it go He pressed if he if he wanted people to let it go there's a million other ways you could fucking handle it It's real is there not no there. I mean brother. It's real Because I mean here is a little inside for you guys those same back channels that they have with all the social media companies to you know Quiet down the the COVID narratives. They still got those back channels There's plenty of ways that this shit could have been that's right They could be banning people off social media talking about the f-steen list right now Or is this 100% just completely silencing the fuck away? Most people are fucking up as they keep talking about the kids that are traffic and there isn't a lot of evidence that shows kids were traffic There's a lot of evidence that shows that they used prostitutes and massages and Hookers and fucking all the shit to blackmail motherfuckers All right, but there's not this endless list of children Anywhere to be found. No, okay, and if there was you all know their names You would because they be all talking about it That's what I think that's also the other the other piece of that too That I think will be coming with them the very near future maybe even a week or two weeks out Is we'll start seeing some more whistleblowers come out. Yeah for sure I think that's gonna be the next big thing that could be what he's trying to do Because he it cannot be him it has to be us right and when I mean by like it has to be us that keeps the shit fucking alive There's gonna be some whistleblowers that come out that that will start really truly exposing this shit And again, it's not the child traffic. It's it's our country And a lot of western governments have been leveraged in blackmail To make certain decisions in the interest of a country. Here's here's all I do bro. All I do is I put myself in the shoes as a leader Okay, and very few people have run a company With more than fucking you know a dozen employees Very very few people have run companies like I've run companies. That's the truth very very very very very very few There's an ability There's always chess going on. Okay, there always is And I just don't see I Don't here's what I'm hung up on I don't see why you would come out Okay, first of all I don't see how this how how is this one of their hoaxes that doesn't make sense Yeah, right you that's he's not explaining it either So that that's the first thing the second thing is I don't see how The what the need was for on July 4th weekend to say this the way they said it Unless there was a demand to do it that way And then if that demand to do it that way Is real who to come from mm-hmm, and who was there? Oh, there was Netanyahu there and why would he be in a hurry to Make such a demand well because he's losing the support of the world And he's shown in three different scenarios that he's willing to use violence to get him off the hook personally And if he holds all these cards of the Epstein list He could be sitting there being like fuck the world's fucking hate me We need to you know like all of this shit fits together in my mind. Yeah, bro. Okay. Yeah But yeah, and this isn't some blind support of Trump bro if Trump fucking is truly part of this and You know, he's hiding this shit and whatever. I don't even see that as a possibility I just don't and by the way to Trump uh Everybody does appreciate all the other shit that you're doing but you're not doing enough of it fast enough That's the truth. Okay, and Bro, yeah, I keep thinking about this isn't gonna go away. No, fuck no But I keep thinking about even just the fact that it was released on July 4th America's Independence Day What what what other day would you release it or or at least start this conversation that on an Independence Day We're actually dependent on another nation That could be a reason why he wanted him to do it then who knows dude, right? I'm just like I just I keep getting hung up on that date man You know the golden day, but like I think people are misinterpreting Like they're saying oh well Trump's not Trump's owned by Israel because Zion Don but yes because he has blackmail on him. Okay, maybe but I Think it's more likely that he's he's he's he's being threatened and not him but you and I and all of us That's what I that's what I think very possible man. I don't know man guys jump down in the conversation I want you guys to tell us what you guys think down in the comments Uh, but without being said, let's get to our third and final third and final story This is a great win for you. We gotta go to California. Okay. I got three minutes and 30 seconds of The hands-down baddest ass video I've ever seen in my life Out of California. All right Let's check it out In the United States I know most of you are probably from Mexico where you don't have the first amendment But that's something we have here where we have the right to freedom of speech and I just wanted to I just wanted to say something to I just want it's true. You guys don't have a first amendment. You don't have respect for civil liberties or right But that's okay. I'm speaking. Thank you So anyway, it's the point I'd like to make here is a couple things one these people here are you know passionately talking about Uh, ice agents coming into the communities and you don't know their identities Well, you know who we really don't know the identities of any of the illegal aliens who've been invading our country for the past 60 years Yeah, how about how about when you when you see when you see when you see the farm worker Is that going to be like the same farm worker that murdered Molly Tivots Yeah, how do you how do you know when the Honduran fruit seller is out there? How do you know he didn't rape one of the many women who came up here according to the univision study done in 2015 80% of women who come to this country are trafficked and raped Think about that. How do we know they're not one of those rapists? How do we know they're not one of those rapists? Excuse me. So so that's that's the fun thing. That's the first thing I think ice should be allowed to act with impunity. I think they should go to every home depot I think they should go to every school every kinssen era and build the wall and depot every single one of these guys because they don't make our country great They make it worse they bring it down they use public services and Americans are sick and tired of it We're sick and tired of it So let me say this too we want it you know, they say you want to know the identities of these mac of these ice agents We don't know any of the identities of these murderers coming into our country these rapists Let me also say this too This same city council and costumatio if you vote to make these people Take their masks off. This was the same city that was arresting people for refusing to wear masks during COVID So now now what is it now what is it Where do you want to enforce the law and take our country back you want to put the man in danger? Is that what you want to do? No, and let me let me know you miss let me let me hand on this Let me end on this Let me end on this let's hear it Let me end on this Let's hear the man Let me let me let me say this you know people people are out here people are out here quoting Martin Luther King who is a plagiarist and a rapist You're saying other things. I'm gonna. I'm gonna give a quote. I'm gonna give a quote from John Jay He signed the Treaty of Paris in our American Revolution and from Federalist number two with equal pleasure I have as taken often noticed that provenance has been blessed to give this country to one united people A people descended from the same ancestors speaking the same language Reflecting the same religion Attacks to the same principles of government very similar to their manners and customs and who by their joint councils Arms and efforts fighting side by side throughout a long and bloody That's it's three minute Look at that white lady like video digger a granny. Yeah, we're gonna. I'm gonna. Fuck a title on you you. I'm a battle on you. That's another thing everybody's got a quick giving a fuck about. All these people think they've weaponized their mother fuck itself. Oh man. It's so bad. You know what? I did it. I did it, bitch. You know what I'm saying? Like what are you going to say then? Yeah. What are people going to say that? What do you say to that? You can't. Yeah. I did it. You take your phone and put it back in your pocket. I don't give a fuck. It's a title culture bro. Like we're fucking. I'm going to post you on Google. Yeah. I'm going to I'm going to I'm fucking telling I'm telling mom you said some mean stuff. I'm going to leave a Yelp. You said a mean joke to me. Yikes. Yikes. Yeah. And then they always write some passive aggressive shit too. It's like why don't you just say it like oh whatever. Fuck all these people. Anyway. This is great. Did you see the model log from the guy running for mayor and Minneapolis? Oh you took out the I am the captain now dude. Yeah. That guy. Mr. Fucking captain from Somalia. Yeah. Did you see that? We should put that in there. Let's put that in there. Yeah. This guy or more fatay. Yeah. They're being called terrorists. We heard them being called drug dealers. We heard a lot of insults. We heard that they're that they're a threat to our national security. And that's a flat out lie. You want to know who the real threat is? Matter of president? I'll give you a hint. They don't look like our chief author. They don't look like the folks up in the gallery. They don't look like the folks on the rotunda. They look like many of the members that sit in the front. And you don't have to take my word for it. According to DHS Madam President, the greatest domestic threat facing the United States comes from quote racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically specifically those who advocate for the superiority superiority of the white race. Not our immigrants. We are safer and we're better off because of them. Who's safer and better off because of them? The immigrants. All right. First of all, motherfucker, this ain't your mother fucking country. Okay. You have a country. It's called Somalia. We could tell by the shape of your mother fucking head. Okay. What? That's in the brother. I don't give a fuck. You're not going to fucking come on here in this in this country. First of all, that's a quote from DHS Senator Biden from 2021. Okay. Yeah. We all know what was going on. That's right. It was August 2021 when that fucking statement came out. So this guy's quoting something from four years ago under a corrupt fucking organization that was trying to silence any sort of American uprising or whatever to fuck you want to call it. Secondly, the fuck are you doing here, bro? You're you're from fucking Somalia. Okay. And if you want to know the attitude of these people, you people keep saying, oh, let's welcome them all. Let's fucking we're not good people. If we don't let them hear, they don't want you here. They do not want you here. He's saying it plain as day. The fact that this man has the fucking balls to stand in public on camera in the United States of America and say what he just said is insane. If any one of us got up there and said the same thing about him and said, and by the way, what's the data say? What's the data say? Don't say that. What? What? What's the data say? Does the data say that the white supremacists are committing all the fucking crimes? Or does the data say that the the massive amount of crimes that are committed by, you know, illegals are not even being reported or being reported as white people doing it, which we've exposed on this show before. And if any of us stood here and fucking said anything about him and for like people would lose their fucking minds. You people advocating for these people to be here. You need to understand they do not want you here. And as long as you advocate for them, there will come a time where you will have to deal with these people and then saying, this is our shit now. And they're not going to give a fuck about you. Like, dude, this is a it's absurd shit. Right. Have you seen that? Did you not see that story about that woman that that moved to Russia? Yeah. Okay. Black woman moved to Russia because she said America's two racist. She has beat up by a couple of Russians who are racist. And then cries about it on the internet. Yeah, right. Okay. Other countries don't put up with fucking bullshit. Dude, have you seen that video? I got it. Well, I watched the whole video of that scenario. Yeah. And she's doing typical fucking American shit. But has her cell phone out. She's up in their faces. She's screaming at him doing all this shit. You know what? They said, fuck you and punch her in the face. And that's that's what people do in other places. Here, we are gilted into believing that it is an our best interest to allow motherfuckers like this. This guy who doesn't belong here to come in our country or this dude up in New York City who's trying to fucking turn New York City into some sort of like fucking communist ridiculous shit. You guys who are all feeling guilty and all this just remembered her bro, you got to keep feeling guilty. And eventually you're going to be surrounded by these people and they're going to fucking hurt you. They're going to kill you or they're going to take a shit. And that's the reality. We it has been too good for too long in the United States of America where people cannot recognize the rules of everything else. There are evil people out there. There are people that will fucking kill you over your mother fucking shoes. They will kill you over their house. They will kill you because they don't like the way that you look. And these aren't fucking white people doing it. And I'm tired of the narrative being spread. It's not true. There is no single fucking data that shows that. No, I mean, every single this guy here should be out fucking deported right now. And I don't even give a fuck. Is he even a fucking citizen? He was born in Washington DC. Okay, well then fucking deported him anyway. I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck. If you're going to advocate like Ilyano Omar does for fucking other countries coming here and people coming here get the fuck out. Like dude, I'm fucking over it. Well, it's not the immigrants are causing all the crime. Dude, the black communities are fucking tired of it. Like what do we be doing? Dude, what are we doing here? You can openly bro, imagine me standing in front of a fucking official government fucking function and saying something similar to that about fucking people like him. Imagine that. How what? That's crazy. No, how is that okay? But it's not okay for a fucking dude. That doesn't make sense to you. That doesn't tell you the whole story. Then you're fucking asleep bro. They fucking hate you. It's so crazy man. Have you seen this clip? This right here? Yeah, it's Minneapolis. It's fucking Minnesota man. Like that's crazy. Well, that's what they fucking vote for. Apparently Minnesota. Apparently, Minnesotians are actually racist because their their ability to be guilted into giving up their own shit is on a different fucking level. Well, here's my take on this, right? Because there's people out there that will argue that this is America. That is not that's not fucking America. That's not America. It's not. Do we have the freedom of religion here? Of course we do. I respect it. Right? Like it's there. That's not America. It's not. It's not. Here's the truth, bro. America's dying. Okay. America's inner cities look similar to fucking third world cities. If you go certain places in LA, if you go certain places in any Democrat run city, which or by the way is mostly big cities because most of the big cities are filled with immigrants and people like that guy. They look like shit. They look like shit holes. They got fucking feces in the street. They got you know, syringes in the street. You got people high everywhere. You got crime. You got this. You got that. Other countries are done dealing with this shit. You know what I'm saying? Like, I don't know, dude. I'm there. I don't know. People who understand the fuck up on an individual level, dude. They better start happening because these people will fucking that that comment about white people pisses me to fuck off, dude. Like bad. What the fuck are they talking about? That's the thing is like, you know, when that when that when that came out, man, like people, people forget there was there's no there's literally nothing to support that. There's nothing that exists to support that narrative. Absolutely. You mean the white, the yeah, you could put it, or look, dude, you could put out that warning in 2021 when you're going to pump in 30 million motherfuckers from a different country and people are going to be pissed about it and then they could say, oh see, he's right. See, right. These fucking people are racist. Yeah, the guy, the guy, the guy looks like the dude out of fucking captain Phillips. Am I wrong? Hey, am I wrong? No, okay, so I don't want here no shit. The fucking guy's head looks like it's from Somalia. He is their parents. His parents are from Somalia. Okay. No shit. Now, I'm not a biologist. All right. Dude, I'm sorry. It's the way it is. I'm sure people can look at fucking people and be like, look at that fat American or look at this fucking guy or look at that. I could tell from that guy's a Russian, you know, say I could tell like the guy looks like it's from Somalia. And by the way, I don't give a fuck. He's a fucking racist. I'm racist. No, he's racist. That's racism. That's racism. Yeah, man. Guys, dude, what do you do about that? Dude, it's people's guilt that's keeping this, that's ruining this country. Some quiet. Yeah, keep some quiet. What the fuck do you have? So let me ask you this. Do white people not have a fucking place to exist anywhere? They don't belong in America because they're colonizers. They don't belong in Europe because Europe wasn't built by fucking white people who was built by black people. So we're the fuck do white people belong. I'll show you. No, you got aboriginal. Yeah, that's right. So everybody else gets a fucking gets to call their place home, but we don't get fucking homes. You understand? I get it. I get it. Fucking over it, dude. Yeah, man. Guys, jump in on the combo. Let us know what you guys think. Man, down in the comments. Like, this dude fucking comes on fucking and you wonder why people are getting pissed and you wonder why racist things are becoming more normal. Like, dude, there's no tolerance for shit like this. Like that guy should not be fucking allowed to be in politics or in America or anything. In fact, I believe that if you're going to fucking get up in politicians and say a single word about race at all, you shouldn't even be in politics. Yeah. Well, first of all, this dude's like 24, right? Yeah. Well, there's not even you don't even have life experience to common on shit like that one. But here's my other issue too. Like, hey, like if that was true, then how the fuck were you ever elected to begin with? If there was this, you know, I'm saying like, how did you get your position of a fucking political pile? Because bro, white people are so afraid of being called racist, they will vote against their own interests in order to fucking defend themselves against that accusation that is part of the fucking propaganda play that's been played in our fucking country for 50 fucking years, man. Like, that's part of the thing. Dude, listen, dude, if you go up to fucking a table of white women and fucking anywhere in the country and you say, is it okay to be white? Every single one of them is going to fucking stutter. Every single one of them is going to fucking get squirmy. Every single one of them is not going to know what to say. It might tell right or wrong. You know, okay, but if you go up to a fucking table full of any other group, Latino, black, Somali, fucking, fucking anything and you say, is it okay to be whatever you are? What are they going to say? Oh, absolutely. Why is that? Where the best? Why is that? Why is that? That's because white people have been fucking propagated for 20 motherfucking years to believe that they're racist and they're actually good people and they don't want to be called racist. But like, bro, you got to understand they're going to call you racist either way. Oh, yeah. Are you going to give up your house because they call you racist? You know, like, oh, you're racist because you won't give your house to me. Yeah, right. Right. Right. You're going to give it up. That'd be the next thing. I'm just fucking over it. I'm not hearing it, bro. Look, I does look like that. He does look like that. That's what I was taking some time to react because I was trying to get the picture in there. Yeah, man. Don't people do not belong in our government? People from other countries or have other interests do not belong in our government. People who are going to fucking advocate for illegals to come here and replace Americans, which is exactly what he's advocating for. Do not belong in our government or in our country. Illine Omar should not be in America. No. No. It shouldn't be a controversial thing to say that people that advocate for people other than Americans to serve in government should be deported. Not only that. Any politician that you want to get up and the first thing you want to do is try to divide literally over half the fucking country. That's a problem. That's a problem. That's what you're running on. Yeah, it's a tired. People are listening. People are tired of it. People don't give a fuck anymore about be called racist. They don't care. They don't fucking care. Now stop carrying news ago. I know. But I'm just saying there's real racism and then there's this fake shit that they try to guilt you with. Real racism is, I fucking hate these people because they're this race. Fuck them blah, blah, blah. Not real racism is, hey, I would like to have a country I would like us not to be invaded by people that don't belong here. I would like our streets to not be filled with fucking bullshit and crime. I would like our, the people who live in America to speak English. I would like them to obey our culture and be a part. That's not racist. That's fucking okay. You know what I'm saying? It's okay to say, hey, you're not going to guilt me into believing I'm racist so that you could take my shit. You stupid fuck. And dude, until fucking people start standing up and stop feeling guilty about all this shit, it's going to continue. Yeah. Guys, jump in this combo. Let's talk down in the comments what you guys think. With that being said, a third final segment of the show is always we have thumbs up or dumbest fuck. We're bringing headline every talk about it. It's one of those two options, Andy. You like ghost? I wouldn't say I like that. I'm certainly not. But let's talk about it. Let's see if you find this cool. Our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads, Paral normal investigator Dan Rivera's friends ripped trolls linking his death haunted. Wait, what the fuck is this headline saying? Sorry, let me start it again. Paral normal investigator Dan Rivera's friends ripped trolls linking his death to haunted Annabelle doll. This is another, this is a creepy fucking top. It's a creepy story. Okay, kind of scared me, I'm being honest. I might need a hug after this. But let's dive into this man. So friends of Paral normal investigator Dan Rivera have slammed trolls linking his death to a haunted Annabelle doll with which he was on tour as it was announced that the pre-plan show will go ahead. Rivera, who's 54, died suddenly Sunday at a hotel in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania hours after finishing a three-day run of his devils on the run tour with the Raggedy Ann doll Annabelle. The state police told the evening sun that quote, nothing unusual or suspicious was observed at the scene. But that hasn't stopped people linking it to the doll and rumors that it's cursed. Okay, now Dan passed away on July 13th. He was seen in a video physically grabbing and handling the doll on July 12th. So literally the day after, not even 24 hours had passed, of him handling this Annabelle doll. Okay, Dan is no longer with us. Okay, let's check this video. Close it up fast. Close it up fast and he's moving slow. I'm just saying. Let's get it. That's all right. And then the father's son, the Holy Ghost, fell married full of grace to learn his wit, the blessed act of the month, who had been the most of the fruit of the life of Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners. Now it's the hour of our death. Amen. Yeah? Let me see your hands again. This was him the day before. We had a priest do a bining ritual on the case of two things in it. We also had all the condos in the museum. Well, I guess that is for you. That's my story. I can go further into the hot YouTube videos out there. It's safe. I want you guys to take your picture. Nope. I don't know. Would you touch Dan about? I'm not. Not by not ever that. I mean, listen, like we got call what it is, man. All right. Everybody's seen the fucking movies. All right. I've seen the movies. I mean, it's definitely that's. Look. Warning. Positively. Do not open. Listen, man. Yeah, I it seems weird. Look, I've had enough paranormal shit happening around me that I know the shit's real. Like I know it's real. I fucking seen it. I got videos of it. We got videos that we can put in the show. Or eventually we will. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I don't know. Did he take the Vax? It's so easy. That was the other thing going on on Twitter. Yeah, people were saying that my only question is was he Vax? Like that's been the fucking. Yeah. That's been a hot comment. I mean, he looks pretty healthy. I mean, that's look pretty healthy. You know, that looks pretty healthy. Looks pretty good for 54 years old. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm just saying. I don't know, man. It seems weird. No, I wouldn't fuck with that. I definitely wouldn't. No. I don't think I think that like I think people. This kind of has to do with everything we're talking about. Like I think people don't understand. That there's a lot of things that we don't see or understand or know. And just because we see them on the surface doesn't mean that it's fake or you know, like in another thing I think is like people. Not enough people have had experiences with evil things to realize what evil truly means. You know, for example, you know, let's take this Netanyahu guy. And people people think like when we talk about like what we talked about earlier with the Samson option or his ability to kill indiscriminately, I think people deep down inside a lot of people. They may not say this, but they they they say, well, he must have a reason for it. Or there must be there must be, you know, something that we don't understand, which is causing them to do that. And I think people have a hard time really grasping that there is an entire category of evilness in people that they do not operate on the same moral standard or code of ethics or right and the understanding of right and wrong. They don't care. Like it's everything they do is further benefit. And they don't think about it like you would think about it. Like if you, for most people, I think if they pull the trigger on a military attack, right? And let's say 50,000 children died that were innocent. That would be enough for most people. I think to have severe psychological issues for their whole life. Right. They would that you would go to bed and you'd be like, fuck, I am I fucking killed all these people. And like you would you would have emotional problems and like you got to understand these people do not think like that. They do not have those emotions. They do not think that it's wrong to kill those people as long as it serves their survival once in needs. And I think people really fuck up man by not understanding that what we're dealing with here culturally in the world when it comes to this imposed control and world communism and blackmail and everything that we have going on is evil. There's no code of ethics to it. There's no they don't care. And people have a really hard time understanding that. They have a hard time grasping that there are people walking the earth that will kill you and not feel one ounce of fucking thought afterwards. They don't not even for a fucking millisecond. And I think the United States has become so comfortable and it's been so good for so long that most people have never really had an experience with evilness like they they say they will right they'll say yeah I had a bad stepdad or I had a bad mom or I had a bad dad or this happened or that happened no that's called fucking life. That's called people doing fucked up shit. This is different. It's not really evil. Yes, real evil exists and it's very real and it exists in a spiritual realm. AKA fucking with things you shouldn't fuck with. But it also exists in human beings and it's hard for it's hard for someone who's never really seen it to understand that it exists. I have had a number of scenarios in my life where I've seen evil like I've seen it with my own fucking eyes. And I don't think most people have I think most people think that things that normally happen. My parents got divorced. You know this tragedy happened or this or this and they equate those things to evil when in reality that's not evil at all. Those are just things that happen bad things bad things do happen without evil. But then there's evil and it's a different thing anyway guys ain't have a great day. It's all right. Yeah, don't be a hug. She'll have a show. Fuck up, fuck up, fuck up, stop counting millions in the cold. Bad bitch, who did you throw? Got her own bank row. Can't fold. That's a no-hit shot case.
