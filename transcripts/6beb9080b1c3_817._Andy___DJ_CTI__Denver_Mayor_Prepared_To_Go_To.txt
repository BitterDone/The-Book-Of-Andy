some pretty cool shit come out of the NFL I think they're they're moved a little bit away from the woke shit that we've seen everybody is everybody is yeah you know why because it's not good for their fucking business anymore it's not cool it shows you that there none of these companies have any principles whatsoever they're only doing the things that are going to make the money and when they thought it was cool the push trends and pride and books you know for little kids they did that and now they've realized people hate that so they stopped doing it and really the truth of the matter is is that everybody should shop and support the companies that had fucking morals and ethics and never bought into that shit entire time by the way all my companies were like that we were standing for this shit fucking 10 years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago 2020 the whole time and like dude I think people need to remember who was doing the right thing and who wasn't you know so yeah it is it's just a good like temperature check of where culture is when you see like it's not all companies like by by no means like there's still a few out there that are holding strong to those uh woke policies and shit like they're few and far between but in this few where every day but it's just cool because like you know for for the time period there I didn't want to see or deal with anything in FL because of the shit that they were doing but it's start it's good to see that they're starting to get back to just good people you know good stories good things like this the story that came out chiefs Tershan Wharton saves young fan who fell from stands and scary scene and like you know just like hero idolizing like just good dude you know what I'm saying it's good to see what happened here I didn't see it yeah so he was part of the chief superbowl winning roster in 2023 and 2024 and is now seeking your third consecutive championship with the club um apparently a young fan was in the stands and uh we went over to uh to go speak to a young fan and the guy like the kid was hanging over the fucking band and fail and he called him let's check the clip out he caught him back to your seat everybody back to your seat this kid just failed back to your seat oh oh shit oh man it's good to see he caught him huh he did catch him because he would have fell right on his head yeah he fucking he fucking caught him he's a beast too bad yeah uh but like just stuff like this like I like to see this yeah and not talking about like you know his political stance on guys right I just you know saving the white kids falling out of stands bro look his spikes they're Jordans oh shit yeah it's pretty cool yeah I had some Jordan cleats in high school you did I didn't know they made cleats like yeah my uncle actually bought me a pair um and then my uh the head coach after he got fought when he got fired he stole him out of my locker oh really so what a got your story sounds like a good dude yeah yep how many times you wear him what's what's one fucking time yeah left him a locker and fucking got fired he went over to locker and cut all the locks and fucking stole my Jordan cleats yep um yeah man it's not like a matter anyway right where do you mean let me it won't go make you any better you weren't gonna be like Mike okay worry yeah dude honestly I wasn't I wasn't I was pretty decent yeah I was pretty fucking decent okay I was pretty decent uh but yeah man let's get a toy headlines man we got a lot of shit to cover out there uh guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures uh articles links videos go to any for sale.com you guys can find them all link there for you with that being said let's take a gander at headline number one um we gotta go to Denver first uh let's go to Denver Colorado okay uh and let's check in on the local government uh tyrant we have there uh Denver mayor says he's prepared to go to jail over opposition to Trump deportations of illegal immigrants um so Denver mayor Mike Johnston uh says that he is prepared to go to jail over his opposition to president elect uh Trump's mass deportation plan even as he walked back comments predicting a tenniman square moment um johnson has uh been asked last week about his opposition to the Trump plan to significantly ramp up deportations of illegal immigrants when he enters office next year johnston predicted police department um and a tenniman square moment if federal immigration officials attempted to do their jobs he said quote uh more than us having dpd stationed at the county line to keep them out you would have 50,000 Denver rights there johnston said in the interview with Denver right um quote it's like the tenniman square moment with the rose and the gun right you'd have every one of those highland moms who came out for the migrants um quote and you don't want to mess with them uh but in a subsequent uh interview on Friday with nine news he walked back those comments quote uh what i have taken it back if i could yes i probably wouldn't have used that image johnston said uh that's the image i hope we can avoid what i was trying to say is this is an outcome i hope we can avoid in this country i think none of us want that um but it was a little too late for that uh because you got this guy that's rising star i fucking like this guy like actually tom homin uh response to Denver mayor he's willing to go to the jail i'm willing to put him in jail your terms are acceptable accept your terms man like this guy is a fucking beast bro these are beast let's let this clip out tom you you heard the got you heard this mayor out there in uh in uh Colorado i want to get your reaction to it and i want you to be clear about who has jurisdiction the federal government or state and local and if you're a sanctuary state or city are you breaking the law yeah absolutely breaking law i have to do look at Arizona versus us you see these breaking law but look me in the Denver mayor we agree on one thing he's willing to go to jail i'm willing to put him in jail because there's a statue it's title eight nice nice days called 1324 trouble I what it says is it's a felony if you knowingly harbor and concealed it will be an immigration is also a felony to impede a federal law force now sir so if we don't have that's fine he can get the hell out of the way but we're going to go do the job president trump has a mandate for american people we got to secure this country we got to save american lives and i i find it shocking any mayor of a city would say the president trust me clear we want to constrain public safety threats and national security threats i find it hard to believe that any mayor or governor would say they don't want public safety threats removed from their neighborhoods i mean i mean i don't know what hell is going on in Denver but we're going to go we're going to fix it if you don't want to fix it if you don't want to protect his communities president trump and i will i love this guy i mean that's the way it should be okay he makes some good points why would you be against that why would you be against the safety of your own community why would you be against the protection of your citizens specifically the women in your city yeah why would you be against any of that why would you want to side with people who are here illegally why would you want to side with people who are here causing crime causing chaos sucking up resources isn't Denver one of the cities that ran out of money because they were spending all the money on migrants you see so we got to ask ourselves what is he gaining by taking this position because i guarantee you there's some sort of personal gain it's not just a political stance he's trying to make okay he is receiving something that he's not supposed to be receiving in order to take that stance and my honest prediction is this guy's a total pussy he's talking shit and when this time homin comes rolling the town to uh take care of these people he's going to say right over here sir this is where they're at you know yeah no shit i feel like time probably will go there personally to master that shit yeah i mean he seems like a nob yes kind of guy and i like it and like it um so i hope the guy does resist and i hope he does go to jail and i hope he goes to jail for a long time because let's be real dude this guy's destroyed the city of Denver Denver is one of the most beautiful cleanest best cities in in the history of the united states traditionally and now it looks like a fucking shittles okay because of this guy their policies all right everybody's hired like of the little tiny area of liberals wagging the dog the tit for the whole state of Colorado bro most people in Colorado are not fucking in down with this these these are people like a Missouri bro they they like outdoors they like hunting they like fishing they like doing stuff they're they're not about this shit that's being pushed through because Denver Denver's politics yeah right you know in the Denver's king yeah says this and that's the point they always gets me man like i could i could i could imagine a a person who lives in Denver you know watching this fucking dude go up there and say oh yeah and a lot of people are gonna stop them it's like what who and then on top of it we're think about the cops you know i'm saying like the cops there because like bro like lizard we know a lot of cops we speak to these guys all the time and we know there's great cops out there and that like you know i thought i don't i believe that they would not stand in the way of that right no and they're watching this and they're probably what the fuck is this guy bro what if what if you're a family who's been uh one of your daughters or one of your sisters or your mom or your aunt or something's been attacked by one of these migrants and you got this fucking pencil neck douchebag saying that he's gonna protect those people over you right you give it I'm saying you're paying the salary yeah right it's insane dude yeah it's wild man there's other things happening uh on that level there's more meltdowns uh snowflakes we got uh losing their mind um secretary of state Anthony Blinken he's just got questioned um blinking question over state department hosting in house therapy sessions after trump win you hear about this wait what wait wait wait the state department is hosting in house therapy sessions on taxpayer dollars so hold on grown adults who are supposed to be leading the country who are in charge of our tax dollars in charge of our policy in charge of our safety in charge of our economy are crying so hard and so traumatized that they have to have in house therapy sessions at our expense is that am I reading that right yes okay yep yep sure are um and somebody called it out you got a representative Darryl isa took aim at secretary of state Anthony Blinken um after it was reported that the state department held therapy sessions for employees who were upset by president elect Donald Trump's election victory quote I'm concerned that the department is catering to federal employees who are personally devastated by the normal functioning of american democracy through the provision of government funded mental health counseling because Kamala Harris was not elected president of the united states uh isa uh who's a republican out of california setting the letter to blinkin uh last week the letter comes after a Washington free beacon report earlier this month that detailed two alleged therapy sessions that were held at the state department after trump's victory uh with sources telling the outlet that one such instance amounted to an information quote unquote cry session um and another instance an email went out to agency employees and touted a separate quote insightful webinar where we delve into effective stress management techniques to help you navigate these challenging times after trump's victory according to the report um quote change is a constant in our lives but it can often bring about stress and uncertainty the email said join us for an insightful webinar where we'll delve into effective stress management techniques to help you navigate these challenging times the session will provide tips and practical strategies for managing stress and maintaining your well-being um um play dough and fucking glitter balls like what are we doing man what are we doing uh now you got time homin like that guy trumps make well look what it says it says in his letter to blinkin it's argued and reported sessions were disturbing and that non-partisan government officials should not be suffering quote a personal meltdown over the result of a free and fair election end quote yeah because you're an adult you're a grown adult that's supposed to have a backbone in a spine and have courage and lead okay we have a big problem in this country with total fucking pussy them okay and on top of it if these people were actually who they're supposed to be they would be excited about the chance to fix what's going on in the country and it just shows you they're disturbed and they're freaking out and they're crying why would they be doing that if they had nothing to hide what would they be afraid of what would they be having trauma from this this shit about trump coming in and being some sort of tyrant is insane he didn't do that the first time he was in found it okay and then did you see the thing with the view what fucking whoopee goalberg said on the view today she said she said and i'm loosely quoting you got to go look it up but she said you know if you're married to a white guy uh he's not gonna to put he he's gonna deport you and keep the white guy and put him with a white person his guys out of his mind like bro these people earns they're insane dude they're insane that's why yeah yeah that's fucking stupid um is what it is now there's other things going on um we've seen you know trump make a few cabinet selections put people in these important positions one of his recent appointments though is bringing some some some interesting attention um so let's let's check this out this is a statement from president Donald Trump um where he announced uh dr jennette nash wet uh as the nation's doctor uh united states surge in general um uh and uh you know he put this long post you fucking celebrated her praise to her to talk about how he ended it saying that dr nash watt will play a pivotal role in making america healthy again right now of course she accepted it um she replied and posted that in the in the tweet saying quote i am deeply honored and humbled by this nomination to serve as surge in general united states thank you mr president for your trust i pledge to work tirelessly to promote health inspire hope and serve our nation with the dedication and compassion at real Donald Trump my high right now here is the problem right the internet is a lot of well things don't get deleted there's receipts we have a lot of them ourselves um and there's some issues with this one there's some big issues with a few of these picks and quite quite honestly i'm starting to really lose trust for trump i'm getting a little low and two i'm gonna do and if and if he if he doesn't do what he says he's gonna do and be the person he says he's gonna be i'm gonna hammer that motherfucker for the next four fucking years yeah i mean um like bro i'm not one of these blind people that just goes along with the side yeah there's so many people that are just this lady was one of the main fucking covid people okay she's the one that pushed the fucking mass push the lockdowns push the vaccinations of children okay she's one of the main people who committed the crimes against humanity that we had to deal with and now trump puts her at surge in general that's fucking insane and don't take it and it shows me that he hasn't learned a mother fucking thing unless there's some other plan unless he's putting these people out in the public so that everybody can see all the things they've done and then he's gonna fire him or somehow that's his way of getting him out of government i don't know but i know this that ain't good no it's not and like don't take all word for it i like this isn't just us making these accusations let's hear it straight from the horses mouth to shake this out and what it is now covid you know this new delta variant hits right before school starts and our top priority should be getting kids back into the classroom but doing so safely here's the problem delta is different and that's why the american academy of pediatrics is recommending that if you're in gonna be in a classroom in a crowded classroom then you want protect yourself wear a mask because a lot of kids for example under the age of 12 they can't be vaccinated so it's important to point out though masking is not the only solution we also need to make sure that we have good ventilation that people are washing their hands that they're getting tested and that all the teachers are getting vaccinated as well but what's happening is this new delta variant it replicates more easily and it's more contagious you can have up to a thousand times more viral particles so kids can pick it up even though they may not have severe symptoms they can spread it to another person and when it spreads is when the virus mutates and that's when we get more variants like delta and lambda and the uk variant or this clip from dr jenet first of all vaccines save lives and i am so excited and i think and i commend facebook and mark zuckerberg for taking action because this affects everyone this affects our children it affects adults we just look at the recent measles outbreak the biggest outbreak that we've had in decades with measles and and that's no joke measles can cause brain inflammation and pneumonia and ear infections and hearing loss and death so it's about time that they are taking action and i hope and pray that other social media platforms will follow suit and do the same thing she's talking about censoring anybody that talks about this correct okay she's talking about uh banning our show off the fucking internet which dude for sure saved a whole bunch of people for sure bro okay so why the fuck is Donald Trump putting anybody like this in his fucking cabinet at any position why that's the part that doesn't get me now i mean i feel like there's an interesting dynamic though right because you got rfk in um he is not with some of these vaccines i'm not gonna say he's anti-vaxor because that's the narrative about he's anti-covid he's anti-covid vax for sure you know i'm saying so like that's gonna be an interesting dynamic you know what's what's uh what's rfk's position on uh he's the hhhs is that above the account reason yeah i mean look dude he's continuing to pick people who have been involved and responsible for a lot of the disruption that's happened for the last four and a half years and it doesn't look good it doesn't look like he's learned his lesson oh man and he's putting people that are you know not only just not in line with what americans truly want he's putting people that cause the fucking problem in the first place right now i mean to your point and i'm not gonna judge i'm not judging until we he's in office and and we give him like 90 days to see what the fuck he's actually gonna do but i'm gonna say this i don't like any of it i'll bro and i mean that that's like to your point though man that could be the play i don't know um you know like because here's the other thing too that i think about you know it's not like as just our show the sogum of this i mean people like there's a lot of people that are yeah i know everybody about this woman that are not with it and a few of other his other picks there's no way he doesn't see it there's no way he does you know i'm saying yeah but by all accounts people that are close to trump all have the same thing to say about them they say that he is impossible to communicate with once he is made up his mind he believes that he is right his ego is massive and uh it's very hard for him to take criticism or feedback or alternative options from other people that is from people that work that have worked with him so you know i i have a hard time believing anybody is that clueless or that tone deaf to what the country actually wants to say i read the room bro yeah bro and and dude part of me thinks that these people are being put in these positions so all of this shit will come out so that he could fire them and get them out of the fucking system that might be his way of getting them out of the system see what i'm saying so i don't know and i don't i don't have a feeling one way or the other i'm at like wait and see yeah uh but it i don't feel good about it i mean what's that one saying like keep your friends close enemies closer yeah i mean maybe like i said i mean listen i like i'm not a bandwagon trump guy right like obviously i'm not either dude but like it is very important man like we we got to keep in mind like what this country needs and what we need is accountability yeah you know i'm saying period you know i'm saying and like i think the people are definitely rallying for it they're crying for it they're demanding it trump has to follow through bro he asks you um you know and it's interesting last little bit uh other interesting updates going on right now um this is all coming out we've seen that the a lot of the federal cases against trump have now been dropped or indefinitely postponed um and now more information is coming out on those um how like special counsel jack smith's federal trump cases cost taxpayers more than fifty million dollars um financial show um over two years over two years the last two years um more than fifty million fucking dollars to try to prosecute this man you know i'm saying now it's just how well what they say is that uh he was appointed a special council um from like mid-November uh of 2022 until march 31st 2023 um and during that time his office incurred cost of about nine point two five million dollars the second disclosure laying out the offices expenditures for the following six months show the offices uh spending increased to roughly fourteen and a half million dollars meanwhile a third expenditure report the latest available show that from October 1st of 2023 to march 31st of 2024 uh smith's office spent roughly eleven point eight four million dollars um and and so yeah i mean i don't really know what exactly that shit's going to um pockets maybe of course you know i'm saying like yeah you know i don't know how they're building all of that stuff man but i mean i don't i don't know which is straight that bro it's straight theft at this point that like i'm so tired of it dude and i i'm starting to lose belief that trump's gonna do anything different just by some of these appointments that he's making like yeah he'll do some good shit yeah i think he'll make some change kind of you know show get a little cheaper for sure yeah but i mean but not only enough for everybody to go back to sleep and not care again right that's the dangerous part man well and the dangerous part is i still don't think that people understand what's actually gonna fix america okay i've been saying this for years and years and years but Donald trump's not gonna fix this country if we want to fix this country it's gonna come down to the individuals that make up america that is you that is me that is everybody else and unless we understand that on an individual level we have to do our part we have to live a high standard we have to be the best americans that we could be we've got to be fit we've got to be smart we've got to be not compliant to stupid things that they tell us to do we've got to get along we've got to unify we can't be sucked into all these little traps that they create for us and and if we want a good society and a good culture it comes down to the individual pillars of that culture which is the individual so unless people understand that they have a role to play unless people come to terms that they have to do their part nothing's gonna change in this country it's a cultural revolution that needs to happen and not a cultural revolution in the way of this is cool now and this is not cool it needs to be a cultural revolution of as individuals rejecting what has been put out to make us weaker and easier to rule and these are things like you know the food that we uh that makes us fat and then when we get fat we require their medicine and then when we're fat we watch all their ads and all their streams and all their we consume their data this is all about creating a mega consumer and until we as individuals figure this out and correct this on an individual level and everybody does that the country's not gonna change regardless of what the fuck these guys do yeah man guys jump in on this conversation that is what you guys think down in the comments with that being said chat let's go check these comments out that cruise comments sounds good to me all right this first one comes from at

trying not to buy uh and then he titled that tweet uh with lead us and lead us not into temptation so post this on twitter uh it's got almost a hundred million fucking uh eyesight on that um and uh how many it has 77 million that's almost a hundred it's almost a hundred black with my math your math is racist uh did you see this uh gay msnbc host Jonathan k part says he's conflicted by trump move to pick scott best sent for treasury i can see this y'all this is interesting so a week in anchor for left-leaning cable channel msnbc said he was conflicted by president elect don't trump's decision to name openly gay hedge fund manager scott basent as the next treasury secretary um Jonathan k part a washington post opinion writer who moon lights his host of the sunday show with johnathan k part on the comcast on news channel admitted he was torn about the since nomination uh because it was a republican who chose him to be the highest ranking gay official ever so he hates trump hates everything the trump does but be chug because trump put this guy in this position he might be cool with it but only because the guys gay well that just shows you that his IQ is fucking sub 60 okay which means he's mentally retarded maybe okay i'm being serious check the clip man well that's the point i was getting to so yesterday morning uh my it says right wait scott best sent is gay he is and married and has children who that yesterday when i brought this up you know he if he's confirmed would be the highest ranking out lgbt person ever to serve is to be appointed and confirmed by the united states senate and i said you know i kind of confronted it is trump it i'm kind of conflicted about this look i think in that case credit where it's still i think he's also i think we expect the markets to shoot up when they open in a jahir and i hear in a little bit i think wall street likes the guy it is very interesting that yes it is trump and not one of our team who made that historic um nomination but i it's interesting looking at the cabinet it is interesting that it was trump and not one of your team yeah it was it it's almost interesting you know it's like the same kind of interesting like you know where they call trump a racist but he's the guy who guarantees the hbc u funding for life that Biden takes away on the first day or you know the guy who comes in and actually works with the black communities and the minority communities and has been beloved by the minority communities for decades before he was president before they started attacking him uh you know you mean the guy who's filled this company with women and his cabinet and his uh team with women and uh has done so historically for the last 50 fucking years okay you mean it's kind of like nothing you've ever described yeah it's kind of like he's the one that's not racist and he's the one that's not a big it and you know if we want to talk about bigotry and racism let's talk about how the left every single fucking four years for the last 60 fucking years have come into the black communities and said hey guys uh those Republicans over there are fucking you over those white guys and we're gonna fucking fix it so vote for us and put us in power and what's happened to the black communities what happened to the funding what happened to the schools what happened to the infrastructure what happened to the opportunities oh you know we just we just uh you know it's just we don't know what happened to the money right but hey we elected our first gate yeah uh you know community manager well i mean dude and that moves into a different that moves into a different topic okay the first topic that these people fucking they are everything they say Trump is that's the truth they are everything they say Trump is they are racist they are bigots they are sexist they are fucking they're all of that shit okay real Americans don't give a fuck real Americans care about meritocracy they care about the result they care about who's the best and we want the best and if he happens to be gay we don't give a fuck so what yeah and see that's the difference between these people and fucking everybody else we don't put people in a position just because they're gay and when I say this guy's got a sub 60 IQ I fucking mean it because here's how stupid this is hey I got a business it's the biggest business in the history of humanity and I need to run it you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put this guy in charge of this area because he's gay not because he's qualified but because he's gay because he likes to fuck other dudes I'm gonna put him in this spot because no one else that's ever like to fuck other dudes has had this spot and then we're gonna throw a party and who gives a fuck if he actually knows what he's doing or not who cares if he runs his department into the ground who cares if he demoralizes the military who cares all the matters is he likes to fuck dudes and we got him in there now take that entire dialogue and flip it and reverse okay hey let's put Andrew take in the fucking uh this position because he likes to fuck bitches you see what I'm saying how's that sound we never had a we never had a dude in that position that fuck as many bitches as that guy right see what I'm saying like bro it makes no sense and these people are literal fucking morons and because the best and brightest in this country have had their heads down taking advantage of the opportunity to build businesses and build careers and do things for their families we've all lost sight and we've we've forfeited the power over to these people who are literally dumb fucks they're dumb as fuck imagine if your entire life depended on a certain decision and you're you your decision was I had to pick someone to do a thing and that thing was so important that it was gonna make my family liver die okay and I am so fucking stupid that I'm gonna pick someone to do that thing based upon anything else than their ability to do that fucking that is stupid you are a dumb motherfucker and I bet if you test this motherfucker's IQ it really is below 60 it's definitely low bro and I that's my whole thing on this listen to talk about it he's fucking thrilled yeah it's surprising he came out of Trump's side what difference does it make of these fucking gay who cares I don't care what the fuck he does bro I that's it that's all I care in his scoreboard says that yeah he actually does it damn good fucking I don't know because I haven't looked at it but but if he does if he does a great job fucking give him the job you know if he likes to play with winners I don't give a shit yeah I like to play with my winner don't play with my winner yeah I just don't want to be else playing with it yeah man you know that's like I mean this is one of those things all right like this is a good pick this guy like I've looked into his background he's decent I think he's gonna do a damn good job he's very very fucking smart he looks fucking smart yeah I mean bro anybody with that type of comb over there and got the salt and pepper going I trust you here it's it's unfortunate he's gay because for like an older dude he'd probably slave bro it's good looking dude wait wait a minute that's a good looking dude that's good looking man uh-huh I ain't got no problem saying a dude's good looking don't bother me yeah no it's fine yeah yeah was it you think that's gay no it's only gay if you fuck him dude listen I think people I think I think you're more gay if you can't admit another man is attractive really yeah how how you can't look at another dude and be like that's a handsome dude yeah I can do this wrong with that nothing yeah okay look at him in the eyes look at deep into his eyes and tell him how handsome he is that's the least gay way to do it hey Joe you bad as fuck well no man you know but this this is a good pick right and so you know you got all of this going on Elon might be buying the mess in BC we know that Twitter there has been a mass exodus yeah I have about you know the 10,000 cry babies they had in there yeah yeah didn't they all go over to that other what's another one there's a fix now hold on there's another what's it called blue sky blue sky but I heard it got I heard that it got fucking like inundated with pedophilia already but well so so let's see so there is this new platform apparently called blue sky and I love this article from the AP because I want to try something with you I want to we're gonna we're gonna check into this right and then we're gonna read this as like an ad how it like appeals to liberals okay okay you win me yeah so but yes so this is this new platform out and they're saying you know for people seeking to avoid chaos noise and political bluster in the aftermath of the US elections are noticing a different mood on the blue sky social platform where the vibe is seemingly welcoming and there are noticeably fewer trolls the site announced it had rapidly added more than a million new users in the week after the election and has emerged as one of the fastest growing rivals to Elon Musk's ex and similar platforms so on this platform users can choose in their settings menu whether to see replies repost or quote post in their feet specific words or tags can be muted temporarily or forever while accounts can be muted or blocked individually or in bulk by adding them a moderation list you can even fine tune the level of adult content that shows up in your feed um now there's also something that's attracting people to this um is that individuals or groups they can set up their own content filters or labelers is what they're called uh they go beyond what blue sky offers these labelers can be used to categorize content or users which can be blocked or hidden but they could also be used for informational or creative purposes like curating or verify in content um and uh this is apparently where everybody's going um so everybody yeah everybody I wonder out of that million that went over there like how many of that is just pure fucking bots already I mean who knows you know um but yeah apparently it's being indedited with the very peculiar group that's what I heard um and it's interesting and they can you know protect themselves and they can you know join these label groups and um you know they can decide what they want to see and uh you know it's weird yeah it's fucking weird I don't and see like there's no real like I don't even know who made this like where did this come from where did I give you a guess I bet I know we're probably the same place Facebook came from huh interesting and that's not Mark Zuckerberg no it's not fucking Mark no it's Mark I also see this too man like is this is do you think that this like real talker do you do you think that this is their attempt to try to reignite uh that manipulation of the base meaning right like we know what they did with Twitter we had the Twitter files right where people were were were shit that they wanted to be pushed out was pushed up polls were fucking miscontrude it was half of the fucking people on Twitter at that time were bots right and it gave these crazy fucks um this confidence right that their opinion their viewpoints were right I think that's why so many of them are having trouble fucking coming to terms what's going on because it's not there no more well I think that they don't realize that it was all fake I don't yeah agree right like they don't have words of support right they're like we're we're what happened yeah it is not there no more you know I'm saying so it do you like I think that that's what this play is I don't I don't know that would make sense I mean you don't want your most radical supporters of your movement to lose steam or lose momentum or confidence yeah right you need those but I don't think that's gonna fix it either though I don't think that having a little social media site that's you know where there's it's just become this echo look dude here's here's the bottom line these motherfuckers are in a fucking echo chamber okay and and I know a lot of people say that about us but here's the reality I am willing to criticize both sides okay most people are not so when we say how how these people operate I mean let's let's look you know they won't allow their family over from the holidays because they have differing opinions in them right like how many videos have we seen over the last month of people who were uh you know freaking out having a meltdown talking about I have to leave my husband because I just found out that he's actually a Trump supporter it's like what some people were murdering their families yeah like that lady with the ice pick or that that fucking dude and Pennsylvania yeah you know I'm saying like I mean was that Pennsylvania what's constant I don't remember somewhere yeah he killed his whole fucking family yeah over Trump over Trump yeah like the but see dude to me that shit is on the meat that blood is on the media's hands they have had free reign and the social media platform because they've curtailed the the content so hard that they made people believe that they were on the majority side when they've been the tiny little loud minority for a long time and these people can't come to terms with the idea I mean look at Rachel Maddow freaking a fuck out like these people I don't know man yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments I mean it would make sense what you're saying I mean to me it makes sense I mean because I look at it like this bro you got to think like when Twitter was going look at how much like I'm talking about like physical action of like the destruction occurred right when these people had confidence it's not like there's more crazy left there's less of them right but even the amount that they had in 2020 burning down fucking cities that were mostly peaceful protests well I mean I was people were paid but I'm saying but they also had that that fucking that that support and that boosted their confidence on these fucking social media programs you know I'm saying so like they need that they gotta have that aspect to get the action that they need not a single one of those people could stand out on their own alone against a crowd and voice their opinions absolutely they believe that they are outnumbered they will be silent okay and that that is the the play that they ran on conservative America for 10 years exactly okay they made conservative America feel like and patriotic America feel like they were the small minority or they were losing their grip or things were changing and it made people feel like they were at the bottom of the I don't know like influence curves so to speak where you know they had no influence anymore so people just didn't say shit right and then on top of nobody else to say you're not seeing it it's being censored that's right shit that is being said they're not allowing you to see it right you know I'm saying so you feel very alone you don't have any confidence well how is this manipulation how how how is this manipulation allowed like how the fuck is it allowed like what like the damage that it's caused over the last two decades has been insane how is it okay for five or six or ten people to control the flow of information across every every place meaning the CEOs of these social media companies these the main people at the three-letter agencies how is it okay that a small group of people control the truth for everybody else in society that's not okay man no it's not okay and and it's a crime considering what's happened you know all of this shit where we see these people like backing up and changing their policies and all dude they're all small more exchange they're all little slimy fucks yeah okay they're all exposing themselves they have no morals they have no backbone they have no principles they have no integrity the only thing they're loyal to is profits and they are making this change for no other reason and in ten years if it comes back in style to cut your dick off they'll be right back to fucking promote that that's real man guys you guys should be supporting the companies that stood on their fucking beliefs the entire time you know guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments that being said let's get to our third and final headline we have headline number three a little walk down we'll throw down memory lane for us quickly do you remember this we covered this on the show right and we're out we were fuck you know I'm spent at least 12 million dollars on luxury properties in LA Toronto according to tax filings we covered this yeah you know we were we we took some arrows that was a headline from 2022 yeah we we took some arrows to cover they we didn't they fucking they shot them but it just hit my steel skin fucking broke that's what it was yeah it's like hitting rocks same I became everybody's favorite uncle you see that yeah see them fucking cobra the stitching contours exactly you guys get it Friday 11 a.m. but we covered this yeah I mean they they purchased multiple I mean one was a 10,000 square foot downtown property that was value that $6.3 million right some nice pads right BLM spent this BLM took I mean real talk that looks like a fucking shittles yeah I mean this is trash at least learn how to spend your money a little better yeah oh I mean you know they probably sourced it close like to the nearest Popeyes I'd imagine and but uh that's racist maybe they were right about you but uh you know I mean this was not that's a nice one this is not as bad you know I don't know if that's actually a brownstone almost yeah it's nice um but yeah I mean they they were taken fucking you know money that was being donated both from you know private individuals that were believing in the statement of BLM and then you know obviously there was corporations I mean tens of millions of dollars was being funneled into this place and the money that did not get funneled back into democratic fucking campaigns they spent on fucking houses and shit right well uh shockingly not shocking uh here's another one for you it comes out today uh anti-police activists lose 75 000 dollars in charity funds for luxury vacation rinsals and other expenses according to attorney general um this guy right here let's enter the chat Brandon Anderson okay this guy um is an anti-police activist that allegedly quote misused charitable donations to fund lavish vacations and shopping sprees after founding a non-profit aimed at improving quote transparency and accountability long for it according to prosecutors the office of the attorney general for the district of Columbia is now suing Brandon Anderson the executive director of Rahim alleging that since 2021 he quote diverted 75 000 of non-profit funds for his own personal use the funds reportedly included quotes spending over 40 000 dollars on a luxury vacation rental service that allows members to stay in high-end mansions and pit house apartments 10 000 on hotels and Airbnb's for personal travel including to a cancun resort 10 000 dollars on designer clothing brands shocking um and five thousand dollars on emergency veterinarian services um yeah but quote Brandon Anderson misused charitable donations to fund lavish vacations and shopping sprees um and the Rahim AI board of directors let him get away with it attorney general Brian Schwab said in a statement quote not only did their financial abuses violate fundamental principles of non-profit uh non-profit government governance uh but Anderson and Rahim AI failed to pay their sole district base employee the wages they had earned um and so uh you got this going on man um again it's not shocking um but what is good is that is it is nice to see that people are not tolerating the shit no more and it's okay to talk about it now right no more arrows are being always okay to talk about it yeah but I would be like there's there's you're not going to get no more arrows on this you know what I'm saying and so it is good to see this fucking cares the reason we've had so much fucking bullshit going on in this country is because people are afraid to be fucking to say the truth yeah the fuck is wrong with you guys we'd rather live in a shitty ass country with fucking mass chaos and total bullshit then point it so one and be like bro bullshit no matter what side you're all you guys come from and we're all we're proud americans we're tough we're the biggest and the bravest and the baddest but you can't even point at something and say that's bullshit without being without being scared about it it's fucked up hey that's a dick and the pool simple shit no shit bro you know what I'm saying yeah um but it is good to start seeing that people are finally um you know growing some balls and I want to you know I give credit words do right um let's go to New York City for real quick we got a New York City Democrat demands firings after violent criminal was released early then arrested and triple slashing so this is a United States rep um richie Torres he's a Democrat from the Bronx blasted New York leaders over the weekend for failed criminal justice reforms that enabled quote a homicidal rampage in broad daylight last week resulting in the murders of three innocent people at the hands of a violent mentally ill man released from custody early quote uh the bureaucrat in DOC that's Department of Corrections who authorized the early release of Ramon should be fired Torres wrote in a fiery letter to governor Kathy Holtchell and New York mayor uh New York City mayor Eric Adams both Democrats quote those who cannot be entrusted with public safety should no longer be employed by the people in New York um he added in that letter saying quote that layers upon layers of government failure enabled Ramon Rivera an eight time criminal uh who most recent stint behind bars involved a transfer to the psych ward at Bellevue hospital where he attacked a correctional officer I mean then posted this on Twitter um with the caption saying quote there must be consequences when government fails and when innocent New Yorkers lose their lives we live in a city and a uh in state where the only people who seem to suffer consequences are the victims of crime and their loved ones enough is enough um and uh this is uh profile I mean and again like it's cool cool bro I like it glad you're calling it out but here's the thing bro this shit's been been been going on for a minute four years you know I'm saying so it's nice to see that you're finally on the wagon bro but hey that wagons left the station four years ago yeah how many people were hurt how many people were injured how many people were murdered how many people had their lives ruined because you didn't do what you apparently now think is right when the time was right and when you first started seeing these things when it wasn't comfortable yeah wasn't fucking fancy or yeah this is the intention this is not like you do not get to be a champion of you know civilian or citizen rights after you made the city completely unsafe and caused all these issues you know what I mean it's almost like these people are starting to see what's happening and they want to be the first ones to jump off the fucking raft you know the sinking ship they want to jump jump out before everybody else does see I talked about it I tweeted it right exactly yeah four years two years we've been four yeah cool bro um it is good to see like I guess I try to get credit whereas dude man I don't know um let's think guy yeah that's what I think guys tell us what you guys think let us know down in the comments bro I don't feel sorry for these people we got to remember what the fuck these people did like they have fucked our country completely up this is not this is not a lot of the shit like if you were a family that lost their business if you were someone who knew someone who got raped or murdered or you know you were murdered or whatever like broke you these people have ruined the country and now they're like oh well sorry let's get this guy to make some sort of noble representation of like their actions now you know like fuck dude fuck all these people know what about the people that were dying in 2020 yeah from violent crime in New York or 2021 or 2020 yeah that I get it bro I get it you know guys tell us what you guys think I jumping on this comment let us know down in the comments well and let's be real too bro they're doing this to appeal to a bunch of mentally unstable fucking idiots who think that you can live in a country without some sort of social order you know what I mean like you can't have a civilization without rules that are enforced you know and you got all these purple hair fucking idiots who who literally play dungeons and dragons and larpen the fucking park with pool noodles and shit and play soldier telling people what they shouldn't shouldn't do they don't have any any experience with criminals or crime or or evil or anything like brok dude evil exists bad people are out there they come in all shaped sizes and colors they come from all corners of the globe just because someone is a certain person doesn't mean that they're not going to commit crimes and do certain people because they come from certain areas in the world are statistically proven to commit more crimes it's a statistical fucking fact until we can have open conversations about those kind of things nothing's going to change because there are statistical non-debatable facts and data that show that certain people commit certain kinds of crimes much more frequently than other people and until those are acknowledged and until it's understood that we can enforce the law on everybody without bias regardless of how many of certain people are criminals versus the other doesn't matter if you're criminal you're criminal doesn't matter if you're a bad white person if you're a bad black person if you're a bad Arab person you're a criminal you go fucking jail that's it doesn't matter and if there happens to be more black people than white people or more Arabs than white people or more white people than black people then fucking matter you're either fucking not committing crimes and you're a productive member of society or you're committing crimes and you go to fucking jail it's very simple straight to jail straight to jail man yeah hey guys those are what you guys think uh with that being said I'm actually against jail I think we should defund all the jails I think that if people are lifetime criminals we like do we should just get rid of them that's what I think I mean dude the amount of taxpayer dollars that's what I'm saying we spend that's what I'm saying I'm housing these motherfuckers feeding them three times a day and and dude how many of them ever actually fucking come around change their lives not me it doesn't it does happen it does happen but not worth the expense of what it creates for it to happen no people say oh you're insensitive no I'm actually not what's insensitive is believing these people deserve the same space the same rules the same opportunities as everybody else who's not doing these things when I'm saying is to protect the good people we have to have protection for the good people they deserve that that should be a priority over the rights of some person who has shown for the history of their life that they're gonna commit forty fuck they've been arrested forty fucking times take that person and throw them the fucking wood shipper because they're not gonna get fixed you but that's a realest point of view that people don't want to address they don't want to talk about it's okay for Bill Gates to go up on stage and say he plans on depopulating the earth with vaccines out in the public okay it's okay for him to go on TV and say you're you act like you have a choice you don't have a choice you're taking this shit it's okay for him to say that but if I say then a lifelong repeat criminal should be fucking executed I'm the bad guy you're a fuck out of here what you should say is we should just give those people some of Bill Gates's vaccines and that'd be fine guys let's know what you guys think man let's get to our final segment of the show as always guys we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck what incentive is there to fucking follow the law the law is never enforced there isn't there isn't and if you and if you incentivize bad behavior you gonna get more you get more bad behavior you know now it's very simple concept man but if it thumbs up or dumb as fuck man we uh you know like I don't know why my heart's been kind of just going to the NFL a little bit
