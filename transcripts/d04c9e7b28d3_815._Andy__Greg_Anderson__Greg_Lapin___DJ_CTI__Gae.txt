Let's just start the show while we're doing we'll go do the intro later, but you know it's you know what's weird dude is that people put all this time into like trying to get the most out of their life when they're 80 it's like bro it doesn't matter what you eat it doesn't matter how you train it doesn't matter what you read it doesn't matter what you do bro when you're 80 it's gonna suck you know like to wait you know like yeah like what do we do like it's just like dude we should be like maintaining our best now so we get the best years now yeah we think about the entire American culture what does everybody do they're chasing a retirement and a pension bro it's like I'm gonna fucking grind away during my most like capable most healthy fittest years of my life where I can do the most things so when I'm fucking 57 or 62 I can then go get a fucking fifth wheel and drive around the country yeah and statistically you're gonna go have a hard attack that's what's going to happen to you but the the system has manipulated people to giving the system their best years and then once those years are over you're fucking dead yeah yeah dude it's it's it's definitely when you like really stop to think about it and dude I don't think you stop and think about it till you're about our age yeah right like sure not I never thought about it and then like all of a sudden I look up in the mirror and I'm like fuck I'm 45 years old bro this is fucking weird yeah and then I'm like I got like 30 years left maybe and then I think about how fast 30 years went by right it's just a it's just a it's a weird like reckoning with the with reality that you have because of your age I know you have it too Joe but like the you know the thing is is like you got you got to live while you grind you got to live while you build you know and that's something that people they think it's you got to you got to give fucking 36 hours out of 24 every day and not have any fun that's not true no I've had a lot of fun doing what I do I love that you say that bro because what does every fucking entrepreneur say what you got to burn the candle at both ends you got to work 12 7 12s and I mean that's probably true in the beginning you know in the very beginning when you don't have shit yeah you got to do you got to sacrifice some some time that you would otherwise want to live but like that five years that three five years that you're going to put in changes your life exponentially for the rest of your life yeah and I think if that's only if you don't know shit yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think you can do both dude I mean well I still don't know shit so you know like I uh dude that's what happens when you get older you start realizing you don't know shit yeah it's kind of freeing right yeah oh dude you know I mean I was the black sheep of my family my family was all like white collar they thought I was crazy going off and doing what I was doing like you know you'll never make a living and for me I was like fuck it I'm gonna go have fun I'm gonna do some wild crazy shit I don't really plan on living more than the next five years six years the five years six years came oh shit you know it's funny because I was having this conversation the other day and I've been married to my wife now for 16 almost 17 years and you know like most married couples that are having like we're having some difficulty and struggles and my I was talking to my therapist because we're all kind of fucked up in the head right and I was like doc to be honest with you I didn't think I'd be married this long not because I'd get divorced I thought it was gonna be dead five six seven years ago yeah cool I'll get married I'll give her that I'll give her a kid I'll set her up I'll make sure she's good to go and then I'm fucking dying from lead poisoning somewhere in the world you know yeah and here I am somehow I didn't die I'm still here so yeah you know now we got what's the next thing I mean well I don't know how far down this tangent we want to go well we can go as long as we want right yeah um to be operational overseas like when I was in Ramadi in 04 and 05 you have to accept that you're already dead like you have to go into that non-promissive environment with an understanding I'm probably not coming out of it because if you if you are hopeful that you're gonna make it what that does is it kind of puts you in a place of fear right you have to be like hey this is a wild ride and I'm just gonna fucking go for it and eventually my lights are gonna get shut out and most veterans that I know that I worked with kind of came to that similar conclusion so you go through your entire 20s like for me from 21 to 29 was pretty much constantly deployed to a rocker afghanistan and then 30 I have a fucking baby and I I'm out of the military and I'm sitting there with this thing and that's why a lot of veterans spin out of control because it's like you have this understanding of who you were what your destiny entailed and then fuck I made it and not that that's a bad thing but it's actually a confusing thing because now you're just fucking sitting in this world that like you can't really identify with it doesn't make any sense to you and I say it all the time on my show it's like you went from fucking fighting men to the death to stalking shelves at home depot and that's where the wheels fall off you know I think the the whole veteran suicide epidemic is not due to like depression or things that they saw that they can't deal with it's loss of identity and I think almost everybody that went through that struggled with that to a certain degree I know him and I talk about that shit a lot I think a lot of people have that dude and it's not just veterans for sure people have it like athletes I know for sure athletes have it yeah it's it's you know this you've worked your whole life to become this thing and then all of a sudden that thing is over yeah and it's like what what now you know I think even entrepreneurs get that too man and I think that's why a lot of very wealthy successful people kill themselves yeah because they get to a point where they've accomplished all their you know financial goals and they've built the things they want to build and things are go and then you get there and you're like well fucking what now you know me at the top by yourself yeah and that's why you have to reposition your purpose you know you have to change from I'm trying to accomplish all these things for me to I'm trying to accomplish all these things so that other people can benefit and when you could switch that purpose to that you know you never really run out of of motivation right I think you just hit the nail in the head is that that's that that service attitude where it's like you've built like this place for an example dude you built this place up or we've built it there's been a lot of people well yeah yeah but like you guys are collectively the the the the royal you you know have built this place up and then obviously there's been leaders and people that have been really really instrumental in that build up but now look at this place and now you're like basically you're here for them for all these people in this building that's why you're here and you're still leading by example but your like not your gratitude may not be the right word but like your enjoyment now is by them serving them yeah absolutely and that's for me like it's a bigger purpose 100% and like for me on a smaller scale and I know with Greg like the happiest I am my happiest times hours throughout the day is when I'm on the mat with my team giving them my digits you're teaching them I just watching the light bulbs go off seeing them hit the move I just showed them beating the guy that's always beat them go yeah and they come up and they give you a hug and they're like really truly like grateful you know like fuck yeah let's do you just unlock something in them that they know I mean and like did you know I bet you got a lot about this when you were a police officer as well you know you're out helping you know helping people doing that well now whether or not you were allowed to do that but I know I know I know you well enough to know that the reason you did that was because you wanted to serve the community and the people that that you care about yeah because we just started this in an unconventional way let everybody know you know Greg tell him you know how we met and and how we've been buddies for you know how we got to be friends and and then also let them you know Greg you go after him all right Greg and Greg was not to add for this delicious screaming freedom for full of energy drink I've wanted to say that for you or the orange size yeah no so my story just I mean I did see or I did real AF been a couple years now so you can go back and listen but uh that was 2020 fuck that was a little more than a couple years ago yeah I think it was 2020 when you when they got the story went viral and so you know right out of high school went in the military I served with the Rangers and then I did some different military contracts which took about it was a 10 year period of deploying from I went in in 99 and then 2001 all the way to what would it have been 2009 I was basically deployed uh got married had a family and that's why I said you know what being gone 69 months of years probably not very conducive to having a family so I moved into law enforcement because that's a very normal transition for a lot of soldiers and I worked for a couple different agencies and then I ended up my last agency was in Seattle and I was a police officer there with the port and that's when COVID kicked off and and here's the weird thing man like I liked that agency I got along with my chief I was a I was a fucking VIP like everybody knew I was a go-to guy I got along with everybody no complaints or no citizen complaints nothing on my file but once I started seeing the direction that law enforcement was going I realized like dude we have to be the people that take a stand first the people in uniform that are sworn to protect the citizens were the ones that have to step up and say hey hey listen governor so and so listen mayor so and so I know you want to do all these things but that's not how the law works and so I decided to make a video articulating exactly that and and you were one of the first people that reached out to me oh yeah and I remember exactly said you said bro you think exactly how I think yeah we need like I want you on our team yeah we started talking and we formed a friendship but uh I don't understand it's funny because I get a lot of people even to this video tell everybody what the video was because it was quite a few years the video was me in my patrol car in uniform literally I was basically calling other on other police officers to take a stand against enforcing COVID lockdowns and illegal COVID mandates because that's what they were right any police officer can tell you I know DJ was a police officer if I'm going to arrest you or take any type of legal action there has to be some type of law or county violation that I can articulate it has to be on the books I have to have either reasonable suspicion or probable cause to be able to even interfere in the first place and when we had all these governors saying hey you know what shut the churches down hey you know what playground yeah you can't you can't drive your you can't drive your car here all this crazy shit I was like I don't know how these fucking governors think the law works but it's I'm gonna let them in on a little secret it ain't fucking that and and we remember remember remember how drunk on power all these people yeah and bro I'm telling you it was crazy it was like overnight dude and I'm telling you in the lunchroom behind closed doors 100% of police officers were like what the fuck is this I remember to this day like it was yesterday sitting in the lunchroom watching that paddle border off the coast of Marissa being chased by two police boats and I was sitting there with like 15 cops and every single cop was like what in the fuck are they doing I would never do that what are those cops doing I would never do that I would never do that I heard so many cops say that and I was like well instead of just sitting in the lunchroom and saying we would never do that let's like be public about it let's take a stand let's let citizens know that the governor is not a fucking dictator that can ruin your life the governor has to go through a legislated process and implement laws if he wants us to be able to enforce them and even if they did do that I'd still say fuck you because I'm not shutting down someone's business and then when I took a stand publicly bro a lot of cops were like dude you can't do that you can't say they got to be care I say whatever the fuck I want dude and it's it's crazy to me a lot of police officers are combat veterans bro I'll kick a door in Ramadi or or or go on an operation where I'm getting I.e.d. and shot at and everybody's cool with that but you're afraid to tell Mayor Jenny Durkin of Seattle go fuck yourself it's like where the fuck is your courage at dude and uh you know the agency ended up saying hey you know like yeah and this is what my fucking commander said to me I agree with what you said in principle but I've been told you can't say that publicly I said so you just told me on a on a principle basis you agree with everything I said but we can't say that we can't as police officers we can't impart a good message to our community he said no I've been directed to tell you have to take the video down so I'm not taking the fucking video down I'll fucking die first and it's funny because he called me and my wife was sitting next to me and we're drinking coffee and she looked at me and just instantly knew okay I guess I'm unemployed right and I was I got I got let go well I got put on leave that day and then I got fired a couple months later but bro here's another thing the fucking country rallied behind me man 100% and they they started to go fund me man and that fucking really helped my family and I'll tell you what a lot of cops hate me for getting that go fund me I got a lot of people talking shit to me well it's because it wasn't them of course what I was man but look I'm always going to say I've always we've always maintained on the show man I think you know that that year of 2020 all the craziness I know for a fact there are two pivotal moments that had those events not happen we would be in a completely different place a thousand percent right and I and one of those is without a doubt Ian Smith yeah and fucking just Andy standing up on the civilian side showing people like hey no this is my fucking like this my business this is and I'm standing up right it was that and bro it was you yeah because like I'm just hearing that again like that message going out to the civilian population knowing like well shit at least there's one cop you know I'm saying that that's fucking with bro we would have been in a completely different place had those two of us we'd be in a different place right now right now yeah for real right now that's why dude that's why I reached out immediately I reached out immediately to you as the minute I saw Ian Smith do that I reached out immediately to him because dude and we're all homies to this yeah for sure but like that I look man if you're trying to accomplish your mission and you don't have one or two people that step up and say hey I'll do it you're fucking losing yeah okay so I recognized immediately all I do we got to put these people together we got to get a message out and dude I truly believe that could have went a completely different way um had you guys not stood up dude and said something yeah and those pussy's man they're not mad that you know you got the fucking go find me they're not mad that you might have gotten a little you know from following their mad because they didn't have the fucking courage to do yeah well and that's what he's fucking succeeding yeah he's being successful though and I want to do the fucking better now that he was then I'm making I'm making four times as much money as I can now and the trajectory keeps going up but this is what happened I got that go fund me and I already had a jiu jitsu academy because jiu jitsu was something that was a passion of mine but it was never a business and I'll tell you man I sat down with lapen he helped me understand the the actual business aspect of jiu jitsu but Andy it was something that you said and I get confused sometimes if it's actually a text message thread between us or if I'm just listening to the show but one thing you said you said as an entrepreneur if you're chasing your your dreams and your goals for financial gain you're never you're never going to succeed yeah it has to be from a passion of making people's lives better and I remember that I thinking about that and bro when I applied that to my academy because the truth is in my jiu jitsu academy I just wanted to build killers I wanted the toughest dudes to come and join me and give me the toughest rounds and have a team of like savages and that was fun for a little while but I realized exactly what you said appealing to savages appealing to the toughest members of your community they're actually the people that need it the least you know who you need to impart skills on and build up it's the people that are overweight it's the people that were never athletes it's the children that don't have fathers and bro and like I get a lot of people who don't have any confidence yes you've never been believed in or never told they can do anything and bro once I started to be like you know what we can have fight club but we can also bring in 40-year-old ladies that are overweight we can bring in 10-year-old girls that don't have a father we can bring in the guys that have been behind a desk at Boeing for 10 years and have a beer belly and have never done anything athletic in their life and once I started to build an environment that was friendly welcoming and conducive to all walks of life boom that's where the magic took off and I'm telling you man I've already you know we've been on this trajectory for four years now I have seen people's lives change 180 degrees because they join our team they start to believe in themselves they get on the path they're eating clean foods they're exercising fuck half of them have done 75 hard and then before you know it people realize like oh there's actually value in being part of something that's seeking personal excellence and dude the the limit it's actually limitless like we expanded our facility once already and we're at capacity again yeah we're already looking at half into a fucking expanded again good problems to have right but that was the formula and bro I'll have a 10-year-old girl come in who like her shoulders are slouched and she looks at the ground and she kind of mumbles when you talk to her and inside a three months she's like good posture shaking your hand looking you in the eye and it's like that's what's gonna save her down the road from a sexual assault or being a victim it's not the fact or just getting stomped on by life yeah it's not the fact that oh she knows a triangle choke now no it's that predators are always yes yes yes you're wrong the jitters there and the jiu jitsu works but the predators are looking for the weakest link and once you believe in yourself you're not the fucking weakest link anymore that's right dude and think about like that woman who's 40 years old who has you know probably been fucking put through the ringer multiple times with multiple fucking relationships or career fucks and you know all kinds of bullshit and you take somebody like that and you give them what would be an intimidating skill set for them to consider yeah you know and then all of a sudden like they realize oh I I me too I can do hard things just like those other people the real me too that's right yeah no shit and then and then you have and then you have a you know a cascading effect where that woman is now taking that home to her children and you know what I'm saying and like bro this is what is going to save society anyway it's not going to be Donald Trump it's not going to be a politician it's going to be every single individual every single pillar of society which is us as individuals becoming the best that we can be and then looking out for the person to the left and the person to the right of us right like there's no there's no room for complacency and passivity anymore in this country considering what we just went through yeah right like that was straight up communist insurgency and subversion that's been going on and we were lucky we were lucky and we still might not be out of the woods but we are lucky to even have another chance because yeah in history we almost lost that's right in history when we go past the point where we were at genocide's happy massive wars happen and it could still happen but if we're going to protect ourselves from this again we have to realize that like it's not just the men it's fucking everybody it doesn't matter if you're 80 or fucking 20 or 15 or in between we have to take personal responsibility for being the best versions of ourselves because society can only be as good as the individual is and people forgot that people people don't think about it like that bro they think about it like oh man somebody else is going to do it or this politician's going to make things awesome or he's not going to make your life awesome bro that's why I'm sure this become my podcast slogan yeah no one's coming to save you they are because that's the fucking truth yeah and I've you've seen the pictures on my academy my academy is very clean I don't have a bunch of pictures or slogans or anything except one and it's personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion I want the kids to believe that yeah I want the with the overweight women to believe that because it's the fucking truth yeah that's right bro if we don't need them then there's no power that they can have over us yep so I think it comes down to do not just turning a blind eye and overlooking shit because a lot of people they won't do it themselves but when something's happened they won't say anything either like yeah I don't get involved fuck that get involved that's got a that's a mother point bro that you got to get involved like I'm sick and tired a good friend of ours Seth far well a monkey was his call sign guy was a fucking monster he passed four years now four years ago now past this dude was 240 pounds six foot three percent body fat could run a mile and under five minutes and like fucking overhang clean overhead clean like just stupid like guys a freak in nature and he could say anything he wanted to anybody at any point in time total strangers like what did you say that was the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard and no one would ever get mad at this motherfucker and when he when I got the text I remember I was laying in bed it was like 10 3 at night it's just monkey's gone and I was like I'm gonna be like more like monkey every day I'm and I've never really held my tongue but I will not let people spout off dumb bullshit that I know not to be true anymore without calling them out and I don't even need to know you I well bro to get you the other day but see you're a strong man and you're a strong man and I'd like to think I'm a strong man okay I got my weaknesses but I would say in general we do bro but okay you're fucking savage but like look bro the average person is fucking manipulated and shamed and guilted into silence they don't have they are told like think about this don't talk money don't talk politics it's rude don't don't say this don't say that if you say this somebody's gonna get offended and most people don't want conflict so so they're told this framework of rules that create a conducive environment for other people to control us right like oh bro if you say that even if it's true it's offensive but like those people that say that shit to us they don't have any problem offending us they'll say whatever the fuck they want to us and what's even what's interesting about it is those people are the weakest fucking people in society they're the weakest please Gavin Newsom yes Justin Trudeau but dude don't fucking joke in me mother those people like us listen to motherfuckers like them are you fucking kidding me bro they will shake their finger at us and say blah blah blah blah I don't say this don't say that because it creates a bubble of immunity around them that's there so dude if we're gonna I mean Greg you're 100% right dude if we're gonna protect ourselves from this ever happening again this bullshit of political correctness and this bullshit of silent majority has a fucking stop and media go man it's gotta go well here's a problem though I think a lot of people including myself to a certain degree up until 2020 we thought the government was incompetent and ignorant and we didn't know they were actually like I always thought they would have her back yes I always thought the military would have her back we didn't know that are the US government is actually the enemy of the people right and and I look at this the last four years is like a blessing in disguise because it forced a great awakening and it forced normal people that just you know hey I don't really get involved in politics I work nine to five I'm just trying to support my family oh like why why are they trying to fucking cut my 12 year old daughter's tits off yeah maybe I wait what's going on here right and and there was so much a gree just shit there was being shoved down our throat over and over and fucking over that now every day people that weren't really involved were kind of like what's what's really going on behind the scenes and remember what I text you right after the election I said and you're a big part of why the great awakening happened and I want thank you for that because like I'm doing we're all doing our part but at the end of the day you have a bigger reach and a lot of times people with big reaches and big platforms they fucking pander because they don't want to get canceled if we're being real everybody fucking pandered until the end okay like oh bro we are one of the only shows that for fucking 800 straight episodes and four and a half straight years told the truth okay and I don't give a fuck when anybody has to say about that because I got the receipts that's right up against yours yeah okay so there's that right but at the end of the day man you know it's not about credit it's about our opportunity to it's about the blessing of the opportunity that we have to legitimately build this country into something greater than it's ever been yeah because we do have that ability right now have like I agree with you I think it almost it's going to work out to be a blessing because now we understand how far away we actually were from what we thought the country was right like I talked to a lot of vets and you guys would probably you know have your own opinions on this but a lot of a lot of my veteran buddies you know they're patriots dude so like when they went over to fucking fight they bought the outside of the political agenda they bought the mission like hey we're here to protect these people we're here to fight for freedom we're here to do this and now those people have realized holy shit we were ponds we were fucking manipulated to go fucking do this shit for money and this killing people in their own neighborhoods and I was the good guy dude are you out of your fucking mind bro but when you're 22 years old you know what they told us we got to kill him over there so they don't come over here of course and bro like we all bought off on that shit you know they're bad guys like bro they're they're they're they live in Ramadi they're not coming over here to kill my family but that was the fucking narrative yeah we were given well I'll say this now here I'll probably guys yeah oh we got oh dude it's just wait until so I um I worked for an organization over there that was a primarily an intelligence based organization and I will say on that note uh one of the targets we hit and recovered a bunch of intel and this is back in 2007 uh we recovered intel we do what's called ssc sensitive site exploitation see all the intel collection so we hit a target security target and we're dumping stuff in bags and carrying those bags out hard drives phones documents etc and uh the intel and intel analyst get it all and we uncover basically um 40 plus blueprints and plans for elementary middle schools here in the US to all get hit at the exact same time all around the country yeah so there are bad mother fuckers out there planning to do us fucking harm here yeah but again that's not an occupation job that's not what we didn't have to understand I wonder why they want to kill our kids all the shit well I like they want to for a long time like yeah no shit for a long time but like special operations can go deal with that now we don't have to occupy we don't have to win hearts and minds and all the bullshit that really pisses people off we literally target the bad guys who want to kill us regardless of what we're doing we fly in fucking the unit delta gag whatever you want to call seal team six dev group whatever you want to call them flies in fucking doesn't expose your breach schwaxes dudes flies out and they're gone and knowing in the neighborhood every even fucking knows the difference and the bad guys that are planning this mission are fucking gone but well if we have an occupying force killing our kids here in America I fucking plan a mission to go kill their fucking shit there's a book called wrath of the wind to go and it's fucking fascinating and it's written by a green beret and it's about a rebel force fighting against the US government and in that book the the United States Air Force is bombing US citizens and so like you can't like what does Joe Biden always say you can't fight against f eight teens or whatever you know like that's a threat of course it's a threat and in this book you know what they did do there are rebel force you right they can't fight against fucking aircraft so they went on to air force base housing when all the pilots were flying around doing missions and they killed all their children and it's like you killed our kids from the air and we killed your kids in their bed and like that sounds so fucking dark right that's exact it is dark like I don't ever want to have to do something like that but if you fucking push us dude like these fucking people think January six was an interaction brought here to tell you right now and I already know because I say this shit on my show all the time so special agent so and so that fucking listens to my show you know I'm right when I say this you know that I'm right that's why don't give a fuck about saying it there is a huge fucking group of combat veterans that have been pushed to the absolute fucking brink and better exercising tactical patients this fucking election everybody can kind of be like oh fuck okay we don't got to do it this time because I'm fucking telling you dude yeah we are sick of these motherfuckers yeah and the toughest most capable men that I know that are former seals rangers delta everybody sick of being fucking pushed around dude and these motherfuckers have no idea the capabilities of the monsters that they built well that's going to be the irony in all of this yeah because think about this they're downfall is going to be based on the people that they built bro but think about this okay what happens in another eight years when you're fucking over 50 or another 12 years oh I know okay that's why they're killing all the testosterone and making another generational well men that that brings me to the point that we have an opportunity a window here to where we could correct culture where they won't be able to do that again for a very long time yes right and so we got really lucky that uh and dude trumps that in office so I'm still I'm a reservations about him and getting in there but um you know we have to realize that if we're going to not just maintain this country but build something that because like dude when I think of America I don't think of it like as some sort of perfect thing at all like I think it's highly flawed I think the structure of its highly flawed I think there's all kinds of things that need to be changed but I believe that we have people in office and we have enough awareness in our citizenship that they understand that these changes are required necessary so I think a lot of them are going to happen and if it does happen we're going to be in a good spot but that still doesn't uh you know remove us from our obligation as men to lead and and as men to hold a standard and women to hold a standard because the reason that we've been able to get so far off course is because these motherfuckers hijacked our own kids right they got them in school and they're teaching them all this crazy shit these kids get out they're not equipped to and I talked about this 10 years ago on my show they're not equipped to function in society they don't know any skills they haven't been taught basic anything and then they get out in the world and they get their fucking dicks kicked in and then you wonder why they're running around in the streets with pool noodles and fucking pink air you know trying to start a revolution yeah you know like they don't feel that the system is fair and they're correct it's never been fair it's never going to be fair but you guys got to specially fucked because you were told that uh you know everything's gonna be okay right and just because you're born and just because you went to school and just because you exist and breathe air you're some sort of special person and everything's gonna be fine you're gonna you're gonna survive you're gonna be 20 and 25 and 30 and we'll figure it out and dude what these people are figuring out is they don't have any skills they don't have any knowledge they don't have any ability to work or compete in the real world and dude when you put a bunch of people in society that are unequipped you end up with chaos yes you know and talk checkers their whole life that's right and and right and that's why you get them crying about you know and so and and supporting things like socialism or they cry about fairness or injustice or oppression motherfucker there is nothing fair about life there is oppression everywhere from every different angle against every different people they it's different degrees for everybody in different ways nobody has it easy nobody has it fair nobody has a smooth path but they have sold a a lot of people on the idea that certain people are only where they're at because they were born a certain way and dude if you convince a population that they can only be successful if they're born a certain way now we're dealing with a hope problem right they don't even see a possibility of becoming any better and if they don't see a possibility of becoming any better what instead of do they have to even try yeah there's an ideology that they just can't beat you know and like people that think we live imagine being taught that your whole life oh it's about 20 years old well I mean that exists in the world and like everyone that wants to bitch a moan about you know um diversity and and how we're getting pinnered against each other and racism and all this shit here in the US like go to another fucking country like we are the most tolerant culture and country in the fucking world yeah and you want to see real fucking racism anywhere else real like real discrimination go to these other countries where you can be the same religion or the same color as this other person but you come from a different tribe and you're treated like a fucking slave dude but there was some study I remember seeing you go to fucking China dude they fuck if you're not Chinese they say fuck you get the fuck out of here yeah yeah if you go to fucking dude if you go to any of these countries besides the western countries that have been manipulated for the last 15 years they're proud of their their heritage okay it's not racist to say I'm Irish and I live in Ireland and I would like Ireland to stay Irish yeah like that is not racist yeah okay uh but people say it is and they'll tell you it is yeah and then the number one name is Muhammad so I have no fuck does that make sense well Andy everything that you just said about like us trying to promote like equality and fairness and everybody's equal and I know I'm biased and he is too because we run jiu jitsu academies but jiu jitsu in my opinion is the best tool to teach reality and the dot will fucking agree like the mats don't lie hey this guy may have been training for a year and this guy may have been training for two years but this guy learned how to beat the shit out of that guy and it doesn't feel fair and it doesn't feel good and it feels scary and like all the shit that you just talked about like helps people understand reality because jiu jitsu's reality and that's why him him and I's mission has become to teach people capability primarily through jiu jitsu but also through lots of other avenues too like firearms training fitness health what you put in your body how you fuel your body I've even moved into like hunting and self-sustaining shout out to my buddy Josh Reduks it's taught me how to deer hunt and every time I shoot a deer I cry like a f*** dude it doesn't feel good because we were talking about it before we were recording we're animal people right but once you have a capability you shoot a bad guy you're like fucking god oh yeah yeah but once you start to learn these capabilities that can self-sustaining you is set you free because now I'm not locked into the matrix under your rules and I'm to the point now and I don't have everything figured out like I'm not a f***ing Mike Glover yet except Mike Glover doesn't have my jiu jitsu so but like I know that if shit goes bad I'm gonna be okay yeah in fact the worst shit gets the problem or okay we okay I'm gonna we drive in that and once you're okay and that's what I tell my kids I sit my f***ing daughters down and because they I don't try and hide any of the shit from them when when the country was looking like it was going towards chaos I had to have those real conversations with them and I said hey maybe we vote our way out of this and the the world can find stability again or maybe everything implodes and we're living out in our property in the woods and we're living on squirrels and slugs but either way in whatever society f***ing falls into there's gonna be winners and losers and I'm gonna be a f***ing winner yeah and once you believe that there's no fear attached in no bro there's zero options to it either like like people think that it's a choice it's not a f***ing choice bro you're either gonna f***ing do everything you have to do or you're not yeah and you know people don't understand that it's and it goes the same way in business you know you're either gonna do whatever is required to win or you're gonna f***ing lose that's it it's too competitive otherwise and when you're talking about survival it's the same shit even more so it's an ultimate competition yes bro they say they say if the grid goes down 90% of Americans die in one calendar year like I've seen I've seen it like first hand multiple times uh living through some pretty bad hurricanes hurricane Katrina was a cop in New Orleans you know uh you can't tell some of those stories on the air can you know there's one there's one sir I can't tell the special limitations still laying out um I can tell some stories but there's one sir I can't but uh you know three hours three hours without services without power with with cops dealing with those stuff the savages start coming out and they start praying on people three days everyone starts turning into a savage after three days people start losing hope and and giving up you know and uh one of the things for me is like we've lost f***ing touch in our society with reality we've lost f***ing touch between video games and the internet and these movies and this all this this f***ing um equality and and being politically correct bullshit and like one of the things that he and I both agree on is like I don't and I get asked all the time hey can you do a three hour self defense women self defense seminar I go no I well I can but I won't well why because here's the thing I'm selling you snake well because in three hours I'm not gonna other than maybe inspiring you to go change you to I'm not giving you shit and women will come and ask me all the time like how long do I need to change you to before I can like really defend myself against a male attacker six years seven years that's the reality because the fact of matters I'm a super don't you have to continue to train to well you're a very capable skill absolutely anything with training right it's it's recency you need recency whether it's firearms whether it's you get to boxing whatever it may be there's got to be recency in that training and it's got to be reoccurring but like I'm a I might I know what I am I'm a 46 year old broken down very mediocre hobbyist black belt and we're not equal but we get so caught up in this thing and like we said all the time like whenever visitors come to my academy or we're hosting an event I tell and and I got this really from him we both say it is like guys there's two sexes that's it there's two genders that's it and there's a difference between us and if the two of you guys want to go in the corner and beat the fuck out of each other cool have at it if you're rough with one of my girls it's on I'm gonna fuck you up next round because on these guys we stop at you up mid-round because we protect our women you know one of the coolest quotes and the women love hearing that of course they do because they know there's a difference that's the essence of masculinity you know they know there's a difference like you're gonna dude I got fucking two ducks I got five ducks I saw your ducks in their fucking Taj Mahal Tau yeah they're doing their their battle training I'm training them to be warriors so I got these two ducks and they're paired duck and daisy and duck is like little bitty duck bro compared to these the other three he's tiny he will fucking get in between him and his little partner who's the littlest duck yeah no fear no fucking doesn't give a fuck he'll fight these other ducks until he's dead and and I'm always like bro he's a little bad ass like that's that's what that and it's my point in saying that is it's primal we all know it and let's know it it's it's it's it's what it's better to be yeah well and to take it back to like what we were saying about not doing women self-defense seminars like we came here and gave a jiu jitsu seminar right but we sold it as an introduction to jiu jitsu and right out of the gates we say if there's aspects of this that you like or that you want to expound on you're gonna have to go find an academy and you have to continue to train but one thing that I do like to say about training on the mats is like as I as developing a warrior mindset I have never felt anything that's more scary than another man that can beat you in the realm of physical combat I've had dude shoot RPGs at me machine guns I've been ID'd mortared none of that stuff gives that anxious response as when you have Marcus Bouchesha holding your head against his chest and you can't breathe it's like and you start to feel like fuck dude this man has the ability to take my life and it's fucking scary and I have found the the number one tool to hone your warrior spirit is literally on the mats training jiu jitsu in MMA because one another man has the physical capacity to impose his will on you that doesn't feel good that's a scary feeling and I don't care how long you've been in this I've been doing jiu jitsu for 22 years now I'm a third degree black belt and when a big fucking Brazilian gorilla gets on top of me and just stifles me and takes away my ability to breathe you start to feel that panic and if people don't acknowledge that they're lying other than Diego Sanchez I don't think that fucking dude has the capacity to feel panic but most people you have to train that and you have to you want to push that fear as far away from being something that arises in a conflict as possible and the only way to do that is to train train train train and you'll see it man people will come into the gym and out of the gates they'll fucking like tap out as soon as you mount them because they're like fuck this is scary a year later you can be fucking grinding your elbow across their face and you can tell like I'm not saying you like it but you can manage it and it's all about managing the world's emotions yeah and again like that's why that's why it's become our number one mission dude and we can talk about Jiu-Jitsu for the next two hours and it goes let us know when it's the one that goes into a lot of things and that's that's one of the reasons you know when when I met Mike Glover one of the reasons he brought me out to field craft survival is you know he realized that physical capability unarmed no weapons no tools and I say this all the time like this this is our mark one model weapon system our body our brain this is the vessel we brought into the world with right and if you're not physically capable of violence then no matter the tools you have and you know he someone said it to him with guns Greg we're not fighting people with swords anymore and I'm like have you ever been in a gunfight motherfucker you know how fucking exhausting that is with that adrenaline dump and that cortisol course in your veins and you think and you're gonna die I ran a course not too long ago and it was a like a small unit tactics course and a bunch like wealthy guys come out and no one was grossly overweight or out of shape and we're doing bounding drills was called IMT's individual movement tactics right and it's something that 17 year old Rangers do right out the gate and it's essentially like you're in the prone you say I'm up and you get up you run they see me I'm down right and you say that I'm up they see me I'm down I'm up they see me I'm down right and it's like three to five second rushes and that's how you learned about and then you start in court well there are dudes out there that after four or five of these little three to five second rushes they're like using their hands I'm like guys come here where everyone bring it in I was like you guys are out here with all your expensive gear your multi cam your belts your three thousand dollar go to the locks yeah I was like you guys are gonna fucking die let me be real you guys are gonna fucking die I said because you guys don't have the as there's a reason that swat and special operations hat their baseline metric for getting into those units is a serious fucking physical fitness test there's a reason for it it's they figured that out you know this is hard shit when we're fighting with a gun a rifle a knife a stick a brick a rock or a fucking hands like that shit's tiring you better be able to endorse some of that how long is a gun fight last I mean obviously you can last totally depends yeah so state side the current statistics still are about three to five seconds three to five seconds is state side um but again that's like the majority and and the statistics are skewed too because it's like that could be a domestic dispute between a husband a wife and a kitchen right so a lot of these videos you see of law enforcement gun fights that are are going through you know a city block that are much much much longer and those to just like gun violence they say like gun violence and I forget exactly the percentages but the majority of gun violence that they they claim in the statistics is people killing themselves suicide yeah come on what the fuck we talking about you guys who are seeing that video it's just got me thinking have you ever seen that video where that fucking cop pulls up and he's got an SUV and he's got a coffee any fucking oh yeah he pulls up real calm turns the key off sets the coffee on his dash walks around in the back unzips his rifle bag what cow pops the dude it goes subject down yeah like and that was a far shot bro I remember like 50 on yeah that guy didn't this fucking that guy didn't even fucking it was just like and then I've seen other cops and videos that are like fucking hyperventilating yeah after they shot shots fun shots fun dude fucking relax bro don't you think that's an innate thing like there's certain people that hundred percent dude because like there's what I've noticed is like when things get fucked like when you know like I've seen some bad things like motor vehicle accidents and you know some other things I found a dude who hung himself one time shit like that and people either respond one of two ways they either get calmer when things get fucking crazy or they just pick up the energy of the crazy and go crazy and com breeds calm chaos yeah I've always been one of those people naturally that like when chic it's real fucking crazy dude I like my temperature goes way down 100% and bro there's like it's been this natural I didn't learn it it's just something I have no that's nature verse nurture for short because I've been the same way things get crazy I get I go in a flow state and I'm like I don't yell you the people who know me when it's when I'm really really fucking mad and like people are about to start like getting hurt they're like dude are you all right yeah I'm good bro like yeah all right we need to leave now yeah a lot of a lot of young Rangers they wanted to go to combat because I mean I was I got into the Ranger Regiment 1999 so it's still peacetime military I was in the Ranger Regiment during the transition and a lot of Rangers like they wanted to go to war to see how they would handle it right and then when we actually went to war it's like okay this is no big deal like it's actually not that scary it's not that hard to shoot you would have had that talk yeah like like something that like goes around the special operations community it's kind of a joke but it's also true it's like how what did you feel the first time you killed a man and recoil you know just like what it's just not a big deal it actually kind of felt like you were playing a video game to be honest and that's not to like try and sound fucking hard or beat my chest it's just like you you can detach emotionally in the moment and you don't really I mean it feels exciting it's also probably different like how you kill them too right like for sure you shoot them one yeah 40 50 hundred yards away versus putting a knife in their neck yeah or smash in their face with a rock like fucking Dakota Meyer yeah yeah yeah the training has a big part of it you know and I tell people all the time like there's a reason the training progression is the way it is so you know it's like you start first start with like rubber duck what we call rubber duck guns and then you go real guns but you're dry firing and then you're on a just a flat range just shooting a target and next thing you know you're doing multi team you know team stuff with blanks and then you start amping it up to then you're doing simulations for some for shooting real role players then you're doing live fire stuff with full explosive explosive breaches and flash bangs and this and flying so the the progression training progression is scaled and scaled and scaled and scaled to build that stress and occupation and make what we're doing make us into subconscious competence in our training so like you said make a video game it's like hey bad guy go walk walk walk walk walk okay cool we're good let's roll well you know like oh fuck which is happening you know like after the fact you did the book on killing written by Lieutenant Colonel Grossman right he said I don't remember if it was I think it was World War one the army trained and the bulls eyes that they shot were just round targets they're just bulls and a huge percentage of soldiers when it went when it became time to kill human beings fucking weren't able to pull the trigger and then after that the military changed the targets to what's called the type silhouettes it looks like the shadow of a man and the the percentage of people that were willing to shoot a human being after changing from a bullseye to an e-type grew exponentially and it's just it's ingraining that into your subconscious you know that's so interesting it's crazy the black silhouettes yeah I mean they change them the dark green you're either a great green marine or a dark green marine you know and like a lot of our a lot of our training now like I can show you like a video that we took of my team training last year and it's so realistic you're like holy fuck like we're going in we got we've got our dogs ready we're putting explosive breaches on the door we have role players live role players players inside the house and we're doing full explosive breaches doing gun portals blowing holes in the wall to stick a gun through it and breaches on the front door and breaches on the back door and sending our assault dog in and you know it's like that's we are we are doing these training operations so close to reality short of actually shooting people with real bullets that when it comes time and it happens for real it's just like another day it's just another day you know just someone ends up dead and it can be us too but we know that going into it and to say there's you know the risk you understand the risk I'm not going to say you're without fear but it's not really that scary you know that's not to sound bravado but it's like like he said like you just go and do the job you know it's you and that is it and it's over one is over yeah well and dude I love the the story of your neighbor oh yeah he was a opera singer yeah yeah telling you like I don't know how you do this for a job that sounds so scary yeah yeah so my my old neighbor he was a world famous opera singer like countries would bring him in for a month or two at a time to sing operas around the country and he was the huntness fish in his dude you ever met like super country like you want to go catch fish you go with him you don't go fish and you go catch him with him you want to go shoot animals you go with him and we're staying that with shriek out of the two things don't seem like they go they don't call inside right his his mom was a a university music teacher and like a high level and he just had an act for it and I guess that's where he went you know he had a skill set and I had just come back from overseas so I think I'd only been home for like a week or so and I'm always a little on edge it takes me when I'd come home from deployments it probably taking me a good 30 days to like settle back in and it's pretty much going right back you know and we're sitting we're standing out in the street drinking having a beer and watching the kids playing ride their bikes and he's like oh man so how was you know the trip I was like I was good it was busy you know I just small talk dude we're getting rocketed every day blah blah blah you know couple guys got blown up got shot blah blah blah and he's like dude how terrifying is that I'm like that's not really like I said let me let me clarify he's like dude that's not you're not scared I said no you have a level of fear you understand the risk but it's really not that scary my I was not afraid of being killed right you you come to grips terms of that I my biggest fear my biggest fear was getting knocked unconscious from an explosion or a crash or or something like that waking up in an orange jumps that was my biggest fear right waking up and and being captured I I carried a I carried a hand grenade just for me I actually carried it in my medical pouch surround wrapped in gauze and I carried a hand grenade just for me and if I had access to that that's that was I was clacking that off with me and whoever was to come and try to grab me but um I was like he's like so like you go in a bad guy's houses and like go kill them or capture them like yeah sometimes and dude that's gotta be terrifying I said dude Paul it's really not you know it's like that's what we trained for we we trained highly high we're really really good at it and I said you know what scares me and he's like what he's like holy shit if that doesn't scare you what scares you he's a really intrigued you know I was like what really terrifies me is putting on a leotard getting on a stage in front of a thousand people and singing and Latin with no microphone and he starts laughing right and I said but you do that all the time right right and I was like do you get nervous before a show he's like yeah sure you got a little bit of nerves right but that's what I do I said bingo that's what I do I said Paul if you told me hey that house in the corner dude there's three terrorists down to a case I'm like all right cool I'll be right back and I'm gonna go in my house I'm gonna get my kid on yeah I'm gonna get my kid on put my night vision on wait for it to get dark I'm gonna go in there I'm gonna kill all three of them and then I'll come back out and we'll finish our beers I said but getting on a stage and singing and Latin with no microphone that terrifies a shit out of me bro I'd be scared shitless and he's laughing I was like I was like it's the same thing dude you're trained for that and you're an expert in that and you have nerves he's like yeah but you could die I was like yeah cool you come to terms that you could fucking blow your show shit yourself on stage and then have horrible reviews and you'd be you'd have a real on every social media platform I'm just dead right people are gonna go celebrate me and have my picture I'm probably gonna fucking statue somewhere I don't know you know I was like so it's really no different I love it I love it the shit we do man like yeah you can you can get used to some pretty crazy stuff you know yeah I love it man I changed my alarm one of my first pumps to a rack they would rocket us every morning at like 645 in the morning every fucking morning two to three rockets and we have these counter battery systems right so a lot of times they would shoot two three rockets and they disappear because they know the counter battery systems are gonna target them and then we'll go kill them the other thing they're doing is are setting up mortars and putting ice between the mortar in the bottom of the mortar tube so it would they can they leave them there leave them in an alley and then disappear and the ice would melt throughout the day and then don't clack off the mortar and no one would be there but I literally reset my I was sick and tired of getting war woken up by the rockets flying over my hooch and hearing that you know and blowing up on base somewhere and if you hear it you're live and if you don't hear it you're fucking dead so it's the difference because they move faster than the yeah let's be to sound yeah so I'm here the ones that kill you yeah so I reset my alarm 15 minutes prior to that to 630 in the morning so I could wake up and I'd be brushing my teeth my hooch in here all right cool whatever don't I don't want to get woken up by rockets I'd rather be already awake you know that's it that's awesome you guys will do some cruising yeah fuck that's dude was that an hour and a half intro we're at 57 let's let's do an honor of patriots I feel like we have some patriots here we love this country we don't plan on leaving anywhere but apparently a few people do and a few people have now in degenerates and Rossi yeah there you go dude they've fucking moved England good hey the food sucks over there you guys are there goodbye I'm really broken hearted that they fucking left hey you see that little fucking twerp that's like I don't want to live in the country that Donald Trump is the president of so I'm moving to Hawaii what a dumb self-delighting man thank god can all the members of the view in Rosio Donald fucking leave to man so that's the thing I mean they're supposed to be on that list there's a long list probably of about 30 people that actors actresses you know singer songwriter it's such a foolish thing to say right like dude there's been politicians that have been voted into power fucking Joe Biden was one of them that I despise as leaders and quotation marks as men they have no integrity they don't have the ability to actually lead and there couldn't be a more despicable person to be the commander in chief why would I fucking just give up on my country because a piece of shit is voted into power because you're so weak that you can't you don't have the ability to defend it that's right dude that's right so so there's a difference when they say it they're afraid that they're terrified right they're like fucking I'm gonna get when we say it when when when things don't go our way we say all right well come fucking get some yeah come fucking get some boots it's a different thing yeah they don't have the a bill this is why it's so ironic that these people are the ones that continue to agitate and call for violence because they are the least equipped to deal with any sort of violence right how is woopy goldbird gonna call for you know all this crazy shit when she's 80 years old and fucking morbidly obese and retarded you know what I'm saying like stir up all the shit in the mouth yeah but see dude that's a different mentality like patriotic Americans they're gonna say no this is my country and yes I don't agree with the president we have however as long as he doesn't come and step on my toes directly we'll work it out yeah that's that's the mentality but they don't have the ability to even think that no they have to yeah and honestly like what you just said and that was a big turning point for me during the whole covid bullshit because same thing I was still a cop I was a swap cop outside of New Orleans and I had also owned my own jiu jitsu academy and I was like you know initially when it first came out I was like all right maybe this is kind of serious like I just the first few days let's look into this now like then you start seeing all these all the doctors out of California she's talking about antibodies and there's a lot of bullshit I'm like we're staying open we're gonna stay open if you don't want to train cool if you live with an older parent cool that's what makes us adults in America we can disagree but if you want to train we're here and my entire SWAT team we had a plan like if they were gonna start enforcing lockdowns or anything like that but like we were there and then so I just decided like you know what fuck our federal government they're not gonna do shit they don't really have any but I'm gonna focus on my local government my governor and down because you want to come into my town my neighborhood and tell me what I can and can't do we're gonna have a fucking fight on the hands I don't give a shit with the federal government says anymore so focus on that you know your neighborhood your community your school board your your mayor your governor and and let them do what they want to do well and if you have a fucking problem with the government draw hard line and fucking stand behind that what is fleeing to England do yeah so many fucking courage well they don't have no head man that way those people don't care about the country no they don't that's the difference they're not patriotic people they have no emotional attachment to the country this is not their country in their mind this is just a place they live yeah so it's a different mentality they don't the elegant generous and Portia de Rossi they're they are so far removed from having any sort of pride or attachment to land or a community you know like bro these people are are in a different fucking planet yeah you know and mentally so like dude of course they're gonna move they don't operate in reality no I just like to get the fuck out of here I never liked Ellen yeah I just like her no no way no no no no reason shit never never I don't even know what 12 days of Christmas she never gave me shit yeah I never got any fuck off from Ellen just you fuck off yeah I used to like her until like I realized that like you know I didn't you know but she's got some fucked up mentality's man it's that I just don't understand like how the fuck do people get so upset like what reality are they living in that they literally think our last administration they don't follow would be a better president they don't think that you don't have to like Donald Trump for to agree or recognize or admit that what he did for the country was better for the country you don't have to like the listen it's what he said yeah they don't think they don't think that they don't think that they are fucking forced and leveraged to have that opinion that is why they are famous they have traded their soul they have traded their integrity they have traded everything that means something to be a human being for success money and fame and these people are owned by other people yeah it's not their own opinions they're not even allowed to have their own opinions they're not and I think a lot of these people I think we're gonna see a lot of these people move I think we're gonna see a lot of these people quote unquote disappear and I think we're gonna see some suicides well you already yeah suicides and quotation made no no real suicide no bro I think for real I think these people have done such criminal shit for so long and they're so afraid it's gonna come out that we're gonna see some of that yeah well you can you can see some of them already starting to pander and and like asking Trump to meet them and like hey maybe we should uh maybe we should become a little more bipartisan yeah like those morning Joe is like oh yeah you're you're ready to do that after the election even though leading up to that was just a fucking the smear campaign of smear campaign citing violence and call calling him Hitler every single fucking guy after the assassination attempt there was like 48 hours when they're like you know what maybe we shouldn't be saying all these things oh yeah no shit because what you're doing is you're warping people's minds and anyway right back to it yeah Trump wants generals like Hitler had it's like and people believe that shit dude he calls soldiers suckers and losers and it's like oh he hates the military it's like bro I have he's gonna use the new like my friend Joe Kent did you have Joe Kent on no no I know he is Joe Kent when when he went to was it dover to to pick up Shannon's remains which is a good serious yeah fucking Trump met him there and then he started talking to him about Shannon's life and he told me goes bro is very apparent that like he knew he was gonna receive the remains of my wife with me so he went and did her homework on her and learned a little bit about her where she's from who she is so he could conversate with me like he doesn't fucking think your soldiers are suckers and losers it's the stupidest fuck it's the stupidest fucking thing and you know what even if he did think that he's too smart to say that yeah like be fucking serious yeah and these people just get manipulated by the narratives dude no he doesn't think it's a lot of the social media so a few years ago I started a fake Instagram account with like a like a Trump head with an ex on it and I think I had title like bad orange man or something like that just infiltrating yeah just to see what the algorithm would do right and I started and I went in and I followed all these like super left and super liberal like and just CNN and all this stuff all the new channels and then you see the algorithm pop up and my that feed was getting nothing but like hate against him and hate against him and hate against him like ridiculous shit that's just being made up but that's people who follow that line of thought that's what they're seeing all day every day and they're not seeing any of the other shit so it's like they're getting manipulated here's the fucked up thing about it though as you take 918 19 20 year old impressionable mind and you feed him this narrative for four years straight and you say dude if he gets into power our democracy is gonna fall if he gets into power like you're going to camp you're gonna go to camps like all this stuff and he's literally gonna end democracy even though he was already the president for for fucking years yeah if he gets in this time he's gonna end democracy so their brain starts to get manipulated thinking oh like trying to shoot him would actually be the honorable thing that would be the patriot thing to do bro you know I'm saying listen every conflict that has happened in the history of mankind near side thought they were the bad guy yeah yeah yeah you know like these people like and here's the thing too because we need deaf freedom of speech people should be able to say whatever the fuck they want but when they're also fucking manipulating people's minds like we should drag them out in the street and fucking beat them to death with a hammer yeah that has to be consequences man because that's the problem we're of a or a society free of consequence I've got the fix I've got the fix I've been saying it for a decade I've got the fix you can get your concealed carry permit in pretty much any state you live in right and you take a little test you do a background check some states have a little psyche value go and you shoot the little course and the state deems you have sound body in mind here Andy Frazzella we're giving you this card you can carry a pistol in defensive your life or the life of others right all we need to do is issue out a punch in the mouth license right you do the same thing they deem you have sound body in mind to issue the proper amount of force to go punch someone in the fucking mouth when they're acting like an asshole so you're standing there grocery store and it could be a little old lady just being a complete cunt why go ma'am sorry here's my card and he's give her a little pop there's a little one right because you right and then it could be a dude at a restaurant drunk act like a fucking asshole hey bro here you go wham you know it's like dude people would stop acting like assholes look at you there that's that's a real thing okay when when you and I and men of our age grew up there was an understanding that you didn't step on someone's toes you didn't just respect them if you did you apologize because there was a chance that you might get punched in the fucking 30 o'clock in the field but that's cool bro and that doesn't exist anymore that doesn't exist anymore so we have eroded the natural order of hierarchy amongst men and society that's right there is no fear of repercussions there are people that are willing to push look at all the little prank kids on the internet who run up to people and fuck with them and it's like bro you guys don't understand like you're gonna go fuck with somebody like me or one of you guys and someone's gonna knock your fucking teeth out all hundred percent yeah like and and and the reason they're comfortable doing that is because they've never dealt with that natural when I would call you know Nate natural order of society amongst men you know like dude even my the the friends I've had the longest in my life these are usually people that we've had a couple physical confrontations with you know but the reason that we're still friends and the reason that we have such a good bond is because there's that respect there that that lasts forever of course right and that's the problem with society and especially with men they do not understand that anymore and we have to get back to a point one way or another to where that's understood yeah you know we talked about this at breakfast with Nick men will do the right thing for one of two reasons their own personal integrity or fear of repercussions yeah right and now we have all these politicians that are no longer living in a state of fear of repercussions and that's why they're running fucking wild and it's like dude if if it's found that you don't vote on behalf of your constituents but you're voting on behalf of Pfizer you should get drug out the street and beaten with a fucking hammer like there has to be like that's fucking treasonous that's that should be criminal yeah and if that's one of the fundamental problems that we have to fix if they're not going to do the right thing because they don't hold the proper amount of personal integrity then they have to do it out of fear of repercussions and there are no repercussions in America you know moving to the UK ain't going to do it yeah well let's get into our first headline man we got a headline number one this is a big talk of the town today this actually just happened right before recording start gates gates are closed gates met gates with draws as attorney general nominee so this this was interest huh I saw this it's weird because he lost his seat now well I think you know he'll he'll get a seat back okay okay he won't you resign from Congress resign completely yeah shit it's weird question me DJ I mean no this should change is so quick too though man I mean because like I saw something that like he was still playing on coming back well maybe I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure I'm right yeah yeah I mean you know but he with Drew is his his nomination that Trump gave him and of course there's like some deep state shit that's going on not sure if you guys saw this but you know there was this internal probe that was going on and somehow to shockingly the document from the federal probe of Matt gates conveniently got leaked to the New York Times after the ethics committee decided to seal it and not release it it got fucking leaked hours and of course New York Times are they're running it guy wrote their article is this guy Michael Schmidt he put this out on the sweetie says now we obtained a document from the federal sex trafficking investigation of gates it shows he made thousands in payments to women who told investigators they had sex with him for money we are publishing a redacted version of the document they wrote the whole article about it you know but but here's the thing and I think we've covered this the other day too there would there's there's no there was no crime the DOJ already said that like yeah there's nothing here to really arrest on right but they're running this wild and I don't know if the reason he's why do you think he stepped down do you think it was just like if you didn't want to stay in the seat or did they have some did they have some they have some dark shit on him I mean who knows right I think it's deeper than that I think what happened was I think Trump and Gates knew that this was going to come out so Trump you know said hey this is who I'm picking makes they they agree that he resigns from Congress it gets them out of the confirmation process now and it basically makes all this shit minimized and go away and I think what's going to happen is he's going to end up being replacing Rubio with with the Santas doing that so I think I think this was a favor by Donald Trump to someone who has supported him relentlessly yeah to get him out of the political fucking whirlwind and get him in a position where I don't think he was ever intended to be the actual turn that's what I fucking love and is what I'm saying you're always seeing things layers I don't I don't think he was because it doesn't make sense if they knew everything because they know right they fucking know so and I guarantee you if Gates is sitting down with Trump Trump is saying hey dude whatever it is just tell me what it is so we can fucking figure it out and then they came up with a plan to get him out and so that he's not having to go through the confirmation process and he'll actually have a career moving forward in another capacity that's what I think I also think that the thing that he did is no different than what any of these other politicians do I don't think it had anything to do with underage women I think he had a that Gates a good looking dude I don't think that I think Matt Gates had a lot of girlfriends and when he got into politics he started paying him to so he could be like hey shut the fuck up yes and that's what I think happened but all these other politicians do the same fucking shit so we'll see but that's that's sort of my feeling I did enjoy that content on the view having to issue an apology oh yeah I mean this was Trump's Trump put this out in the truth he says I greatly appreciate the recent efforts of Matt Gates in seeking approval to be attorney general he was doing very well but at the same time did not want to be a distraction for the administration for which he has much respect Matt has a wonderful future and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do I mean yeah that's a that sounds supportive like yeah this sounds pretty annoying which is that I mean that's that's what I see happening here dude because like you know most people don't have they don't have crisis management skills because they don't have crisisist manage right if you're an entrepreneur you constantly have crisis manage so my mind automatically goes to okay what is a real fucking story here and how are they spinning this out and uh because nothing's ever ever fucking seems never it never never never never no no these guys these guys are buddies Trump's thankful for his support Gates went to bat for Trump when nobody was going to bat for Trump Trump appoints a attorney general knowing that he can't be attorney general knowing that he can't go through the confirmation process Gates resigns Trump already had a second pick to go in and I guarantee you the second pick is going to be way more damaging than what he would have been guys jump on it on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's let's keep this cruise moving I want to say this too like I think it's it's it's it's it's fucked up that all these politicians do the same shit and then when they get to a certain level they all drag out the one guy shit every one of these people the pot column because listen dude all these people cheat all these people fucking pay money to tell their people to not fucking talk about it that is that is what they fucking do bro and if you went to any of those women or any of those men you would find a bunch of shit in their closet just like Christy know him right like everyone has shit and I think it's fucked up that as a society we are at a place where we don't value people based upon the skills for the job we're now judging them on their social character of what I mean bro how many fucked up relationships have you had how much time do we have that's right that's right that's my point though like my point is is that every single human being if you dig far enough you're going to find things that are unpalatable or things that could be twisted into something that is you know not good and the fact is if we want to operate this country we have to get past these sort of issues as being the scandal that disqualifies them from doing the job and we have to get back to can they do the job or can they not do the job but here's the thing dude it's it's only a scandal when it's a conservative remember when Bill Clinton was going through that I don't it doesn't matter what well I think conservative set themselves up for that because they play holier than that right like like dude conservatives I'm an independent dude like and I know everybody thinks I'm some hardcore conservative but the only reason that I'm conservative is because the left has gone so far off the fucking rails that there's nothing to relate to yeah I'm a centrist I'm more libertarian than I am anything else but I sigh with the conservatives but the problem with the conservatives is and they bring this kind of scandal on themselves because they pretend to have no skeletons in their closet yeah just I'll say yeah they don't say I got three chicks right they don't say they don't say hey by the way I've had an interesting social life yeah okay okay I'm a wealthy dude I'm good looking and guess what I've done this and this and this but guess what I can do for you I can make this amazing right and like dude even look at Trump Trump's fucking bro Trump Trump flew his side chick to fucking Aspen while he was there with his wife okay he's done all kinds of fucked up relationships shit oh I was gonna say Trump wasn't Trump doesn't sit there and preach about you know this that I'm morally superior than you and I go to church every Sunday and I've never done anything wrong and shame on you and that's where the conservatives give fuck yeah because they fucking they they put the shame out just like the left does but they do it from a place of moral superiority yes well in a lot of it is just based in religion because they have to appeal to that base yeah but wrote like that's these are these are actions aren't congruent with what they're saying yeah it sets them up for those kind of scandals right like if you fucking heard I don't know fuck all the left are so fucking ugly they probably don't have no crazy yeah I mean like who's okay if you heard Gavin Newsom he's got side dudes okay if you were Gavin Newsom had four fucking other girlfriends and and also two boyfriends there you go no one would care yeah they'd be like oh that makes sense Gavin Newsom's a fucking slime ball but I'm still gonna vote for him because that's what I like yeah you know Nancy Pelosi's husband was fucking male hooker of course in beating him with hammers or whatever that was allegedly allegedly there were hammer was you somehow yeah somewhere in there I'm not sure somebody was getting hammer yeah that's right but dude you know story disappeared to see that's where these conservatives lose the comment like bro I feel like I represent that 80% of common sense people and dude now that we have the conservatives in power I've already started to see them wield that cancel culture moral superiority nonsense against regular people bro I've seen him coming me you know I've say like oh you know fucking you know go to church you never talk about God well that doesn't mean that I don't have my own beliefs and practice my own shit and private motherfucker bro you like I just don't feel the need to preach to you because I don't think I'm better than you but also doesn't mean that you're not a good man of principle either bro you know like I don't go to church no but I will fuck I'm a man of fucking that's what I'm saying but those people will stand on their fucking on they it's actually it's actually everything that Jesus was against yes dude okay it's like standing on this this rock of moral superiority and pointing down at you and when Jesus was walking around with the criminals and with the prostitutes and saying hey there's still a place for you I still love you you I know you're bad I know that you've done wrong but guess what it's okay because you could that's the message of Christianity and dude a lot of these people have lost that they've gotten to this point where they are the judge and they are the person that wields this this shame you know weapon against everybody and now that that now that you know Trump has one we're seeing it start to come out again and it's like bro if you guys would just keep that shit under lock and key and just be a humble person about that area we could really unify the country yeah but what starts to happen is after three or four or eight years of that shit people get tired of the plexulums the pangelome swings the other one that's what I'm saying it's like fuck dude I'm so nothing drives me more nuts and dude my show is a fraction of what your show is but people will still reach out to me and be like you're you're you built a big enough platform you need to speak about this so you need to speak about they go build a fucking platform you know I'm fucking show them I don't need that hard dude than what I want to do bro when people tell me that I automatically intentionally do the opposite yeah I do like and I and you get that it's like dude this look man here's the reality we live in America and in America if you want America to be harmonious and peaceful and free that means you're gonna have to accept that not everybody is exactly like you yeah not everybody is going to behave like you and that doesn't make them a bad person are there things that makes someone a bad person of course or sure all right but just because someone doesn't you know operate the same way that you do doesn't mean that we have to destroy them on the internet or destroy their business or ruin their reputation and that's where we're getting off track with people because dude this country needs to be unified and if we continue to judge each other and we continue to pretend like we have the moral high ground over another human being I mean but bro don't you think most of that was fabricated because most of the yeah but I think people play into it yeah I agree but like most of the conservatives that I know that I surround myself with like bro you can't own a jiu jitsu academy and not welcome diversity yeah like you know what I'm saying no no one cares oh fuck dude a black dude wants to sign up at jiu jitsu man or all that dude's gay that dude's gay like like nobody fucking really cares but they've just strategically pitted everybody against each other and bro I don't care if you want to fucking cut your dick off and put a dress on I you want to come change jitsu with me or you a cool person yeah now I might be like bro like what the fuck are you doing like a little weird because I can't understand why you would want to live in that manner doesn't mean I fucking hate you I think people like us have always been there but the problem is is that we've always been living let live so much that these people have gotten comfortable taking our taking our space yeah right they inch in and inch in and inch in and inch in and we're like hey look I don't care what the fuck you do I really don't because I don't I don't care what you do bro don't fuck with kids but now it's affecting my kids in school correct now you've encroached and now they act like they're the ones being oppressed it's like dude all you had to do was just go live your life and bro no nobody nobody's out here being like oh we fucking hate gay people like I've met some listen real talk but my point in all this is that like bro there's not the hate out there that people think there is and we have to get to a point where all of us we the common sense people who have always been like fuck dude let's let let's let them do what they want you know it's fine as long as that we we just have to adjust our our boundaries a little bit further out okay so they can't get that close again you know what I'm saying like like hey dude now now you're starting to talk about this shit at school we're stopping that right now yeah okay hard and fast too right you can't let it that's a part I don't want you talking to my kids about heterosexual sex or sex I don't do anything I can teach them how to read and write dude and do math but my kids out of public school for that reason yeah my fucking one my my oldest when she was nine she came home one day and it's like dad I haven't decided if I'm gonna be straight or lesbian when I grow up and I was like dude you need to be out back catching frogs like you like to do like what the fuck are you even talking about and a couple more instances like that as I could do her mind is being polluted boom fucking private school you know yeah I love the school my kids are in Utah because it's super conservative literally I we got an email that my nine year old girl got in trouble for kicking a boy while he was on the ground after like taking him down she's been trained in judicious and she was five and they didn't call us in they didn't send her home they just we just got a little we just got a little email that was it see just a mercy maybe the boy deserved it fair enough the boy I'm like baby you shouldn't have kicked him after he was out of the ground right and Roger that yeah all right well guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments let's keep the screws moving ahead on number two this is probably what's on everybody's mind gotta talk about it some weird shit happening I think this is be a great opportunity great a great group of people to talk about this with um we gotta talk about uh Ukraine Russia there's some weird shit happening right now um Ukraine uh so they we all we talked about this the other day on CT I guys Biden approved the the use of long range missiles for Ukraine Ukraine use them immediately after they also use some from the UK as well the storm shadow cruise missiles that you UK gave them they used those as well um and since then Biden has also made another step you shifted some policy changes with Ukraine with them using some anti-person ill minds as well another escalation of of just the use of force you're seeing change in that fog which was interesting you got NATO is preparing to move 800 000 NATO troops after the kremlin made their response to all of these these policy changes um and uh they have moved them into Germany at the time of the show uh and we're closing embassies in Ukraine I mean there's a lot of stuff that's happening okay we close our our embassies over there now we've talked about this peaceful transfer of power that's supposed to be happening it's really not starting to look like that um one of the other issues that came up just a few just yesterday actually um is this uh russia got accused of cutting and sabotaging this like undersea cables that run right but we remember north stream pipeline remember what happened with that and uh who the real agitators that that was um but at the time of recording the important piece of all of this um is because this is something the first time in history that this is actually happened um russia has launched intercontinental ballistic missiles uh in Ukraine towards Ukraine um it's a big massive development well um i mean i don't think president shits his pants is who's making these calls we all have that right now so the powers that are in power right now are not gonna allow the next six weeks to go fucking smoothly and like president puton i mean he has a reputation to uphold inside of russia with his own people and i don't know what the do you guys know what the civilian casualties look like has that has there been reports on that because i heard some of those car to reach the numbers we're able to reach Moscow yeah and it's like dude if you back him into a corner to where now his fucking people are being fucking killed by us munitions what does that really leave him an option to do right and it's uh it's it's it's fucking preposterous because puton has already said hey i think trump is a man of honor and i think that him and i can negotiate and i look forward to negotiating like he's already put that out you can't fucking wait six weeks to see where this plays out and the answers know they can't wait six weeks because they don't want this to get wiped away they want to escalate it while they still can and bro like what percentage of american people want the russia ukraine war to be escalated right now the answers probably fucking zero but here again we let these motherfuckers use our money and our capabilities to perpetuate a war that none of us fucking want it's treasonous and people should be drunk out in the street and fucking strung up for it when i think this goes back to what you were saying earlier is that you know he hasn't taken seat as the president yet and i think there's stuff going on behind the scenes that they're gonna do everything in their power to try to fuck that up you know thousand percent yeah i mean dude this is uh this is wild we're going to get you a pundit real quick um because there's actually some video evidence and it wasn't just like one now uh let's be very very clear these are i cb a missiles okay these are very long-range uh and apparently the ones that russia used um they're actually have some new uh defense mechanisms so they can't even be tracked it's hypersonic by by nay yeah right there ten times the speed of sound right and you can't even fucking track them yeah um and now to you though yeah we do have a few now they did russia did remove the nuclear warhead aspect of it but still loaded up with a shit ton of fucking munition in it um this is a video clip that's a show force it's a show of four it's a warning it's a fucking warning i'm gonna get you you don't even know it's coming we can we can touch you and we can get you you want to know what else is in range inside of ukraine of those missiles is us bio labs so it's like that was the whole thing dude yeah that was one of them going hold on people don't realize that people have not they still don't understand why the war even happened it happened because NATO and the united states were backing up their troops on the russian border and there's three reasons why this happened one they were backing up their troops on their border what would we do if china was putting all their troops on the other side of mexico's border 100 percent okay secondly there's a genocide that's been happening from the eastern region of ukraine where Nazis are actually killing russian people who are russian that happen to live in ukraine and want to be russian they want to be part of russia okay so bladder impute said that's stopping we're not doing that and the third thing is these biolabs that are all throughout ukraine ukraine is the biggest money laundering crime laden geographical location for international government crime okay that country is basically a shell for the united states and these other NATO countries to do all of their crazy shit and not really get fucked with okay so that's what we're dealing with it's not like uh what they make it sound like we're you know putin is just some crazy psychopath who wants to invade ukraine and kill all no if he wanted to do that they'd all be dead right now okay ukraine is nothing compared to russia's military if if putin wanted to destroy ukraine it would already be gone it would be gone okay so we have to understand that you know when when they show a speech of Vladimir Putin on tv and they don't let us hear the sound that should be a red flag does yeah okay uh there's there's a number of world leaders out there that they do not allow it past and uh past and present who they do not allow us to find the sound of what they're actually saying why is that why do they not want us hearing what those people have to say well we all know why we know why because it would make sense to us and we would realize holy shit we're being lied to these people aren't the fucking warmongering crazy motherfuckers you know who the warmongering crazy motherfuckers are Obama that's us that's the people the the quote unquote elite country that's why like the the deep state was so fucking mad at Tucker Carlson for talking to putin and if you sat down and listen to that whole interview and it's entirety it's like oh Putin's brain does work pretty fucking well and the things that he says makes perfect sense and you remember he goes man I tried to join NATO I asked Bill Clinton let's let's be allies and Bill Clinton shook my hand and said I like that plan let's do that 48 hours later he got a phone call that said I was actually told that's not going to be possible and I remember because Tucker Carlson said well why did he say that that's not possible he goes those that's for Bill Clinton to tell you those are his words I don't speak for other men and it's like oh he has honor too yeah in the midst of all of this yeah you know well I think Putin's a badass right and I think to your point man it's just like you know I think he also understands too that there are there's still like we talk about there's a separation between the people and the governments you know I'm saying I think Putin understands that probably better than any other world leader because I mean even just the shit that we've done in this proxy war I think is far past the point warranting some type of repercussions for us as a country right but he's he showed heavy mercy and and and patience on that because he understands the separation between a government yes and the people of that government yeah right like like he understands that even in Ukraine there are good Ukrainians there that don't deserve to just fucking die which is like really any war I think he knows exactly what's been going on here I think he understands that we had a fucking coup yeah in 2020 and had their had their agenda been adopted more successfully there's no way Trump would have won this election no okay they wouldn't have allowed him to but it didn't go the way they wanted it to and I think that Putin is very intelligent and I think he totally understands what you're saying he says the America people do not support the American government and I do not have the right to go kill innocent people who actually would be on my side yeah yeah if they knew the truth and I think he knows that we the people don't support what's going on here and I agree he's showing tremendous restraint tremendous restraint man I mean even with this message message right now with all these missiles brother it wasn't just one he fired a good time I like here's a clip not shivering did you got to see it there's no audio for those listening on audio platforms but come check it out on YouTube let's let's watch this clip man holy shit are those hitting are those landing those are landing and they're four four every piece so like that's a group of four group of four fast holy shit that's fucking why you don't have time to think about no I mean I've seen rockets hit targets and land and nothing like that that just came like the sky lit up and it was over yeah it looks yeah I mean well that's actually kind of reassuring yeah there's not gonna be a time to panic no you're fucking done I was saying earlier if you hear the rocket you're good yeah well me do look even look at the sky afterwards bro like I mean it it bro that looks like some alien shit bro that looks like some what's that independence day yeah well I mean and you go to see an end they're saying that it was just some experimental medium range ballistic missiles and they never saw anything like that before yeah they only they only have a handful of these is what they're saying you know but but even with that man it's still just weird shit you got Kamala Harris she's going to Hawaii for fucking Christmas apparently Joe Biden just turned 82 everybody's disappearing and even our FBI director homeland security secretary they're nowhere to be found right now they're skipping fucking these mandatory briefings and we're on the brink of what were three man what else we got on this guys well fuck dude who's to say that these motherfuckers wouldn't set off their bomb here and blame it on Russia right 100 percent again going back I mean I'm gonna say nothing they can and I've been saying enough for two years I said well here's what's gonna happen if they don't get first of all I told you they were gonna start this fucking war I told you for the last two and a half years do you have receipts fuck yeah I got them all right in fact you plug them in here we don't plenty of people in the right places to know to keep track of what the fuck's going on over there I don't I'm not saying that this is gonna be a World War three situation it could be but it very well could be very well could be especially if we fucking take the same thing especially if the media decides that they don't want to be held accountable for what the fuck they just did which is the biggest crimes of humanity that have ever been perpetrated on the fucking human race I am 100 percent confident of that I'm not wrong about that the the fucking the overall death data reported by insurance companies in 2021 is 40 percent higher than fucking what it's ever been the fucking amount of cancer that's being found inside the military right now is literally let's see so 135 it's it's four times higher than normal in the last year over the years past okay this shit that is happening is not conspiracy theory it's a fucking crime it's a crime for a lot of reasons there was a lot of things they wanted to check there okay money fucking all kinds of other things okay but like dude they don't want to be held accountable so start start a fucking huge war dude start a huge fucking war where millions of people fucking died then they'll never be held accountable for what they did we if I received bro it would be if we put them in there it would be a fucking hour saying that same thing they could very easily put the world in a position of total chaos between now and January all they would have to do is flip the fucking power grid off set off a fucking bomb turn the power grid back on be like Russia hit us with the missile and they killed Trump yeah or around around attack Trump and they killed they blew up everybody more logo right that's what the fuck these people I believe are willing to do because they are guilty of crimes against humanity they are guilty of treason and if you're guilty of crimes against humanity and you're guilty of treason what are you gonna not be willing to do to protect yourself yeah you'll do nothing that's what I'm saying and so like bro we have to be smart here and the Trump team has to be really smart like they're all over the place and they're fucking here and they're actually stressing me out bro they're all a UFC they're all a fucking UFC you got fucking Trump the fake the whole fucking cabinet Elon everybody's sitting at you fucking stay in hiding bro I saw that and I was like texted my buddies on the secret service I'm like hey dude is that normal they're like oh yeah we got airspace and this and that I don't have shit dude that's what I'm saying like to smoke and mirrors that motherfucker none of those people should be together they shouldn't be flying on the same plane together they shouldn't be in the same geographical location and here they're going to UFC yeah like dude I saw that and I was like what are you guys doing yeah that's funny I thought the exact same thing first thing I thought yeah I mean I thought even the plane thing that's I mean bro you don't even fly I don't fly on the same plane as my business partners uh uh we don't fly on the same fucking points yeah I mean that's that's that's standard operating we're and we're fucking we own a goddamn vitamin company I don't know say it like just a small vitamin shot yeah that's right we just own a little vitamin shot but the point is is like we're taking those precautions you know what yeah dude what I what I tell you I am worried about happening and and this is some information that I've gotten from friends of mine that are still working in in a um clandestine capacity with the intel communities is that they are tracking um massive massive amounts of sleeper cells here in the US for small arms attacks yeah and they're just seven ten seven style uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and they're the same thing for literally and it's gonna be it won't be a door of a cause a massive bomb blowing up Washington DC but it's still the same I'm not fear yeah imagine imagine the imagine gang of these these uh these migrants coming to your neighborhood and going door to door and slaughtering your fucking families that's it that's that's what they did in Israel and like that's the that is it's funny you say that's that's that's what I heard to happen I've heard it to matter of time I was told by somebody I was told by somebody who would absolutely know that his exact quote to me was prepare for demoralization yes that was exact quote bro like you know people always say you know like oh the the the the Civil War blah blah blah bullshit you know why I keep stacks of fucking magazines loaded in satral bags and my kit and my body armor and my fucking night vision my rifle's ready to go it's for that shit yeah because with I hear that I'm fucking racing down to town on my kids school I'm securing my family and I'm going to work I'm killing motherfuckers but here's the truth about that is if something like that occurs it's not the terrorists doing terror shit that we should be mad at no it's our work we need to go string up all the people that intentionally let those people in 100% that the border open that's how we take fucking action against the people that are intentionally destroying America they're going to continue to intentionally destroy America oh they're not going away and I that's what I'm saying I know we're all hopeful because it feels like there's an energetic shift for those of you that geek out on astrology we're moving into like the age of Aquarius like we fucking I am broke yeah I'm I'm all about all that fucking weird shit I got fucking be like and stuff always makes fun of me for wearing crystals bro what the fuck is that but the truth is I do feel like there's an energetic shift I am I'm hopeful that we can fucking change the trajectory of this country but at the end of the day there are evil players out there that want to fucking any and all cost continue to fucking tank our country in the the current trajectory that it's been on and until we fucking do something to those people they're going to continue to do what they do you know I mean guys jump in on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get to our third we got comments no comments today no we do longer shows we just give them you don't have any no that sucks I mean I was going to yell at some people but it's okay we have a free dandy a fucked up comment did come I mean we can do that fuck you Andy fuck you too he's got a small dick yeah yeah wait what all right let's just keep going I mean I don't have to go too far to find hate comments do the best the best comment I read to him the other day so Mike and I are doing this weekly show called the team room yeah and we just did one on that Oklahoma City cop that slam that fucking 70 or 74 year old Japanese dude I can put him in the hospital like the guy might die totally unnecessary too so we did it episode on that and the best comment in there was my ex-wife's getting slammed by a cop right now it's fucking horrible oh man that sucks he needs a hug yeah well guys let's get to our third and final headline we got headline number three this was interesting first trans congress member is banned from using women's bathrooms after major retailer green declared war you got seen this I did see that did she declare war did she just ask dudes with dicks to not to use a bathroom it seems pretty fucking reasonable it and bro that's the thing that dude think about we're at a situation now we're saying do not go in the women's bathroom if you have a dick yeah it's like controversial right dude right that's insane this can pro that is our fucking fault 100% it's our fault because not enough I listen the first time I heard that they're gonna put fuck dudes could go in a woman's back I threw a fucking fit but everybody else seemed to like thing you're intolerant Andy yeah I'm an extremist I'm an extremist because I remember the rule I was taught when I was fucking three you know I'm saying like fuck dude when I tried to do it last time y'all everybody had a problem with it yeah what's the percentage of men that think they're women like a 100th of 1% it's almost fucking like non-existent but we still put this front and center and allow these people to fucking change policy and dictate the actions of normal people for a fucking end of a percentage tail wagging the dog yeah dude it's fucking ridiculous this is wow no it's because we as men didn't just look at those people and say hey guess what yeah shut the fuck up yeah and bro it goes back to what we were just saying like you you want to be a dude and you want to fucking put a dress on and a wig and pretend you're a woman okay I feel like there's something off in you but I also don't fucking care I've had it but you when you want to follow my fucking nine-year-old daughter in the bathroom I'll slit your fucking throat I don't like that you want to go to my fucking kids school and read them books and do a stripper dance yeah like you're dead yeah I wish to be dragging these dudes out you never see you never see trans women you never see women who are wanting to be men who are pretending to be men doing that shit no you do not ever see it you do not fucking see it but they can you it's a pedophile problem it's a pedophile infiltration of the trans community with trans women yes okay and that's what the fuck it is you have grown who sit at home and look at porn and have fucking little kitty porn and their dirty as nasty as that's why they all look the same so like any of these do it's not like you go to Thailand you see these fucking like you're confused right you're like fuck is that a lady what is that yeah right like you know see that shit here you see these fat disgusting fucking gross men who you wouldn't they you wouldn't even let your kid around them as a man that's right dressing up as women and then pretending they have rights over our fucking kids and then people support them no they don't people don't support them it's a fucking lie nobody supports that shit gay people don't support that shit that's true dude they don't it's all a lie to to further a what is a communist agenda of demoralization and the removal of truth okay if I can get you and I can get you to admit that a man could be a woman and a woman could be a man what can I not get you to admit just feeding well no but I'm just saying that's a fundamental truth that all little children know okay just like that movie kindergarten movie kindergarten party's in the penis and girls have a vagina yeah no shit okay fucking know that right everybody fucking knows that so that's the fundamental truth of fucking humanity right men and women if you can get someone and people don't understand what this is about that is all this is about all this is about is about the manipulation of truth so that people cannot have a national identity or a personal identity okay they want people to be part of a communist infrastructure to be part of a communist infrastructure you have to have no personal identity you have to have no patriotism you have to have no loyalty to any cause or any person or any truth you are just a robot and this has worked over and over and over again but it's only worked when the internet didn't exist yep and so now we have this massive free flow back and forth of information which they used to try and manipulate us but it also was their own undoing so when we think about what the trans movement is really about it is not about acceptance it is not about unity it is not about you know people having equal rights that's not what it's about it's about convincing regular people that the most fundamental reality that they understand is up for debate yeah and if that's up for debate what is it up for debate you know what I'm saying yeah yeah in every level of government though is gonna support this because like let's say let's say we think this is over dude I think the cultural switch I think the call me yeah I think culture is like during the height of this when fucking they were going into the libraries if you fucking call me up and said hey there's this big fat fucking transgender dude waving his fucking dick around at jama's library let's go out there and fucking drag his ass out into the street what's gonna happen police are gonna come for us to yes they're gonna come for us yeah but I think that's over dude I think the social I think we're gonna get back to I think pedophiles you should be afraid right now well that's the other thing I was going you know same thing it's a agenda when they're what do they call underage attracted yeah the fuck out of here that's right bro I mean you know the deal yeah you we've all got kids like you fucking come out my little girl or my son I'm gonna beat you to throw I don't have kids but if they come for your son I'll be the first one to do it because then you won't get in trouble I'm playing bro I'm putting some of these motherfuckers in woodshipper eventually yeah like this pedophile shit well get with me because I know how to get away with it so look dude all the woodshipper is destiny that's what I'm saying Trump's Trump is nominating all these chiefs of things I would like the chief of woodshipper operation yeah you know treasonous criminals pedophiles feet first I will handle them like we've talked about many times we will make a pay-per-view show 100% dude we will charge you think Netflix just got the biggest audience ever with Jake Paul let me fucking put the show 100% okay we'll make a show and we'll call it the big show all right and the big show comes on once a week all right every Friday Saturday night comes on you guys pick I don't give a fuck and when the show starts here's Steve otherwise known as Savannah here's what here's what Savannah did this dude has 4,000 pictures of naked children on his computer and so then he decided that he was a woman and then he did this and then he did that and then he did this and now he's in the woodshipper huh and then and then whatever the pay-per-view is we take the money and we give to the fucking victim that's right dude okay so like bro it can become the biggest entertainment ever and also generally most good massive amounts of correct we can use an electric woodshipper and it would only take one season of the show good for it to never happen again you know what else like I've said this for years on my show like that fucking that pedophile that did old can Velascus's boy yeah like pay-per-view event him versus can to the death yeah is he still in jail for that no he's out on bail right now but like dude you want to talk about generating money like came Velascus is always exciting to fight to watch fight when he was fucking in his prime yeah but to watch him beat that dude to death I'll pay I pay $500 pay-per-view fee for that that's what I'm saying dude I'm just saying like there needs to be public fear of accountability for that class of people 100 percent you do not fuck with kids you do not fuck with anybody's kids you don't even come with them 500 yards of anybody's kids you don't say fucked up shit you don't give them a sucker you don't fucking look at him weird you don't go in the bathroom you don't read him a book and if you do you're going in the fucking shipper that's that's what a fuck yeah listen bro that has to happen this is pedophilia has existed for thousands of years and the only way that culture has ever been able to remove it is through harsh accountability yeah fucking removing them from side correct like dude it's it is what it is man it's not okay and I think culture is shifting I think we're going to get back to a situation where there's going to be accountability had one way or the other for these people well it starts with common sense and I think that's what the story is about um it started with house speaker Mike Johnson has ruled that the first transgender member of congress cannot use the women's restrooms in a decision that will shake the United States capital uh so why would that fucking shake the US capital like that's pretty fucking clear yeah I mean it makes sense to me man um Sarah McBride okay who will become the first openly transgender lawmaker uh when sworn into office in January we'll have to use the men's facilities and brother I mean this says more about our country than these this one fucking dude that wants to piss in a women's bathroom like you are electing a mentally ill person as a lawmaker right and part of me is like fuck man when like when the country looked like it was fucking circling the drain there's a part of it's like you know what we get what the fuck we get let me do it I agree let it go yeah 100% uh this is so this is uh ceramic bright um the name it's uh it's uh it's cool it's cool I know we are too you have some beautiful stay at helping us out yeah full-time pair of tips I am very mindful that my responsibility is not to any other community that I'm a part of other than the community that is the state of Delaware my job is to be the best member of congress that I can be for Delawareans working on all of the issues that matter and that will be the only way that I can guarantee that while I may be a first I'm not the last so I'm not doing this to to make history I'm not doing this to be a trail blazer I'm doing this to give back I'm doing this to serve I'm doing this to make a difference do you remember when we were kids they were called cross-stressers and they were considered fucking like that was considered like a mental yeah they're mentally oh I mean that is but we're born a male or a born a female for sure and if you want if if I have difference in opinion of like if you're homosexual okay you're born that way like especially dudes dudes I don't decide at fucking 46 years old hey DJ you're actually kind of hot bro that beard that's double dude you can try the straightest man guy you know like you don't fucking decide that on the way I'm like it's some chick piss you off like yeah bro hey just so you know I'm a gizzy blackbuck you know if anyone's given I'm gonna be the one give I'm gonna take your back show you my third hook but you know like I think that's that's that's that is a hormonal chromosomal thing that you're born with I've got family members that that are gay and you knew when they're like eight nine years old like oh you know he's gay okay cool whatever but then when you decide like I don't even want to be a man anymore I want to be a female or I don't want to be a female that is a fucking mental illness I'm sorry you know you fucking hate hate on me on the internet but that's mental illness yeah simple well Nancy may say something to say on this too let's check what she had to say everyone I seem to blow up the radical left last night I filed a resolution that would ban biological men from women's private spaces on the hill I'm just getting started and I've already know where near stopping and the death threats that I'm receiving now aren't gonna stop me either so I've said it before and I'll say it again come at me bro or broves in this case I'm not gonna take your threats for an answer I'm gonna file a call for women and girls to keep men out of women's private spaces to include bathrooms restrooms locker rooms changing rooms you name it you are not welcome fuck yeah but bro think about like it shouldn't be a controversy of state that's just like she's even having said she's getting death threats bro it's embarrassing that that's what the US government is fucking dealing with right now yeah like we don't have no there was a fucking I was just checking my phone there's a fucking headline on my phone right here so we're here talking about this and here's this just came out quote from Putin that's I'm saying if a single Western weapon is used against us then nuclear retaliation will be next you just said that and this is the fucker shit that our fucking government yeah it's fixating and you don't I guarantee you I guarantee you before the end of this week they will shoot more Western weapons that oh guaranteed 100% if not today guaranteed man well that wrapping up on this the good news is it appears that mr. McBride what's his name yes McBride Steve he decided to be the bigger man and he is going to use the men's restrooms he put this statement out saying quote I'm not here to fight about bathrooms I'm here to fight for deloarians and to bring down costs facing families like all members I will follow the rules is outlined by speaker Johnson even if I disagree with them so that's respect that is respectful yeah yeah that is respectable like that's the response that I would expect that is a common sense response to everybody would be okay with yes I do not care that you would like to be a woman I do not care do I think it's kind of fucked up yeah but dude I'm not you okay you're not me you don't like to lift weights and fucking do the shit I do I can respect that if they had that attitude yeah I was like okay look I know this is a little bit different this isn't shouldn't be to focus like I'll be real after reading that I like that's a good person cool I'm down with it yeah but see and that's the point we it's not hate against transgender people it's the forcing of what you want against the boundaries of natural order yes okay and I'm sorry dude ceramic bride might be a wonderful person she might be or here whatever might be top to bottom one of the kindest smartest best people in the world but when you start to encroach on people's normality and their common sense and you force it on them and say dude if you don't if you don't allow me in the bathroom you're a fucking big it that's where the problem starts and that's what these people for for for the most part are refusing to understand that is the first time I've ever fucking hurt someone like that I like that I do too but see like look at this DJ get ceramic bride on the show yeah but see dude here's the thing I would have run yeah fuck I know you would but dude here's the thing I fucking invite a no see to come on she won't come on yes she won't but she left me on red actually yeah well dude the thing is I bet she did she did yeah so but the point is is like bro if all of these people have that attitude we would have less problems we wouldn't have problems so we can focus on fucking you train like bro you're not you don't belong in swimming pool fucking Riley Barker you know what I'm saying you don't you don't belong in a boxing ring you don't belong running track you don't belong stay the fuck out of women's shit okay and you can live with like a woman all you want and you know for a lot of them people won't even know yeah to be completely honest I wouldn't even know that was a transgender I wouldn't know that was a man or listen one told me yeah no she had pretty good job yeah I mean that's the best job you were all referring to her as she knows I just because she seemed pleasant it's funny whenever it's funny for one it's funny how you behave when you treat people respect yeah that's right if you if you if you come in and you say you better use my pronouns this I'll put them in my bio I'll put them in my email fuck you yeah like I'm not doing it bro you're trying to force me you don't need to make demands of me correct yeah like when you treat people at respect I would I would call that person a her yeah for 100% so like bro maybe there's maybe we can get to a place where there's lessons to be learned for both sides I agree yeah I agree yeah guys jumping on this combo that is that is highly abnormal from what I've experienced dealing with the transgender well because it's usually all the last four years all I've gotten is fucking massive amounts of hate from transgender people now one time not one time did I get a fucking common sense argument that person is a responsible steward of transgender community yeah I respect it well here's the first thing he's she's probably getting a bunch of fucking bullshit from the trans community yeah I guarantee you bro that's the hill you need to die on yeah but she's doing what she's supposed to do she's saying hey I'm here to serve and make good decisions and lower the cost of Delaware families not about bathroom okay you know after she said that dude probably have to people I don't give a fuck a bathroom you put the fucking dress on tonight yeah yeah yeah man it's a well that's a metaphorical dick-bash you know I'm saying like like you're not gonna force people into it but maybe if you were polite about it and you respected the boundaries of what people are comfortable with everybody would get along I think it would be a good thing for the country yeah for sure well uh sir if this gets out to you hop on in yeah yeah you got my respect it yeah I do now I was gonna say we got back them rules here too though you know okay real talk she's okay with that that doesn't seem to be real talk if you walked in the bathroom the men's bathroom and she was standing at the journal it's fucking weird yeah I was in the locker room today in my underwear and a chick walked in there or whatever I was in there too the guys came back in right after that they're like oh my god I'm so sorry I didn't think I'm like it's a locker room but people go walk around fucking their dicks out yeah it was just a little cold right it's always a little cold bro don't judge me bro guys jump it it's always cold for DJ too I listen I got home your stasis oh yeah maintain that you said you were a fucking grower not a shower I am a grower okay you're the wrong ethnicity to be a grower no I know I mean listen not all of us are you know colors like my still grows but like it ain't like it's a fucking like it's fucked up it's how black dudes fucking try to play that shit this is no I didn't this is a true fucking dicks go like this they go like that right and then the white dicks go like this yeah yeah they're red but but like bro it's all it is is a difference of this or this right it's like a fucking lever or a telescope I saw a comedian and I got to be real bro I kind of like the telescope part because I'm like because I look down on my holy shit dude how does that work how does it do that I can't fucking wait for your presidential campaigns all of these clips and be like look at this bro the fun is gonna be a telescope right look fuck it with me the funniest the fuck races but black dicks and white dicks bro different that's right they do they do but black guys run around and be like my fucking dick so it's like bro your shit goes like this if you were some I dick hard you'd be impressed you know like we I can hate yeah bro you might think I got a fucking shrimp if you saw fucking normal but like bro that's for protection man I'm ready for combat yeah for a grower for jiu jitsu yeah real real fucking thing like before jiu jitsu tournaments before MMA fights matches and stuff your body gets ready for battle your body doesn't understand it's just it's kind of like the Spartans right yeah yeah yeah and get a boner your fucking balls like shrink up in your your scrotum gets real tight your ball shrink right your dick starts like getting real tight in it's ready because it doesn't want to get shot off ready for fucking battle protection and then you go fight your match you go out and then it's hanging there again you're just all you're always in a battle mindset you see me in the locker late early and then jiu jitsu you can't work up because it can be used as a folkroom to snap arms yeah so it's kind of fucked up I got I got need in the taint so hard one that piss blood for three days that's so yeah that sounds like yeah it's bad yeah yeah anyway well enough about dicks I just yeah I just you know yep tell us go tell us go guys jumping on this combo uh down to the comments let us know what you guys think bro it's like dropping one of them little you ever have those like little sponge pills yeah I'm in the monster yeah you're dropping in the water and you come back in five minutes and it's fucking like five times a side yeah how to do that I would no no yeah magic magic magic all right magical dicks well guys let's get to our final segment of the show as always got thumbs up or dumb as fuck and you you know me Andy I couldn't let this show go without just a little bit of it racism gotta have it gotta have it you guys ready for this let's go for the biggest white supremacist in the world right there all right here we go look I worked as a new Orleans cop I was like one of the only white cops in the district that I worked in my entire team was all black man you want to talk about some racist motherfucker's dude bro some of the black cops that word with the hate of the black dudes we are arrested yeah bro fucking bad man yeah so I mean you know here we go we got Christmas right around the corner everybody's excited about Christmas yeah our thumbs to thumbs up or dumb as fuck hell I reads KFC launches Christmas wrapping paper that tastes like chicken there's a catch what's the catch let's find out it's finger looking good KFC is hoping its new holiday product will be on everyone's lips literally the fast food chain has launched lickable wrapping paper for the gifting season the limited edition paper purportedly tastes like KFC's original recipe chicken with quote a refreshing hit of cranberry sauce and an aromatic pinch of sage from the sage and onion stuffing patty Jesus dude according to a product description quote despite the festive battle of the birds at KFC we believe in chicken Phoebe Sims brand manager at KFC UK and Ireland said in a statement per the Daily Mail quote introducing our first ever lickable wrapping paper inspired by our epic limited edition stuffing stacker burger so here is I'm getting fatter just hearing you read about it yeah who the fuck eats all this shit I want to the fuck I mean fuck dude it just makes me lose hope for humanity let's let's start licking paper like I'm sure there's no micro plastics in there or fucking red dye number 40 smaller dick there you go see back to the fuck dude is the PFAS that's why they're trying to give to the black guy so that's the catch why do they have a Mexican guy licking it then because it's not available in the US that's the catch there's no black people outside of the US well that's I mean that I'm I'm a little off in it because I was in KFC like super popular over in Europe compared to here yeah I think so so but didn't you tell me that KFC was white people chicken it is white people chicken yeah I would like to know if that's actually true I'm curious what makes it black pop eyes black people chicken okay all right pop eyes in your what about churches chicken churches is black to yeah for sure in the hierarchy of chicken what is the widest chicken versus the blackest chicken uh so raising canes is the widest that's the widest you could probably agree with that I never heard of that raising canes developed at ls u in Louisiana I don't think we have that shit on the west coast yeah that's like the widest mayonnaise I'll agree with you yeah yep white bread yep so yeah okay so there's a there's like a higher archie like you could go down the list for sure these about you okay if you want really black chicken like if they're not if if the employees are not fighting each other in the fucking it ain't black chicken uh raising canes uh I would go raising canes KFC uh zaxb's pop eyes churches okay all right churches being the most black yeah you know it's funny dude they're fighting in there lisa is probably in there too lisa is fucking good yeah lisa is down there too they'll be fighting lisa's black chicken yeah yeah I agree with you and I don't even know what makes the difference between white people chicken and black people chicken but I agree with you that makes super sense yeah I mean if you don't feel if you don't if there is not a feeling in the atmosphere that you might get shot while eating your food and it's probably you're probably safe it's probably KFC hmm so I ate it's I ate some chicken and turkey necks and pigs feet okay that's some place where I'm like boys I don't I don't fucking belong to a little sense of danger they're like no you're good you with us dog Mike bro I don't want to do look at this fucking guy licking his fucking yeah chicken paper yeah now you can't eat this girl just lick the paper yeah so you just lick it you don't eat it how big of a fat fuck are you this is the dumbest it's done I ever see fucking lick paper chicken paper and fucking actually do it I want I want some so what is the paper for they want you to buy that for like you actually and then you lick it looks like these it looks like these three people are about to take a fucking load that's just some AI shit is it now look like that yeah it does it does look at hey I

like a small group of elite human beings have been making groups of men kill each other for it's the beginning of time correct I was this king versus that king but that's what I mean however you want to describe him but whoever's at the top of the food chain you know and like well what do we all do and I was as guilty of it of it as anyone we go and we kill those people are youngest and strongest people are easily manipulated because they lack perspective and experience you're you're when you're at the peak of your physical performance between you know 18 and 30 you know you're also at the lowest part of your intelligence you know say it so it's easy to physical bodies and adult but you're playing as far from it you don't have the perspective how many dudes do you meet that are in their
