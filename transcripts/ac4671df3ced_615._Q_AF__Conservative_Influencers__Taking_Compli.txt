Yeah, it's funny But it's like part of me also feels like I'm just like Torture and a child, you know why? Because like you're fucking with their like their mental you know, I'm saying like yeah, I tried to like tap in like you know Welcome to the show. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, it's like it's like shit man everybody fuck with us look at the shit They put on TV. Yeah, but then I think but that's the other thing like I think too like man Like how easy it is to convince kids have literally fucking anything really like how impressionable they are, man Yeah, most kids never grow up and they become adults. They're easy to convince of anything. Yeah, that's from real shit, man Yeah, so we're you know, so I'm gonna try to keep it cool, but Anyway, yeah, we got some good ones though, man. Yeah, guys got some really good ones guys Andy question number one Hey Andy a friend of mine recently invited me to a TPU essay event But I have honestly lost a lot of faith in the quote-on-quote conservative influencers because most of them are just bandwagoners if I'm being honest I feel like they had a purpose for a short period of time, but I feel like that ship is sailed What are your thoughts on conservative influencers at the moment? I think identifying With an ideology as an identity for anyone at this point in time is just playing into the strategy that the people who are doing the damage to society wants to play into I think that people who strictly identify themselves as a Democrat or Republican or conservative or a liberal or right wing or left wing I think people I did making making their identity These categories that we are offered are the real cause of The destruction that's happening in society because when we identify with these in this whether it be conservative or liberal or whatever Side you identify with and we make that our identity and Makes it almost impossible to unify And unity is the only thing that's going to save this country whether you like it or not people say I'm not unifying with that Well, look I agree we shouldn't be unifying with the pedophiles, right? There's yes, like there should be a line in the sand drawn around common sense individuals and Those common sense individuals should all realize okay, we may have some differences We may have some disagreements. We may have some fundamental things that we don't see eye to eye on but we need to work together because If we don't work together the people on the other team are going to get their way and that's going to mean bad things for us And when we say the other team we have to realize they have propagated and intentionally made it seem like you know The other team is other citizens the other team is not citizens in the country It's not your neighbor who has a Joe Biden sticker on his fucking car. I mean he might be an idiot But he's not the enemy okay, there's a difference and we could say that about the guys on the right too No, all right for us to heal as a nation for us to have a a true America again The people the citizens us are going to have to quit identifying so hard with Identities that they give us and start identifying with being an actual citizen a human and Someone who represents the free people of the United States of America and that's my opinion on it And a lot of people say well, that's a libertarian. No, that's not that's just another label. I'm a free human Who wants to Build a country that is in the interest of other free humans that benefits the citizens of this country Whether they have the beliefs of this or that or the otherwise and there are lines in the sand where certain beliefs are not tolerated like dudes dressing up as women and shaking their dicks in front of little kids That's where the line is for almost everybody in my opinion and These were it needs to be yeah, and we need to have and an understanding of what this government should look like What we should actually be treated like and the reality is is we don't need this massive Ridiculous government the the government that exists in the United States of America is the largest organization ever assembled in the history of humankind All right, our government should have police. They should have military It should provide very basic essentials for society and the rest of the shit should be free market All right, that's what our country supposed to be and it's not and actually it's really far from that and the idea of saying Oh, well, America is a free country is not actually true anymore We talk about this every day when the citizens of this country when a citizen and and by the way, it's most citizens But when any citizen pays more money to the government than they get to take home for the work that they do That makes them a slave of that government and we have lots and lots and lots of people in fact the majority of taxpayers Fall into that category when you add all the taxes up so We've got to be real about the situation that we have and it's not right or left. It's not liberal or conservative. It's Elite tyrants versus the citizenship of this country and that's what we're dealing with So when you ask me what do I think of the conservatives? I don't see the conservative influencers any different than the liberal influencers or the left influencers I see a lot of people who do not have an identity or anything going on outside of their identity as a conservative influencer who are working to sell t-shirts or get traffic to their page or trying to You know be relevant and that's their relevancy and that's not in our best interest as as citizens either So you know, this is why I don't go speak at these events. This is why I don't go to quote unquote. I'm a pro freedom human American citizen. I am pro freedom. I'm not right. I'm not left. I'm not Republican. I'm not Democrat I'm not libertarian. I'm a human fucking being that wants the best for the rest of the human beings And I want some common fucking sense in the country and I want to be left alone I want to pay low taxes I want to be able to go build things and prosper and get all the things that have been promised to me in the constitution of this country Which we do not have That's what I want and until people wake to fuck up and stop identifying with left to right Republican Democrat and black white gay straight all the shit That is that is put down on us for the intention of preventing unity Until we figure that out and stop doing that we will continue to be abused by these people who hold the power That's reality So that's what I think of them. I don't I think a lot of these guys are just they make things worse I think they sensationalize things that that should be discussed. I think that You know when we look at a couple different scenarios in the country right now and we look at let's say how big the censorship is You know you have to look at what they try to contain To understand what they're afraid of right? What are they try to contain? What do they try to do? What are they trying to do? Well, they're trying to get us censored on the internet. So what does that tell you? They're afraid of our speech. They're afraid of our voices And that goes for all of our voices. That's not just people who have a big platform This is every single individual if they weren't afraid of your voice Why would they come up with an operation like political correctness which is the abandonment of fact To not offend people with the truth. Why would that become a thing? Why would there be a social movement like cancel culture? Where if you don't step in line with the beliefs. We're gonna take your business. We're gonna get you fired We're gonna ruin your name. We're gonna embarrass you publicly. We're gonna we're gonna we're gonna hurt you Why would they have this culture movement of uh, you know silent majority? Why would they create nobility around silence? Why would they do these things? It should be obvious to anybody with a critical thinking mind that they are afraid of the voice of the individual And you guys have been conditioned to believe that your voice doesn't matter You believe that you have to be someone with a big platform. I have to have someone that as millions of followers or millions of dollars Or somebody relevant or famous that the that thought process That's these people with massive followings are gonna get it done is what's preventing it from getting it done Okay, so there's that right? So what are they trying to contain? They're trying to get you to silence They're trying to keep you shamed. They're trying to get you to believe like you're alone So what does that tell you they're afraid of they're afraid of your voice your voices the most powerful thing that you could have Okay, and then let's look at the second thing that they're afraid of okay Let's look at all the intentional division that they that they promote around race Okay, like let's let's just break this to fuck down all right We're talking about the pigment the level of fucking melanin and someone's skin tone Like that's the level of fucking ridiculousness that we have been reduced to They have they in their mind they have gotten the peasant class to argue over something that is legitimately irrelevant It's irrelevant, okay, it doesn't matter how much fucking pigment you have in your skin It doesn't matter where the fuck you come from It doesn't matter if you're black white gay straight. It doesn't matter bro. We're all human beings and they propagate all these Identities left right black white gay straight blah blah blah all these identity Palotic issues because they understand that when people pick opposing sides there's no discussion When there's no discussion there can be no unity and when there's no unity they get to maintain control and fuck the rest of us And so when we look at like what they do and their actions we should be asking ourselves Well, why are they doing these things and where are they afraid of and why is this how does this affect me and how should I behave and the answer is You should behave in a way that is the opposite of the way they intend you to behave and they want all of us to pick sides They want all of us to argue they want us to go on the internet and trash each other and call each other all these names They want us to go out and march against each other They want us to fight each other in the street and reality if we all just like hit pause if you could hit pause on a pause button And one person could speak to everybody at once you could solve this problem like five fucking minutes Do you guys not notice what's going on do you not see this over and over again? Yeah, I understand you guys might have different beliefs than we have We have different beliefs than you but at the end of the day These guys are the ones making it hard on all of us. This is why and if we if you could give that talk to everybody at once You shoot them saying this is why people like Martin Luther King were assassinated a lot of people so well he was a Marxist mother Got everybody to unify Okay, and they killed him for it JFK why they kill him well they killed him for a couple reasons But the main reason was is everybody was behind him Okay, they're afraid of unifying voices and if everybody can become a unifying voice And everybody can kind of look past some of the ridiculous differences that we may have and say okay Look these are below the line differences we can get back to these later Let's get back to these but right now we have this problem And that's what needs to happen right now But nobody's talking about it because nobody has any interest in talking about it because it doesn't get the clicks like shares And drama that is required to go online. I mean, let's look at what gets traffic online dude We got people You know all day long with these amazing stories of overcoming and struggle and and and fight and then overcoming again Who inspire us all but what gets the views what gets the likes? Oh, it's some hateful shit or some mindless shit like some dude Watch me eat 47 bookers out of my own nose right and 10 million fucking views right like the look of what they're encouraging correct So like dude, we're in a situation where We have to be smarter than what they're trying to propagate to us and unfortunately it doesn't seem like it's happening It seems like it's happening a little bit. I see it happening with our audience But the only way it's going to happen with our audiences is with everybody is if all of our audience This is to what I'm saying and executes it That by the way guys do you not understand this is what I'm trying to do I'm trying to get you to do the thing so that everybody else in your neighborhood does the thing So that we can fucking fix this shit like you're an active participant in what's going on here You know what I mean? This is not just a fucking podcast bro. That do for fun. What a day to be alive Listen, I come in here and do this because I want to solve this problem in a legitimate way And you guys are one for office running for office is not going to solve the problem because culture is what determines Where the politics go and right now here what I do here has much more effect on culture than me being elected in any fucking office Okay, so if you want to know why shit, I can't fix go look at the fucking mirror man Why are you not activating why are you not spreading the message? Why are you not talking to your neighbors and your friends? Why are you not having this discussions in your community? Why are you not getting engaged? Because the plan is there and it will work But everybody has to participate and by the way I know a lot of people do and for you guys it makes me very proud. I see it every day I'm not talking about everybody because every time I say something like this we get all the comments We're out here, man. Yeah, we are out here But there ain't enough of us out here. There's a whole bunch of us listening that aren't out here and we need to get out here Sure shit, man. I love it Guys any question number two Andy I'm 30 years old and I run a successful company as a general contractor For my perspective I'm moving forward at a good pace both personally as well as professionally But I witnessed myself struggling to take compliments and acknowledging my achievements because in my mind I'm nowhere close to where I want to be in life. I sense that you are also wired mentally like this What advice do you have for keeping a positive mindset during this time during these thoughts? I constantly find myself having negative thoughts because I feel like I haven't accomplished shit in the grand scheme of things I think that most high achievers are wired that way I think that most high I think there's one of two ways high achievers are are wired they're either wired That way the way this man describes which he is correct. I am also wired that way Even when people tell me good things about myself. I really almost just think they're full of shit. I don't ever really believe them Which you know has its emotional toll on me it does um And then I think there's other people who do everything they do for the compliment And those people are also effective at achievement Because they're chasing the next compliment because it's like gives them the the dopamine they need It's like an internal yeah, so their job gets done for those people as well For both groups the job gets done, but I just think it's how you're wired I happen to be wired like this gentleman um Who has a very hard time? I have a very hard time believing or accepting any praise or any compliments of any sort and It is because I feel like I haven't done anything relevant. I still feel that way I still to this day and people think I'm full of shit or being falsely humble when I say This but I still feel like I haven't done anything I feel like what I've done isn't enough and I feel like what I'm doing Is so big and it's so huge That like I probably will ever feel satisfied just because I'm wired. I'm not wired To be fed a state dinner bro in the cage at the zoo I'm wired to be let free and go fucking hunt and kill like that's what I'm wired for okay? So I don't stop the wonder if I'm doing a good job I don't stop to think like oh and then when it's like someone says hey, you're doing really good I'm like, bro, I haven't even fucking started what the fuck you talking about like that's my natural reaction and people usually People misunderstand that they think I'm either being a dick or they think I'm I'm being falsely almost like falsely humble or I'm fishing for more shit like bro No, I I'm doing my thing and I haven't done my thing yet and it's so big You don't know what I'm doing yet and I don't take compliments well And You know, I I think I don't even know if there's anything wrong with that, you know, I have a I have a good friend of mine who said to me one time He's like Andy you need to learn to be a gracious receiver meaning I need to learn how to accept praise. I need to learn how to accept like People doing things for me like another thing is like bro. How many times you've seen somebody pay for dinner with me never It never happens never like I don't fucking take shift from anybody I don't even take money from ads because I'm so fucking like dude fuck that. I'm fucking doing on my own You know what I'm saying? I mean do you think it's a fear of like complacency almost like the moment you get the credit It's like I think there's some truth to that. I think there's truth to people who take I witness it I see it all the time. I see people who start to read their own headlines or their own press clippings Then they get lazy and then they stop working and then they lose their shit. I've seen it happen. No, so um You know What do I have for advice? Well, if I had figured this out for myself I'd probably have better advice, but since I've been doing the same thing that you're doing I actually choose to believe that certain people are wired certain ways to accomplish certain things And just because you're wired that way. I don't necessarily mean think that that's that there's anything wrong with you I think I think we deal we live in the society now where It's so fake and it's so Over-presented as perfect That if you're wired even slightly different than what the socially acceptable norm is You feel like an outcast right because you're like fuck. I know. I'm not like these motherfuckers like right what it fucks wrong with me Right, but the reality is is I don't necessarily believe there's anything wrong with you I think that you know, there's certain people that are wired certain ways and a lot of times our biggest gift Is also our biggest handicap so you might be a very you might be able to become a very successful business person because of this gift But you might struggle in other areas and nobody has it all figured out, dude You know nobody has this this you know We're living in a unique time man We're living in a time where first of all we have to see everybody else's lives Every day all day because if we're on social media and we're usually on social media because it's a big part of our business Okay, so we're out here witnessing Everybody's quote-unquote lives and we we forget that there are Many other layers to everybody else's life nobody goes on the internet outside the victim culture perpetrated by the predatory therapy culture that's happening on the internet right now Nobody goes on the internet except except professional victims and tells you their shit Those people over exaggerate their hardships for attention, but everybody else who's normal Everybody else who's a A regular human being they're still presenting a perfect picture of their life Okay, and never in the history of humankind have we had to Compare ourselves at that kind of a rate right like people don't understand this That are born with social media as a way of life But like you know when I was growing up dude like you well you'd be going down the street thinking you're just fine You might see your your neighbor kid out in the street with a new bio. You're like fuck dude. I mean got a new bike I want a new bike right and there's like a fleeting sense of like jealousy or whatever right. I'd do like I'll go steal it So so fucking you know, let's never happen No, now it's in your face all day and it's not just material things like a lot of people shit on the material things I actually think the material things are one of the best things on the internet because they don't talk no shit All right, I could just appreciate it for what it is that's a cool shit But dude we got people presenting their family perfect We got people presenting their mindset perfect We got people presenting that they've got it all figured out and let me tell you something dude There's a ship so I mean nobody has it all figured out. It's a fucking lie. Okay Every and dude and then we got like all these entrepreneurs faking their shit, you know like oh there I know everything. I'm ultra successful motherfucker look dude I'm more successful than fucking 100% of those fucking clowns on the internet and I'm gonna tell you right now. It's hard as fuck for me every day Hard as fuck every day. It's been hard every day and I don't anticipate that changing anytime soon. Yeah, so You know, we have to take all these things into account when we start to like examine ourselves because It's very easy for us to examine ourselves and say there's something wrong with us when we look around and everybody's got a fucking mask on You know, I'm saying or everybody's wearing a costume, you know like like dude It makes me think like what if that is the normal way Right, because I think of it like this like think back like hunter gatherer days, right? Like we go kill a fucking man, if there's no like there's not really any celebration. We just get to eat There is no reward system outside of like just what you did it's life and death like When's the next one coming up, but now because of social media we are indebted in this like reward system cycle That makes us think we're supposed to be getting some type of credit or some type of gratification from anything that we do And so like what if that mentality is how it's supposed to be? I I don't think that there's anything that says it isn't that's my point I don't think there's anything wrong with being an extremely driven human being to where you don't really I don't I don't think there's I don't think that's I think I think I guess what I'm trying to say is I think we often put labels on ourselves That are false because of the environment that we are surrounded by in that isn't reality like it should be in in true human form Right, if we didn't have technology and we didn't have these phones We wouldn't see all this bullshit and by the way nobody would be fronting any of it either like it create create Social media in the internet has created a completely false reality of humanity and it's very dangerous Psychologically and nobody really understood what it was going to create nobody really understood what the backlash would be Like I said about AI It was implemented and the greedy marketers and the greedy entrepreneurs took the shit and ran with it without every thinking of what the implications could be and now we know okay, and It's fucked people up and there's a lot of people out here with anxiety depression frustration Feelings of worth worthlessness Feelings that there's something wrong with them like this person and you know, even sometimes like me like All because we're presented with this false reality that isn't real and I think it's important for us to have real discussions about the internet you know even even the There's just very little authenticity man and there's people all over the internet who are working to achieve a thing and they're willing to present Whatever message and whatever picture and whatever Theme is necessary to achieve the thing without any regard of what the thing does to other human beings. Yeah, and um when we compare ourselves to that I think it's normal to feel That we're there's something wrong with us and I personally like this this person here You know, you say okay, what what a how I deal with this I would deal with it by continuing to go and kick an ass and Building a great life and being proud of it and accept your gift for what it is You got something that not everybody else got you have the ability to move forward without the need for praise when most people need praise every five minutes to even keep moving forward That's a huge advantage when it comes to building shit like I don't I don't need people to cheer for me I don't need people to clap. I don't need praise. I don't need to be told anything I'm just gonna fucking go build and that's a tremendous asset for an entrepreneur to have So the fact that you're in entrepreneurship and you have that skill set I would say is probably a big bonus to you now. Are you gonna struggle in other areas your life? You probably are there's probably gonna be situations that other people have that seem completely normal that you have zero Interested right and you're gonna be you're gonna be looking around and everybody enjoys doing this thing Everybody enjoys doing that thing and you're like well fuck. I don't enjoy any of that I guess I'm fucked up. No, you're not fucked up bro. You're just built for a different purpose They are the lion that can be fed the steak You're not the lion that can be fed the steak. You're the lion that has to be uncage and go fucking kill shit on your own That's a massive advantage to have in business and entrepreneurship and I would take it for what it is You got a gift other people didn't get Yeah, you can acknowledge and give yourself a little bit more love and say hey man This is what I actually did. This is what I've done This is what I'm doing and be real with yourself But never lose that edge of having of being able to go without praise because I think that's what holds most people back honestly I think most people you know like over the course of of my life when I see people who quit whatever path they're on or change or whatever One of the things that ever that that always comes up is You know nobody appreciated me nobody nobody showed me any recognition And real talk like I don't give a fuck about that like at all. I don't fucking care You know, I'm saying I'm a yeah, it's nice sometimes, but I don't need it. You know what I mean? So I think not needing that as a huge advantage I don't think it means you're wired wrong. I don't think it's fucked up people The world needs fucking warriors that are gonna go build shit You're one of them. That's real shit. You know, I think there's a lot to this I think this could be a whole discussion for many hours. You know what I mean? So I was I was over trying to pull up the depression rates in like the last 60 years Can't find it, but I got it would be interesting to see You know if you lay that but that's because back in the day They didn't fucking call it depression they called it fucking life exactly. It's called hard That's what I'm saying, but like fuck bro, but bro putting that graph on top of like the increase in technology How I can see how those listen, listen bro Here's the truth and I say this and people take it out of context and they get so fucking pissed off when I say this But the real reason why most people are depressed and the reason people have anxiety is because they don't have a real purpose in their life They don't have a real mission to accomplish humans are mission driven Beings they have to have something to build contribute to or be a part of and when you sit online all day And you just scroll through your fucking phone and sit on your couch and order your uber eats and smoke weed or drink alcohol Dude, you're gonna feel like shit. Okay. That doesn't mean you're depressed. It means you're not actively living a life Okay, and this is why when you get the fuck up and you go out and go on a walk you feel a little better And when you get the fuck up and you go out and you go on a walk with three or four of your people that you know You feel even better and you know when you feel even better than that When you get those three or four people to go build something or contribute something or do something good for your community You feel even better. So the more you live a life That humans are built to live for the less depression anxiety you have All right, and the technology and convenience that we're all sold as The way that we should live now because it's so convenient and so easy We should consider who's telling us that message Who's selling us that and what are they getting from that message? What do they get from our complacency? What do they get from our apathy? What do they get from our laziness? They get everything and we get nothing And that's where the fuck we are. So like dude, I don't actually believe You know for a long time bros on an antipressants for fucking a long time You know and when I fucking finally came to this conclusion. I'm like this is bullshit You know what I'm saying? Like it is bullshit. It's bullshit. It's bullshit I'm not saying it doesn't exist. I'm not saying you're not struggling But what I am saying is the reason you're struggling is because you're shit ain't hard enough And you're not applying yourself and you're not going and building contributing and being a part of the human experience And it's causing you mental anguish and that's normal and technology contributes to that So we shouldn't be surprised that so many people say that they are depressed or that they have massive anxiety What you really have is massive anxiety because you're letting your life pass you by without doing anything with it That's what technology is created. I love it. Yeah Guys, any of you are a third and final question. Any question number three My boyfriend is a young entrepreneur and he's been diving headfirst Into all real estate I know that grind sucks and there's a lot of days. They're gonna be hard My question is in the early years of your journey Is there anything specific that you wish the people who supported you would have done for you or anything you can think of now No, because everything that happened to me that was negative in terms of the relationships I had the friendships I've had has made me who I am today and taught me everything I needed to know about people and life and how to operate with the way that I am wired Not the way that everybody else is wired So no, I wouldn't change anything for me At all But I think that's not the real question I think the question that you're asking is How do I become someone who is who is the biggest supporter of this person that I care about while they're on this very difficult journey Is that fair? Yeah, that's that's what the question sounded like to me. Yeah Here's what I can tell you I can tell you that becoming an entrepreneur Is indescribably hard And this is why I get so frustrated with the online entrepreneur marketing that we see On a regular basis from people who haven't really been down the path It's incredibly difficult. It's incredibly hard It takes every fucking thing that you have it sucks all of your energy is sucks all of your life It's the only thing that you can really think about it care about And that's reality and You know when I think back about around the friendships I had And I want to say this before I say this I don't hold any hard feelings I don't I don't like look back at Girls I dated and think like man fuck them or anything I've come to realize that certain people want different things in life And the people that that I was with at those times wanted different things that I wanted and You know in the moment you get pissed right you're like oh this person's a piece of shit They're fucking with me or this or that some people never get over that. Yeah, but um The nature of human beings is different like what I want is different than what they want or what you want what somebody else wants and When you have an entrepreneur who's gonna go down this hard path There's a pretty good chance that they're willing to do whatever the fuck it takes And if that means sacrificing their relationship with you then it means that too They don't give a fuck okay, and that's a very hard thing for partners to understand Because truly driven people are wired that way like it comes fit and that dude There's gonna be a lot of people with a lot of judgment when I say this but it comes before everything That path comes before everything for people because that's how much it actually Takes to actually achieve it and that's reality and anybody who's ever fucking actually built something Will tell you that's reality if they're telling the truth It comes before at least in the beginning at least in the beginning now there comes time later where you have family and things change And I understand that as well But that's after work to get something off and and off the ground and running It's fucking everything and One of the things that would have made it a lot easier on me was if the people around me would have Understood that I was that committed They didn't always remember I was that committed and so things like Relationship drama or friend drama or gossip or partying or stupid things often got in my way Because the people around me did not understand me they they understood what everybody else was doing They didn't understand what I was trying to do and because I didn't even really understand what I was trying to do a lot of time was Wasted by doing these other things and I do kind of regret that a little bit But not all the time because I had some great stories. I had a lot of fun. I experienced a lot of life right um But I could have gotten to where I'm at now a lot faster had I not had those distractions That's what I'm gonna clarify so you're saying like there was things like you know maybe like like peer pressure the guilt trip like yeah But oh Andy come out with it. Yeah, but but look bro You gotta remember I'm a different human being now than I was then sure, okay? I'm a different human being than I was two years ago. Yeah, like after going through the shoulder surgery and this rehab Like I'm a fucking mentally hardened person now and in a different way than I was he if you knew me two years ago You don't know me no more. That's real shit. Okay Ten years ago. It's completely different right 15. It's completely different. Yeah, so uh You know back then I didn't have the discipline or the ability to recognize that those things were costing me time right or costing me effectiveness And uh, you know, I wasted a lot of time doing the things that were quote unquote normal Because other people wanted me to do them When in reality, I was never happy doing those things. It wasn't it wasn't what I wanted to do and it just Made me it almost Killed my progress a number of times so like if I could go back and change anything I wouldn't because I still was able to have a lot of life experiences have a lot of fun But I wouldn't have learned the lessons that I'm teaching you had I not gone through that. Does that make sense? Yeah for sure That was almost necessary. Yeah, it was for me. It was absolutely necessary And I I think you know what this person what this woman's actually asking is how can I support someone? Remember it or just realize they're fully committed Um and any nagging or any emotional draining shit that you do on him Moves you further apart and further apart and further apart until he's gone. So You try to minimize the nagging you try to minimize the frustration you had communicate like an adult not like a little kid You know, no silent treatments no guilt trips real communication that that would be extremely helpful for someone in that position um You know understanding that they are on a different kind of mission for a different kind of life and trying to keep yourself from speaking to them in terms of reality and whatever anybody else is doing That was something that always pissed me off dude like all these people would tell me like when are you gonna grow up and get this You know, you're you're eight years in you're not making any money yet like when's it time to throw in the towel You know what I'm saying like that shit is not helpful eight years in man. That's crazy I know but people don't but but look dude everybody else was telling me hey man It's time to you know it's time to get serious, you know, this isn't this isn't panning out And I'm here like I know I'm right on the verge, you know, I know I'm right over the next hill bro I'm gonna be there and and honestly it it alienated me away from most of my friend group Because they can never see where the fuck I was trying to go and it was always those kind They thought they were being my friend. Yeah, they thought they were giving me a good talk. Hey man You're going down the wrong path of life I knew I wasn't going down the wrong path They just didn't understand what path I was on and I think For a non-autroprenure minded person. It's very hard to understand That journey if you don't have a parent or you don't have a family member. We've never been around it It's very difficult to understand so in my opinion um, you know Trying to not nag don't be an emotional drain try to contribute don't complain don't cause extra stress Have real conversations like an adult don't play games Uh, don't throw fits don't throw temper tantrums because dude those just move you further out of that person's life That person will shut you the fuck out eventually Because anybody who's going to invest that kind of time energy and effort and pain into building what it is They're wanting to build uh, they're willing to cut you out for it too So I think it's just very important to remember and this goes for anybody who's who's in a relationship with an entrepreneur Mind a person they will eventually cut you out And if you're an entrepreneur and you have someone who's in your life who's causing you all this pain and frustration And you're thinking about quitting just understand that person will complain about you quitting the minute you quit Okay, so the minute right now they're saying Oh, you're so busy. You don't have any time for me. You're obsessed. You're this you're that it's unhealthy The minute you quit they're gonna say you're a loser. Why don't you do something? You know, you're always fucking broke Well, blah, blah. Yeah, we always hang out, but you're not doing shit That's the exact conversation that happens when you quit do not quit do not ever quit your fucking dreams for somebody else's Ever do not ever ever ever quit if you're an entrepreneur and you're with someone who's telling you That you need to reevaluate or do you're gonna fuck yourself because the minute you quit that person will nag you For quitting and all the other shit naggers nag bro. They nag if you're doing good They nag if you're doing bad the reality is you got to find someone that contributes that doesn't pull energy out of you But actually puts energy in you. That's the ultimate 10-second answer find someone who puts or be someone who energizes the person Don't be someone who takes energy and that's that's really what it comes down to I love it. Love it. We're guys. Andy. That was three. Yeah guys go pay a fee Counting millions in a coke bitch. Oh, this whoa gotta own bank road. Can't fall. There's a no-hit shot case clothes
