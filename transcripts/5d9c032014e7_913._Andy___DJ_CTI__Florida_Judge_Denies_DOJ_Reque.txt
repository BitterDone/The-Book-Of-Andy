We're from sleeping on the floor, now my jury box froze, fuck up, fuck up, fuck up, stole, counting millions in the coke, bad bitch, booted, swole, got a own bank, broke, can't fold, does a note, hit shot, case, clothe, clothe, clothe, clothe. What is up guys, it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realist's second body of the lies, I think it's an end illusion, some modern society, and we're welcome. Guys, today we have Andy and DJ, Cruz the motherfucking, and that's what we're gonna do. That's what CTI stands for, Cruz the internet, we put topics on the screen, we'll speculate and make fun of these people doing weird shit in the world and then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on. Let's just get right into it, don't forget to pay the fee, don't be a hoe, share the show. What's up? My mic, tip smells different. Mine doesn't smell different. It doesn't? Nope. Okay, alright man, yeah what's going on bro? Why does it smell different? I'm trying to think of what it smells like too, I don't know. Guess what? What? I watch Kingdom of Heaven, alright? At least I watch the first half up until the intermission, like the 10 minutes into the second half. Okay, I forgot this long movie. It is a very long movie, especially the director's cut. But no, it's pretty good. Pretty good, I know, that's pretty good. It's no days of thunder, you know what I'm saying? But I would say out of more recent movies, it's one of the better ones I've seen. Bro, do we have terms? That's pretty good. The guy knew that Edward Norton was dying anyway, I'm not gonna lose. Exactly, man. Pretty good. What I really liked about is, because it actually shows, what real leadership I guess was back then. Respect was just different back then, bro. Well yeah, I will fucking kill you, man. There's consequences. When there's consequences, there's respect. When you remove consequences from society, respect ceases to exist, which is the world that we live in. Alright, that's why when they started prosecuting people and putting them in jail for simple assault, it changed the world. It did. Yeah. Okay, men used to understand that if men said certain things or spoken of certain tone or did certain things, that there was a 100% likelihood of consequences. Yeah. Okay, and now we live in a situation where that just is in the case. And there's a lot of really weak people who quite honestly have never felt the consequences of disrespect and they need to. That's the truth. And if they did, and natural order was re-installed into culture, we would not have the problems that we have. Yeah, dude. Allow it flourish. What needs, bro, I fucking love that movie. Yeah, it is fabulous. Yeah, I haven't finished it. So I don't tell them what happens, but yeah, so basically far it's pretty good. Yeah. And like dude, the Edward Norton, when he's riding up on the fucking with the army behind him, I mean, this just looks pretty fucking hard. Oh, yeah. I pray you retire to Damascus and home. Yeah, yeah, yeah, very calm. It was good. And on the shots here, we'll be punished. Yeah, that's good. Withdrawal, we all die here. Bro, that's probably the best movie scene ever. Yeah, it's just such a good movie. Yeah, I definitely couldn't understand the first fucking 20 minutes at all. So Andy Text me last night. He's like, yo, what was that movie? And I'm telling him, he's like, I better be good because it cost me like $4. And I'm like, immediately, I'm like, fuck, did he get the directors cut? I'm like, bro, the directors cut. He's like, well, shit, now it cost me $8. And then he texted me like two hours later. I can't understand the fucking word they're saying. I'm like, dude, subtitles, man. It's just like Braveheart. Braveheart's like that, you know? Yeah, those time periods, it takes like 20 minutes to like acclimate to what they're saying. Yeah, then you feel yourself in it. Yeah, bro. That's pretty good. I'm happy for you. I like the, I like his costume, dude. Do the mask. Yeah, fuck, yeah, that's badass. I might start wearing that every day. Bro. The Edward Norton, you know, the thing is a crazy thing about the movie. So he didn't even want to be putting the credits for that movie. He wanted the king to be like this anonymous, like, you know, who the actor was. Like, he anonymous, mysterious, bro. And you could kind of tell it's him through his voice, really? Yeah. See, I wouldn't familiar with it before that though. So I don't know. You never saw American History X? Shit, same guy. Yes, very same. Same guy. That is the same guy. Same calm demeanor. Oh, we were all down here. It makes so much sense now. It makes so long, man. Oh, right. Dropping bombs. Well, guys, we got a full show before you guys today. If you were to substitute the, uh, the, the language for language, yeah, that'd be pretty funny. That'd be pretty funny scene. Like Edward Norton rides up with his fucking king mask. Oh, honey, he's like, hey, if you don't get the fuck out of here, I'll curb stop your ass. Do we have turns? Yeah. You understand what the fuck I'm telling you? Bro, fuck, man. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, fuck, I guess I didn't know about him. I did know about him. Yeah. Um, yeah, man, we got full, we got a full, girthy show today. Well, I'm going to get a fucking like, I want to get like a cool poster of that fucking, that character. He might be one of my favorite characters. Which one? The king. Oh, it's okay. Yeah. The young king is pretty good. Anyway. Yeah, I quit watching at the part where she, uh, where she realized that her son has it too. Yeah, brother. That's deep. Yeah, and then I had to go to bed. Yeah, it gets crazy. Yeah, it's a great movie, man. It's, I'm just glad that one of my recommendations is, no, it was good, bro. I mean, it's no days of thunder for real, but it's good. It's, it's a brave heart. It's up in there. It's a, no, it's a remake of brave heart. Bro, it's a remake of brave heart in a different era. And that's what it is. And then also a lot of the music is, is very similar, especially, uh, like a lot of the music comes from like the dude who did the Hannibal score. I recognized it from listening. It's good, dude. No doubt. It's a good movie. Oh, yeah, man. I want for one for DJ right now. So that's good. One for one. Like my first good movie recommendation. No, that's like one for one gazillion. Well, the movies have, have I, have I recommended it? No, I'm saying like one for, like I'm one of, I'm one for one. I'm giving you good movie recommendations. I haven't given you a bad one yet. That's because all the other you gave me, I didn't watch. Yeah. You know what, you run another one? I give it to you anyway. Uh, fine and emo. Believe it or not, I've seen that. Okay. All right. Great movie. It's all right. It's great movie. Okay. All right, but now let's give it to you. We got a lot to cover today. Uh, I got a special brand new segment. Oh, yeah. I'm coming for you guys. So stay tuned for that. Um, but we got it. We got to talk about some very, uh, disconcerning news right now, man. Um, Hulk Hogan. Yeah. I saw that legend, man. Dead at 71, bro. I saw that, bro. Don't they say that like death comes in threes or some shit? Like, I know there was a black stereotype. No, no, no, that's, that's a real thing. Yeah. Okay. Death coming in threes. So if you think about it, they had the, the dude from the Cosby show. Welcome, Jamal Warren. He drowned. Yeah. I saw that, dude. Um, you had, uh, Ozzy Osborne. Yeah. And then now you got Hulk Hogan, bro. Yeah. Well technically for us, cause Epstein's attorney died too. I saw that. Yeah. Yeah. The guy that his defense attorney from the original trials, he died. He was like 81 or something like that. So technically for us. But yeah, I mean, Hulk Hogan, bro, fucking legend, bro. All right. So I want everybody to pay attention to something. Yeah, dude. Well, you know, we grew up watching Hulk Hogan, dude, but it's, it's fucking Hulk Hogan, bro. You slammed on to the giant. Yeah. That's when that was my era, dude, right there. Yeah. You know, the yellow and red McDonald's outfit. You know what I'm saying? Let's get him into like that. Yeah. I mean bro, he wasn't, he wasn't a legitimate American icon. World famous. When people think about America, dude. You know, Hulk Hogan. Oh, yeah. For sure come there. Hulk Hogan and bald Beatles. Yeah And this amazing for managers. You're free to that's right. That's right Yeah, dude, that sucks man, but I want everybody pay attention to the bigger picture of how The left is responding to his death because huh he's racist. Oh, no, they're like good riddance. Maggah shit Yeah, right okay Go read all the comments of the left and Watch how they're celebrating another man's death and then realize that that's what they would think about you So I just want everybody to see it in real time These people are They have no class. They have no respect. They have no Tolerance even though that's what they use to even get traction in culture and demand be tolerant Accept us we exist and then when someone that doesn't align with their values passes away They go crazy celebrating and being happy like You guys should all realize that that's what these people think about you Mm-hmm And that is why they cannot be afforded to ever have fucking control of this country ever again I see Gavin Newsom going around and trying to like do the podcast circuit and all this shit. Mm-hmm Just remember he's the worst one all of them. Mm-hmm. So yeah, man Well, all right, Pete to the legend, bro. Yep. All right, Pete to the legend Yeah It's just crazy. I got saw come on my whole man dude. That's that's crazy man, but Yeah, so one of the cover that but I that's promised I have a new segment for for everybody here I think I hope we enjoy this one This segment brand new to really up CT eyes called let's get philosophical Elisophical You spell that yourself that did yeah, all right. I did philosophical L Sofable Well, you feel with your hands So yeah, so in this segment, I'm gonna be asking you three philosophical questions And just give me what you got on it. Okay, all right, you ready? I guess so all right first question Do beavers even know what they're doing or do they just see water flowing down a river and think? Absolutely not I think I've seen enough beavers to know that They instinctively um Build dams. Okay. Yeah, it's it's it's what they do and the reason that I know that is because There's videos on the internet of people who have pet beavers who take all their stuffed animals They make dams like at the hall damn. Yeah damn damn. So I think okay, they don't I don't know if they know what they're doing I don't think it's the water. I just think it's what they do. It's just instincts. Yeah, I got it. Okay All right, well, let's get philosophical again. Uh number number two Um, is it reasonable? Is it a reasonable expectation that when you reach a 900 credit score, you won't have to see another black person Is 900 credit score possible. I don't know. I definitely know you're asking me. I had to have no no clue Yeah, that's probably pretty stupid for me to ask You know, I don't know man You know, they say everybody's got to have a dream No, I don't know bro. I don't think you can get the 900. Okay. All right. Yeah, but if you got to a 50, which is what you get here I you know Let me ponder that okay. All right. Um last one Let's get philosophical here man. Okay. Uh question is If you send a dick pick to your homeboy and he screenshots or saves it who's gay All right, the one definitely the one that saves it Okay, yeah, not the one who sent it Well, I'm not saying he's not gay. I'm saying the one that saves it's definitely gay Ha We could be trying to settle arguments. I don't know You know stand like we could be trying to break stereotypes here could be trying to prove points Uh There's a lot to be going on from the one that sent it okay, but the one that saves it yeah for sure. That's no questions totally gay no questions All right, I mean Yeah, I'm that's my answer. Okay I'm feeling some tension between you two guys. Huh? Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, I'm seeing don't save it. I'm trying. Yeah, don't save it. Don't even look at it If you look at another dude's dick your gay Yeah Yeah, it's fact for sure. We're guys 80 What what about the a-50 credit score though? I'm still pondering. Yeah I mean, I heard it's a legend, you know, I'm saying like I'm praying to God I get to a 50 Is that why? No, man, I don't know dude. Yeah, you know, I don't know I got I mean you gotta be up there According to experience only 1.54% of Americans have a perfect 850 score Hmm one percent of America approximately well no actually You know you think that because of like people that are wealthy Have perfect credit, but that's actually not always true. Oh, because usually wealthy people look at like small bills that are like 500 600 bucks and they're like they they fucking are like It's 500 bucks, and so they like fucking put it off and then it doesn't get paid and then some credit gets dinged And then a lot of a lot of wealthy people don't really use credit that often. So the credit score suffers, you know what I mean? so Yeah, it's not necessarily the wealthiest people to have the highest credit scores. Yeah, never thought about like that I wonder what like I wonder what like Bayzo's credit score is I Mean what would he need to use credit for? It's true. Yeah, I mean right to your point Well, that's what I'm saying and then if he if he doesn't you if you don't utilize credit your credit score goes down. Yeah, so Yeah, bro. I know I know it's a terrible fucking business. I'm gonna be real. I mean terrible Like I think it's fucking stupid for you fucking come for you for them. It's very smart. Yeah Well for us it's stupid. Yeah, you know, it's a terrible game. We gotta play Yeah, well, I mean you get it get born into that system. You know to They they make the wages low enough to where you have to use credit to live in a certain lifestyle You know what I mean? So like it's it's a it's a fucking trap. There's no way to really avoid it Which is completely unconstitutional against what this country is about But you know, they've made so much money that now everybody's in their pocket. Yeah, so That's crazy man guys settle reserves shouldn't exist. No No But guys we got philosophical today. So yeah, some down in the comments what you guys think We're just you know trying to make the world better here That's right. That's it. But yeah man guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos Go to Andy for seller.com if you guys are listening on audio come chuck us out on the tube Yeah starting on Spotify as well for you guys Yeah, yeah, look at that. Yeah, that's good. That's right. Good job. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you What that big set us getting through our first round of headlines Hello number one This is a CNN CNN's been hold on. What's up? We got business to settle Oh What did people think about the ice cream rankings? Oh, I got some I got you for that. Yo, trust me. I have to know they got you I got to know they got me Yeah, that's coming a little late. I got you though. All right. Yeah, it's coming Listen It doesn't matter what everybody else thinks it's what you know, it's yeah, I think that's right. It's right. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine Oh, it is fucking living in it Yeah, but that's uh, let's let's go to my king's mask. Yeah, fucking it'd be official. They'd be fine. Yeah We have to tell us that's what I'm gonna wear into the revolution bro, you know, you know, you know, I'm gonna give me a big fucking one of those big fucking Purchor on or massive horses and And then one of those masks and we're just gonna ride into the revolution like that You fucking awesome. You know, there's you know, it's funny enough though. You know, it's uh, what's like picking up a lot of steam and talk right now What is bringing back like the actual crusades Like yeah, well, you know, that's one of the biggest lies of Christianity is that fucking. It's passive I've been saying that for years It's not passive. It's very active and uh Well, I don't know if you saw the pope just allowed the night's template to come back to the Vatican last week You know, and they were in full fucking dress. Dude like this and it's what's we got. Well, we'll cover this a little bit more But yeah, well sign me to fuck up. No By the way, er, was it are you can't kill no actually you can God wills it baby. That's right. God wills it's it's it's just like the movie said it's doing Small acts of evil for the greater good. Mm-hmm That needs to come back and stop bro. Well, it's coming. It's coming. But let's get into our first Dude listen all about it dude Um, but yeah, first set of headlines. I want to go to I want to go with CNN Because they've been they've been talking a lot about this Um, so let's give some updates latest on Trump administration DOJ to meet with Epstein associate Galein Maxwell Okay, so so CNN has been pumping out a bunch of stuff over the past couple of days um pictures videos Um from like 1993 drawing this Trump Epstein connection But yeah, the deputy attorney general Todd Blanch is expected to meet with Jeffrey Epstein accomplished Galein Maxwell today sources tell us CNN Um, he is actually down in Florida right now um, uh, they're scheduled to meet. I believe at 4 p.m. Eastern time So literally right now as it shows recording their their meeting um, it comes as a judge decline yesterday to release grand jury documents from the criminal probe Into the late convicted sex prisoner. We got a little bit more on that. But um, this is CNN's update. Let's check this out What does Galein Maxwell know and what is deputy attorney general Todd Blanch prepared to offer her To get that information from her That's what we're watching as this very unusual meeting Takes place in Tallahassee, Florida where Galein Maxwell serving a 20-year sentence This meeting is very unusual because you don't every day have the deputy attorney general Traveling to go meet a convicted felon to try to get information from them Galein Maxwell has very little incentive to talk to the federal government She maintains her innocence. She's appealing her her sentence at this stage and For the administration, you know, what they can offer is perhaps some leniency the president has the power to pardon galein Maxwell He also could commute her sentence Blanch said that one of the purpose of this meeting is to get any information from a galein Maxwell that could Perhaps lead to additional prosecutions of people who were associated with Jeffrey Epstein we know that one of the names that is associated with Jeffrey Epstein and of course is Donald Trump Back in May Pam Bonded the attorney general and Todd Blanch brief the president that his name appeared in these files that remain under wraps Yeah, so there's a lot happening here Just a dive in a little bit on this so a Florida judge denies the DOJ's request to unseal Epstein grand jury transcripts, okay, so that just happened Now this was an Obama appointed judge um us district judge robin Rosenberg um And she basically concluded that her hand the court's hands was tied citing that She was actually required to dismiss the department's request because of long standing grand jury secrecy rules that include only a few narrow Exceptions and none of which she said the justice department met in this case And so you know that comes out Isn't she somehow related to the judge that Represented him back like in the first time he was accused of this that ruled over the case. Yeah, I'm not sure Yeah, I think she's got some ties to that person. Yeah, but I mean I think they all have ties some way shape of form. Yeah Um Yeah, she said that her hands are tied um and then it comes out And this is weird. I love you take the pan bindie is apparently sideline right now after having a sudden medical condition um just after um Another report came out that The AG told Trump that he was in the Epstein file. So this is um, this is all you know I don't know if you can call it hearsay right but again, CNN has been pumping this Trump's names in the Epstein files Um and allegedly attorney general pan bindie told president Trump that his name appeared in the so-called Epstein files When she briefed him in May on the justice department's review of the documents according to multiple sources and then When that report comes out pan bindie abruptly cancelled her appearance at a high profile Anti trafficking summit on Wednesday citing a sudden medical Emergency yeah right because she knew she's gonna get fucking destroyed Yeah, so apparently she uh she she she sent a letter or statement um that was read out uh saying quote I'm sorry to miss all of my CPAC friends today unfortunately I am recovering from a recently torn cornea Which is preventing me from being with you. I truly wish I was able to join you and support all of the work being done on this critical issue And then I looked into it the number one cause for torn corneus is uh trauma or blunt trauma or penetrating injuries or high-speed particles like wood chips or metal chavings Um when they're prepared at high speeds Um, so it's interesting now Trump comment and all of this just yesterday um about this reporter allegedly With his names being involved in this and a g-todum. This is what he had to say. Let's check this out No, no, she's uh she's given us Just a very quick briefing and in terms of the credibility of the different things that they've seen And I would say that you know these files were made up by Komi They were made up by Obama. They were made up by but the Biden in from you know We and we went through years of that with the Russia Russia Hugs with all of the different things that we had to go through We've gone through years of it But she's handled it very well And it's gonna be up there whatever she thinks is credible. She should release. Yeah Let's say interesting change of pace there Donald Don don don bro you got more well, I mean Not on the Epstein stuff. I mean more on the Obama stuff that's coming out. I don't know if you guys saw this well First of all. Yeah, well, I gotta say something here. Okay You Get your story straight dude All right, like you come on a month ago not even a month ago three weeks ago and say oh, it's bullshit It doesn't even exist. It's not real Yeah, blah, blah, right Now you're saying release the stuff if it's credible. Mm-hmm and if Somehow this was something that was made up the way that you say it was which by the way The people who have been paying attention to this Don't buy it because they've been paying attention to it for the last decade all right, so Just because this is now mainstream doesn't mean that there's a massive amount of people who have been Obsessing over this story for a long time and now it's coming to the surface And you have him saying all different kinds of shit and I always like to give Trump the benefit of the doubt because I understand How strategic some things need to be in order to get things done, you know You it doesn't always go one two three four sometimes it goes one four three two, you know and uh I understand that But like dude when you come out and say it doesn't exist. It's bullshit. You guys are idiot weaklings for believing it and you haven't given any context as to How it was made up or why it was made up if you want people to believe that then you should come out and show that All right, which they're not doing now secondly There's a lot of people Who are saying, you know, oh Trump's in the Epstein files no shit They all ran around together bro that doesn't mean he was out having sex with underage girls or anything like that That's not what that means There's all kinds of people that are in those files that did nothing wrong that are just associated Through the high level network of You know social light, but yeah social like culture correct like that would be no different than a prominent member of St. Louis getting accused of The same shit Epstein's doing and then saying Well, Andy and this guy belong to the same cigar club and they sat together and fucking smoked a couple cigars and You know, he's name is in the frial So he must be a predator like this this guilty by association shit Yeah, dude, and that's not true either yeah, so like And Trump is feeding the hysteria by not giving a clear answer. Yep, right and so when we Think about The people who are really dug into this You know, you have all these leftists now saying you're defending a fucking pedophile and then you have A lot of people that were I don't know in the middle or Did vote for Trump that are saying well, he's in it too What's the proof of that? Where's the proof of that you see what I'm saying no like Well, I mean that's even my question bro. Yeah, but there's seen it has been pumping out all of the shit last week with pictures of like Epstein It is wedding and you know all this why now so you tell them you guys just now got all these fucking pictures Like so so I had 500 people at my wedding. Yeah So if one of those people ends up being a sexual predator that's on me. Yeah, right, right, right How many people that down in Trump have his wedding bro, right and how well connected and wealthier those people There's gonna be some people doing some fucking fucked up shit that you never know about may not find out about 10 years from now 20 year Maybe you never find out but like The jumping to these massive conclusions is Indicative of why we keep finding ourselves in these situations as the citizens of the country to get taken advantage of Like we have to look at the whole picture bro, and it's not about sticking up for Trump If you have nothing to hide Trump you need to fucking show People why they made it up? What is the reason for them making up? So you're saying that they made this up and puts your name in it 10 years ago to pull it out now, right, and then we're gonna pull it out in 2020 Then we're gonna so instead of pulling this out in 2020 and saying he's a fucking child molester They instead fucking release COVID yeah, right are you fucking serious bro like Look dude There's way more to this I don't care what anybody says. I don't care how mad people get I don't care what you fucking think of me. I Call it how I see it. I don't know what the fuck is happening, but here's what I do know neither do you Is that fair that's pretty fair? It's like you're fair and and just because you're willing to wait and let someone let this play out a little bit doesn't mean your fuck is supporting You know just because someone says hey, I'm gonna stand by Trump doesn't mean they support fucking Trafficking right okay, and just because someone says hey Trump What the fuck doesn't mean they hate Donald Trump they want some answers right like I don't know like it's just like people seem to be it's like this this or that this or that this or that Left or right gay or straight black or white, you know, Democrat Republican You know fuck it's like dude you don't always have to be a part of a team you can think for yourself And you can say hey, I'm not sure. I don't know Let me look into this I agree mostly with what this guy stands for but I don't like this about him These these are the thoughts of a critical thinker Not a NPC fucking sheep emotional fucking yeah, man, cuz that's really what it is. It's weird It is super weird man. Like I can't remember the last time my life dude I mean even with the people that are closest to me. Yeah, where I'm like Yeah, I agree with everything You know what I'm saying like no now It you know if we're in public, I'm gonna fucking agree with everything, you know because that's how we roll but like In private I might be like hey That's kind of fun. Oh, it's stupid. Yeah Now dude, I think you shoot themself in the foot every single time that he kind of like does this like doubling down of it Because like you see your point without without without any reason with no zero like bro What would even be the motive of behind that? You know, I'm saying like that doesn't make sense well the only motive that I can think of is that Look dude the only motive to his story of They made this up would be to use it against him somehow How are they using it against you you mean like right now? They're using against you right then if they were using it against you right now Why didn't they use it against you when by was office? Why didn't they use it against you in 2020? Why didn't they use it against your 2016 right? You know what I'm saying? Like That's bullshit and everybody fucking knows it And that's what led me to believe like continuously he wants people to keep talking about it But why why So I don't know dude like it's weird. I'll tell you this I am leaning more towards right now that nothing's gonna happen to any of these people. Yeah Well, I mean, so like even with the the judge ruling that he's not you know down in Florida that they're not releasing it There is another Opportunity because the DOJ leaders have also asked to federal judges in New York For prosecutors brought cases against Epstein and his co-conspirator Galeimax well to un-till their grand jury transcripts And New York's federal courts have generally taken a less stringent approach to grand jury secrecy. So you know There's two more chances here. We'll see But I mean, I don't know if the same shit's up there is what's gonna be disclosed you know him saying like it's too hard to tell We don't know well why why have they not Disclose it if okay if it's bullshit. There's nothing on it. It's nonsense only weak people believe it then why the fuck do you not just let it go? Right, right the reason he don't want it out In my opinion and my speculation and what I've heard is because it will embarrass his family meaning Like that's not already happening though I agree you know, I'm saying like I mean what like that to me that doesn't make it can't be that In my opinion because that's already happened. Oh, you don't want it to be be known that Melania Well then the other thing you know that Trump through it like that's already out like people already know that you know I'm saying like what well what do we stop it? He doesn't know that people know that I don't know bro. He's been getting pretty hammered man like I mean well Then then the other thing is there's three possibilities. He's in on it He did do some fucked up shit He's doesn't want his real it he doesn't want to be Embarrassed his wife because he spent his whole life embarrassing women. He probably doesn't want to do it again. Mm-hmm Or he's being threatened or we're being threatened. Yeah, right. Right. I mean to me that's what leads to it But it's like even okay, if that's the case though There needs to be some like like there's just has to be some other way to like To crawl the people well, it makes you what it makes you it makes you wonder like okay. Is that why he's not explaining it? Because he can't yeah But not because he's a Zion Don but simply because like he cares about people Because about the nonsense. He's not doing a very good job painting himself as not Zion but gone right right which I think but that's the thing I think they know that though right like That state knows that you know, I'm saying they know exactly what it's doing So I mean either way it's but like and so that's what makes me also feel though like okay Let's fucking roll them bro Like if you truly want the support because you're your credibility is being ruined regardless You know, I'm saying by either saying it's fake or look bro. He needs to fucking realize listen. He needs to realize this If you don't fucking do it and you don't arrest people and you don't hold people accountable and people don't pay for what's happened in this country You Donald Trump will be the biggest fucking failure as a president ever Ever he not he won't be the reason the country Revived he'll be the reason the country went down the toilet permanently For real yeah Now last little bit on accountability here And because this just came out today the house panel they moved to subpoena the clitons in the Epstein investigation So that came out they're gonna be um throwing some some subpoenas to both the former president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton um, so that that just came out um, and and there's some interesting stuff because even with this whole Obama russia hoax thing that that's also developing right now um, it's also gabber did a press conference at the White House where she You know release some more information on what was going on and like the compromise that was happening between Russia and and the US and what was actually discovered is that Hillary Clinton was pretty fucked up post 2016 let's check this clip out The report goes into great detail about the information that russia and putin had which include on Hillary Clinton Which included possible criminal acts Like secret meetings with multiple named US religious organizations in which state department officials offered In exchange for supporting secretary clitons campaign for the presidency significant increases in financing from the state department They also had documents that showed the patronage of the state department To state department employees who would go and support Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign There were high level DNC emails that detailed evidence of Hillary's quote psycho-emotional problems uncontrolled fits of anger aggression and cheerfulness And that then secretary Clinton was allegedly on a daily regimen of heavy tranquilizers Then cia director Brennan and the intelligence community mischaracterized intelligence and relied on dubious substandard sources to create a contrive false narrative that putin developed a quote-unquote clear preference for Trump God dude. I really worry about Tulsi Gabbert. Don't I really do And she's yeah It's almost like they're drugging these people and then putting them out in public when they need him to say shit You know what i mean? Yeah New me for Clinton. Yeah, and Biden and whoever's fucking doing whatever well I mean do you came out that like Biden was on fucking like sleep pills and shit during the debate to know that and like they just Push these people out and hope that they have rehearsed their fucking scripts enough, you know I'm like dude. I remember that video of uh Clinton like she was leaving I think a hotel with some like that. Yeah, I should hold her up. We covered it. Yeah, you know what I'm saying like so it's like Yeah, I mean is there. I mean if you guys are watching on YouTube if you listen to audio They clip we were playing what's also speaking it was all the the cut clips of Hillary Clinton acting very fucking bizarre in public dude Very bizarre if you took all these people All of them arrested them Eliminated them from the planet however, which way we decided to do it There there would be a breath of relief In this country there would be a lightness on people's shoulders because people would realize that that's over You really want to get the country back going you want to get the country fucking unified and back to being a good place A prosperous place the gateway to that is accountability because no one believes in it anymore. Mm-hmm even this most staunch patriotic person They're they're not fighting anymore for a great America. They're fighting against those people and we should be looking How do we go from here to create the best country possible and we have the ability to do that But not without some Some hard decisions. They really should be easy decisions made by Trump and his administration hard optics Yeah, it's what but dude, you know what sometimes hard optics are necessary People need to know that you cannot fucking do certain things right like the fact that we have allowed the Normalization of the sexualization of children That's an indicator of how far society has fallen that would not have been tolerated 30 40 years ago bro Those people would be dealt with and they would be dealt with by people who realized that Sometimes you do have to do something that maybe isn't great for the greater good And we used to be a country that did those things now we're a country that sits here and says Are they as anybody gonna do anything? Yeah You know what I mean live laugh love baby And then guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think That being said let's go cruise some of these comments Andy because they are they are hot and ready Oh, yeah little ceasers bro.

That's good yeah, yeah. So uh, free pirate How I can I can either conform North and We're over my head. I did apparently I missed that. I don't know how I missed that. I was there. Yeah. All right last but not least we got another we got a hot pocket juicer for you. Oh, we do. Oh, yeah. Okay. Uh, this is Carlos Hernandez. You don't know how to run a country. No. No. This one. This one's great. Okay. Okay. Carlos Hernandez XT9 me. Um, if you know Jesus. Dude, are you ready? I didn't realize it was going to be a fucking novel. Yeah. It's deep. It's deep. Listen. He has some stuff to get off his chest. Sounds like it. Shit, dude. I don't know if we got time to read all that. If you guys haven't caught on yet, Andy is getting all his info directly from a Trump admin, meaning literally anything he's providing is literally propaganda being used. Nothing more than another tentacle of the J's grab. Wait, notice his body language and how he starts to trip over his words when the J question pops up. DJ brings up when they kiss the wall. Andy. Well, wait a minute now. Oy, they that's too much noticing. Don't let Andy convince you that this almost 10 year old Obama problem that should have been addressed during Trump's first term is nothing more than a smoke screen and a nothing burger to distract the fact that our country is and has always been occupied by the tiny hats. Well, I don't I don't I don't think that any of that that he's saying here is things that we haven't addressed. Mm-hmm. You're just haven't been listening consistently. Yeah, you must be new. And by the way, I will never generalize an entire race of people because I don't believe that that's correct. I've met people from all different kinds of races and religions who didn't represent the stereotypes. And I think every single person that is a free thinker and a critical thinker would agree with that. We've all met people who were we were told were bad people belong to this group who are actually really good people with good hearts. And you know, you have a Latino name Carlos Hernandez. And you know, let's be real. There's a bad Latino reputation in terms of crime in terms of a lot of things that people don't like. But you don't see me going and saying all Latinos are fucking criminals because they're not because I have a lot of friends that are Latino. Just like I have a lot of friends that are Jews. And I'm not going to be someone just because it's popular to say that it's all Jews to say that. Because I don't believe that that's the truth. What I do believe this truth, which I've said many, many times on the show, is that there is a group of criminals who are at the top of the power structure up Israel who claim to be Jewish who then hide behind all the other good Jewish people that, you know, quite honestly. A lot of these people have no idea what the fuck is going on, bro, because you know what, not all Jewish people are rich and wealthy and have all this privilege. There's people just like you, just like me, they're having to be Jewish that are out here trying to make the fucking way in the world. And I don't think it's fair to wrap those people into it by saying it's all Jews because what that does is creates a modern mentality that when society breaks free, people start attacking any single person that belongs to that group. And that's not okay. All right. So allow them to continue to fucking correct defense. That's what I'm going to get to. So Carlos, what you got to understand, bro, is that when you say it's all the Jews, you are perpetuating their intentional defense mechanism where they cannot be identified. Okay, because that is an easy thing to point at Carlos and say, he's a fucking anti-Semite. He hates all Jews. And then how the fuck are you going to defend that because you're saying it. All right. When in reality to get to get regular people to understand what's going on, you have to name names and you have to understand what's going on. So don't think that I don't fucking see exactly what's going on. I've communicated it directly over and over and over again for fucking years long before you ever started listening to this mother fucking show, bro. So I don't have any problem with what he said. My problem is is that you're not fucking listening. And you're not understanding that when you do that, you play into their defense system because now they could say, look, look how crazy that guy is. He hates all the Jewish people. When in reality, look, dude, when the Italians were running all the fucking mobs, you know, and everybody said, oh, it's the Italian mafia. No one went out and attacked all the Italian people. But when you say, if you would have said it was all Italians, then people would have been attacking Italians in the street. I don't think that's right. That's not what I'm down with as a human being. As a man of God, I am not the best man. I am not the most holy. I'm just a regular dude out here trying to fucking be decent who sends a lot and has a lot of fucking problems. I don't think that it's right to generalize people like that. That's my personal fucking view. Do I think we have an infestation. As I think that's what he said, what do you say, infested country, been occupied? Do we have an occupant occupation of people who are dual citizens of Israel, who are criminals? Yes. So I'm not arguing with any of that. In fact, all of these things I've said I've said on the show for fucking years. So, um, you know, and as far as being a propaganda tentacle. Bro, you don't know nothing about me. I was rich as fuck before I even started doing this show. I don't need anything from anybody. I don't fucking need any money for anybody. Nobody has shit on me. And if they did, I'd say, yep, I did it. Okay, so I am ungettable when it comes to that. And yeah, I do talk to people in Trump's administration. I do talk to people in the secret service. You know why? Because they listen to mother fucking show. Okay. And I criticize Trump all the time. And it is what it is. If you don't fucking think that I'm aggressive enough, then turn the mother fucking channel. Yeah, go listen to someone who's going to fill your head full of fucking unreasonable propaganda. That's going to get going to confirm to you that it is all Jewish people. It is not all Jewish people. It's not. It's just fucking not. Is it is it criminals that happen to be Jewish? Yeah, there's also criminals involved that aren't Jewish. All right. So I don't know. And everybody can be mad at me or hate me whatever they want. I don't feel that that shit's right. I agree to do. Yeah. So, you know, and he says, uh, don't let Annie convince you that this all of most 10 year old Obama problem that should have been addressed during Trump's first term is nothing more. No, I did not just say that. I just say nothing's going to happen. Like I'm not like bro. Look, I can appreciate why you might say that. Because it's frustrating to be in a country where, you know, we have dual citizens of other countries, not just Israel, by the way, of any country operating our country. That's wrong. We should there should be no dual citizens of fucking Somalia. There should be no dual citizens of anywhere ever in American government. You should be a natural born citizen. And um, that's what I believe. So I think even that dual citizen saying real real quick. Like people always like to say, oh, look at the Talmud and it says this and this. Dude, do you understand there are different versions of fucking Jewish faith? There are different versions of Jews. There's not just all the same Jews. Half the motherfucking Jews in Israel hate Netanyahu. They understand what's happening. They understand that Netanyahu is innocent killing innocent people. They understand that they are creating. They are getting looped into it. They understand that they don't aren't safe when they go around Muslims anywhere anymore. They understand this. So if half the motherfucking country of Israel understands that, then how the fuck is it all Jews? Right. You see what I'm saying? I just think that's a very lazy conversation. I think it's intellectually lazy to fucking say that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, thanks Carlos. Yeah. If that I don't even think this is a real car. I don't think this car. I don't even see that as hate. I don't even see that as hate, bro. This frustration. That's what I see. I see he's frustrated with what's going on. You know, and dude, you know, it seems like every motherfucker out there is for sale. You know, it seems like everybody out there is being told what to say or not say. I could promise you the criticism that I give him causes me shit on the backside. You don't fucking understand. Okay. So, um, you know, don't think I don't get phone calls. It's actually the opposite of what he's saying. I get phone calls being like, why are you fucking saying that? Why could you be loyal to the world? This isn't about loyalty, bro. This is about what's right and fucking wrong for this country. So period, poo. Yeah. Guys, we appreciate you for being real. As fans though, keep liking the comedy. Like normally I'd make fun of someone like that, but like I, you know, yeah, he's fucking for we're all pissed about it, bro. But you can't run around and fucking hold people accountable that aren't fucking part of the problem. If you want to handle the problem, then everybody should be making a list of the fucking top 30 or 40 names and figure out who those people are and then understand that if you cut the head off of the fucking snake, the snake fucking dies. So and that shouldn't be that hard to do for all you internet sluice. Yeah, you know, that's real, man. Well, let's keep the cruise cruise and dude, we got a we got headline number two. Let's talk about France and some baguettes again. That's back in the news. Uh, you got Macron. Uh, they filed defamation suit against Candace Owens over Bridget trans gender claims. Regite. Does she have a baguette or not? Think about that one all night. I did actually. That's what I did rehearse. Man, a French president of manual Macron and his husband, uh, Bridget, Macron, a filed defamation lawsuit against American conservative commentator. Now Candace Owens over claims that the first lady of France was born a man. Now the couple of France filed a 218 page lawsuit in the US state of Delaware on Wednesday against Mrs. Owens and her businesses alleging that she has financially gained from making demonstrably false claims about Bridget, Macron being secretly transgender. Now Owens has previously stated that she would stake her entire professional reputation on the fact that Bridget, Macron is in fact a man while claiming that Macron was in fact her brother, Jean Michel Tragnol, um, and had assumed the identity of Bridget Marie Claude Traggzo after changing her gender. Um, and so in an in an statement to financial times, and Macron said, quote, because Mrs. Owens systemically reaffirmed these falsehoods in response to each of our attorneys repeated a request for a retraction. We ultimately concluded that referring the matter to a court of law was the only remaining avenue. Representing the pair, balls. Now that was on the spot. I represented the pair of balls. We could tell. Attorney Thomas Claire of the defamation focus, Claire Locke Law firm told the paper that both President Macron and his wife are willing to personally travel to Delaware to attend a trial in person to seek punitive damages against the American podcaster. Oh, let's see the wing. Let's see the lack of the wing. Let's see it. Yeah. I don't want to see it actually. We are determined. Make it gay. Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's right. Um, I won't save it though. I'll see it. Don't I won't save it. You're a glance. Yeah. So this is what you're obviously this is, uh, you know, being talked a lot about on the online right now. Now, uh, she did, you know, the McCroms did just losing court in France over the same exact thing. Um, yeah, it was on appeal. Okay. So there is a difference between that case in this case. Okay. The difference is is that they were not doing it according to the court in a malicious fashion. All right. So that wasn't malicious. And this with candid soons is malicious. That's what they're saying. And financial gain. Yeah. I mean, we're doing well. Yeah. So okay, this is Candice's clap back. Look, bro. Okay. Go ahead. Yeah. I just want this is what Candice has to say about all of this. This is, uh, she's not going to be intimidated back. Oh, no. Yeah. Oh, no. Check this out. You were born a man and you will die a man. That's the point I'm making. So give us a sample. I'll send my doctors to take your blood, figure it out real quick. However you want to go about this. Hey, how about just giving us some pictures again of you growing up, um, you know, raising your children. That would be fine. Whatever reason to phone, by the way, like I said, we'll get to the bottom of it. All right. That is what discovery is for. I'm going to ask a lot of questions. You're probably hoping, Oh, you know, which this will go away. And these will say we sued her. We'll say we went after her. You know, she'll probably fly over this to get dismissed. I'd like to make it to discovery. I think that, uh, we owe that to the world. Anyway, you guys, we are revolting against this. We are voting against the perverts that run the world. And I want to be very clear here. I count you among them. I think you're sick. I think you're disgusting. And I am fully prepared to take on this battle on behalf of the entire world. Okay. That's what I'm going to say on behalf of the entire world. I will see you in court. Yeah. I mean, I didn't expect anything different. Dude, and I, I bet you she's right. I'm I listen, man. I like Candice. I think she's I think a lot of people don't like her. I think she does her homework. I think she makes clear arguments. I think she makes a lot of sense. And I have not yet seen her. Cover a story, no matter how controversial that wasn't actually true. You know, so I don't know. I'm on team Candice here, bro. And I think 100 percent what she said is true. I think these these are fucking quote unquote royalty elites. And they they they expect to Candice to get this letter in the mail. And you know, get terrified. And backtrack or comments. And this and that. I would fucking don't see it happening, bro. No, I don't think Candice. I want to someone that can be intimidated. No, but I also see too. Like I mean, like I've gotten the chance to meet Candice. We talk. Yeah. Um, I also see her super fucking gracious and nice and person. Very nice. But I'll like to that point. I also see her as being the type of person that like, no, okay, they get to discovery and like does come out that she has a split, you know, whatever. And she is a woman. Candice coming. All right. I was wrong. Yeah. Okay. I agree with that. You know what I'm saying? Like she's not going to, you know, so I don't think she's wrong, though. I don't think because dude, where are these pictures? And where is the brother? There's not one picture of her. Where's the brother before she was 31? Where's the brother? Yeah. Well, I mean, like, and this is one of the, the pics that that comes up all the time. So you got Bridget on the left. And apparently also Bridget on the right. All right. All right. Look, dude. It's possible that those are brother and sister 100%. But where the fuck is the brother? Where is he? Do, do, can you look up where the brother is? Where's, where's the actual brother? Yeah. Like, where are the pictures of her raising her kids? Okay. And let's be real, dude. She's weird looking. Yeah. Like, and I don't, I'm not trying to hate on someone's looks. I don't like that. We all look a little weird. But to me, she does not look like a woman. She looks like a little gay man. Rest in one. Okay. And also, I want to say this too, though. I feel like that's also the bigger, the bigger problem that I personally have. The age gap between this relationship and how that relationship came to be. No, that she's a creep. It's a creepy thing. It's a mass. No, that like bro, like, what's it? Yes, what's it? Yeah, it's predatory grooming. It's the fucking exact same shit that we all talk about here over and over and over again. Dude, it's not, it's not cool. I have this other clip. I think this is, imagine me in 47 years old and having to fucking like, like, let's do some present in France, bro. Right. The, the fucking country of love, bro. Yeah. And you got to fucking walk around with her. That's him. That's the best you could do. In France. That's the best. Fucking gross. Dude. Oh, I don't know. You know, she's not some wonderful sweet person. She fucking punched them in a face. Bro, there's something deeper here for real. For sure. Yeah. That comes out. She's connected somehow to this fucking, this is my speculation. She somehow connected in this cabal that runs the world. The fucking Roth trial, quote unquote, whatever fucking bullshit we got going on. Them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that's the other thing too that's weird about all of this is because the, the levels that these people went to like get Candace to stop talking about all of this. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, there was talks about this five million dollar fucking payment and fucking, you know, all these things. He also, and this is what in this clip, but apparently, my crone was willing to hold off fucking peace and shit to get Candace to stop. Okay. If that were true, then why would you do all of that? Why wouldn't you just sewer up front? If you, yeah, you're 100% right, dude. They've escalated all the options. Yeah. I'm going to withhold peace in Ukraine. Yeah. Right. Trump, you need to call her and tell her to shut the fuck up. And then they go back to suing that would have been the first thing. Yeah. That's right. That would have been the first thing. And so, dude, what that tells me is that they've exhausted all the options. And this is the only one they have left to like intimidate. Mm-hmm. And it's not going to work. Yeah. No. Let's check this clip out. Okay. Dude, they'd be better off. Like just fucking never talking about again. Yeah. President Donald J. Trump, he is calling me. He tells me that Emanuel Macron is requesting to his face. I stopped speaking about his wife. I said to him, you know, respectfully, Mr. President, it's not my fault that he merits someone with a peace. As a look, I'm happy to do this for the short. Obviously, I don't want to have on my conscience that less Christian men could have died in the east if I just shut up about something. You're telling me you could negotiate to end a war, but you need a podcast or to delete a video. That doesn't sound like you're leading on behalf of your people. By the way, close to a million guys have died or been maimed in this war. White, Christian, Orthodox men at the head of a non-Christian leader. What religion is he? Yeah, dude. It's not here, man. I don't know. We shall see. Like I said, the file, the suit has been filed and we find the brother. It says she has two brothers. One of them is deceased. 2018. The other one lives in a place called Amiens. Rorx and a family chocolate legacy. I cannot find a lot of photos. Is there any photos of her and the brothers? Her and both brothers? Do there's no pictures? Isn't that kind of weird of her prior to being 31 before the age of 31. It doesn't exist. Then they tried like I saw this picture. They also came up. It was like a young girl. They tried to say, oh, this was Brigitte, but it actually turned out that was actually a daughter. You know, I'm saying, dude, it's just weird. It's some weird shit, man. I don't know, man. I don't know, but I have faith in can this weird immediately is that her hair is always the same. It's no, it's always the fucking exact same to weak for sure. That's what I'm saying. If that were the most women changed their hairs here and there and sometimes do something. Yeah. Even if you don't change it, you can't keep the same all the time. I know. And it always looks exactly the same with the bangs and everything. Yeah. Yeah, man. Guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know if there's a bad get there with that being so let's get to what they're what do you think? Oh, bro, come on. What I think? Yeah, she she she was rocking. She had one. There's no doubt. She had one. Yeah, I agree. She she at some point. That's my guess. I believe she was born a man. She cut it off at the age of 33. No, I don't know. That did they even have that available then? Fuck yeah, brother. They were doing it in the fucking Vine Mar Republic. I know that, but like it was like mutilation straight up, right? She's fucked up. So you think she's got a fucking like fucked up thing for sure. For sure. You don't think she just kept the thing. Here's what I don't understand. Like if you're a trans person and you know, like you read on the internet, like these people lose all sexual sensation and that sounds as nerve damage. Yeah. Yeah. Then why wouldn't you just keep the fucking meat? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, like you can't fucking have sex, bro. Mm-hmm. Every again. And then they go on fucking Reddit and they're like, I have never I have not felt anything. No shit. Did you read all the fucking other ones? Like did you think you were going to be the different one? Yeah. Do you you think they were going to dig a hole in between your legs and you were going to be able to fucking come? Like, have you have you read any that say that you can? Because I have not. And why is it that you can't find that many pictures of the before and after surgeries on the internet? You know why? Because they fucking know that if people saw it, they'd be like, what the fuck? Mm-hmm. Well, that's it's no different. So different between now and what was going on then. I mean, it was the same probably same doctors. I don't know. Yeah. But I'd be curious to know you guys' thoughts, man. Let us know down in the comments. Let me set our final headline. headline number three. I don't want to talk about this. We and and and tactfully here. You know, but we haven't touched this conversation in a while. The Russia Ukraine, right? Cool. But I had to issue with this because I saw, you know, the set line reads dozens injured, including child and Russian strikes using new type of bomb being tested on civilians. You know, the headlines are there. I know the US. We sent some more money there, right? And right now there's like this big battle over the Black Sea, Russia, Ukraine, they strike resort cities and all of that stuff, right? And I'm seeing I'm seeing all of that stuff, right? But I have a hard time like giving any light to any of, you know, the Russia Ukraine situation is terrible as it is. You know, but there's some there's another big thing that nobody's really talking about. And we got to go to Gaza. Gazans are dying of starvation. They're in a stage five stage five starvation right now. And nobody's talking about it enough at least main streams not talking about it. And this report just came. Why is mainstream not talking about it? No, they can't talk about it. Why can't talk about it? Because who pays the checks? That's right. I mean, they can't talk about it. Yeah, you know, and it's like, but this report just came out that Israeli soldiers were ordered to shoot unarmed Gaza eight seekers. And so that's going into it. And like, I mean, basically what you have happening, you have these, these trucks right now the main way into the Gaza strip because obviously it's not coming from Israel is going through Egypt, right? But Israel is not allowing any of those aid trucks to get the the past, the green light to actually go into the strip. And then those few that do make it into the strip, the IDF, so it just starts shooting and throwing grenades at those trucks to which nobody wants the trucks anymore. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, that, you know, that's the that's the one side of the story, which I believe, by the way, the other side of the story is Netanyahu was telling everybody on the NELK boys, yeah, that Gaza's leaders were hijacking the trucks and then selling the food and letting their own people starve, which nobody believes nobody believes it. Okay. So yeah, it's interesting. So they make a report, you know, of one two two kids getting killed in the Russia, Ukraine, right? That'll make the headlines immediately. Oh, yeah, that's out there. But, you know, not the 50,000 plus children that have died in Gaza or any of this shit about start letting them start, bro, listen, it's crimes against humanity. Fucking is what it is. There's a reason that the entire fucking Muslim world hates Israel. Yeah, but it's not because they're the ambassadors of peace. It's not because they're walking around being good neighbors and it's not there's a reason. And then they will they will make us on the other side of the world. They will try to convince us that, you know, oh, well, the Arabs are just savage people and this, that's not true. It's not fucking true. Okay. So, and nobody's buying this shit, dude. No, no, and you know, you dive into a little bit more. By the way, any of the soldiers doing this shit over there, they are with the fucking criminals. So, yeah, yeah. Yeah, but you know, it's interesting when you just look at the timeline. Again, I know we've talked about it and brought it up a few times, but it's like, you know, all of those fucking people, they all have international criminal court arrest warrants for for for them. Netanyahu included as the top one and a bunch of people, and there's some homos officials there too for sure because like, yeah, that's something, you know, there's bad on both sides for sure. You know, but the thing is, it's like this court that Netanyahu is supposed to, you know, be going to he keep skipping the fucking courts. He keeps skipping it. And apparently, there was some big protests and stuff going on in Israel over the last few days about this issue because this is like, that was like the fourth court appearance, fourth or fifth one that he's, he's missed. Look at this shit, you know, but like two years ago, bro, these motherfuckers living in their house, you know what I'm saying? Now look at the fuck look at this fucking shit that they've created there. Bro, dude, if that, like if you can look at that and not feel like it's wrong, there's something fucking wrong with you, dude. But dude, so so uh, Randy fine. Okay. Dude, the guy who's been saying kill them all and all kinds of crazy ass shit. He just he just posted this tweet, released the hostages until until then starve away. So maybe fucking Randy fine needs a starve away. You fat motherfucker. And that was from his congressional like his congressional fucking 600 fucking pound lady fucking arms. He's got you know, them arms are really feckin fat people, bro. Yeah, like like like like real big. Yeah. Yeah. And they like hang down. Mm-hmm. Usually it's a sign that they can cook really well. So many should kick that dude's fucking fat ass fucking fupa real talk, bro. That guy never has ass kicked. That's why he talks to crazy shitty talks. They sick shit, man. Oh, you fucking only like Republicans. No, I don't because I fucking don't like that guy. Mm-hmm. No, it's insane to me, man. It's insane. So I mean, we'll see I'm trying to look and see like when the next court date was supposed to be scheduled. Look, bro, by sheer numbers, look, this is why it's important to not generalize entire groups of people. Okay, because in sheer numbers, there's only one way this ends. There's only one way this ends. And it's going to end with the entire world coming down on fucking Israel. And it's hard for me to believe that they don't know that that's what's going to happen. And so meaning, I think he's going to sacrifice a whole bunch of his own people to create a situation of, you know, look what they do to Jews. Why? Okay, you know, you got really fine saying, oh, well, Jews have been kicked out of 109 countries. Why? We never hear why? Why? Dude, well, going back to even our understanding. I want to like why? Like, follow that stick, keep going. Jews have been kicked out of 109 countries because, fill in the blank. And that blank is not, oh, just people fucking hate Jews. Right. It's because the people running that group of people operate under a certain fucking world view that it's not compatible with the rest of the people. When you walk around earth for history saying, we're God's chosen people and everybody else is fucking goyem shit. Eventually, the goyem shit is going to say, oh, really? And that's what's going to happen here again, because there's 14 to 20 million Jews worldwide. There's three and a half billion Muslims. And then there's everybody else and everybody else is starting to fucking not like them too. Oh, yeah, do that. That's why I was going to say, going back to our talks earlier, bro, there's been a lot of traction with this, with like the Christian crusaders row coming back. I know. And like, we'll just go in and handle it. Yeah. And they'll be peace. I don't know if that's true, because, you know, Christians have adopted this mentality of turning the other cheek and let people do whatever you want. And never be violent. Jesus flip fucking tables over, bro. Okay. Like, there is a room for Christianity to defend Christianity. Whatever that looks like. Defend humanity. Am I? Yeah, dude. And it's not, it's not just, dude, if you just let people fucking turn, you turn the cheek, you're a turn your cheek into extinction. That's it. Yeah. You know, and unfortunately, you know, that's that's the mentality of most Christians. And I don't think it's, I don't think it's a good one. No. I'm gonna tell us what you think, man. Let us know down on the phone. I think it's good in certain situations to turn the cheek. Yeah. Yeah. I think I think it, you know, when, when you know that you've done some shit, and then that same shit happens to you, sometimes you gotta say, okay, well, that was my turn. Or that's what happened. Or that's the, you know, that's the way it goes. I have to turn the other cheek. You know what I'm saying? I'm guilty of those things, too. Or someone does something to you. There's certain things that are unforgivable. There are certain things that aren't supposed to be forgiven. There are certain things that are supposed to be condemned. There's certain things, and one of those things is standing up for children. And one of those things is to protect the people who are Christians from being fucking exterminated by any means, okay? Meaning, if they are trying to exterminate people through death camps, you gotta do something. If they are trying to exterminate people by breeding the religion away, you gotta do something, okay? There's all different ways to extinct races and religions of people. And they've all been done over the course of history. But you'll never, you'll never make any progress with Christianity until people wake up and realize that it is not about standing by and letting evil do evil shit. It's just not, you're not a good fucking Christian. If you do that, I don't care what anybody says. I don't care. If I had a son and my son let everybody walk all over them, spit on them, shit on them, and then eventually kill them because he just sat there and took it. That's a weak son, period, okay? And if you guys all believe that you're the, the sons and daughters of Jesus, I can promise you, I, you know, I can't promise you, but I would suspect that there are certain situations where doing the right thing supersedes certain other assumptions about a religion. And every religion operates that way. So yeah, dude, I think we're long overdue for some Christian resistance at a better minimum. Yeah. Guys, jumping on this conversation, man, let us know what you want. If you want to get hyped for it, go watch Kingdom of God. Kingdom of heaven. Yeah, Kingdom of heaven. Yeah, we're right in there with you guys. Do we have terms with my outfit? As I'm saying, dude, I'm ready for the fucking outfit, bro. Okay, get the horse. It's gonna be an awesome soundtrack. Well, be sick. Yeah, be sick, man. Yeah, with that being said, man, let's get to our final segment of the show as always guys. We have thumbs up or dumbest fuck.
