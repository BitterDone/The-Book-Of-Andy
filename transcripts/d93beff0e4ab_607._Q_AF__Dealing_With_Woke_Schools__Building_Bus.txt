trying to do it with the little kid it's it's difficult yeah because she she makes it very hard yeah but uh we we survived and getting ready for the Christmas spirit man cool yeah we put Christmas lights on our house first time ever yeah first time I ever did that it was wild seeing it yeah all right yeah I like it though it looks good yeah man you know like the more the more I realized that they're trying to erode typical American customs uh and replace it with nothing and to moralize our country the more important I realize it is to participate in our actual holidays uh and that's really like what maybe say dude we need we need to do this yeah you know it's not happy holidays it's fucking Merry Christmas very fucking Christmas I'm saying I'm not playing around with these people no more so I put up pretty good amount of Christmas lights on my uh on my on my humble about looks like a fucking land yeah yeah well Clark Gridswald actually like black hawks and shit can see it when they come over anyway yeah she dude every helicopter in St. Louis flies over my house but it's for noise fuck yeah I know they're doing it because it's like it's a cool property I know that guy down there oh no it's a it's a cool property I mean it's a it's a compound but like bro you helicopter pilots here in St. Louis flying over my house all the fucking time gets old let's stop doing it assholes I remember looking into doing the FAA blackout thing on you we should do that it's difficult well we should do that it's fucking annoying it happens a hundred times a day yeah anyway lights look good though man yeah they get lights look good so uh they're nice what no nothing no the man those guy guys have good questions for you though let's get into these guys Andy question number one uh Andy I recently got an email about an ecology meeting in an alpha-back club and my daughter school she's in eighth grade and this is what they want to shove down her throat I want to handle it the right way I have a bad temper especially when it comes to idiots but how should I go about approaching this situation personally I'd like to go down and slap the shit out of everybody at the district but I know that that isn't going to help any advice I don't know what would you do your parent yeah I mean I'm gonna tell you this if I had kids they wouldn't be going to school place like that yeah they just wouldn't be I would do whatever I had to do to make sure that they're not in that environment they're not being shoved down and having forced upon them political ideologies or gender ideologies or any of other sort of shit yeah it isn't true okay like we this is the problem with gender ideology that people do not talk about enough all right they say oh just be polite and cater to these people well the problem with that is that what you're asking us to do is to deny what we know is fact and reality and when we deny what we know is fact and reality we lose confidence and trust and belief in ourselves it erodes away so you're asking us to play make believe with this concept which isn't actually true which destroys our own understanding of what truth is and then on the flip side when we cater to calling people a girl when they're a boy and vice versa and telling them that can be whatever they want we're conditioning our kids to believe that the world will bend and and be manipulated to their will at any given time and that's just not the way it works and so it actually hurts both sides and it's not a bigoted thing it's an actual truth thing that we should come to terms with the reality of what it is it's not it's not being mean okay like if you want to be a cross-dresser or you want to pretend to be a woman and that's your life then cool but like asking everybody else to pretend and asking everybody else to go along with it is actually disrespectful because what you're doing is you're asking them to lie to themselves which destroys their own belief their own confidence and their own self-esteem so it's harmful in other ways and when we do this with little kids who are very young they grow up with this all right so personally if I had kids there's zero fucking chance at all that they would be in an environment like that ever and and and I understand that's hard and I understand some of you guys might have financial limitations but that's why it's important to become financially successful that's why it's important to make a lot of money so you have fucking options okay so I would say like I mean my my question would be is how many other parents in that school do you know where where's the parent community at because I would be willing to put money that you're probably not the only parent who has concerns about this so I don't know maybe a you know pick up or drop off they'll start talking to other some other parents we could get a get a little community going because there's going to be strength of numbers if you go by yourself the probably laugh you out the fuck there are strength in numbers but that's why they that's why they've bullied people into submission and made them believe that being part of the quote unquote silent majority is some sort of noble thing yeah the reality is is that they have very intelligently stifled any sort of resistance through bullying and shame so they have culturally conditioned people to not speak up so you have grown adult parents where the vast majority of them agree with you and me and what we're saying not saying anything because they're afraid to rock the boat but if they go just talk to the other parents they figure out that they're all in the same team and they could actually get something done but ultimately bro this comes down to courage this comes down to not being a fucking bitch this comes down to standing up and say I don't care what you guys think call me whatever name you want say whatever you want but I'm not going along with this shit and neither should you and we should all work together to do that that's how you handle those situations but that takes courage and right now there's a lot of people that don't have courage because they've been bullied for the last 10 years and you know how many people do we hear from let's say you know oh man I love the show I wish I could say that stuff but I don't want to rock the boat bro if you don't start rocking the boat there's going to be no boat left to right in that's the that's the reality that we have to come to yeah I think people also need to realize too it's like you know you talk about you know this is why cancel culture in reality doesn't really work because the people who are trying to cancel don't have the pying power right and the same thing goes to schools bro like if you look in if you look at the data the the percentage of or the number of kids being homeschools gone up private schools going up right like schools that are not going with this stuff and so these schools they're going to be faced with no choice but to respect the wishes of parents because when those parents start taking them kids out of the schools those schools shut down right and so like I mean I don't know I would say get get with your parents man like like get a community it may you know if you're afraid of going in by yourself try with five of the parents be afraid of what are you afraid of that's what I'm saying like hold on I'm trying to understand this what are you afraid of what are you what are you afraid of you're afraid of someone who you don't respect who you disagree with who you don't want to be who you don't admire in any way shape or form calling you a name right you're afraid of it yes that's just a name you're afraid of someone who completely is interfering in your ability to raise your child the way that you want to raise it and they feel entitled to do so and you have zero respect for these people and what they do and how they do it but you're afraid to speak up against them that means you're the problem not them you're the problem if you're if you're looking for permission granted go do it it's not about need permission dude it's about understanding like if you don't speak up if you don't stand up for your kids they're going to get indoctrinated into this shit and then what who failed them then you did so this is something that you have to take responsibility for and start to understand and be a grown up like if you have kids you have a duty stand up for what you believe is right and wrong whether that be in the grocery store whether that be on the playground whether that be in the school system wherever it is and we have a bunch of people who are afraid to be called something because that whatever I don't know why dude it's so funny I was taking my own to school yesterday morning and or last last week a couple of days ago I was taking it to school and walking out the door and she's at the stage where like she knows like girl boy she got it right and she knows that she's a girl she knows that is a boy right she got it and we're walking out the house where it's like daddy I'm a girl I'm like yep you sure are and you will always be yeah and like it's like and I said it like it happened I said it so quickly and then I'm like that's it like why am I even having to say this right yeah because you have a bunch of people that shouldn't who that shouldn't even be educators who feel somehow entitled to teach people's children things that the parents don't want taught and then when confronted on it they say those are our children we have a right to teach them that know the fuck you don't and so dude until we get some some real parent pushback this is going to continue to all those people to do that gender ideology and this pushing of sexual they should be fucking eliminated from the school system yeah 100% they should not be educators no no we our educators should be preparing our kids to go out in the real world and and be able to survive and what they're doing is the opposite of that they're creating a scenario where our kids think that if they go out and they throw enough of a tantrum the world will bend around to them and then we wonder why these kids go out in the world today we have so many young people that are of the age around 19 2021 who are ineffective in the real world and then what do those people do and you have to think about the bigger agenda is the why they want that why why would they want an entire generation of people who cannot fucking be effective in real life well because if they're not effective in real life that means they have to be dependent on the government and this is how they maintain control and you guys think it's about being polite or inclusive it has nothing to do with that but they tell you it's about yes it has nothing to do with that it has to do with them stay and the people teaching it they believe it's about being inclusive they believe it's but they're called useful idiots if you read any book about communism that's what these people are called so yeah the worst part about it is like you know the yellow to you oh you know be be inclusive be tolerant but yet we get zero tolerance or inclusivity correct on the back end correct so it's like at that point it's over yeah it's over this is supposed to be a win-win situation it's it's not it's not about that if you if you if you say anything to them it's bullying but they have no problem bullying you at all they'll call you every single name though they'll try to cancel you with their Facebook groups they'll try to put you on blast they'll bully the fuck out of you as long as you stay quiet so it's time to bully them the fuck back that's where the fuck we are that's real shit it is time to bully the people back that's where we are and I'm not apologizing for it because I've warned about this for for almost 10 years like we have to stand our ground and we cannot give an inch of fucking ground to these people anymore that's the answer so your answer is be a responsible parent be a leader for the children stand to fuck up like a grown adult like you are stop being a pussy love it that's the answer man that's it man guys Andy question number two Andy how do you build sales and a customer base in today's world via social media while living a private life a lot of famous and successful people online have everything online for everyone to see their house their wife their kids cars property you are the only one that I know who has really kept people away from the intricate details of your life I currently have built a successful business and I want to go further but it just seems all business owners are just sharing their whole life to gain a customer I'm a very private man with a wife a daughter who's never posted on the internet I want to push further and harder on social this year I just don't want to lose my privacy so how do you build social media without letting the internet fully expose every aspect of your life privacy is the cost that you pay to get where you're trying to go on social media you are the product your life is the product and yes while I have been able to be more private the last few years there has also been a cost to that because my Instagram page could be at 10 million followers or 15 million followers and my YouTube could be at multi million followers have I have been showing my life the whole time so we have to understand the reality I started in this of 2012 on social media all right so that means I've been doing it for 12 years what is that 11 years 12 years in a month okay I only stopped posting in 2020 so that means for eight years I did all the shit that you're saying you don't want to do which built my brand to a point where I have a loyal following and now my content comes from what I have to say and how I think not people observing my life but if you've noticed I have started to do a little bit more showing my life why do you think I've done that do you think I'm doing that because it's bad for my brand I'm not doing that because I think it's fun and cool it's not listen here's real talk I am having fun doing it and I do think it's fun and cool but getting me to the point to do it I did not think that okay I had a lot of friends around me who convinced me that that was something that was probably a good idea and one of the friends we talk about the Hermosi's a lot they're great people but Alex and Layla came they were here visiting and we were in a locker room and Layla said to me hey look dude I love your content I've been listening to your content since 2015 when you started it she's like the reason I think you should show more of your life is twofold one because when I was consuming your content and you're talking about going hard and working hard and paying the price and all these things that you talk about I felt like that was all you did and when I couldn't live to that life I felt like I was failing so that was the first thing that made me realize man I need to show people a little bit more right and and the second thing was is that I have a number of younger people who come to me and they say you know dude like anytime I post like cars or my success or anything like that like that's not I'm I don't that's not my cup of tea bro I like I like that stuff because it's me I don't like that stuff because I'm trying to get more clout and that's why I have one of the nicest car collections on the planet that never gets seen nobody's ever seen yeah so um but I realized that when I do show those things I get a lot of feedback from like the younger generation where they're saying man like dude I'm so glad you show this stuff because it makes me believe that what I'm doing now will be worth it and so what I've started to realize is that I have a responsibility I used to believe this I you and I know this is true that I have a responsibility to show my success because of the inspiration that it provides okay but then the internet got so fucking douchey all right where I felt like I was one of them when I was showing my life so I stopped doing it but what I realized now is that all that's left is a bunch of fake ass shit and no real shit so why do you think I'm doing day in a life so you guys can see what it looks like and I'd guarantee you and I could say this without a hesitant of a doubt there's not a single mother fucking social media influencer on the fucking planet that has the life that I have not a single one there's a lot of guys that pretend to have a cool life they might have a decent house and they might got a you know a car or two or maybe they're doing this or that but they don't they don't have it all bro they don't have companies they run like let's see some of that from these influencers right it's like there's a lot of bullshit out there at my point and so I've I've started a bit become more aware that I have an obligation to show what it really looks like which is far cooler than any of these guru dumbasses are showing you anyway yeah cool you got you got one car that you financed out your ass for by my shit right like you guys don't even know what real baller shit looks like because none of these motherfuckers that you follow are real ballers can't do it no that makes sense that makes sense let me so let me actually this and then follow up to this so what does that look like what what's the relationship between the personal authentic Andy brand when it comes to business like how do those is that like a symbiotic relationship right because if you have an increase the eyeballs on you what what what should this person be expecting well you have to realize that like dude you have a lot of different options there's plenty of business owners that aren't public but they use their marketing budget properly to use influencers to to leverage their following and their privacy on the brand but the reality is is if you don't have a big budget and you don't have cash flow you got to kind of make yourself into that to get leads in the beginning or you're going to have to come up with a creative way to you know figure out how you're going to get business and there's a number of ways that you can do that but social media is free and it takes you know a little effort but less effort than what it would take less money than what it would take for you to go out and try to work with all these influencers so having a strong personal brand is a huge advantage because of that but it's also a huge advantage because if you can build a good one then other influencers traditionally want to work with you like they will look at this your personal brand let's say yeah I want to be associated with that right and so now with somebody faceless yes yes it's easier to get the most influential people to associate with you when your strong your brand is strong so like having a strong personal brand is a big deal and like yeah you could say I love my privacy and I love this I do too but here's the real I could continue to be private and just be fine you probably can't that's reality and if you can and you want to go ahead but that's going to take cash flow that's going to take money invested in other social media influencers that's going to take a different kind of marketing and advertising but the reality is is there's very few situations in fact I can't think of any where a strong personal brand isn't extremely valuable to what you're trying to do so the idea that you know I can empathize with that like I don't like showing a lot of my life like I really like I would love to but like I feel like I get tossed in with all these goobers right and they're just not my it's just not like it makes me feel gross yeah and so I don't do it but I'm starting to do it in different way you know because I feel obligated and and it's actually pretty fun so I think you know another upside to what you're saying is is like I think if you actually stepped out and started doing it you might have some fun but like real talk dude you know you haven't even started yet and you like think like your first three years are gonna suck dude like you're gonna get fucking two likes you're gonna get five views nobody's gonna comment on your shit and you're gonna have to keep doing it over and over and over and over and over and over like that happened to me like if you go back process yeah like you have to put in all this time like people think they can become a social media celebrity overnight but the reality is is that doesn't put asses and seats okay and asses and seats is what really matters what that what I mean by that is do people show up for shit that you do do people respond to a call to action do people buy your stuff do people you know translate from your brand into your your actual business brand and actually convert into paying customers and most of these people that you see online have a lot of fake shit and that's why they don't ever really convert okay so there's a big difference like you know like you know why when I show up to events there's fucking 7,500 10,000 people sitting there in a fucking arena well that's because I have a real fucking following that I invested in for 11 years now so you can't do it overnight it's no different than starting a business it's no different than starting it's so different than starting up a company dude you have to look at your personal brand as a real brand and that takes time it's just gonna take it's gonna take time yeah I love that man yeah I mean there's a lot of tips and tricks that you can use to do that you know you can you can start making some decent content and you can shuttle it out to people who who also make similar content and maybe they'll collab with you maybe you know like bro this takes effort this isn't just as simple as you know and we see yeah man and we see this because so many so many there's so much fake shit out there right so we see all these people doing all this stuff and they look real successful on the outside and these motherfuckers don't have you know two grand to rub together on the backside you know what I mean so we got to be real like social media you know you have to really like look into people to know if they're actually real or not and you know this is why I always tell you guys to vet people this is why I said you know like what companies do they own can you buy their products do they have employees how do they live how long have they been doing it what's their story you know can you be a customer of theirs like everybody else can you like evaluate how they do business like you know like look into this shit like because there's a lot of people out here that are fucking straight up lying they're straight up lying about everything they got going on and they're selling you some fucking bullshit so you know I love it I mean it's just a matter look it's like anything else it takes time it's hard as fuck you're gonna have to do it every single day and it's gonna have to become a big part of your actual initiative and the privacy part that's part of the price would how much privacy would you give up to get where you're trying to go that should be the question that you're asking how important is it to you yeah it's real man guys Andy our third and final question and question number three Andy I work in underground telecommunication construction say that three times fast but uh installed in fiber optic cable underground and I run a small crew of about two to four guys often my younger guys just can't seem to show up for work on time if at all uh it's a regular occurrence when we have big jobs to do every single man counts if one or multiple guys don't show up we oftentimes can't do the required work for the day and uh thus no ones making any money that day myself included my standards of expectations um I fired these kids but my boss says quote a warm body that shows up is better than having no one at all in my mind there has to be consequences to their actions um if they can't hang with the standards I said I'd rather not continually attempt to pull them along what advice can you offer or would you what would you do in my situation stand fast on your standards of excellence uh to your own detriment or losing work altogether um or just taking what you can get since someone who uh mostly shows up is better than not having them at all the fact that you the way you wrote the question is very insightful to what the problem actually is okay I can't seem to get him to show up what do you mean it's not an option you're either fucking here you're fucking fired like it's fucking real simple okay and here's the fact that you need to really answer is that you're being a shitty mother fucking leader by allowing these motherfuckers to drag down the rest of the guys that you have to be responsible for okay so when you're boss and you and I encourage you to go play this fucking clip for him when you guys fucking enable these people by allowing them to show up late allowing them to do bullshit work what you're doing is you're sacrificing the well-being of all the other people who are showing up every fucking day working their fucking asses off so you have an obligation to the people that you actually care about who are showing up there getting their fucking hands dirty getting in the fucking fight to do what you have to do to make sure that you have other people show up and do the work so uh no I wouldn't tolerate it and the fact that you've tolerated it so long has only sent it this is probably going to create a bigger problem for you that you haven't seen yet the fact is you've tolerated this and how long do you think it is before you're good guys are gonna start realizing that they don't have to show up okay not long no not long it doesn't take somebody to figure that out like if nothing's gonna happen to them then they don't have to do any work okay so eventually you gotta start chopping mother fucking heads off and this happens in every organization it happens usually in bursts okay usually there's one person and they got some pretty good reason and then you know the the the peers know that they're full of shit and then they start coming up with some good reasons and then all of a sudden it goes from having good reasons that not having reasons and they're still not showing up and now instead of one guy you got 10 guys that are doing this and guess what you got to do with all of them fucking cut them out it's what has to happen because otherwise that culture infects everybody else and now you got a real problem all right so my answer to this question is very simply stop tolerating you get what you tolerate that's what you're gonna get and when you sit here and say my standards or standards of excellence know they fucking aren't because you're tolerating less than that this is a you problem this is not a them problem this is you you are sitting here telling me on this show that you are a person of high excellent standards and and you care about the people no you don't because if you did you wouldn't allow that you wouldn't fucking allow it even one time it's not a standard of no being hey and like dude real talk like a lot of you guys need to fucking realize this you have people in your company right now that are ruining your ability to run your company and I don't know if you guys looked around but it's not getting any easier to run companies it's certainly getting a little more challenging okay so you have these people and this is a great this is the great thing about what's happening in the world right now there's a lot of bad things but this is the great thing there's a lot of companies laying off people who are highly skilled and highly qualified who are who these people are good what they're the good workers who have to be in a position where they don't have a place to work okay so all of your people that you're tolerating that don't do the work that don't fucking show up that don't really dig in and go to battle with you guys you you can cut those people right now and find people who will there's a lot of people out there that are looking to be a part of things that are that are going to you know work no so it's a good opportunity it's a necessity and if you don't do it your whole company's going to crumble your home little you know your boss who says oh just blah blah blah he's ruining his own share he doesn't even know it yet yeah he's just saying that because he don't have to deal with it right let me actually this and because I know you talked in the you know you you've said this often of you know people come in and ask like man where did you find all these people and your response is always we build them like we develop these people right so I mean do you think that this could also be maybe an issue with like the higher-end process or the standards that are setting up front or is it you know could it also be their their investments into these young people bro because I mean a lot of young people I don't know if this I think this is just a common issue with young people right now you know we talked a lot this ties back into the first question yeah when you train people for their whole lives that they can do whatever they want including decide to be a man or a woman at their own whim do you really think that they feel like they have to be at a job at any given time or do you think that the job will just say yeah it's okay you know you're gonna get the check yeah exactly so this is what you're dealing with yeah and this is what that listen this is our own fault does American citizens for allowing this shit to creep in okay we allow it we've allowed it we've allowed it it's been fucking years and years and years we've allowed it and now we're like well nobody wants to do shit well no shit if you never taught anybody that they have to actually go out and kill to survive what do you think's gonna happen when you tell them they got to go hunt and kill they're gonna say no I don't I'll just eat some of yours the fuck you will that's what they say that's what they think yeah and so you have to stop fucking feed them that's fuck yeah I love it man like bro I don't know what to tell you guys you guys are fucking hold the line say no cut them out do whatever you gotta do let them say whatever the fuck they're gonna say you'll continue on going and they'll go do something else and they'll do the same thing they're doing to you somewhere else better over there than here you know what I mean yeah yeah yeah dude you guys you know you can't say you're a leader with high high standards if you're tolerating people not showing up to work and then you say the job can't get done without those two people so that means that the job can't get done for the other two guys or the other three guys that are there counting on that to feed their fucking families and you're telling me it's you think it's the losers fault no that's your fault that's your fault you're a shitty leader you need to get better I love it man I fucking love it man guys and that was three yep I'll pay the fee doesn't know here shot case closed
