do the guru should ever down then oh yeah you know me sweet bear well listen let's uh let's get into this man let's make some people better today mid mid week drop of q and a f and uh let's start off with some some fire here um any guys question number one Andy I have an employee who has been with me since almost the start of my business she started four months after we opened the brick and mortar store we've been in business a little over two years after hiring her she quickly became a key member of our team she learned how to do all the jobs at our bakery coffee shop she was eager to learn and grow she became a good leader for our seasonal high school staff members we made her an assistant manager giving her a little more responsibility and a race um then last summer I could feel her falling off she quit putting in the extra effort and wasn't trying as hard we had a conversation around that uh where she told me that she quote uh felt that I no longer needed her and she quit trying to uh to which I told her that I felt uh I felt that and was I was very frustrated did still need her or somebody uh to be that second in line and help aid with all the things she was supposed to be doing after the conversation she improved back to original helpfulness that was last while now this winner uh in March she has approached me uh asking to only work four days a week going forward because she quote needs more time for herself uh this hit me in a really bad way because I've been working really hard on building out and expanding our little business so we can do uh serve more markets uh now I feel like I don't have someone to count on and help me build this out it's extremely frustrating and has left me feeling better and resentful towards her I know I can't expect anyone else to put uh in what I am putting into the business I don't uh but this whole situation has just left me feeling better and resentful towards her any thoughts how to move through this is this is something you you've experienced before so you're bitter and resentful because someone that you hired to help you and you relied on heavily didn't feel valued or needed and decided to spend their time other places who does it sound like is that the root of that problem because it ain't her all right and this is what happens when I talk about the the typical business entrepreneur who wants to come in on Tuesday and leave on Thursday and I understand you may not be doing that however at the very least you haven't been fostering the proper relationship and what it sounds like to me is that this person who was highly involved in getting your business off the ground has now realized that that's all they're ever going to be you're not making them a bigger part of the business you're not giving them extra responsibility you're not actually relying on them to help you grow to where there's a reward in that for them because in reality if you want people to stay with you there has to be some things that happen all right one they've got to progress in their career two and most importantly they have to believe in what you're doing and if you can't pay in a picture that's big enough to where that person's dreams fit underneath that umbrella that you're trying to create with your company that means they're going to lose belief and you as an operator cannot expect people to give up their dreams just because your dreams are your dreams so you have a responsibility as the employer to your key people to create a scenario where they can create the life that they want within the system or the operation or the business or the organization that you're creating and what it sounds like to me here is that you got it off the ground she was an integral part of what you did she probably feels like she was going to be a big part of the business you sort of coasted for a little bit she got bored all right meaning you didn't continue to grow fast and now she's detached from the business for whatever reason it sounds like you have a really good employee that might just need to be brought back in and talk to and explained like hey man you're a key part of this this is what's going on in fact I need you to do this and this and this would you be willing to come back in that extra day a week if I could give you this right so you have to understand dude just like you pointed out in your email just because it's your dream doesn't mean it's someone else's dream and if someone else doesn't see their dream inside of your dream it's a very high likelihood that they're not going to stay so you as an operator the best thing that you can do is to consistently paint a big vision consistently reinforce with your employees where their vision fits inside that vision and then consistently show them what they need to do to get to that point and if you can do that and then also accompany all of those clear communications and upward abilities and requirements for them to get there you also couple that with becoming their coach their personal development person the person who sits down with them and says okay here's what you need to improve you need to do this this this this this and this now you have someone who's fully engaged they understand the path that they're on they understand that you're going to teach them how to get there and that person is very unlikely to just bail on you all right what it sounds to me is and this is limited I could be wrong but it sounds to me like you had someone who was really bought in you got a little distance between you and that person they started to realize that you know or whether it's true or not they started to feel like this was just a position that was being filled by them and that's not what they expected what it sounds like they expected to me was for them to be working hand in hand with you to build a company which is a great thing and it sounds like that's what you want so what I would do is consider everything I just said sit down with a person have a real conversation and then use this as a learning lesson to not let people feel like they're not an important part of the mission that you're on when they you know that they are yeah so let me actually just I feel like that that's a misconception like you know going back I don't know you know if you look at how business was done 50 years ago right there is you come in you work and then I give you this little check that you can cash at the bank uh-huh right and it's a very cut and dry relationship and so now you know here we are in 2024 your business that that's it's not how that's a should be done anymore no most business still is done that way but when you're trying to grow and you're trying to be exceptional and you're trying to do something special it's going to require buy-in it's going to require passion it's going to require people who are committed to the purpose and something that's different about the younger generations now as opposed to the older generations then that you speak of is that people want to be inspired by a purpose they want a mission that's bigger than just collecting a check all right you can get a check anywhere but accomplishing a mission and being part of a mission and being part of a real purpose that does good things for people that's rare and that's a huge advantage for you as a business owner if you could figure out what that is and lean into that because not only will it inspire your employees but it will also help your customers get the most value possible from your brand your product your service which will drive revenue a lot of people like to say things like oh Gen Z's worthless millennials are worthless I don't know I built some pretty good companies with Gen Z and millennials and I can tell you this they don't want to just show up and get a fucking check they want to be involved they want to contribute they haven't really felt special anywhere else in their entire lives they come up through a school system that doesn't make them feel like they're anything special in fact it squashes their dreams and their hopes to try to get them to conform so when you really think about it the younger people it's not that they're lazy it's just that they want something better to do while they're getting paid they want to do something that matters they want to do something they're passionate about they want to do something that fulfills them in a mission not just getting a check so it's a generational difference and it's not common it's only common to you because you're around these business yeah right right right most companies just don't operate that way they do they say come in get you check go the fuck home leave me alone you're not going to get the best people to work for you there because the best people are no longer working for just money they're working for mission purpose and fulfillment yeah and so you have to figure out what that is for your business if you want to keep the best people so if you want to build a business that is going to be unannibalty changing lives you have to offer the employees more than just a paycheck is what you're saying yeah the person development yes yeah yeah yeah listen the idea of you guys hiring millennials Gen Z's people like that who are younger who have the skill sets you need who have the understanding of technology that the idea that you're just going to pay them and they're going to show up and give you their best work that's not in congruence with the way that they view the world they view the world as this is my opportunity to do something that matters I am going to trade my time for money and that's okay but I want the time that I trade for money to mean something I want it to matter I want to affect people in a positive way and too many of you guys that run businesses or manage people you totally leave that off the table and you expect motherfuckers to show up and work like you're going to work for a dollar they're not going to do that that's not going to happen you might get some people that are going to show up and get a check and go home but you ain't going to like those people and you're not going to like having to work for you because guess what they're not going to give a single fuck about what it is you're trying to do yeah that's so real man it's so real like I and I get this a lot you know when when people come in to even here at first one man they're like you know you got a lot you got an army here of people that are willing to run through brick walls but when you look at the all of the investments they get put in outside of just a typical paycheck right like it makes sense well they care yeah they care about what they're doing they want to contribute they want to build they want to be relevant they want to be a part of the team a lot of people who manage people they manage people with the perspective that these people are lazy and they don't want to contribute they don't want to do anything and that's how they treat their whole team but the reality is is people are not lazy people are just uninspired people it's not that people are apathetic it's that you haven't given them anything to care about so when you fix that in your leadership style that unlocks a whole new level for people to come in high quality people that are passionate who care who care about your customers who come in and drive revenue because the customer gets the most value out of those people then your company makes more money and those people make more money yeah so the amount of value that you deliver in a very literal sense is very very very parallel to how much you're going to get paid or how much company your company's going to make it's it's not it's there's no other secret than that if you over-deliver and you're the best and you do the best you're going to do the best in business and it's the same looking at yourself as a business within an organization if you're the highest skill if you're the best guy or girl if you deliver the most value you're going to make the most money and that's how it works yeah I love it I love it guys Andy guys question number two hey Andy my question for you is I'm a diesel mechanic and relief driver for a local fleet that does dust control work so this time of year is busy as hell to say the least my other job is a driver for another fleet my question is when you get bombarded with so much work you can't handle what do you recommend I do do I talk to my employer as it seems that you know they kind of let it go in one air and out the other I keep saying it's my bitch voice and I'm trying not to listen to it but I also work another local job and I have no time for rest lucky if I even get a few hours of rest and then he give a night and it's becoming unsafe especially operating rigs I guess what would you recommend to to do to keep the grind and run like a raped ape or should I tell I should I tell one of the two employees like employers hate my plates full I need to have it toned down so I'm being safe in my job I mean if they won't listen to what I have to say about my health and safety operating unit and I probably just don't belong there yeah what do you do when you get overwhelmed is that a is that a thing well first of all you got to make sure that you are overwhelmed and you're not just one of these people who's ineffective at what they do all right because most people will say oh my god I'm so overwhelmed I got so much work and then you look at them and they're not actually overwhelmed at all they're just completely ineffective at what they do they waste their time on the internet they scroll they watch movies they fuck around and because of that they feel overwhelmed because their shit piles up and they don't get any of it done not saying that's the case but that's what most people do so I would first check am I actually overwhelmed okay are you overwhelmed yes I'm overwhelmed how do I address that all right well we work on being more effective one all right because that will reduce the overwhelm but if it's actual overwhelm in terms of your workload and that's a real thing and you can be honest about it yeah you've got to say something especially when it has to do with your safety especially when it has to do with the quality of the work that's getting done because if you're doing lesser quality work just to do more work you're going to be seen as invaluable and this brings up a bigger this makes up a bigger aspect for people which is we have to understand that you can only work your way up the chain so hard all right at some point you have to start thinking how am I going to leverage my energy to get a more lucrative situation going for myself right like if you have to if you're a tattoo artist and you get paid for the amount of tattoos that you do there is an upper limit to what you can earn because at some point in time you're not going to be able to charge any more money and you can't do any more work so how do you make that into something that's lucrative well you have to think differently what could I do could I create some aftercare tattoo products could I create my own tattoo gun could I create this could I open up my own shops and do this or what you have to think about it differently so that you can leverage out your energy for more money so yes address the overwhelm but realize that if you stay in this situation where you're just burning yourself down and you keep saying grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind you're not going to get any more reward because there's only so much you can actually do all right so think about it what could you do what changes could you make that would not only reduce your overwhelm but increase the amount of money that comes to you or that goes into your bank account these are things that most people don't realize because they're so indoctrinated by the hustle culture that's on the internet which is work work work work work work 47 hours out of 24 we have two we have two extremes on the internet okay we have work 47 hours out of 24 and 10 days a week out of seven okay never fucking sleep ever that's one then we have the other one I can make a million dollars and five minutes for my bed with my dick in my hand okay that's the other extreme so the truth is where do you think the truth is somewhere in the middle the truth is in the middle okay you've got to expend your energy in an effective way and it has to be on a project that's going to produce money produce a result that you're looking for and you've got to figure out what those things are that's why the power list is such a valuable tool that you can get for free at episode 16 on the audio feed only it's such a valuable tool because it teaches you how to be effective and move forward without using all of your time and grinding yourself into dust which is counterproductive anyway so that's how I would look at that problem yeah let me actually this about the because you talk about the inner you know being inefficient right and it just came in my mind it's like you know if you're if you are good at something right and you've been doing something for 10 plus years right you should be pretty efficient you would think because you've like got the skills and and so does the input when you talk about the input like you don't have to put that you'd be more efficient is you're still putting in max fucking effort or does it will appear as if you understand what I'm saying yeah I do so in the beginning you don't have skills so you have to put in more effort okay and the more effort you put in the more time you put in the quicker your skills develop as time goes by your skill set goes up which means you can usually do more effective work in less amount of time all right so when you start it's effort effort effort low skill and as you get good you can get way more result with less less effort but these people that they don't really make the money it's the people who continue to work with the high skill and the high effort who out produce everybody else and end up winning and making the most money and becoming the most successful so yeah there's people who when they get skilled they tone down their work ethic and then they do okay they can make the same amount of money with less effort fine yeah but they never really get any better so the goal here for this show is for you to be the best that you can be so I would recommend that you put in as much effort as you possibly can and have as much skills you possibly can produce the best possible result that's what we do here we're the best possible result that okay not get by not settle right yeah I love it I love it guys Andy question number three hey Andy I'm 20 years old and I'm very curious to hear what your thoughts are on the fear of missing out or FOMO I look around and I see people my age graduating college and attending these big parties I've never been present at and obviously I feel like I'm only I'm not anti social or anything in fact I'm the opposite just wondering what your thoughts are on this please and thank you fear of missing out FOMO if you do what everybody else does you be like everybody else it's that simple when I was coming up through business all my friends were getting quote unquote real jobs and they were making 60 70 $100,000 a year and they were looking at me and they were saying when are you going to grow up we're out here doing this and they're going on these vacations and they're doing all these things and guess what I had to do oh I had to work seven days a week but guess what over the course of time that begins to change and now every single one of those motherfuckers into the exact same position they were in 20 years ago and I'm not and you know what happens when things like what's happening in the world now are happening where people are getting laid off do you know what they do they fucking call me and instead of saying when are you going to get a real job they say hey you think I could interview for your company you got any real jobs over there there you go okay so when you sit here and you watch all these people and they continue to go do all these things that seem to be super fun just realize that there's a cost to those things that you're not going to see until down the road all right right now you're looking at everybody and you're thinking fuck dude I don't get to do any of this shit they get to do it how all this fun blah blah blah blah blah blah blah yeah except you don't see them when you're 23 you don't see them at 40 or 50 all right I'm old enough where I see those people at 23 who laughed at me those people who were doing all this shit making me feel like shit what I was doing I now know what their lives are like at 40 years old okay and let me tell you it ain't that great and if you go ask any of them they'll say oh this is what I wanted because I'm a humble person this is all I needed yet if you go out and you put three beers in them they're gonna bitch about how much money they don't have and how they're in financial distress and how their marriage is fucked up because they don't have a way to fucking support everything though you can't do everything the wife wants to do and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and I'm like you know I'm saying they're looking I'm like I thought you said this is what you wanted you see what I'm saying so we have to as young people you guys have to understand yes people are gonna go out and do shit and it's gonna make you feel like fuck I should be doing shit too but those people are gonna end up in a place that you don't want to be and if you behave like those people and you listen to those people you will be those people that is the reality so many of you guys want to listen to your mom and your dad and your aunts and your uncles and your teachers and if you actually gave an objective visual scan of their existence you would realize they're broke they're stupid they don't know what the fuck they're doing they're miserable they're unfulfilled yet they feel qualified to give you all this advice about what the fuck you should be doing if you don't want their life you shouldn't listen to a fucking word they said unless it's something that gives you an indication about what not to do so that you don't end up like them that's the reality so stop looking at your quote unquote friends at 23 years old thinking that those are your fucking friends those aren't your friends those are people you're fucking grew up with those are people you went to school with you don't even have any real friends at 23 because you have different goals and you haven't met anybody that also has those goals those will be your fucking friends the people who will sit down with you and say how can I help you in you can help me win that's fucking friendship okay friendship is not just because you graduate high school with someone or just because you went to college with someone or just because you drank beer with someone that's not friendship and we have to stop being loyal to people who we associate with when we were young thinking we owe them something you don't owe them anything the only person that you fucking owes yourself and what you owe yourself to do is to pay attention in a very honest and real way to everybody else's lives that are getting you advice and say do I want that guy's life oh I don't what about that one no I don't want that one either no I don't want that one oh I don't want anybody's life is telling me shit which is likely the case so what do you got to do you got to go find people who have the life that you want and you start emulating what they do and you try to get close to them and you listen to what they say and you guys live in the most privileged society ever when it comes to that when I was 22 years old we had books we have fucking podcasts we have rich mother fuckers who built empires telling us what the fuck to do we have any of that shit we have people that were willing to coach you or help you or do do anything for you we had a read in a book I didn't fucking know anybody that was successful you see what I'm saying now you guys turn on the internet you see fucking all these people who are successful which by the way most from relying just being honest you got to dig in like I've been talking about what's their business what's their product who are their customers how long they've been doing it what's their employees say where's their headquarters can I order their product how do they fulfill it do they have real shit going on if you would just ask those questions it'd be really easy to identify who was what okay but I could tell you this you're not going to get rich overnight you're not going to get rich in a fucking year and the good news is it's not going to take you 10 or 11 years like it took me because you have technology that didn't exist so you guys grew up with this technology and you also grew up with this ability to have access to people who have done these things and you still bitch like it's hard fuck you don't even know what fucking hard is bro you have no idea go try reading Tony Robbins books and then to do what you can from there go start a business right and that's only that's the only thing you got okay you don't have the internet you don't have cell phones you don't have shit you gotta go do it you motherfuckers couldn't do it you couldn't you wouldn't go door to door knocking on doors and if you wouldn't go door to door knocking on doors you don't have what it takes anyway because ultimately it's whatever the fuck it takes but basically my message to you is don't listen to motherfuckers that have never done anything including your fucking friends including your parents including your aunts and uncles including fucking anyone if you want a better life if you listen to them you'll be like them that is the bottom line so when someone's telling you what to do with your money or how to live or how to do this and how to do that and how to do this look at their fucking life and I mean really look at it what kind of money they make kind of house they live in kind of car they drive what's their family like where they like and look at it very honestly and then you could decide whether or not you could take their advice or not I love that man it's almost like you know one one thing I pulled from you so you know when you get this idea of this man I'm gonna be missing out yeah you are gonna be missing out on all the bullshit on the back end of that yeah that's exactly right dude or way to look at not only that dude it's no different than making an investment and a fucking stock okay your stock is you all right you're 23 years old you're gonna make an investment in some stock and because you made an investment in stock that's money that you can't spend on going out to the bars and you can't buy a car with it and you can't do this you can't go and fucking do buy you can't do because the money's invested in you because you're a stock okay and then over the course of time that stock is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and 20 years from now you're gonna have so much going for you that no one else around you's gonna even have and it's because they spent their energy capital their money capital they did not make that investment they went on the trip to Dubai they went on the trip to fucking here and there they fucking bought a car they couldn't afford they did all these things they shouldn't have done and they didn't make that investment of themselves so there's no payoff over here so if you look at yourself like that and you look at it as a stock all these things that you're missing out on all this money that you're putting into yourself and not into Jordans and other bullshit no one gives a fuck about now you start to understand that these are investments that have a payoff it's not it's not a sacrifice the biggest lie told in personal development is this idea of sacrifice how is it a fucking sacrifice if you're getting a payoff at the end it's only a sacrifice that there's no payoff so whatever you're missing whatever effort you have to put in whatever you have to endure that is an investment that is not a sacrifice you what are you missing out on you're missing out on going to a bar with a bunch of drunks drinking some shitty beer with a bunch of fat bitches that's what you that's what you're then do that and then if you're fucking have all these problems your whole life bro or take the time now and say I'm gonna become this and this and this and realize what the fuck you're gonna become and dedicate yourself to it and eventually you will be that and nobody else will be that's how it works man you're not missing out on shit you just feel like you are because your friends think they got one up on you right now but they don't because you'll be the one with the last laugh when you're not having to work a fucking Wendy's when you're 40 years old shit man that's real shit well extra sauce for the people right on their face right in their

try to do it too it looks ridiculous we call it some else what are we calling much part oh yeah we all go to those parties oh man okay we got I got yeah all right guys question question number four Andy I'm curious to how you keep common situations that present distress I don't more specifically when people are being deliberately worthless humans so here's the example I'm I am drinking at a bar they finally bring up my pizza after taking so it's you being deliberately worthless oh they finally bring up my pizza after taking long the entire time prior to me even ordering the pizza I would have finally arrived it's not how I asked for it I have tipped a few dollars for every beer I got and extra five for the pizza to combat the negativity yet the manager was still completely out of line with my mojo I was beyond kind and acts that it be properly cooked and his quick response was quote well we already put it in the oven initially to make it extra crispy I got my refund I don't play that shit left half a full glass of wine what is some real life applicable instances you can provide an example proper solution to by the way I work in the service industry and I'm not faulting the servers bartenders but the manager is an idiot all right so here's what you do you go out and you marry a girl from the country I know where this is going and it's why because if you marry a girl from the country and someone fucks with your food they'll kill them you don't have to do anything I have to do shit yeah my food gets fucked up bro Emily's on it yeah she just kills him yep puts him in a fucking hole we go home yeah that's how it works feeds them to the ducks yeah that's it ducks ducks feet ducks eat good I mean real talk yeah just get yourself a woman that won't tolerate no shit because there's nothing worse than having a complaint about your food that's always yeah yeah as a man yeah like like if you especially for me like it listen why's that come I don't get it you're what all right you're big I'm a I'm a big man I saw the beast start to come out I figured that's what you think I think I'm gonna rob the fucking restaurant dude listen you know what um unfortunately you know the world needs people to cook the fucking fries you know I'm saying and uh you're gonna deal with people like that and service here and there I think most people try to do the best they can I try to give people the benefit of the doubt and if it's a situation that just cannot be resolved and can't be taken seriously I just don't go back and that's how places go out of business the market decides what's gonna make it and what's not gonna make it the places I go I only go to three places dude and they all got tremendous service and that's honestly why I go there I go there because of the service the food is great in all three places but the service is what matters and you know what I noticed now in culture is this uh is this idea where like people dude after COVID service really got fucked up oh bro before COVID everybody it was it was pretty good after COVID now we have this entitlement mentality amongst the service industry that they deserve some sort of reward or tip or whatever just for existing for breathing right like you notice how much shit people are trying to get us a tip on now fucking everything all right let me tell you something if you work in the service you should have no problem earning tips but it's earning tips okay and because of the service is so poor across the board if you are just reasonably good at your service you were gonna make so much fucking money because people are so accustomed to people not giving a fuck so while I don't have a solution for you other than say your piece and don't go back and maybe write a review you know a real review I don't I'm not for these people that just go straight to like trying to kill places because they fucked up I give benefit because I own businesses and I understand things can get fucked up but if you have a situation like that's unreasonable I think it's reasonable to say something and while this may not answer your question for all of you servers out there that say shit like nobody respects the servers nobody tips this if you ain't tipping 20% then fuck you no fuck you okay because your tip is based upon the extra mile service that you provide your job is to bring me my fucking food okay but if you bring it with a smile and you're happy and you're fun and you're cool and you make good conversation you keep my drinks going and everything comes out right and you're nice and pleasant you're gonna make bro I usually tip like a hundred percent of the fucking meal anywhere I go okay so you see me coming you're gonna get two options you're gonna get a hundred percent or you're gonna get fucking nothing and that's it and I think a lot of people feel that way I think a lot of people tip very good for great service and they don't tip shit for you thinking that you deserve a tip it's the entitlement generation people still the free market is the free market bro and the market will always dictate what things are worth and if no one's tipping you it's because you suck okay I know plenty of people in service industry that make a fuck ton of money they work in high-end restaurants they're making tons and tons of money you know why because they work their fucking asses off to make sure of the experience is good and a great experience is worth money to people so if you're one of these servers that thinks everybody owes you just remember they don't they don't owe you a tip and they'll be people that will make a point out of not tipping you just because you're mediocre okay it used to be like if you went to a restaurant and service was just mediocre it was a normal thing to not tip yeah that was normal now it's like if you went in there and you got shitty service and you don't tip 25% they post you on the internet well go ahead and post me and then I'll talk about how shit you were you know what I'm saying I feel like there's a flip side of them and like because I actually had this experience this past weekend but I was in the restaurant and sometimes the people can just be assholes and I want to leave this is no doubt every day thing right now or the most common situation but like dude this dude and it's wife they were just being fucking asses customers yeah to the customers yeah and like they didn't tip and they fucking left like everything you know it was worse experience I think they were just trying to get the shit comped yeah of course but I brought I felt so bad I was kind of over here in this the I fucking tip that's over yeah you know I'm saying just cuz I just felt bad well there's people like that for sure that's not that's a dress those fuckers I mean their pieces of shit rose pieces shit everywhere you go yeah it's not you know another thing I see is wait stuff like this always say this is black people to do this there's all kinds of people that do this I've worked in wait staff I've worked in service I know what the fuck this is about there's lots of people that just try to get free shit and it's not indicative of their fucking race okay there's pieces of shit and if you're someone in service and you treat every single person as if they were that one piece of shit that you dealt with that day you're never gonna make any money so that's not a good strategy the right strategy is to say well I know that one out of the 30 tables I had was shitty but I'm gonna treat all those other all of them the same knowing that the balance is gonna equate and and come out my favor right I have short-term memory loss for sure you can't dude it's just like sales man like if you quit selling the minute someone says no how are you gonna win if you keep if you quit providing extra value because someone was mean to you didn't appreciate it how you gonna win if you quit working hard because your boss didn't see you or acknowledge you for this one thing how are you gonna get better and people shoot themselves in the foot more often than not by having this attitude of well I could do all this work and it won't be appreciated just because it wasn't appreciated one time doesn't mean it won't be appreciated just because you got passed over one time doesn't mean you won't get you know get to go up two or three spots the next time it's not the way it works the way the world works is this you give the best you can every chance you get and eventually it works out and that's how it works dude there's no exceptions to that either I love it I love it most people will say there's exceptions to that but what's actually happened is they got passed over once or twice and they've given up so now in their mind their identity is I work really hard I go the extra mile I do all these things when they're really not they're not being honest with themselves and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy right because they got passed over that one time or they have one bad table they have one bad experience and they actually have quit doing all these things but in their mind they still identify themselves with the person who did all these things before but they're not doing them now and then they end up losing and then you know they're bitter at everybody they have you know it's unfortunate that so many people in the world lack the ability to look in the mirror be honest am I giving my best am I doing my best am I honestly giving what I could give most people will say yeah of course I am and then you know you're around them for an hour and you're like what the fuck is that what's that what's this I thought you said this oh well that's just this one thing you know that that that that well your whole day is filled with one things that fuck you up you know what I'm saying yeah bro they're delusional the best thing you could do for yourself is to not be delusional about the reality that that you live in an experience be honest are you good or you're not good are you fat are you not fat are you good looking or ugly be honest because if you're ugly you got to work a little harder work a lot all right they're right but not I'm just saying man just be honest yeah be honest if you're honest with yourself the world is a lot easier navigate you know throw a shit man guys I love it yep that's four that was four yeah come back for more more brown chocolate Eagles yeah
