very confident and sharing that opinion what do you think i do listen i'm happy well i thought of you you know we thought we thought of you when we when we launched the flavors we said what would be DJ's favorite flavor to have and uh bring back all the childhood trauma yeah and we came up with a grape yeah and uh the grape is amazing this is about on i thought about these shantou bro and uh we made a special flavor for him but that one won't actually be available in stores we just custom making for when he wants it it's curry water you know i'm saying it's a nice and spicy and that sounds terrible yeah launching on 11th of July yeah that's right you like it don't you yeah yeah yeah drink it every day yeah why don't you show what it looks like there you go that's orange yeah that must be orange curry that's right that's right that kind of like orange chicken yes yeah but it's chicken orange all right guys here's the deal the brand new form energy drinks just drop today and if you guys were paying attention we made a huge deal back in j j j jayneuary to get the distribution of these drinks all over the world all over the country and you will be able to find these pretty much anywhere starting this week yeah you ain't gonna fight cash yeah now you can if you want yeah you could definitely fight him if you want but you want sometimes it's fun but you don't you don't have to anymore because they're going to be pretty much everywhere uh that you're gonna be able to get drinks so look for it support it try it out tag as it tag me in it i'm gonna tell you right now this is not just bullshit if you think it's bullshit you can come kick me in the balls but i'm telling you right now these are the best drinks and they make our old ones and i know a lot of you guys are gonna be like oh i love the old ones dude just wait just wait this one here makes the old screaming freedom tastes like fucking nightkill yeah okay and that grape the one we made last year that we were gonna launch that grape makes that one tastes like dimetap yeah like these are so good listen yeah dude i there so i can't believe how good they are and i'm not just saying that dude like i'm not just saying that you guys have to go try them yeah um so yeah that's been one of the biggest things we've been working on and uh you're gonna be able to get them everywhere your grocery store your sea store pretty much everywhere if you can't get them i'd be very surprised so check it out this is the screaming freedom dj's got the grape uh z-shines got the orange curry and then we've got a blue razz that is uh we don't show it's really good too but i'm just not a blue razz guy yeah uh and then we have a bunch of other flavors on the on the on the books on the you know coming up list uh which will come out a little bit later this year so very very excited we're all very excited and i'm happy for you man i'm proud of you man it's been cool dude you know we we did this partnership with uh with Brennan Whitworth from A.B Dana White and us here to form a new joint venture on uh with drinks it's been super fun we've all had a great time doing it it's great people involved all companies that support you know actual people not trying to do everything with AI you know what i'm saying like it's all culturally in line and um it feels good man i'm really excited about it and i think you guys are gonna really enjoy it so i know they are yeah i know they are too i know dude this flavor here is i mean you try them all right what's your ranking i would personally i would go screaming freedom grape orange blue razz what did you guys did you try them all what do you think i like the orange the best yeah absolutely orange is i mean it's hard for me to pick i don't like blue razz anything but it's good that's good but like that's definitely at my bottom just because i would i never drink that yeah but the screaming freedom i think is my favorite and then i think grape and orange are like tied and then blue razz yeah and i guess if i had to pick over grape and orange i'd probably pick orange just because of course that's more yeah you know because i'm racist you know yeah no i that's just more that's just more what i drink you know what i'm saying like i just drink i like orange stuff like i like orange gatorade i like orange soda i like orange orange precedent i like orange curry yeah i like an orange president too yeah that's true the audience should let us know if they agree with your rankings or not yeah well they haven't tried it yet i mean when they try what look it's hard for me to pick between orange and grape like real talk they're both phenomenal yeah i don't see flavors so i get it yeah well i yeah well we did have you try another flavor didn't we oh you did oh yeah i can't talk about that one though hey hey hey hey that's secret sauce we got that we got that corn water coming on saying all right guys so that's that's uh that's the ad for the show yeah brought to you by for energy no ads yeah that was yeah yeah that's sick man yeah bling bling bling bling motherfucker all right dude all right well with the show uh so we got a uh you know i like to win here yeah right winning's great i like having the medals that's nice you know i'm saying and uh winning's good winning's great it's uh it's needed and uh you know over the weekend it's been a long weekend for a lot of people but kept getting tagged in this thing i'm like start looking into it bro can i stop right now like how do these motherfuckers walk around wearing this shit all the time they don't they don't where they put it on right before they go out yeah i'm gonna tell you right now because this is this is not comfortable it's got some weight to it no it does this is real this isn't like this isn't like no fake fake ass shit bro this thing costs like 400 grand you know not really it's like not even close it's not real but that's what these guys do on the internet bro yeah it's dude it's super heavy i don't see how them didn't guys do it yeah i don't know yeah i think i need to take this thing off yeah i'm gonna need his help i need help oh my goodness shit sh** try to score his back oh man all right yeah so we like winning and uh over the weekend man we we kept getting tagged this stuff and uh landing i'm happy i'm happy to report uh we are back in first place we dude and what um i mean i always knew that well i mean but there is a catch this but let's dive into it so there's this company out there um called ad fontis media okay and uh they claim uh that they help people navigate the news okay and they they uh oh god basically weigh biases within media okay podcast tv shows and uh andy we're number one we are the most extreme right unreliable podcast out there no way oh yeah bro there you go there you go no you come this is real this is not we are the for according to this chart we are the furthest right and the most misinformation yeah yeah contains inaccurate a fabricated information yeah number one man how can that be fucking accurate oh i don't know we're the only people on here that's why because we hit on everybody um i mean that's the thing i mean like you know it's sort of looking into how are we more right when there's entire shows dedicated to supporting the candidates on the right and never and agree with them no matter what no matter what yeah how we you know what i'm saying that's a good point well i thought about i'm like well i mean okay so if if we're this right like who by the way have you ever heard any of those people that run those shows give any credit to anybody on the left ever no i believe that we do that quite often when they do good things yeah i think we rayer but i i yeah it is rare but there is some people that do shit look i feel like we call balls and strikes bro for sure you know what i mean like yeah we do yeah i that's how i feel yeah but it just got me to thinking like okay well what do they consider to be reliable news and like unbiased news and um you want to take some guess let me take some guesses on this i would bet that first of all the the companies that they think are unbiased are totally in line with who these people are um but i bet if we looked into it it's going to be the companies who benefited from things like us a id uh where they stole our tax dollars and pumped into these media companies for the purpose of propaganda that's what i would bet and i bet this company i speculate that this company is probably involved in some of that yeah i mean 100% so so so so who do they think is number one yeah i mean well they got mpr oh so exactly what i just said here we are they have a negative bias how do you have a negative bias like like like like negative bias what does that mean yeah they're negatively biased what look it up what's a negative bias i don't even know what the fuck negative bias i mean i'm a simple brain to do bro i'm not very smart it's negative 0.28 they are right smack down the middle and they provide reliable fact reporting news oh okay so uh so who else do they think yeah uh you got abc uh yep they have a negative 0.3 bias wait so yeah who else anybody else 60 minutes who just got sued by trump for 60 minutes advocating shit 20 billion dollar lawsuit for lying yep what they just killed left they skew left well i mean here's where it gets interesting bro because like i bet if you go down the list bro i bet it's all the fucking big names i bet it's msnbc i bet it's seeing an affiliate podcast but it's all that shit they just skew left but they're they're good okay so let me get this right uh so if we are the furthest right and the most myths information on a podcast ranking that ranks npr abc 60 minutes cnn ms as the reliable sources that actually does make us number one we are number one that you flip that around man that's a we want feels good hey bro we made it mega we made it we now i say this we we made it we made it bro well here's the thing man like that's true though it is no it is true now that means we're giving out more facts we've been right about more things and we're more center than any of these people yeah i'll take it dude well i mean listen i've always looked at it like this i'm like you know like what about the og you know i'm saying like we're labeled conspiracy theorists not that crazy stuff and i'm like dude no for sure like Alex Jones got it you know i'm saying like and they have a score here um he has a reliability look at his bias rating 31 versus negative bias ratings right no these second place baby oh shit i don't know about that dude no this is that shit that's real active so dude here's what happened guaranteed one of these little nerds in their office started listening to the fuck fuck fuck left left yeah they have this to Alex Jones are like god this guy is so annoying no no and then they listen to us and they fucking hate us you're i fucking hate him to you DJ yeah yeah man could you imagine that the meltdown that happened when they were evaluating our show straight meltdown dude nuclear meltdown well and so their process how they say they do this is like they'll listen to the sources right they listen you know whether it's a news article or podcast they listen to it and then they have a three panel uh a three panel group of analyst one right one left one center whole that route like read through it or digest it and then they all independently come up with the score and then it averages out well let's first of all you know uh everything that even skews right is considered far right super far right by those people 100% so and anything that puts out any information that isn't approved by the media matrix the government funded propaganda machine is considered misinformation so if they're ranking us that far outside of that that means that we are telling the truth and we are unbiased so that's a pretty good thing and i wouldn't say we're unbiased dude i'm definitely biased more towards the conservative side but that's because the over 10 window has shifted so far to the left right like when when i was in 2020 when i was 20 years old i was definitely down the middle man you know and anybody who thought like we mean you think those were centrist and now we've been pushed to the far right i guess apparently um most extreme right because the window i shift it so far to the left and really the truth is is most conservatives have shifted with it you know the things they say they're trying to conserve are not being conserved at all you know they're starting to little by little by little accept things that are outside what they wanted to conserve anyway and that's what causes the window to shift so i don't know i mean that i mean real talk i mean that does put us at at where we need to be yeah i'm proud man so who's the panel that's well that this so this lady on the panel no that's the the founder in CEO so her name is Vanessa Otero okay um she's uh she's like a copyright lawyer or some shit out in Colorado that started just back in like 2016 i ve yeah that's her on the left i'm not sure these two ladies are but i mean you're looking to there she'd like dude like here's the thing this this company's not gonna be non-existent in a few years well why do you think that is because it like the one nobody believes it nobody trust you guys right lost all the fucking trust nobody nobody nobody's funding this dude this is this is like this is like gaslighting your agenda and thinking that people are stupid bro they're operating at a net negative million dollars a year right now well and that's from their own sec filing so well look dude there's a reason for that and there's a reason that all these mainstream media outlets that were funded by us a id directly or indirectly there's a reason that the ratings for CNN and ABC and MSNBC have tanked over the last few years there's a reason nobody trust these people and it's because they're smart enough to know when they're being manipulated and lied to and forming these fake charts and these fake you know rankings and all of this shit and trying to make it look official only contributes to the mistrust even more you're not like there's no no that's it dude and these these people all think they can still trick people by putting out things like this and you know it people are smarter than that man and and dude you're not going to be able to continue to operate operating like that it's not going to happen well where they fucked up is bro like they just they stop being afraid of just directly lying to people man like you know I'm saying you can you can't just you can't tell the American people one thing right and then when when that that American goes outside but sees the reality of what's actually happening and then they're hearing you say everything's fine and you know cities are burning down across the fucking country or the economy's great and gas prices are fucking 10 times they've seen it too many times you can't fool them we're not talking about right this second but like you know like when the George Floyd stuff was happening and then they tried to say it wasn't happening you know and then they said you can't go outside you can't do anything six feet apart wear a mask do the and then but then every they can flood millions of people in the streets nobody gets sick right you can go into a restaurant and you got to wear your mask as you walk through the restaurant but when you sit down you could take it off like people are smarter than that dude and we could go on and on they did this with they did this with the black square they did it with COVID they did it with Ukraine they've done it with this Israel thing Israel Hamas thing and dude people are seeing it and you know they've done it with the economy they did it with Joe Biden's health and you know like dude it kind of actually it doesn't kind of it exposes their elitism mentality that we are so much smarter than them yeah you know we went to school we went to Ivy League we we came from Harvard or we came from Yale or we came from Cornell and we're so much smarter than you that we can lie to your face and you'll believe it and dude that's just not true okay going to a college at this point in time is more about indoctrination cultural indoctrination is about education and let's not mention the worthlessness of it because of the length of it now the world changes so fast now that by the time you start to learn a skill and go through three or four years or five years unless you're going to be a doctor or unless you're going to be an engineer but the truth of the matter is is like dude the technology is is replacing these professions and going to continue to replace these professions and these people are so arrogant they don't think that's going to happen like there are videos online of AI doing x-ray scans of people's lungs and process in an inch second yeah and the doctor who even says on the video you saw the video yeah he's like bro I spent fucking he goes yeah he goes he goes dude and this thing get it in 10 seconds and it saw things that I didn't see so like dude these people they're arrogance about smart they are about to eat them alive there's even all these attorneys man like yeah because I mean we're over litigious culture that's not going to happen because they want to allow it to happen that's going to be going to be the final star yes that's going to be when that starts to happen that is when we will see some sort of regulation because attorneys make the law no for real attorneys make the laws and they're not going to allow their profession to be eaten up by AI and technology I just don't see it happen they want to allow it no I ice and so that's what makes me feel a little bit better about limiting it but dude like you know it's just arrogance dude you know and it's people that think they're smarter than everybody and they're not and they've never been around regular people they've never been to Iowa or Missouri or Tennessee or you know outside of a big city or you know to any of these states that we would say like you know what we would call maybe the average American lives right like normal US like like real America you know like they don't go outside their big offices and they're there's fancy you know rooms with and important people they like you know every state you know has these people right like California has them Colorado has them Texas has the whole country's made up of people like we're describing and how those people view people like us who grew up in that world isn't you know hey it's like this they see it as like this fat hillbilly with no teeth that can barely speak and because they have that viewpoint they are completely out of touch and because of their arrogance and ego it keeps them out of touch and what's it it's gonna end up eating them up yeah they're like why is it why are we losing money why can't we make it well dude because people see what you're doing they see what you're doing you want to turn that shit around start telling the fucking truth that's real man guys jumping send us some congratulations yeah can hey congrats congratulations yeah good sir you can find out about the negative bias I get it now after I think I contextually understood it now yeah it means if you're over zero you're actually biased if you're under zero you're less bias no it's not about less bias it's more towards having an unfavorable attitude so a person might have a negative bias towards a particular political party leading them to disregard positive aspects of that oh god it got it okay so exactly what they are yeah but they're not negative point six they're negative pointy yeah right something like that yeah I got it yeah that's funny we're the most biased dude we're the only guys we're the we're the and I mean this would respect but we're the only guys real talk who called everything every single move out actively months and months ahead of everybody else seeing it and we haven't gotten credit because we're so far ahead when we say it right and what value is it to people to be taught and everybody else they talk about it as it's going on yeah okay think about how easy it is to talk about something as it's going on versus actually anticipating what's going to happen and telling people this is what's about to happen that's a different kind of thing that's what we do here what bro that takes courage it takes balls it also takes vision that people don't have all right and here's the thing what's more valuable to the individual well obviously the guys who say hey this is going to happen let's prepare for this is much more valuable than the person says hey this happened and here's what's going you know on today right so like dude we the problem with us being so far ahead like we have been and by the way if you think we're full of shit feel free to go back and listen all the shows because we were way ahead and we got crushed every time conspiracy theorists you know whatever dude all the time and we haven't been wrong we've been right just like Alex Jones has been mostly right he's and he's way ahead like 10 years ahead yeah and and dude the people don't like the way Alex delivers his content because he's he gets passionate about it just like I do just like you do but even if we had said it in a calm way they're still not going to listen because it's so far out of their vision that they can't see it coming down the pipe all right so what ends up happening is we get dismissed and these regular dudes get to be like they get the credit when they're talking about it while it's happening and we as people need to start trying to anticipate what's going to happen so that we can prepare instead of you know just reacting as it happens you know part of the thing of social media is that I feel like it creates a situation where people believe that just posting about things is actually making a difference no and I think it's an intentional outlet for that I think I think the internet is being used as a an intentional blowoff spout for the bad things that are happening in the world where if we didn't have social media and people didn't have to post about it we would see real action and so my intent here is to call things out as they come and let you guys handle the preparation and the action inside your communities that's the whole intent right but whatever man I mean like I know where I know we've been right and I think it's funny that like I think I just think it's funny that like some of these shows get all the love and we don't get as much even though we've been right for a year ahead of them or six months ahead of them you know what I'm saying I did I mean it's not like we don't get love we're number 25 show in the world yesterday number one in business but you know that's whatever man it's not I don't know like it requires action as I guess is what I'm saying like we have to take action in our communities and it's not no one's coming to do that dude that's you guys that listen to the show and I know that sucks because I know your plates full and you're trying real hard and you want to be doing your life the best you can but no one's gonna do it if you don't do it that's the truth so yeah man that's real guys let's go down to the comments what you guys think about that with that being said let's get into our crews we've got a lot of stuff to cover remember as always if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them all links therefore you or come check us out on YouTube and follow along with us as we cruise the internet that being said headline number one let's get into it it is coming off from Memorial Day weekend very very very memorable day memorable day should be a memorable memorable day for us but a lot of stuff happened over the weekend we got a cover real quick did you see the the French president get fucking bitch left by his husband yeah I did so I mean I'm sure you guys have seated by now but we got we got to catch up on this yeah bizarre moment French president McCrone is shoved in the face by his husband while squabbling by his husband what what squabbling is that like a white I don't know I thought it was but you know apparently it's a it's just like a little scuffle yeah we don't have I don't think we can I don't know Kendrick Lamar just made a song about it squabbling squabbled up squabbled up squabble he did didn't I'm off I know yeah damn you're white he drinks more this real quick yeah yeah man so they were they were they landed losing your superpowers that's what it is me yeah that's what it is you know it is what it is you got to drink out man yeah but they were going to Vietnam okay for a state visit the plane lands on the tarmac and you know just like any other you know uh you know world leader the door opens on the fucking jet and you're supposed to come down well this is what they caught let's check this clip nope it's the smile bro it's so funny okay bro but this is how you know he was pissed all right like that like she was you know and I say his I mean the Bridget woman lady potentially tries to like hold her hand going down the rail she says no she says no and then this was them right on the tarmac bro I'm sorry yeah he's got he's got his fist clench I do yeah he's mad he's pissed bro he must be a pretty small dude because she's tiny she's really and they're like they're not far off the same size yeah but dude that's a there's no doubt by mine that's a man Candace Owens this bait explodes this you know like you could tell that's a wig it always looks exactly the same it never grows it never gets longer it never gets shorter it always moves the same I mean I don't know actually I do know I mean Candace is right and is this she like 70 yeah she's she's old he's like what yes she is 45 or something yeah something like that she is she's 72 he's 47 and that's the thing today they met like I mean look at the couple dude the couple met 1993 when she was a 39 year old high school teacher and the future French head of state was was her 15 year old students and a classmate of her daughter okay first of all that's nasty okay even if she is a chick that's nasty it's pedophile it's pedophilia yeah it's pedophilia the could do the crazy like I follow that Candace Owens report on this yeah did you know that the French government offered her like a one time like three it was like three or five million dollar payment a look like a one-time payment plus like 15 grand a month for the rest of her life she doesn't talk about oh yeah bro oh yeah well I mean look man I don't think Candace is for sale no yeah no you could think whatever you want bro but she says what she thinks is the truth and I think she's pretty good at it I think I do agree with that yeah and it's like but like that right there should tell you something you know well dude it seems like she's some sort of handler or something for somebody they picked groom this dude and he was young yes you know him saying he's gonna do exactly what we tell him for sure and dude you know what listen there's there's there's there might be one or two but there's no 47 year old man who is in that position who's with a 72 year old no what it's not fucking happen dude it's not even believable a little bit you know what I'm saying yeah no so whatever man I mean I bet he's pretty pissed bro because it's embarrassed it's super embarrassing and also he's probably like listen you know what I could be doing but I'm I'm trying I'm here being loyal to you so it do 72 year old man with saggy balls you know saying like a little bit of but I don't care that he's in that whatever if that's what he's into but like let's be real she's old you tell not your only option you got that there there's no way there's no way he's a good looking dude bro it's not possible no fuck no yeah and the part that I hit to like they try to just like play it off like his quote that he gave out yesterday says quote we are squabbling and rather joking with my wife McCruise it people are saying all sorts of nonsense everyone needs to calm down and some of my own team said said quote it was a moment when the president and his wife were decompressing one last time before the start of a trip by joking around you can press it with some domestic violence you sure you sure they're not American right I get it you know oh man it was a moment of togetherness yeah no it does not no yeah it does quote a moment it's a moment of togetherness no more was needed to feed the mills of the conspiracy theorists this is what we were just talking about like we saw it we saw it dude she pushed him in the face yeah they weren't joking hands was together with his face yeah like blink twice if you need help McCruise just blink twice bro blink twice what will come save you from him yeah so gross it isn't nasty it's so gross you think that's just a show or you think he like really like has sex with her I Maybe French people are nasty no they're not bro what do you mean why have you been to France bro like that like I've been to France a bunch of times that's the place of love bro like they get they do some some interesting shit oh you mean nasty right no right the sex museums and Amsterdam that motherfucker's nasty bro French get down how you know bro a lot of all the monage a twa you know where they came from yeah that's French yeah that I'm sure they didn't invent the concept it probably just sounds the best pretty you know what I'm saying like you think she still has her head just her what their head what's that bush oh no I think she has balls so I think she's got her blueberries so macros that's right that's right that's right yeah man these these uh these people at the top bro they're no different than these kings and queens that we've read about in the past they just make us feel different about it because they figured out eventually people kill those people yeah you know oh man yeah I'd be pissed I wish Alex would hmm bro you went right back at her yeah did I bro I'll drink one of those citrus blasts so quick it'd be own and pop it well all right these shut today shut the door back after that happened no no no it's just it's just replaying oh hey come in my fucking that's right that's right yeah man it's crazy man but yeah so I had to get that out of the way you had to talk about it yeah um but we are coming off Memorial Day yeah very very important for uh important day for the United States um Trump he uh spoke at all international cemetery um he's been on this this um really pro-military kick I guess you can call it um this is a MSNBC article I know you see it yeah the president to speak at Arlington National Cemetery to mark Memorial Day who made this headline this is MSNBC the Trump to speak listen to this shit guys Trump to speak at Arlington National Cemetery to mark Memorial Day another round with that accurate headline what's the subline the president will also participate in a typically somber reflaying ceremony after posting several messages on social media throughout the morning so what you're saying is he didn't do the performative uh somber act that you guys all do he actually just was normal then went to the event and did what he's supposed to do yep like every had to draw attention to his social media bro every single thing these people this is another reason why nobody believes him because they everybody can recognize when some look every single person out here all of you listening all of us we can recognize when someone we don't like does something good all of us we can all do it we can be like hey I don't really like that neighbor but I really like that he did this so you know what I mean we all have the ability to do that no it's because being objective yeah and dude when you can't when the media can the media has not said a single thing positive about president Trump since 2015 when he said he was gonna run that's okay not a single headline not a single thing you could be Charles Manson and in that's amount of time you're gonna do something decent you know saying like you could be you could be the worst person that ever lived and in over you know 10 years you're gonna find something that you say well he is a psycho but he did that you know and that's their job their job is to report and you wonder why companies like that initial one that we talked about are going out of business and ad revenue is drying up and viewers drying up for all these people is because dude they we can see that yeah and then I the only one brother I mean like is it Trump's been putting a lot of attention on on our military because we know how you know the state of our military as a whole has been you know for the last four years you know but it's like again like he can't fucking win he goes to West Point for their graduation this is a political headline Trump mega fives West Point appearing in a red mega cap the president delivered what sounded at times like a rally speech to the West Point graduates is that not what he's supposed to do I mean five is that not the role of the leader of the United States a commander in chief is he not supposed to rally the troops what would you like the him to do show up and say hey boys we're gonna cut our nicks off or fucking follow them the stage yeah dude was fine dude get out of here man that was fine like these people are so ridiculous they won't even let you have memorial day bro you know like memorial days supposed to be every day like we're supposed to have honor every day we're supposed to remember what these people did every single day not just one or two or three days a year you know memorial day 4th of July uh veterans day look these people died so that you can have an opportunity in life there was a time where Americans understood that there was a time where we lived that these people paid for your freedom in blood okay legitimately literally and we have so many people that are willing to waste their life away thinking that it's about them forgetting that people have sacrificed everything my dad's dad died in France after storming the beach on d day he died six months later as a 20 year old man never meeting his own son my grandma was pregnant with him when he left okay he never got to see my dad grow up he never got to see my brother do what he's done you know become a tremendous athlete a tremendous play professional baseball become an amazing CEO an amazing father he never saw any of that he never saw anything that I've done and we we hear my family we take that serious right it's directly in our family but I have people all the time tag me in these little comments and say who's this asshole saying how we should live it's known to his fucking business know it is my business because my family has paid and a lot of other families have paid and not only that we have to live with the consequences of the poor leadership and the selfishness of people who forget that there's an obligation to being free in America it is our obligation to do the best that we can it is our obligation to try I'm not saying you have to be perfect I'm saying you have to try you have to think about who's coming behind you you have to understand that what you do they will also do okay and we have to restore the respect through our actions and through how we live for memorial day and for the July and for veterans day and and really it should be every day that's that's how we should be living and Trump goes to West Point to rally the troops and the media destroys them for it like dude we're not living in a real America these people are anti-American they fucking hate us okay and we need to understand that and the only way for us to counter that is to live to the standard that I'm talking about that's the only way because if it was up to them we'd all be confined to our households fed shitty food so that we become fat unhealthy pumping our brains full of garbage which they've been doing for 70 years so that we will buy their pharmaceuticals and buy their cures and consume their information and become mega consumers of the mega companies so today when and we lose and we're easy to control and dude the only way for us to get the power back as it is at an individual level and it's the only way for us to win it just is and like dude this is disgusting shit it's disgusting like we're going to disrespect memorial day by talking about some irrelevant bullshit to try and tarnish what because you don't like Trump right you know I'm saying you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna fucking criticize him for leading the troops right the people who have the actual courage and balls yeah the fucking fight for you why you type that fucking article yeah dude these people be out it was like that debate you did the other night with that lady like bro she's saying well what what is peak peak hegseth qualifications well I you know I don't know like he's been on the fucking battlefield he's he knows what actually it's like to be a soldier I believe he's very well educated is he not very well he's been in where did he go to school I want to say he went to double check Princeton yeah Princeton oh you know so everybody's like oh who's this guy and what's he qualified for well I mean uh he's pretty fucking qualified yeah pretty qualified and because he sat on a new show they think he's just some political commentator yeah yeah right right like dude and these people they want to be right so bad that they're willing to flush I mean look I don't think a lot of the people understand what's going on but the media knows what's going on but the regular people are here they want to be right so bad that they're willing to flush their own lives down with toilet to win like dude it's really it's really weird yeah it is super crazy man other things on this man it's like you know like say he's they've been on this this this push to kind of revitalize our our service men and women right and and for again for good reason for the last four years it's you know we've been kind of the married dogmasks and and where dresses and been demoralized on the national intentional global scale you know i'm saying and so like you know one of the other things that came out from this weekend is a brand new ad touting our military strength and power let's check this out no more distractions no more electric tanks no more gender confusion no more climate change we are laser focused on our mission of war fighting we will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars we end and perhaps most importantly the wars we never get into its called peace through strength you look into the eyes of these young Americans who were giving up the best years of their life in a uniform to serve their nation they are incredible through our power and might we will lead the world to peace our friends will respect us our enemies will fear us and the whole world will admire the unrivaled greatness of the united states military we will replenish the pride of our armed forces and the recruitment crisis we don't fight because we hate what's in front of us we fight because we love what's behind us we are God bless you God bless our armed forces God bless our men and women serving overseas and God bless the united states of America now that is copyrighted so we'll link the video for you guys anyway it's awesome it's fucking badass yeah it's badass and I get it's good to see um it's really good that's what we're supposed to have that's what we're supposed to do that's how we're supposed to promote our military we're supposed to attract the young strong men that want to go and do cool shit and the best party said in that whole video was the wars that we don't have to fight right because we have a strong military and it's a strong deterrent that's how it's supposed to be yeah we're gonna do no shit because you know USA they'll get our life works man that's how life works that's how it is they don't give a fuck about our put mask bro yeah like that I'm scared nobody yeah you know now in good news um something to report new polls came out today and right now we are finally at 50% for the first time in poll history of uh of majority saying the countries on the right track so this just came out this is how to off the press um this is a rass musin report poll um that uh 50% of the country is now saying that we are in the right direction even 31% of democrats are saying it um and uh you know so that's good to see it's good to see I would say we are in the right direction um but something else came out this last little piece I want to touch on this man because I thought this was interesting did you see again we got rats jumping ship left and right um Jake Tapper he's kind of the biggest mole of the group um you know went for years to deny there was any problems in the Biden White House and you know it was completely fine and you know but now he's writing a book you know trying to you know save his own ass basically um a new this new article just came out a farmer Biden aid admits staffed felt justified doing undemocratic things to stop existential threat Donald Trump oh so treasonous activities so what it sounds like that's exactly what sounds what it sounds like to me correct yeah uh axios reporter Alex Thompson revealed on Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream that White House insiders revealed to him that uh they often viewed themselves as the decision makers in the Biden administration and were shielded from the president's oversight let's check this clip out well and it did seem like there's so many people who you would have thought would have access to him who didn't because of this inner circle that really much managed his his schedule and his time and his access in a way that didn't give a lot of people you know one-on-one time with him um in the book you quote a long time Biden aid basically admitting he shouldn't be running again they said to you on page 85 he just had to win and then he could disappear for four years he'd only have to show proof of life every once in a while his aids could pick up the slack who would have been running the White House in a second by in turn oh this person went on to say that when you're voting for president you're voting for the aids uh around him but these aids were not even Senate confirmed aids these are a White House aids these were unelected people and one of the things that really I think comes out and our reporting here is that if you believe and I think a lot of these people do sincerely believe that Donald Trump was and is an essential threat to democracy you can rationalize anything including sometimes doing undemocratic things which I think is what this person is talking about sounds like trees into me it is trees and just like we said four years do we not say this was exactly what was happening or did you hear that part that like they just have to get him elected and then he can disappear for the next four years yeah dude those people shall be in jail that honestly they should be executed that is that is completely completely completely out of line with the constitution it harmed so many people because these people don't understand what they're doing they're working for an agenda that they believe is correct when in reality the the political ideology that they believe in is the one that's most responsible for the most deaths ever of anything communism has killed more people than fucking anything okay more than any war more than any disease anything anything anything and these people are these stupid useful idiot dumbasses due to those people will at a minimum they belong in jail forever and that's that's not what they should be they should be dealt with harshly so that this never happens again jail is not harsh enough no not at all man guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think man with that being said let's go cruise some of these comments let's go check some of this stuff out what we got down in the comments let's go to we got it JT Thomas all right I think you're still blooming on marketing has been working Andy oh yeah yeah saw the can on the desk took off my shirt and immediately saluted yes sir yeah that's what we do I bet he got an eagle tattoo right after that you know I'm saying that's what I'm talking about you want he wants some freedom screaming yeah yeah I had some dude on a Monday show I read the comment he's like I wonder what the marketing team thinks about you putting the can on your desk and I'm like well you're talking about it aren't you right right maybe that's the point maybe you're the reason I even put it out there you think I do that on accident dumbass right right marketing team man man man man man man man man who do you think runs the marketing team I've never run a popsicle stand but I'm gonna tell you how to do your shit yeah man USA it's nice yeah USA feels free yeah let's go to free him's gonna say the world I mean listen it's gonna make patriots come out and scream America fuck yeah eagle tattoo place of kid rock you know what I'm saying people don't understand how calculated you are they underestimated really hard well I mean that's because I'm big mouth dumbass quoting them who takes a bunch of steroids you know like I got lucky you know it's like 9,687 days in a row I was just going to say that yeah it's good good caption wouldn't yesterday in your story you put that and out of curiosity I just looked it up it was exactly your days it was January 7th 1999 that's right it was the almost to the day I might have miscalculated just a little bit I think I didn't take into effect the leap years oh yeah let me get you yeah dude do we still do those as far as I know yeah when's the last time we had a leap year it's every four years yeah well when's the last one when's the last time we had it well hold on if it was every four years and that was 25 so that'd be oh yeah seven days yeah that's what happened yeah exactly right otherwise it would have been the exact days yeah we have one last year oh we had a leap year last year okay what's that relevant for the conversation well you brought over here talking about someone else bro I get that I get that no no same same no I know not saying I totally different no I just I was you guys you brought up leap years I'm like fuck like I didn't who even thinks about leap years like was last time we even have one it was it was last year I just wanted to bring that up because that gives an example how calculated you are the numbers on your story are not even random so people if they did do it in what's here's the funny part I know what I'm doing and then they they're like it's like dude you're an idiot like you haven't you didn't think past this you're looking for a reason to attack me when I'm right and I'm like you're exactly why I did that you know yeah screaming freedom well I bet the marketing team no how about we talked about the marketing team and that was the plug how about that fucking smart tough guy oh dude it's like it's also like all these dudes you know that try to talk shit on everything I say like it's like bro listen man they've gotten comfortable you know that's why we're bringing back the Clisdale cartel bro I'm done with this shit I am too yeah all you guys out here to follow me and comment on my post listening to show just to let you know how the last five years I've you know said hey let's take the high road no we're fucking done with that we're going to the gutter there is no there is you don't get respect for it it's not you get fucking you get fucking chirpy little fucks who get real comfortable with your silence and think they can disrespect you rely about you or tell it to disparage your name and the truth the matter is dude my people you guys listening are so fucking savage that they will get your page deleted yeah bro so from now on we're back we're gonna fuck people up when they act like assholes no now they're joking and they're and good for I don't know that's fine I could take a joke yeah but when these people come in with a asshole tone let's fucking destroy them like that's it dude and don't be sending it to me either don't be saying hey you see this guy no if you're if we're true friends you take care of that shit on your own you don't send it to someone you know I'm saying like a lot of people try to post you as a friend by showing all this for you by showing you all the negative things no you handle it that's the point you know I'm saying dude fuck these people yeah I'm with and then we got all these people ripping off 75 hard and saying bro no fuck you you know so I'm done with it dude the ninth degree yeah I'm with you oh let's go like Trump said in the video dude peace through strength you know when people know they're gonna get their fucking asses beat they stop doing dumb shit yep it's very simple you know the reason the country looks the way it does is because there's no been no repercussions like the reason these people that are communist feel comfortable doing things that destroy our lives is because tyrants have it had their heads cut off in a very long time like this is the way things work and it's no different on the internet just how it is yeah let's check out another comment we got a Joe Whiskerson 1755 when DJ cut to that fat guy in the Dodgers jersey I spit my water spit out my water that's funny shit or that shit's funny please keep that that was funny that was pretty funny yeah man dude you did you did give some people hot on the grimace shit though yeah well you know what you know why because it's fucking true okay and you know what the only way the people could argue with it is by saying a few different things oh says the guy on steroids what the fuck are you talking about I'm 45 years old of course I take testosterone if you're if you're not an idiot you would be two because it's actually healthy for you and there's tons of scientific data to prove that the main of which is the natural regression of testosterone levels and men over the last 25 years in 2020 the average testosterone of a 20 year old man is that of a 60 year old man in 2000 right okay so we've had all of these chemicals introduced into our lifestyle many different ways you can argue about which ones do what but the truth the matter is the end result is the end result and the testosterone level in men now is much lower than testosterone level was 20 years ago and that's intentional and so if you are over the age of 30 really at this time you should be talking to an expert a doctor about your levels getting them checked and make sure that you're not in average range but that you're in the proper range for functioning as a regular male dude and the crazy the craziest thing about testosterone though is like you know a regular a man will go into his doctorate you know get on TRT or something like that they won't give it to him bro but but but you know if you're like a you know 12 year old girl they'll give it to that person yeah not only that dude the the whole thing if you like the whole idea of testosterone being pumped out as this thing that'll fucking kill you that's propaganda bro that's been so that these people right now will be will be adverse to taking it so their their testosterone stays low they stay emotional they stay controllable that's the truth high testosterone men are revolutionaries they don't stand for bullshit it's a cultural fucking propaganda play all right then you know the other thing they say well you don't have any kids no shit I couldn't have kids all right that's not my fucking fault some people can't have them but I tell you what I've raised a lot of other people's kids and I do live a standard and you know they say well you don't have to work motherfucker I work 16 motherfucking hours a day and I have since I was fucking 19 years old that's not six days a week that's seven days a week okay I've been on one vacation since my honey moon one all right so if I can do it you sure can do it too and we have to realize that you know and then they would say well you know you know beat there's a lot more to being a man than being jacked no shit I'm not even saying you have to be fucking mr. Olympia I'm saying you got to have some standards bro and anybody who fucking watch that video if they're being honest knows exactly what I said they know exactly what I said I was saying very simply don't give up don't let your young people behind you your sons your daughters see you give up don't become a fat blob of shit okay and that doesn't mean there's not other areas of being a well-rounded man but the physical area is very important because it dictates a lot of different things it dictates yourself a steam it dictates your confidence it dictates your abilities as a man it dictates your actual health it dictates your mental health it does all of these things and all of those states contribute to you being a better leader so let's not sit here and try to be intellectual and say well you know being a well-rounded and literature listen motherfucker I understand that I understand there's plenty of pillars to being a great man but so many men think that they can ignore the physical just not not mr. Olympia right just being reasonable and holding a standard and they think that like like so dude like when people pick that apart the reason they're upset is because it applies to them yeah somewhere inside it's touching them that dude there was one dude that was like oh look at him shooting on the blue collar Americans the average the fuck are you talking I didn't say anything about how many blue collar dudes I know that are fucking yoked that take care of themselves that work fucking most 10 hours a day in hard circumstances and then go to the gym and eat right and train and take pride in being a great example for their kids bro almost every mother fucking blue collar dude I know is like that most so let's let's be real and on top of that there's been no bigger advocate for blue collar America that's used that has a platform this big besides maybe micro I come to battle for the people every single fucking day employing real people making sure they have careers making sure they have jobs teaching the skills that I know how to make them better so that they can be better at what they do and continue to grow careers so I am hearing it bro my point was to offend you because if I hadn't have said it like that you wouldn't even be fucking talking about it and people are like oh well that's unkind no unkind is presenting truth in a way that gets brushed off okay unkind is being too big of a coward to raise the mirror and say look at you man look at you okay that's unkind you have to be willing to show people what the truth is so they'll change and sometimes that involves saying things that are not very fun to hear okay the reason that I lost a hundred fucking pounds that got my ass in shape is because everybody on the internet every single time I post was like fuck you you fat fuck for years and finally I was like dude fuck they're right and I got my shit together you know what happened millions of people got those shit together because of it we created transformation program in first form hundreds of thousands of people if not millions of people went through it 75 hardest transform more people than any fucking program in the history of okay so I don't want to hear it if it made you upset it's because it applies to you in some way shape or form and the truth of the matter is I care more about you and see more potential in you than you see in yourself and you don't like it but dude I'm tired of living in a world where you know and then the other thing like I said earlier what businesses of it is of you that that how I live no it's actually is my business it's everybody's business because we got to live with the result of your poor leadership out here in the world and everywhere we fucking go we got to fucking see it and I'm tired of it and so is everybody else so it is what it is bro listen man it is what it is and it's not making fun it's not shitting I've been in the same position it's very hard in the beginning it's very scary but you motherfuckers can do it that's the truth so don't fucking kill the messenger bro and and and those men who hear that message and they actually go change they'll be saying thank you in a fucking year from now yeah that's real man last comment let's get one more in it we got the boner donor 209 boner donor 209 specifically all right I'm says bro what the fuck happens who I'd day in the life Andy they motivated the fuck out of me those vids were sick as fuck bring them back big dog well boner donor uh here's the thing I have real jobs I am not a content creator i'm not a podcaster and I'm not a youtuber these are side things for me uh you don't see me making content all day long about how to do things I'm actually in the real world doing things but I do ask for good news for you however yeah we are bringing out the day in the life as a little bit different format the first episode will drop very soon and you guys are gonna it's it's a pure entertainment show and you guys are gonna love it and uh you're you ask and you shall receive because we're already on it brother I already recorded yeah first episode is yep first episode is more just like setting the table like because a lot of people they don't a lot of people legitimately think that I just do a podcast like all these other dudes and they think you know they don't understand what I do and so we're gonna show a people that and uh and then we're gonna get on with the uh the fun fun um so yeah we are don't need some bonus oh yeah that's weird that's weird I don't know yeah I don't know about that yeah yeah guys we appreciate you though for being real ass fans those that love us and hate us uh thank you yes let's get to cruise cruise shall we yeah head on to you um this is an interesting one going on in California of course um furious parents round on trans track stars mother after their daughters were destroyed at event um I'm actually happy to see this is about time we're getting some uh we're we're we're seeing some some some some consequences being handled and I mean it's starting off nice but it's coming from coming from where exactly it should be coming from um so let's dive into this a little bit uh the mother of a transgender high school track athlete uh who continues to exert their dominance over biological females is labeled a coward while being confronted by rival parents and footage circulating online AB Hernandez of Joropa Valley who is a biological male came out on top and both the women's long jump and triple jump at the California inter-scholastic federation southern section masters meet over the weekend and doing so Hernandez is qualified for both events and next weekend's state championships having missed out on the place in the high jump by one spot after finishing fourth um so this junior from Joropa has been Joropa Valley high has been making waves and track and field uh world events in recent months winning a triple jump competition by nearly three feet um at the Roosevelt International California back in March let's check this clip out uh mama bear by three feet huh and that's a shit ton yeah I know that's a shit ton sounds like a close competition yeah super close um let's check out this mama bear protecting her her actual daughter let's check this out I'm gonna listen I don't have to I have a right to speak truth boy good girls are girls this is not gonna be not belong continue to get those girls period what a coward of a woman you are allowing that what I'm telling you are woman telling are women telling girls to go and compete against a boy how embarrassing how you are mother you're a mother stand up like a mother I have a mother I'm protecting girls you want a boy how many people support the boy competing against her girls no tell me to shut up I was respectful to you okay no sure that was personal yeah that's correct I love it yeah she's right and if uh more parents handled it like this from the beginning we wouldn't have the situation happening that's the truth uh men don't belong in women's sports men don't belong in women's locker rooms they don't belong in women's restrooms they don't belong in women's spaces those are women's spaces and uh they don't belong there there's no explanation that justifies grown men dressed up as women being in the bathroom with girls or uh little girls trying to go to the bathroom uh you're inviting problems problems happen from this every single day and uh if we have more parents like this and more people like this this wouldn't happen and everybody's waiting for someone to come along and say you know to handle this you're supposed to handle it you got when you see it so that's the point it is not anybody else's responsibility nor can anybody else solve the problem other than you so this is exactly how you handle it period we have grown men diminishing entire life work of women athletes such as Riley Gaines who is on the show who by the way said on the show that this grown man is in the locker room naked with his penis out in front of other women who are trying to shower and change and we're bending the rules of society for this tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny population and then what's funny is these people will come in the comments sections when we're talking about things like this and they will say why do you keep talking about it it's such a little problem it doesn't represent the norm this is ridiculous that's the point we're being forced to bend over for people that make up and very very very tiny part of the population and that's not right because like I said on last week's show none of us get that privilege nobody else gets the entire world to change the rules and bend over backwards for their situation or whatever you want to call it all right I personally think it is a mental illness I personally think by enabling these things we are doing far more damage than we would be to say no that's not the truth okay but we have people out here who disagree and then they point to the suicide rate well if we don't allow this the suicide rate of of trans people is 40 well what is it of people who have gone through a transition right do we have that data because I'll bet you when it's all said and done the suicide rate of people who have gone through the transition and then realize that it's been bad is much higher than the people who have gender dysmorphia that's the truth so this is how it should be handled this is not this is not even an argument it shouldn't be that's the part that pisses me off do because this is just it's not like we're discussing fucking you know rocket science and like debating on what fucking like this is very simple stuff like stuff that my fucking four year old and two year old even though I know it's very very simple stuff I guarantee you Ryan knows the difference between boys and girls she absolutely does she absolutely does and I and dude it to me it's it's so stupid that we even have to talk about it man but we I mean we talk about the people who are actually affected about this like think about that your girls know the difference between boys and girls they have grown people at an event at an event for is bit what is basically adults 17 year old people arguing over it and those people are in their 30s and 40s that's insane man it's insane now now one of the things I love about this story outside of the mom and bear protection of coops is that the dude this is the boy biological male you can tell by how he's standing because he girls can't stand like that guys can't stand like girls pelvic bones is literally I mean it's fucking anatomy that's the boy there first place now what I really like about this is the girl right here to the left so she placed second hat the boy not been there she obviously would have placed fucking first right so after they do their podium call she takes a rifle place as soon as the boy hops off let's check this clip out and crowd goes wild yeah crowd go right that's Reese Hogan of Cree and Lutheran High School again she would have won that event she would have she would have won that event that's dude this is fucking bullshit this bullshit yeah now here's the thing so when Trump first got in he made an executive order to to kind of you know fix this and I think for the most part it has fixed it but obviously not all the way because it's still going on and we have an update for you Trump issues major threat to California after transgender long jump or qualify for state championship so president Trump threatened to yank federal funding to the entire state of California after a transgender athlete won the long jump and triple jump in a school meeting qualified for the state championships Trump blasted governor Gavin Newsom who he called new scum and called the results not fair and totally demeaning to women and girls quote please be advised that large scale federal funding will be held back maybe permanently Trump threatened on his truth social so this was the full the full the full statement that he posted on truth social saying quote California under the league leadership of radical left Democrat Gavin Newscombe continues to illegally allow men to play in women sports this week a transgender male athlete at a major event won everything and is now qualified to compete in the state finals next weekend as a male he was a less than average competitor as a female this transition person is practically unbeatable this is not fair and totally demeaning to women and girls please be hereby advised that large scale federal funding will be held back maybe permanently if the executive order on the subject matter is not adhered to the governor himself said it is unfair I will speak to him today to find out which way he wants to go in the meantime I am ordering local authorities if necessary to not allow the transition person to compete in the state finals this is totally this is a totally ridiculous situation it is it is and it sucks because if he does yank federal funding that's going to hurt a lot of people in a lot of different ways and so what needs to happen is the people need to get loud and put pressure on Newsom to do the right fucking thing right and get away from all this dude you know the whole trans gender ideology is a is a communist demoralization destabilization ideology people don't understand that bro it started in 1930s Germany specifically in Berlin and this was a precursor to a lot of the shit that happened in Germany because people got super fucking pissed off about it all right this is designed to and 100% is a communist ideology all right it is designed to get people to accept anything as truth if you can convince someone that a man is a woman and a woman is a man and that is the fundamental truth that your two-year-old little girl understands then what can you not get them to be okay with that's the point that's what this is about and that's what it was about back then too okay I'm not into it freedom and we can talk about what happened in World War II and we can talk about all that shit and all the details and what was true and what wasn't true and this and that it doesn't that's that's not what I'm talking about what I'm talking about here is that communist do this and push this to create a situation where truth is not truth anymore so that they can do anything that they want to culture and bro like I wish people would just look into the Vimar Republic and understand what happened there and who was responsible for it by the way it wasn't Jews it was fucking communists of which some of them were Jewish okay but nobody wants to talk about that you know yeah man it's crazy to me I do like the point to that he put in there though about it's either like this happened this way or you know the other argument is all Jews are bad and like bro both of it's both of it's not true no I do like the piece though that he added in there about local law enforcement handling that it they should in the time being yeah because these people that go to these schools these these principles and these teachers they're all fucking far left people yeah and they all think they have more rights it's no different than what we said about the Biden administration thinking that they can do undemocratic and legal things on behalf of what they believe is right right which they cannot that's treason and these people in the school system have that same mentality we don't have to listen to anybody because we know that we're doing what is best and for the common good and the right thing these people firmly believe they are right and they believe they have the moral high ground and authority to to not even listen to parents you see what I'm saying bro like dude and that's that's uh those people should go to jail yeah man this is crazy man guys dumb it gives you an understanding of how far they're willing to go like if you have people in control of the schools in control of government who believe that they don't have to follow the rules because they have the moral high ground and the moral authority to do whatever they want they believe that they know best and what's right and that we're we don't know any better you all you have is the same thing that we had 500 years ago which is a you know a monarchy or a kingdom and that's funny because then they turn around called Trump King no he's following the fucking rules of the it's dude it's just irritating I can't stand the way these people think that they can do whatever they want and by the way is that the person holy shit yep let's see this double listen dude I mean to your point though I just saw this is just came out that person's life is ruined oh yeah yeah like like that dude doesn't even know how bad his life is ruined no you're not he and five more years six more years whatever two more years they're gonna snap out of it and they're gonna realize they were lied to it we're already seeing it in the detransitioner movement every time you see one of these detransitioner kids look up the detransitioner movement every time you see one of these detransitioner kids they talk about how their parents and their teachers and everybody pushed them to do it the doctors pushed them to do it and now they're they're fucked up bro they cut their breasts off or they had a surgery they can't reverse or they took puberty blockers or hormones and it fucked them up bro and they're never they're never going back so think about the mental health of that individual right that person is gonna struggle their whole life because they're always gonna think what could my life have been if I hadn't of listening to these people or they hadn't of pushed me and think how bitter you're going to be towards everybody else for pushing you to do something that ended up ruining your life like dude it's fucking wrong and it's sad and the people who contribute to it belong and fucking prison that's not far right that's common sense did I just saw this thing that um now you know the Democrats they're they're they're pushing this this thing called a shadow cabinet have you seen that where they're they're they're they're saying that uh the people who are going to be operating basically they go against everything that Trump does in all these different positions so like they're saying you know we have pambondi for ag they're saying it's latisha james and like they're coordinating this fucking like treasonous movement like to your point like i mean yeah bro like it's it's the fucking schools it's the teachers it's the principles we wait what do you mean the Democrats just put out a list mark Cuban secretary of of comments latisha james she's the shadow attorney general uh john federman's wife she's the the shadow secretary of of homeland security um 21 heavy hitters to take on trump and refresh the democratic so these are the people that are gonna these are the people will get if the democrats ever get back in office let's try to say they're working now to fucking you know counter anything that comes up now yeah bro what's more Cuban's deal I don't I don't know he's a hard read bro did he get funding from one of these people what is this deal i have no idea man like is he i know he doesn't like Trump yeah no i mean it's just a hateful thing because like dude mark Cuban i mean i don't know i don't know i never met him but like it doesn't he doesn't seem like he's in character like it seems like this came out of the blue and it doesn't feel genuine no it doesn't yeah and i and i mean dude obviously marks a pretty smart motherfucker you know so it's like what what's going on there bro what do you do it yeah like i don't know man but guys jumping on this conversation let us go down to the comments what you guys think gotta keep the cruise cruising got one more thing for you we got headline number three um we don't miss we don't miss come on man we don't um and i'm really happy to see this we don't get the number one ranking by missing yeah that's true i'm saying that's true um i was happy to see this this just came out today um you know we we talked a lot about covid during the show um over the course of the last five years um rfk junior doing some good stuff with the maha movement right this just came out today i don't know why they keep calling it maha or maga or anything obviously that is an inflammatory way to it can be divisive because it's i'm not gonna say divide it can be polarizer i just wish that i wish you know i wish anyway i said what i've said i'm fucking tired man yeah but it was good to see this i just want to go make money and have fun yeah i can build shit you know i'm saying i get it i can't wait till the new app launches and the new podcast launches i mean we're gonna keep this one going because it's funny but um i just enjoy talking about winning way more than i enjoyed talking about any of this shit i get you know very excited about it i get it um but i was happy to see this uh kennedy sets covid vaccines no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women so it's completely off of the the the the cdc's recommendations right um they they they stripped it completely off taken and completely off um here's a club for him it hi everybody i'm robert of kennedy junior your age as a secretary and i'm here today with n i h director dr j about a chariot and f the a commissioner dr marty macarie i couldn't be more pleased to announce that as of today the covid vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the cdc recommended immunization schedule last year the Biden administration urged healthy children to get yet another covid shot despite the lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children that ends today it's common sense that's good science there's no evidence healthy kids need it today and most countries have stopped recommending it for children or now one step closer to realizing president trump's promise to make america healthy again produced by the u.s department of health and human services clearly produced yeah clearly the fuckers need to learn how to act a little bit better i mean i was that was pretty terrible it was pretty bad yeah it was pretty bad i mean the delivery i'm saying yeah i think i mean bro i would have done it with like kid rock or some shit no i mean like i mean look it's okay but like ah whatever i mean i like the message yeah it's good right now little corny yeah for sure now this we got to do a full circle here right because again remember one for a reason um we we got to we got to see we got to make a little forecast prediction here all right because justice that got released this next headline comes in okay and uh i would love to see your thoughts on this this this new headline just just came out highly infectious new covid strain from china that led to massive spike in hospitalizations has spread to the united states including new york city it's a brand new brand new covid strain remember i told you that that they at any time these people can release something that's actually deadly bro at any time bro people don't realize that and isn't it ironic that just as our hhs you know removes this recommendation from american citizens that we now have only that dude listen it gives them here here's the play that they're gonna try to run or one of the plays they could run all right and i said i've been saying this for years for years i've been saying this we ought to probably throw the clips in here a few of them so that they can see they will do this again only this time instead of just villainizing and shaming and trying they will actually criminalize the people who are against it because this time it actually will kill people okay so this is their plan in my opinion to remove the dissenters once and for all i think they're gonna run another pandemic play i think it's i think it's a possibility i think it's an above 90 percent possibility but they will run another pandemic play that's sometimes soon in the future where it actually kills people and then people like me and people like rogan and people like rfk and all these other people who have stood up and said bullshit right they will criminalize and put those people in jail or execute them to remove the dissenting voices from because they'll be able to say look see this is the damage that they actually caused right no and all they have to do is release something that's truly deadly one of the plays that they could run is releasing an actual strain of some sort of COVID or other infectious disease that has a high mortality rate and then that they have a cure to that they can all immunize themselves with and then blame the people who called out the first one for the lack of belief in the second one and then criminally prosecute them if they get back in power that's that's the play that's what i mean or it just kills them yeah right you know i'm saying like so you know dude this is why this this is why i've been saying for years that this can't be handled slow it has to be handled fast and all of these people need to be arrested now because they have the ability to release shit that they've probably already made that actually will kill people which frames people like me and you and everybody else who's saying hey this is bullshit by the way with all the data that's been accurate we've been accurate about all of it right right and then say look what they did they created doubting people and they didn't listen and they didn't do this in this and now they're dead it's their fault do they try that the first time right but the the thing didn't actually kill people directly now the vaccine is causing tremendous mortality oh yeah all cars mortality has been up as much as 40 percent um we covered that thing with my card i just last week didn't we you know they're now saying that you know the Biden cancer thing was caused by the vaccine well i mean i don't know about that they say yeah i mean that's what they're saying i don't think he took it you don't think it's just old and healthy i think him i didn't not even be true i think it might be something else but the point of the matter is is that by us not acting fast it gives them the opportunity to do very nefarious things and i've been saying this for years is that what you're getting at yeah you know and this is the point of people who call it out way ahead of time being ignored especially when they have the credibility of being right at a very high degree yeah they're actually have i missed on a few things yeah no doubt bro but remember i don't have all the data to pull from either i've got what the news puts out you know yeah and that's the thing the other piece of the suit that i think is interesting man is like you know we have been in a battle with china specifically yeah we've pissed a lot of them off you know i'm saying they're government i should say you know i'm saying so like dude they can genetically they can they can target these things so that only so correct yes yeah for sure that's also been proven i mean i've gay junior talked about he talked he got in trouble for it because he he talked about it but it's it's true yeah it's true dude i don't know man this shit it's wild in the sand right now just in china they had 81 severe cases in the past four weeks and of those 81 cases 30 of those people died also within the last four weeks wait 30 of the 81 30 of the so almost half almost half almost half and the vast majority of the cases they were in adults there was 65 and up so i mean do sounds very similar to what i was saying ow yeah well you know if they do it it's because we didn't act fast and the government didn't arrest these people and the people didn't fucking do their jobs they let they let one or two or three people say all the shit because they were terrified so you know these people should all be like legitimately the people involved who organized this should be all arrested today everywhere globally every leader of the of the entire world should be arresting these people and if the leaders were in on it you know like the world economic forum those guys should all be arrested you know Fauci the whole crew all be arrested and they should all be held with the military tribunal and probably executed so that this shit doesn't ever happen true man so it's crazy shit what keep you guys updated on this three times i've called for execution this show three times yeah see why we're all see why we're number one yeah that's right but real talk what do you do man if you want people to not commit crazy ass shit you got to hold people accountable in a savage way that's the truth bro like if we had laws in this country where if people were caught like undeniably raping murdering you know violent sexual crime violent violent murders if we had videos and and and dude maybe not even videos anymore because of AI but like indisputable indisputable evidence you know evidence of these things happening these people if these people knew that they were going to be dissected on national television alive in front of everybody they wouldn't do these things you wouldn't have people driving cars through crowds you wouldn't have people indiscriminately just killing people like you wouldn't have it you know what i mean it wouldn't it do and to be real that's the world i want to live in i want to live in a world where i don't have to worry about people doing shit because they're not afraid of the consequences you know we we all work hard and we try to hold standards and we do good things and we pay and a ridiculous amount of taxes which we that's a whole nother topic but we shouldn't have to live with this shit it's real and until we all of us the people get together and demand that it fucking stops and demand that people be held accountable it's never going to change because there's no fear yeah guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think with that being said let's get to our final second of the show as always with thumbs up or done as far as we're bringing headline ever talk about it um it's got a Japan

cheap they can't make no profit that's because it ain't good well no body's the capitalist economy says that you are wrong no the problem i know what it is says the best products win it's a real estate thing because the best restaurants they take over the clothes down pizza huts and like there's just not a big supply of those out here that's that's my answer the market dictates demand for the best okay all right it was the best that would be the way it is mm-hmm okay that's just what it is hey same same oh man i think you're on to something i mean listen bro every good restaurant you find a Chinese food place that used to be a long john solvers bro you're in a good business you're in a good spot bro listen it is yeah it might taste good until you fucking get food poisoning wow you'd be

culture you see the tattoos dragons okay and those Japanese coy tattoo styles are pretty bad at it bro yeah fucking sick they don't look good on everybody though no but man the guys that looks good on are fucking it's fucking badass for sure um but yeah so our thumbs up or dumb as fuck dragons Japanese this judge dragons Japan let's go to it it's like a dragon roll no experts solve mystery of ancient mummified dragon discovered by Japanese shogun mummified creature dates back to the 11th century okay so researchers believe they've cracked the mystery of a mummified rainbow dragon that's been sitting in a Japanese treasure house for centuries the dragon has been stashed at the shoshan treasure house in the historic japanese city of nara according to penu's the remains were reportedly found by yoshinori ashigaga ashigaga a 15th century shogun in 1429 okay so this is shogun that's the mummified remains all right this is a that's his remains no this is the dragon this is the dragons remains okay so they that like you know it's real thing all right now they've been doing some research some analysis on this okay and I personally I could I think dragons were real at a point in time in history you also think that Chinese food in the hood is superior same same it is Andy it fucking is man all right sorry man you're wrong kernels Andy okay he like it's fucking I'm telling you bro I'm telling you if it was that good it would be that way everywhere that is the way fucking the economy works so you don't why why people to have it no no no that's what it is but because if it came out here to the county you know what else would come out here with it and we don't want that okay that's already happened me I know you're here now I got to move out to the fucking country yeah fuck they're following me stop asking for our food out here man you keep this contained for like I mean I'm saying it's possible well anyway the dragon yes okay now you're your first thought I mean do you buy it listen man I really honestly don't know okay I don't know okay I think that there's been a lot of things in history that we have been completely lied about so I am open to hearing whatever okay well so what they're saying uh that this guy actually found and discovered is not a dragon at all they are saying um that it is where's the sorry some short dinosaur no it's even crazier than that they're saying it's it's called a a mark in I believe is the word it is yeah a Martin it's a female Japanese Martin it's a fluffy weasel-like animal that is this this is a Martin yeah they're saying that this is the dragon I don't buy it bro I don't know what's that movie with Matthew McConaughey and he fights the dragons like in there in the future dragon they find the dragon and it comes out of the mind and then it takes over the world it's like rain of fire or something like that I think that's what it's called rain of fire it's pretty good rain like rain drops yeah rain of fire pretty good
