That's what we're gonna do. I know this is a special cruise the internet because normally these come on a Friday But we're trying to give you to this week, you know the old the old tag team be three triple team triple team. Yeah, some of your hose will like that What the hose that don't share the show on that. Yeah, they're gonna love it. Yeah, anyway Let's just get into the show. Yeah, let's get into it man guys. Don't forget we do have a feed for the show though speaking of those hosts. Yeah, the fee is share the fucking show and don't be it. Oh, yeah, yeah, right. Well, let's get it to her. Maybe you like the triple team nasty motherfuckers. It is some nasty people out there bro. I did. We'll just look at Instagram for an hour Five minutes. Yeah, five. Well, I just saw a real this is the problem with society. I just saw a real from one of those red pill shows where there's a young girl I mean 25 probably Talking about how she gives her man a blowjob and then until she throws up and then she sucks to throw up off of his fucking pee Yeah, so what's wrong? Yeah This is on me and my point is is it and then she loves she's like sometimes I just throw up on the floor my dog eats it No, that's disgusting. Yeah, like that's the level of fucking human being that we're dealing with in the world like that's the that's the degradation of culture Like almost like there's like a lot of times I really feel I'm like fuck bro. Just give us those nukes Just give him to us bro. Even if it fucking gets me we deserve it release the crack. Yeah, like it's disgusting, dude. That's low shit, man But It's not like humanity hasn't been through this before we went through this 1920s and 30s Germany with the Vimar Republic if you know your history you know that so you can go back and look at The degradation of culture in that time period was actually worse than what's going on now, but we're definitely headed down the fucking History repeats itself, man, and it comes in cycle. Oh, it's just gross It's just gross to me that like these young women have resorted to Just straight up like disgusting shit on the internet. You know what I'm saying? It's so public now Yeah, dude, and like talking about it laughing about it like it's no big thing and like Like bro, you're that shit's gonna be on the internet forever You know, and I don't know it's whatever man And then they wonder why they can't find no good dudes and these all these fucking stupid bitches think they're gonna Fuckin find some rich dude who's real smart to take care of them What they don't realize is that rich dude he's smart for fucking reason. He's rich for easy. Yeah, you ain't you don't want that You know what some girl that's talking about fucking that on the internet. No, it's just they don't even understand what they're doing dude No, like imagine meeting a woman like that when she's 35 and then Finding the videos of that on the internet. Yeah, man. They're gonna work. No, it ain't gonna work And it can't work for any dude. The only dudes is gonna work for like low life like Dudes that just want to bang. That's it. There's no long-term commitment there and it's just like I could see it But it's whatever and dude. It's funny because you know 10 years ago I was just way more fucking socially liberal than I am now. I had to really like I Used to like not care what people did I used to think like you know It doesn't matter what people do let them do their thing let them be them I'll be me they'll lose I win and that's good enough But it's not good enough because look what it's done to culture and look what's done to society And these people should be shamed they should be made fun of they should be ostracized Really real talk we got to get back to a high more high level Stay and I'm bro listen. I'm gonna tell you this and let's not say like like this nobody's perfect Bro, that's not the point exactly. I was gonna say that bro I've made every fucking mistake you can make in life all of them girl But like I recognize that they were mistakes and I corrected the behavior and I try to do the right thing from there on out Yeah, like real hard, you know what I'm saying? It's like nobody's even thinking about no future car I don't fucking care bro. It's about like shares and engagement on the internet the internet is truly ruined humanity And those of you who weren't around before it don't understand what I mean when I say that you think it's better. It's not even It's not even close to better. It's it's a hundred times worse societies a hundred times worse since the intake the invention of the internet No, no and pretty much every way the only way it's better is that you can make money a little bit faster Well, that's literally about it. Let me fuck you look at the hate you look at the bullying the I mean the degradation and morality of our women and even men like the show I mean it's like the scam some fucking church choir mother's one thing that has nothing to do with that But it's just that then on the other side we got to rebuild this standard in society Yeah, but then on the other side we have all these people like finding God again, right? Mm-hmm. I feel like Jesus and God have become like a new thing for a lot of younger people But in the same breath that they're talking about Jesus and God They're coming down on people so hard and condemning people so hard like they're perfect You know what I'm saying like like three weeks ago, bro. You forgot that you did those things. Yeah, and you did these things and You know you have skeletons in your closet and if all these godly people out here had their skeletons exposed like a lot of people have happened to them We'd see a whole different picture right and how often does that happen? It doesn't happen because mostly Like it does happen sometimes we're like these godly people like I think that's karma Yeah, I know when you ride around on a on a holier than thou message and a holier than thou um Persona eventually it comes out that you're not as holy as you pretend to be Well, my point is because I am a godly person. I I'm not perfect. I'm I'm I'm sure God's like what the fuck most of the time All right real talk, but I do my best, bro and People wonder why more people don't like go to church or find God or find Jesus and it's because the people that That promote it the most or the biggest hypocrites and everybody can see it plain as day You see what I'm saying? Absolutely, bro. So it's a it's a very it's a like all you guys find in Jesus and find God Why don't you actually study what it means to be a holy person? You know understand, you know He who's without sin cast the first stone is a principle to live by these motherfuckers launching boulders Yeah, and and and fucking think that they don't live in a glass house Yeah, and that's why people won't go to church. That's why people when they hear church They won't they're like yeah because of people like that So like dude if you're one of these people and by the way I think it's awesome that people are finding Jesus and finding God and finding something bigger than themselves to believe in or compass I love that. Yeah, but don't be a fucking hypocrite bro and push people away Don't be a hypocrite and and judge people don't be this don't be this guy Don't be the guy those Christian people are the reason that not everybody believes because they push them out Anyway, that's my soul. That's real shit, man Dude it's been on my mind man because I could see the younger generations getting more in tune with Jesus and God Which I think is great, but I don't think it's great the way that they prance around like You know they've done no bad or they've done no harm or they've done, you know and you know what I'm saying It's like dude if you really want to fucking live in in in the footsteps of Jesus Let's hear your fucking skeletons motherfucker before you start throwing them on everybody else You see what I'm saying? Yeah, bro humans are not perfect. That's what it talks about in the Bible You're not designed to be perfect. You're designed to be someone who makes mistakes You're supposed to make mistakes. That's the point Jesus died for the sins of mankind to walk around and pretend like you have no sins What do you think God thinks God sees all the things that you do and you're what and then what do you think he thinks when you walk around And act like you're holier than now and then he knows what you fucking did that's not endearing to God God looks at you and says you're full of shit bro and by the way you're using my name for clout fuck you That's what he says if he was in 2024 See who really gets sent eternal damnation Said they were really see you get sent away for the comments for people All I can't believe Andy talks about God and uses profanity. There's profanity in the Bible scubula means shit There's all kinds of it actually. There's hell over there. No, there's actual profanity in the fucking Bible scubula It means shit. Huh.

You got Like this head army it's WF EU chief vonder lane Demand censorship of industrial scale disinformation in Davos the typical shit I mean this is expected they mean us. Yeah, that's us like they're trying to you know really really push it on private businesses And people like us tech censorship in this face of industrial scale disinformation world only people putting out industrial scale Disinformation is that is them. Yeah, no 100% But just trying to do it more that's all that is but I mean a lot of the typical shit You know they talked about how trumps victory if Trump was is to win the 2024 presidential election And get back in the lighthouse they would pose a quote fundamental challenge to Europe That came from the black rock chief. That's that's that's not what they meant to say what they meant to say was Trump victory repose a fundamental challenge to our plans for Europe. Yeah. Yeah, no, that's 100% what it is Yeah Challenge the my plans for you. Yeah Like I said a lot of typical shit you guys you know, Zalinski's back there. He's begging for money again. That's no surprise John Kerry got got snapped on I'm about his carbon footprints By that plane does know right. Yeah, he does not own but his wife or something like that owns yeah Secretary of state Anthony Blinken he got traded in there on his Boeing I wonder why that would be But here's the real news We got to talk about a Argentina president Melee he lit the stage on fire This headline reads long live freedom dammit Argentine is me lay dazzles Davos with tirade Like an Argentine William Wallace Javier Melee cried freedom at the end of a world economic form speech in Davos and which he put forward a case for radical global capitalism Mobbed by the media and attendees Argentine is new president delivered a speech the likes of which the state halls Have really heard in 54 years Part neoclassical economic lecture part Trumpian tirade his speech called for small government the removal of bureaucratic elites and the calling of any form of gender equality policies while also attacking any form of collectivist economics After all socialism quote murdered 100 million people Mr. Melee said met by muted laughter from those in attendance Quote long live freedom dammit. He said to applause after a 23-minute address Mr. Melee took office last last month pledging to roll back the Argentine state after an election campaign punctuated With populist tirade. Here's a clip of his intro. Good afternoon Thank you very much Today I'm here To tell you that the Western world is in danger And it is in danger because those who are supposed to have to defend the values of the West I Co-opted by a Vision of the world that inactually leads to socialism and thereby to poverty Unfortunately in recent decades Motivated by some well-meaning Individuals willing to help others and others motivated by the wish to be long to a privileged cast The main leaders of the Western world have abandoned the model of freedom for different versions of what we call collectivism We're here to tell you that collectivist experiments and never the solution to the problems that afflict the citizens of the world rather They are the root cause I mean Freedom dammit He's on the Andy what do you got on this? I mean, I think he's I think he's being very polite because he's in their home You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I think he has either food I think yeah, no ship, bro I was in him. Yeah, right If I was him I wouldn't eat or drink anything there. I get the fuck out of there right away But you know when he says well-meaning individuals that care that are inadvertently leading people to a version of collectivism I don't believe that to be true. I believe he's giving them the benefit of the doubt For the sake of being polite in their home, right? You go to someone's home. You don't tell him the full truth you tell them the very nice way Yeah, you know what I mean? That's what it sounded like to me. I mean he's right and they're smiling and laughing because they're Cheering the accomplishments of the mission. They've set forth So when they laugh about a hundred million people being depopulated or when they snicker about when he says freedom They're laughing because they think they're winning. So that's an important point I think for people to understand, you know, why would they laugh? Well, these people are fucks. They're evil, dude They don't must say like what's funny about they are not well. They're not well-meaning individuals. No So they're disgusted by us like this woman here. She's disgusted by us. She this woman is so Elite in terms of her life, right how she lives where she flies what she does She she would not come to your home for dinner like she would be disgusted. She would put on like gloves to walk in your home and like You know probably a mask and probably like Make weird faces and like insult you. That's how these people think of us So I think it's important to understand these these are the people they tell you to hate when they tell you to eat the rich These are the rich and people like me. It's not small business owner who became you know Success story in your local economy. That's not that's not what they mean. They mean they they mean us, but that's When they say eat the rich. They're the rich. This is who he's yeah It's real shit man. These yeah, I mean do these people are fucks. Yeah Yeah No guys, let us know what you guys think on this topic down in the comments I'm sorry to see me lay doing doing well, though man Yeah, for the time being yeah, you know It's also interesting that You know like dude real talk Watching how they've operated if you go back and watch How the global economic forum has operated and how this communist insurgis operated for the last 50 60 years You know, they could have pulled this off in the in the late 70s early 80s here in America and they didn't And it makes me think you know that they're going to start inserting Descenting voices intentionally into their program because they realize they can't fully they can't fully go all the way and get their way You know, I believe that they intended to try to get their way when COVID happened But they I mean you've heard Klaus Schwab even say that the resistance was much more than they anticipated We have to regain their trust now correct So yeah, that's the theme of the Davos summit. So you know, this is a guy who could be there to help regain Their trust they're allowing him to speak they're they're not you know You know, they're allowing Trump to have more and more say again. I mean after since the the primary or the caucus the other night You could see the mainstream media personalities start to Slide their tune over to where they're like well, you know, I'm not personally for Donald Trump But he may be the president, you know instead of like So you know who knows we're for the way that the way they do this is they push and push and push and push and push and push And then take like two steps back. It's like four steps forward two steps back with them And so like we have to be very cautious that we never let these people have an inch ever again with any of this bullshit You know what I'm saying? Yeah, we can't get to where they can't we as individuals can never go and allow this to ever happen again And this starts with us telling the truth. It starts with us speaking the truth You know, I get I get called a lot of names for some of the things I say on the show But like the one thing that I never get called Are very rarely get called to saying well, he's telling you not telling the truth Right in the liar we and we as individuals In this country especially have to start speaking the truth even if it hurts people's feelings Nobody wants to hurt people's feelings Nobody wants to hurt to say something About trans people when certain people have trans daughters or suck right like nobody wants to hurt those people But the reality is is we have to call things what they are You know what I mean nobody wants to talk about the crime otherwise people be talking about it But you know, I'm saying it's uncomfortable We have to tell the truth about uncomfortable things if we want to create a situation where these people cannot Advanced or agenda and it's as simple as that You know all of these social weapons that we've been on the receiving end of For the last 25 years are real okay, you know political correctness Participation trophies the removal of competition the removal of the plush of allegiance You know silent majority, you know Me too like feminist movement all of these things are our weapons Self-sensorship, you know don't say that because you might offend this person These are weapons so that they can dilute the truth to a point where nothing matters except your objective Reality that you get to create and that's not that's that's what a lot of these young kids think they don't think there is a true reality That exists they think that their reality is based upon a perception that they get to the side That's whatever. Yeah, like if I say that this this is water They're they can say well no, I don't agree to that's water. I agree that that's Pepsi Yeah, and if you say different you're you're stepping into their space and not respecting their Their perspective and bro, that's bullshit. Yeah, you're perspective. Yeah, you're perspective doesn't deserve any respect because it's based in lies It's based outside of the realm of facts. So when we see someone who is Uh, you know like the leotama situation where a grown man is swimming with women That's not that's not up for debate. This is a man A thousand years from now they dig up his bones. They're gonna be able to tell that was a dude You see what I'm saying and we can't sit here and respect these people's uh perspectives at the risk of uh at destroying everybody else's perspective So what we're saying is the the perspective of a protected class a few individuals is more important than actual reality for society How's that gonna work? Well, it doesn't work and it's very clear it's not supposed to work. Yeah, that's right That's correct. It's not supposed to work. It's supposed to remove All reality from the situation for the purpose of removing any Uh Loyalty or any You know patriotism one might have to their culture of their country so that they can form a one-world government That's what this is all about. Yeah, that's what these people have been pushing for the last fifty-six years. Right You know guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think on Davos 24 Um, that being said, let's keep this cruise moving. Let's head over to the comments got cruise the comments this comment comes from at uh ricky bee'sly 52 20 he says My wife saw what DJ looked like for the first time when we had the show on while working out She said it was weird to see because she thought DJ was white Let's not listen to show that much Do I not like me like are you saying that I sound white? I don't sound racist to me Just saying look her Rick You know i'm saying Like what Do i need to put like a bottle of Hennessy up here to uh, I mean, I don't know maybe we saw a new port 100s. I wish you guys won't I don't know Bro, I think half the black people think you're fucking white too, bro You know saying This way this man headline number two Uh headline number two reads Vivek at Trump event 45th president will shut down the deep state Uh, entrepreneur and farmer 2024 Republican presidential candidate Vivek Rama swami declared former president Donald Trump Uh, would quote shut down the deep state If elected back into the white house while speaking at a Trump campaign event in new hamster I'm a swami's appearance uh at the acconson new hamster event Tuesday evening comes the day after he dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Trump following the 45th president's record breaking victory in the Iowa caucuses Monday I'm in the video stream to rumble by right side broadcasting the 38 year-old Rama swami said and his impassioned populist pitch on behalf of Trump But the nation is in a war uh, that is quote between the permanent state and the everyday citizen He said the country needs a commander in chief who will lead us to victory in this war. Here's the quick clip There's not a better choice left in this race than this man right here And that is why I am asking you to do the right thing as new hamster and to vote for Donald J. Trump as your next president Because we're not working with a lot of time here If our kids are in high school before we get this right We don't have a country left that's what it means we've been celebrating our diversity and our differences For so long that we forgot all of the ways that we are the same as Americans bound by that common set of ideals that set this country into motion We believe those ideals still exist this man is going to be your next president to revive them e pluribus unum From many one And you know how we're doing it. We're doing it by speaking the truth at every step of the way There are two genders in this country period that is the truth Fossil fuels are a requirement for human prosperity drill frack burn coal embrace nuclear energy Reverse racism is racism and open border is not a border Parents determine the education of their children the nuclear family is the greatest form of governance known to mankind Capitalism lifts us up from poverty There are three branches of government in the United States not four And the US Constitution is the strongest and greatest guarantor of freedom in human history That is the truth We fight for the truth We stand up for the truth that is what won us the American Revolution That is what reunited us after the civil war That is what won us two world wars and the cold war that is what still gives hope to the free world And if we can revive that dream Over group identity and victimhood and grievance Then nobody in the world Not a nation not a corporation not a virus not China is going to defeat us That is what American exceptionalism is all about that is what we are going to revive to yes make America great again Vote for this man right here in the New Hampshire primary god bless you and your families and may god bless our united states of America Thank you new hamster. It's good to see you guys We're coming back and winning this in a landslide. We will not stop until we get this job done Thank you all god bless you and your families Yeah, and to that Donald Trump uh, I agree with everything he said no now except the part where he said we celebrate diversity Because we don't we don't go sat satire We don't celebrate diversity no we celebrate we celebrate in the in the wrong ways We celebrate the achievements of every culture except The white culture and then we remove a lot of the facts about white culture and pretend that they weren't It's not white culture that did these things and there's we see this in this Critical race theory and in the history classes at school. Yes other minority cultures have been celebrated for the last 15 years But white people have not so I think that's just an important point to say. No, that's real But to that Donald Trump you too like when he says that I'm like what are you talking about? Yeah So I know we remake every movie. Yeah, it has white people in it with fucking black people in it Or fucking or we remake ghost busters with women. I'm just saying it's it's I'm not like upset about it I'm just saying like the city we convinced him. I'm just saying it's important to fucking point out like we need to stop this shit Yeah, we need to start telling the truth everything else he said I totally agree with yeah Um, but to that so Donald Trump responded to that the uh, I took the stage and did a little celebration hug and embrace and then Donald Trump made a very interesting statement. Let's watch the clip on that Oh Thank you. Thank you Wow, that's how was that pretty good right? I was pretty good and he's a fantastic guy and he's really uh He's got something that's very special because he started off with a zip-o and he's got He ended up very strongly did a great job. I was actually surprised when he called because he was doing well And it's an honor to have his endorsement. He's gonna be working with us and he'll be working with us for a long time Thank you. Yeah, that's true. That might be true, but Trump's Trump's notoriously terrible at picking people to work with That's true. Okay, look at all the people he picked in his first term that ended up turning on him I you know And let's be real the minute that Rama Swami steps on Trump's toes in any way shape or form Or it's a perceived step on his toes. Trump's gonna fucking destroy him. They like still the spotlight Yeah, he's gonna say he's a piece of shit When in reality, bro If if a vague is who he appears to be in my opinion Which we could all be wrong Trump needs somebody like the vague who can Speak before him because no offense to Donald Trump, but you know, he's a little older He's not as passionate as he once was he's not as great of a speaker as he once was when we touched on this on our last episode You know, Trump Trump is not very good at like painting the picture of what we're going to do He's just very good at like defending himself or attacking people who are out of line. Yeah, which is necessary But we need vision and we need tactics and we need a vision painted for us And Rama Swami is good at doing that and so hopefully that you know Vivek is who he claims to be I I personally my per I personally think he is But I don't trust anybody anymore, you know what I mean? So My gut says that you know, he is he is who you know, he's got little kids, dude He heard him. He said, you know, they're gonna be in high school. We won't have a country. I agree with that I think most people agree with that. I think that's the truth And I think he's worried about that. You know, I've spoken with him a lot like him and I've spoke You know outside the podcast quite a bit and I don't know man You know, he could be a really good liar too. Who knows? But at the end of the day, you know I will say that the santa's crowd has become like so anti-Trump that it's fucking disgusting Like real talk like you guys I like I see I see all these tweets of people Talking all this crazy shit about how they're not gonna vote for Trump if he's the nominee and he's ruined the Republican party In this and that and I click on their profile and all these people are you know, they live in a nice house and they live in a they have a decent financial situation and some of them are even very wealthy and They're like throwing a selfish tamper temper tantrum because their candidate just got spanked in Iowa And they're saying and valing never Trump never Trump never Trump And like bro, are you really an American like real talk to even say that because we all know what's gonna happen if Biden remains president And all those there's all these people I hear that can't make paychecks connect, you know, and they make ends meet They're suffering. They're struggling. They're they're they're on the verge of of totally losing everything and some of them a lot of them have lost everything because of this And we got these elite the santa supporters, you know and saying I'm never gonna vote for Trump even if he's a nominee That's a very selfish take bro like you're gonna let the you're gonna let the country burn for your own ego You know what I'm saying? There's a lot of things about Trump that I disagree with for real But you know why I'm successful in life because I've mastered decision making I don't get the right decision every time I make a decision like when I come in here to work very often in fact most of the time the two decisions I'm presented with neither are perfect Right so I make the best decision of what's available and then when I get down that line and another decision time comes I make the best decision again. I don't throw temper tantrums because it's not perfect or it's not my way or it's not what it is I make the best decision that's gonna move us forward in a way that you know produces long-term success and it's weird to me to watch these grown adults stop their feet and kick kick air and shit Because the santa's got his ass beat and and Iowa, you know what I mean? whooped like motherfucker like Trump's gonna be the nominee dude like you guys are gonna have to eat some crow Like real talk and you're gonna have to realize that like you know You're probably the only rich person in your family You're probably the person that decides who gets taken care of and you probably take care of your whole family and all this shit Like most rich people do that are ultra rich and shit. Okay. They handle business for their family Your family's gonna be fucked bro, and that's gonna be more money out of your pocket That's gonna be more responsibility for you You see what I'm saying? These people are not thinking it through and those of you the own businesses that are saying this shit You're you're a fucking idiot Like you're gonna you're gonna kill your own customers like how could people buy your shit if if you What You won't vote and participate in moving the country Maybe not in the idea way, but in the in the best available way at the time So you're gonna cut your own fucking throat because you're ego that makes no sense bro It is stupid and it like You know, we see a lot of it on the internet man And like I can I can hear the criticisms of Trump like I can hear yeah, hey man, you know like There's some things about him that he's fucking done wrong. I wish he would have done different that I wish he was different on but the reality is is those are the choices we have right now We don't have another choice this year. I'm glad. I don't agree agree 100% with everything he says it does you're not supposed to yeah exactly the point yeah But who's the best and I think personally if it's the census of Trump and you make it it's like bro it It's a wasted vote for one And you're an idiot you don't want you don't want you to be you don't want the problems you see fix because no You're your own life because you're ego it's stupid and you're gonna destroy the life of your friends and your family and your customers You're not gonna have a business it's stupid listen dude if you want a small business in America This is real if you want a small business in America and I mean one that's not part of Davos and World Economic Forum. I mean a small business If you if Biden goes for four more years that you will not have a business So you should think about that there will be no business for you Yeah, it's interesting to that like the census hasn't dropped out nor has Haley Um, I think it's highly irresponsible the census really fucked himself, dude The census got surrounded by the run on easy to run on ego or like He's running because see like I feel like there's this too right like why would they not be dropping out? Bro the santa's is fucking stupid. I'll tell you why I think he's a I think he's good at the job I think he would do a good job But he's a terrible campaigner and terrible strategic guy How do you just right now? Florida just flipped some seats in Congress the fucking Democrat because they got an absentee governor Yeah, you see what I'm saying. I'm so busy out here. Yeah, yeah, so now we're in a situation where you know like the census if you had had some some help some humility and some patience You would be the automatic president in 2028 now you're gonna have to compete with Ramaswamy and some other people Who have not yet said they're gonna do anything see what I'm saying I do yeah So see I look at it like this like he would have been automatic pick I'm almost getting like a sense of like over arrogance from the Sanctus and I say that because like Like what does he know that we don't like does he think that the like bro? Trump's gonna be the nominee What would stop him from me in that if they arrest him and those indictments go through? So is he banking on Trump getting arrested and not me? You know, I'm saying like what it what are you? Why are you still in the fight bro? Your states falling apart? Listen these people were real Americans like for real like we're If real Americans and they cared about country and they cared about the people they say they care about All of them were drop out and we'll create one massive movement That's my biggest issue am I can they but each one of them look up there and they'll try to talk about DEI right? Okay, cool. So it is meritocracy best person for the job right Right you're not it. Yeah back to fuck out Look, I think the Sanctus could do a good job I just think that he's playing some very bad cars strategically. Yeah, where he if he would just wait four more years His record in Florida could have been that much greater and I said this before he ran. Mm-hmm So let's not this isn't hindsight analysis like I fucking said this is what he should do and if he had me in his here Somebody who's actually smart instead of a bunch of fucking paid morons We would you would have been present in 28 but now you're gonna have to compete with some other people And those other people are gonna build massive fucking movements from now until then Yeah, cuz you're gonna be working on cleaning up the shit storm in your state. Yeah To a shit final thoughts on this real quick MSM they refuse to show and refuse to air Donald Trump's victory speech in Iowa But they ran Haley in the Sanctus is mm-hmm. Yeah, I saw that. Did you see the clip of Maddo? Yeah, it was insane Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just have to do a little bit of business just for a second At this point in the evening the projected winner of the Iowa caucuses Has just started giving his victory speech We will keep an eye on that as it has you want you to mention his name? Who's made in that speech if there's anything no worthy something substantive and important The reason I'm saying this is Of course there is a reason that we and other news organizations have generally stopped giving an unfiltered live platform To remarks by former president Trump. It is not out of spite. It is not a decision that we relish it is of course In that we regularly revisit um and honestly earnestly it is not an easy decision But there is a cost to us as a news organization of knowingly broadcasting untrue things That is a fundamental truth of our business and who are and so history You guys stop tonight will not fuck her Okay, you you fucking you fucking ran COVID into the dirt telling everybody they're gonna fucking die Yeah, you had a covert trick Take her on your fucking screen scaring people into death for your cause you lied about fucking Russia Trump collusion Which was fucking proven fact and then and then when that was proven that was a lie. They didn't say shit Okay, they still go with it. You lied about J6 you lied about voting You lied about all kinds of shit You lied about COVID and people died They lied about Ivory Mecton. They said it didn't work They lied about hydroxcloroquine. They said there was no therapeutic These people are fucking criminals dude And the reason that they don't want to show Donald Trump is because they are afraid that if Trump gets back in power That they will be held liable for the damage that they cause society as they should be There should be no immunity for people like this. No No, but they definitely uh, they did their Haley uh, Nikki Haley and uh Yeah, Nikki Haley talk like she won the fucking election row. Yeah, she did. It was kind of weird. She's a weirdo Yeah, did you know this she fucking you know the Nikki Haley's not a real name. No, it's like Did you know that non-Morrata? Did you know that? I didn't know that Numerado. Yeah, uh, I was talking to Linda and she fucking told me that yeah She's like indian wake up with Linda if you guys aren't following her. She's got some good takes she's gonna show a few times What does Numerado mean She's indian or something I think she's a do yeah, do you know her Oh What is that racist? Is it? Toughen up Well guys, let's keep this cruise moving tell us down in the comments what you guys thought about that headline And now for a little special segment you got something for you all right, but we got we got lay down some some fundamental rules Okay, so this segment is Just leaving this here. Oh, so I'm gonna throw up a headline and you can't say anything about it. Okay. All right I don't know if I can do this I'm gonna fail this test. So guys today is just leaving this here headline reads ex leader of Canadian LGBTQ pride group accused of child sex crimes Just leaving that here Yeah Yep, just leaving that here Is that it that's him. Yeah, just just leaving that here All right, you did it you did it get it Hold it hold it Just leaving this one man. It's even right. Hey man. Hey I'm shocked That failed no you're good outside the safe zone. We're good. All right headline number three That's not number three reads undercover FBI agents helped autistic teen playing trip to join ISIS Now I gotta give I gotta give some applause here and I got plenty of context here, right? This is diversity equity inclusion Mm-hmm But you know, we covered a couple of stories. So this is about the intercept again, right? And they should just make him president Who the autistic teen? Oh, yeah, that way we can show that we're not discriminatory against autistic people in terrorists Yeah, yeah, yeah, we don't hate terrorists. We don't discriminate against autistic people Hopefully, you know, he's he's a minority of a pock. He is right. Oh, is he okay? So we can check all the boxes. We could just put him in charge and let him run shit see what happens Great no, but like I mean we recover stories on this and like there's some lot of fucked up shit about this I just want to talk about it. Let's let's dive into this article Hums a Mashqor hot just cleared security a Denver international airport when the FBI showed up the agents had come to arrest the 18 year old Who was diagnosed with the developmental disability and charged him with terror related crimes At the time of the arrest a relative later said in court Mashqor was reading diary of a weapon kid a book written for elementary school children But now Mashqor had gone to the airport on December 18th to fly to Dubai and from there to either Syria or Afghanistan As part of his alleged plot to join the Islamic State the trip had been spurred by over a year of online exchanges Starting when Mashqor was 16 years old with four people he believed were members of ISIS According to the Justice Department's criminal complaint the four were actually undercover FBI agents As a result of his conversations with the FBI Mashqor could face a lengthy sentence for attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization At an initial court hearing family members said that Mashqor who had just turned Who had turned 18 just a few weeks prior to the arrest had intellectual difficulties and have been diagnosed with autism Despite acknowledging Mashqor's family support and his young age the judge ordered that he be detained while awaiting trial Quote is not lost on this court that mr. Mashqor is a young man with possible mental illness and the diagnosis of high functioning autism It is clear he has a sea of familiar familial support the judge said Quote but based on this evidence There's no reasonable assurance that the court can simply chalk all of this up to the defendant simply being a young man Law enforcement agents first became aware of Mashqor's online activities in support of ISIS in November 2021 But instead of alerting his family Mashqor's lawyer told the intercept the FBI agents posing as ISIS members But fronted him a year later and strung him along until he became a legal adult Quote it is a pauling that the government never once reached out to his parents Even while they were sending undercover agents to befriend him online Starting when he was 16 years old said Joshua Herman but offense attorney representing Mashqor Quote almost all of the conduct he is alleged to have committed took place when he was a juvenile I'm gonna. It's not the first time they did this a couple of times to a couple of different people 18 year old arrested on terrorism charges is mentally like a child More one teen and three FBI operatives was the government behind a 17 year-olds terror plot in Texas Um or this one after his mother asked for help FBI terrorism sting targets mentally ill teen they have a history of doing this. Yeah And it's interesting because with J6 just passing not too long ago you got this guy Ray Epps who is on video Saying let's go in the capital over and over and over literally in the night before and the day of literally inciting it But he's just into this appropriation that has no jail time at all and guess what There is record of him being a paid informer. I've seen the idea. Yeah. Why is there yes? I don't know that. Yeah, it was in the court documents Well, that's allegedly. I haven't seen that. I've seen it with my own time. It was in the court. It was in the actual court filing It was laid out during his depositions Um, you know, and so my but my issue here is okay, so we're spending all of these resources Trying to get these these juvenile American citizens In trapped in some type of domestic terror plot right is it because we don't have like is there not enough actual terrorism domestic terrorism that's happening Right, well, how do you think I'm doing it? Is there not enough domestic terrorism that we got to implant and form? I mean, you think all these people that Do these shootings end up being mentally ill mentally disturbed people? It's a lot of the same like the the the fucking common denominators are all there Yeah, and they all have another common denominator which is this Oh the FBI was aware of their activities long before they actually executed their plan Mm-hmm So it would be Reasonable to assume that there is a connection there. I think that's more than reasonable to say Yeah, you know, but my issue is we're spending all of these resources and all this taxpayer dollars To focus and create domestic terrorism When we know that there's tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of military age males both Chinese foreign nationals and other countries Countries that are our actual enemies pouring across our border. Where is the where's the resources being poured into that? Where's the tracking on those guys for years? What does that happen? And it's funny because I pulled up the federal Bureau of Investigations budget requests for this year Um, that was written by Christopher Ray, right? And then he outlines that they're requesting Uh, almost 11 and a half billion dollars for this year Um, and I started digging through it all of his stuff and you know like what what about you know Okay, the message here is inside like what about the the the human trafficking and crimes against children and and how big of a problem that is Oh, well, it's funny because like you know, they state that in 2022 Um, they were only able to recover 84 victims And the entire year But we're literally trying to create our own domestic terrorists and you got hundreds of thousands of children going missing every single year in this country. Well first of all regardless of what's going on You shouldn't be trying to instigate people into doing attacks You know, trapped these people these people are very famous for in for arranging false flag situations to gain support Um, for initiatives that they want to do You know, if we're being if we're being Very honest and it's a painful discussion and unfortunately it hurts a lot of people's feelings and people get very upset about it But if we look at 9-11 You know 9-11 is very it's very hard to disprove That that was a false flag operation in order to put us into a war where all these people got super wealthy and Millions and millions of millions of middle eastern and people were killed Okay, and you know, there's there's a there's a large percentage of people that believe 9-11 was was some type of inside Right or inside false flag And these people are not these people in my opinion are not Are not And I know all the shit like I know building seven and I know you know the melting melting missing the street I know yeah, and I know the pentagon. I know all the shit. You don't have to tell me okay. I know it all I'm trying to be respectful because there's people who listen to this that have loved ones that were killed in that In that situation that might or from the byproducts of this But really like those people should be the ones that are upset the most about what happened because I do believe that that was Something that was orchestrated intentionally for us to gain support to go to war and those of you that aren't old enough to remember You know there was never a more patriotic time in my adult life than there was on 9-12 2001 Okay, everybody unified Everybody and everybody was of the mindset kill them all That was what it was it wasn't that was no mercy dude And they whipped everybody into a frenzy and I was one of them dude. I bought into it I wanted to fucking flatten and turn of Middle East and fucking glass I talked about it for fucking years and now it's embarrassing for me to think back That I fell for that because I don't believe that's the truth anymore I believe the truth is is that you know The biggest racist event that's ever happened in the history of earth ever was the Blaming of 9-11 on Muslims and Islam, you know Because dude, that's just not the nature of those people Of the everyday people She's not And so it's very it's It's very It's a very sensitive subject. I don't talk about it flippantly, you know um But I think it's something that we got to be honest about and I also believe that our own government killed Uh, JFK You know most Americans believe that there's there's a most Americans that are read up on the situation believe that they say the CIA killed them For a number of different reasons one of which he wanted to put us back on goal standard And isn't it weird that every single leader that's ever wanted to go back on the goal standard was fucking Somehow killed all of them oh marty katafi so now who's saying JFK go back through history They don't have Hitler yeah all of them dude all of them Every person that ever said we're not gonna work on the world on the uh Federal reserve they fucking killed And that's why Malay and Arjitina is in deep shit in my opinion Look man these people the FBI doesn't there's no need for FBI to exist not the way that it does Just doesn't nor the CIA nor the ATF These are unconstitutional organizations that impose strict rules on society that are not voted on they're not um They're not passed by congress. They are just they are they are the DOJ these people are wrote these are rogue people that are above the law They get to do whatever they want they are fucking gangsters Okay, and I know there's some good FBI agents and I know there's some good CIA guys I know them like I'm fucking friends with those guys And dude they tell you that they'll be like bro. It's insane. It's fucking overrun by these fucking traders So you know the good FBI agents and the good CIA and the good ATF guys They got us they got to stop complying internally even if it cost them their job And then they got to be public about it and blow the whistle you know And and Trump and the vague if they get in which who knows who knows what's gonna happen whoever gets in They have we have to remove these things You know one of the things that I know why it not exists how they do that Yeah, and our oppressive tax system cannot exist the way it exists No cannot exist anymore like this That you know the income tax was supposed to be temporary And then they just kept it just to get us through the walls Like two weeks to two weeks to slow the curve two weeks to stop the spread Right now we're bunch of slaves Like people are like, oh bro, you take it too far. We're not slaves. We're free. No, we're not You work for the government. I work for the government If we add up all the money that we spend over the court or we earn over the course of the year Regardless of you're in the poverty level tax bracket If you make $20,000 a year and when you add up all the tax that you pay to For income tax that you pay for to own things to hold things to buy things to to gas to all these taxes You pay more than 50% of your your revenue to the government and if it's not more, it's right at For everybody else that's not in the lowest bracket. It's over You see what I'm saying? Absolutely And then we have these millions of people that don't pay any tax that get the benefit of those taxes That's not right either and we get those people to go tax the rich more Yeah, that's right and the more that's what they want They want the majority of people to be those people so that they can villainize All the cultural realities of capitalism and remove them so that we can have one subservient slave Class that they get to rule over that's the whole play You know if we create 55% of the country that screams tax the rich and fuck capitalism because they don't have anything And then we're paying with our taxes to support them eventually what happens is the people who produce stop producing They say it's not fucking worth it. They move to other countries. They they close their businesses They say I've done enough. I'm just gonna I'm just gonna retire and there's a whole book written about this called Atlas shrug And if you don't if you if you can't read the whole book you should go read summary of it Because it talks about and this is very real. We have to get back to a place in America where People who contribute get to have the most say that means if you file a tax return you get to vote You get to have a say in what's going on if you do not file a tax return You do not get to vote you do not get to have a say if you're on government assistance You do not get to have a say that's not fair You everybody says it's equal and this and I know it's not it's not equal at all because it's punishing the people who are actually getting out of bed every day And working their mother fucking asses off So we have to have some major reform in this country especially around the tax code and like very few of these people are fucking talking about it That should be the main thing that every voter is fucking screaming at these people When are you going to change the tax code? When are you going to correct the size of the government? When are you going to remove these agencies so that the United States government is no longer the biggest Organizations ever existed in humankind Like we are fucking slaves in America the sign on the door says freedom But that ain't what you find on the inside. It's not what you find It's a lie And until we get back to a place where we get to keep most of our money and by the way I'm all for paying taxes The taxes are used properly. Let's look at Dubai. They don't pay any tax look at their place No crime, beautiful streets, no litter, no nothing because they're hard on crime And they utilize their capital resources to build their infrastructure in a beautiful way And we can easily do that with our tax revenue But these people that are in politics are not serving the people anymore They're serving themselves and that's why this that's why our cities look like shit That's why there's litter everywhere. It's why there's crime everywhere These people do not fucking care about us, bro And I don't know that electing a politician of any sort is what's going to fix the problem I think we can slow it down But unless someone that's radical comes in and fucking breaks it apart and fucking rebuilds it you know I mean look dude Depending on how things go Like I would be willing to do that I just don't have enough fucking horse power to do it this year You know what I mean? No Like 2028 comes around and we're in a fucking you know I'm gonna I'm in the spot to do it I'll wreck this bitch and fucking rebuild it the way it should be And everybody will fucking live in free America the way it should be Nothing will change without the individual changing though That's what you guys got to understand without you doing your part nothing's going to change nothing Nothing if you don't adopt the mentality of personal excellence in your own life And being the best American citizen that you can be there doesn't matter who we elect because nothing's gonna be able to get done It's a cultural problem First political problem second Guys, let's get on to our final segment of the show as always thumbs up or dumbest fuck This is where we bring a headline up we talk about it or get one of those two options So with that being said our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headman reads Wrestling legend Hawkehogan helps rescue woman after car accident I saw this yeah, I thought I was pretty I like Hawkehogan I've always liked them too Legendary pro wrestler Hawkehogan was seen rushing to the scene of a car accident in Florida Sunday to help a victim climb out of her overturned car Witnesses say that Hogan was riding in a car on the highway in clear water, Florida when a woman swirled her car Made a summer salt turned over and then ground to a halt right ahead of them TMZ reported on January 15th apparently the mighty Hulk jumped out of his car and he and his pale Jake rushed over the snake Jake the snake is a snake.
