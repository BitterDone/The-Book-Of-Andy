I've almost sold it I've almost sold it a couple times and traded him for the new three RS but I Think it's I don't know man like I like it better. It's nasty. Yeah, it's not that's a that's a beast Yeah, that is a beast, but yeah, man. Let's get to Let's get to make it some other people to better day. We got some good ones for you guys as always We start off with a call in or a call first man. I got a got my man Jeremy waiting So let's let's let's give Jeremy a call Jeremy what's up, dude What's going on man? What's up, Jeremy? How you doing bro? Doing good doing good. We're getting some cars ready for the local car show today. We're at We're in Oregon file little tiny town They shut down the main street and yeah, so I ain't got nothing cool like you But I got some old and Chevy blazer and C10 that I'm taking down there bro. That's cool Yeah So yeah, no Go ahead. Oh, go ahead I'll just say yeah, just yeah, I Enjoy seeing your cars up just inspiration for me. I'm Definitely into the cars and the motivation that way. It definitely helps. Yeah, you know a lot of people don't realize how motivational and aspirational cars are for people that love them, you know, yeah, yeah Sweet man, we don't know what cool thing you stuff so I guess my My struggles per se would be in the Making relationships with Life-minded people on the same same path or even just finding those people I grew up and kind of came really Independent early on Grow up with forced dance and my dad was not a great role model so Throughout that I had to kind of grow up young and Got really hard to trust people and to you know give people the chance, you know, and then Getting getting kind of burned a few times and it just made it harder and so I guess Looking for input that way All right, so It's real simple. That's called fucking life, bro Like you know, I grew up the same way dude like my parents been divorced since I was five years old I've been fucked over by every single mother fucker. I've ever met my life with the exception of like 10 okay The world sucks most of the time. That's why it's important that we have to live to a high standard and Here's the thing You don't need anybody to trust or believe in you or support you to do what it is your Wanting you're wanting to do so And the quicker that you Build yourself into a person who is doing things Them the quicker you're gonna find other people that are aligned with that right nobody that's actually doing things out there At a high level wants to waste their energy your time with someone who's not so This is a common struggle with a Lot of people who are trying to level up their their networks and When you're trying to level up your networks, it's important that it's very clear You may not have the result, but you're doing everything you can to live at that standard You know behave like them act like them be ambitious be somebody who attacks be somebody who's aggressive Be somebody who is looking to provide value to the people around them not just take value and Those efforts are recognized by friend circles and peer circles that we would say are more Down the road of the success journey that you might be right now So I'm not saying you have to go out and produce the result That always helps but What I found and I've had this happen to me many times is that people who were above me In the in the success journey were able to recognize that man this guy is hustling. He's doing everything he can He's working hard. He cares Let me see how I can help this kid out and you know, I've had a number of those people along the way You know Come in and then you know out of my life as I out grew those people so we have to understand dude that like very few friendships are permanent Many of them serve a point In our lives and then when they no longer serve either party people grow apart This happens in and friendships this happens in relationships That's a normal part of life A lot of people are wired to think about what they can get not what they can give and those people never win long-term And I know that it's difficult and I know it feels lonely But the reason it feels lonely is because it's rare and you have ambition you have drive You have the one and the will to do bigger things and not everybody has that man So when you have that it's gonna make you feel like you're alone It's gonna make you feel like you're the only one but you're not the only one. There's lots of people like that and the quickest way for you to Become surrounded by that, you know, it's basically twofold one make sure that you're putting the effort in And living the lifestyle of a person that would be at that level and two Make an intentional effort to be around those people, you know, this is one of the reasons that Arate is such a successful program for entrepreneurs is because people have a hard time connecting with other people That are ambitious have drive have focus don't want to live the average Joe life And so they join groups, you know, and there's other ones too. This isn't a pitch for Arate. It makes no difference to me um But they join these groups intentionally so that they can be surrounded by people like that But I will tell you that even in those groups where people pay to be a part You are still gonna have people that want to take you are still gonna have people who are there For them not to contribute and so you just have to have you have to develop more of a filter for understanding what someone's real actual motivation is Very quickly and that will reduce the amount of heartbreak that you have, you know, because when you're a good person You give people the benefit of the doubt and then they end up burning you, you know, and that happens dozens of times man It does start to where you are, you know, and uh I've struggled with this myself because like dude. I try to help everybody around me. I try to help everybody be successful I tend to take everybody's problems and put them on my fucking back which is very difficult and It's why I think I'm a I'm a I've been an effective leader. I won't even say a good leader because I'm in a I'm in the process of becoming a better leader every single day but You know bro, it's just a hard thing and you know good comes with the bad so when you have this Want and this will and this desire to Help people and you put their problems on your back to fix A lot of times those people won't reciprocate and that's just reality So we have to become more finely tuned, but here's what I'll say out of all the times that I've been fucked over There's been way more times where I've developed great relationships and done good things and had great times and built Uh, you know good friendships and it's worth being that way It's worth being that way even with the the times you're gonna get fucked with so um Bro, I just you know, you got to understand the nature of the world, you know the the the world isn't what we want it to be It's what it is and uh, we have to we have to realize that being a good person Trying to contribute Trying to do the right thing is not always reciprocated man, and that's just called fucking human nature. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I think I mean that's I mean I Man, I've been listening to you for five years now buddy. My turn me on to you and I really validated a lot of honestly how I felt for a long time, but you know just feeling kind of like held down, you know from people around me in a sense and um since then, you know, I've had a big change and I you know during COVID I left my job that I was out of started getting told to put a mask on and got my construction license and just been doing my own thing and It's been it's been good, but it's been very challenging because I feel like it's you know the higher standard You start putting yourself to the more like it seems like you have a target on your back because everyone's like now Oh, you think you're better than us or this or that and the other and um Chit honestly, I've been doing it mostly in family and Wow brother You are better Just own it like the quickest way to get over that shit is when they say Oh, you think you're better just fucking be like yeah Yeah, like that's that's what I do That's a pretty quick yeah, and then I and then I don't deal with the shit anymore because they can't say it again And whether I believe it or not They perceive me to think that I'm better and no matter what I say no matter how I argue no matter how I try to convey to them Like hey motherfucker. I don't think I'm better than you. I've just chosen a different path I will just say yeah because I don't want to waste the time it you know, yes You're correct because I know from my experience that there is there is no Convinceing them otherwise and that is not a problem with you bro That's a problem with them their own limitations their own Regrets about how they gave up on themselves and we have to accept that and I know it's frustrating But bro that shit is only going to get worse and worse and worse and then once you cross a certain line once you cross over into like Undeniable success Those same people are going to be saying man dude. I knew Jeremy when he was just a young buck and he was getting started and I always believed in him Right and like you're gonna fucking laugh and roll your eyes and you know, it's all gonna come full circle bro Like you just can't you can't Let that weigh you down dude like like look You know, I see this problem all the time man I see all these people who let People who are close to them or even random strangers on the internet who aren't doing shit who are sitting at home with the fucking Cheeto fingers You know eating their hot packets in the basement They've never built anything you know, they the fucking only thing they've ever built is a good set of man titties Like these motherfuckers are losers dude and they're always gonna be and it's unfortunate and I hate to say it that way But it's just the truth and winners don't like losers and losers don't like winners That's just the nature that's the nature of human beings all right, so You're on the path of them. Go ahead Well, I was gonna say like honestly, I'm in correct. I mean we've been having some Just ridiculous family stuff going on and and it's like the people nobody will be accountable for the truth Like your choices you make the actions you do you know the choices like you literally choose to make your own truth And so many people just won't even won't even accept to their own choices and truth and then it's like you're the bad guy Yeah, no shit, but that's because you did and they went they didn't and that's always gonna be the case bro If you want to be like them Fuck you go hang out with them and and listen to their shit because that's what the fuck they want because then you're not a reminder Every single day every single time they got to think about somebody from their family who's actually doing something It reminds them that they haven't done shit with their life bro, and you're exactly right The result of one's life is a choice whether it's a voluntary choice or in voluntary choice Most people think that the only time that life is a result of their actions is when they do the right things And they fail to recognize that the passive choices they make when they're not engaged in trying to be better They create the opposite result and so you are correct They do choose it, but they will never admit that bro And you will spend your entire life trying to get those people to see it And they will never see it So my advice to you brother is to understand you are on a different fucking path They will never get it. They will never clap. They will never cheer until it's so undeniable that you are winning And then they'll come back around But they'll only come back around because they think they can get some from you. Okay, or or Or they think they can like get clout by saying oh yeah, Jeremy's my homie. That's what that for you. Right exactly So like bro listen Just because someone's related to you doesn't make him your people and that's the point All right, that's right that fucking sucks like I know it sucks bro. It hurts. It's not fun. Oh, I But it's reality Yeah, no, I got told I was a horrible person and my kids were gonna hate me and all this stuff Literally yesterday I had to kick my mother and mother and her husband out of my house because they were just completely disrespecting my wife and Her down and seeing what she was you know what was happening to my wife I was like you need you need to leave like I'm not I'm not gonna sit here unless it's happened You know and then of course it's just like you're such a horrible person and hey That's the right fucking thing to do bro. You don't want that native influence around your kids You don't need to hear it your kids are not gonna fucking hate you They're gonna be proud of you for doing what's required as long as you explain to them along the way like hey guys I'm doing this because of this and this and this and yes, I might miss I might miss baseball one time I might miss soccer one time, but I'm trying to create a life so that you guys can have you know can play soccer and You know like these as long as you explain it along the way they're gonna fucking respect you for it And good for you for being man enough to kick those motherfuckers out of your house bro because most people will just eat it Oh, man, it was yeah, I mean Between trying not to explode and just become part of the problem and just like no we're just not doing this you know and Yeah, you know Jeremy being a dad and it's that stuff Yeah, well listen, that's the toughest path you've ever picked Taking your life is being an entrepreneur and I'm sure being a dad on top of it makes it even that harder so It's gonna be tough. That's it No, it's tough, but it's so rewarding you know, I mean I'm always told you like uh You know like for me like we've got friends that you know I've turned them on to listening to you and you know got them going to church and stuff that just you know It's better in their lives and watching watching things change and it's it's awesome and then it's just like When you get the people to come and they just want to kick you all you know all they can and try to make Life hell and it's just like I don't have time for that. That's right. You know you know When it's family and trying to explain that you know, it's like my kids understand like we're I told my wife The only thing we can do is just give them as much of the truth is is we can really give them without you know making it More than it needs to be to them right, but you know, they're they're pretty receptive. I mean our kids and well That's my middle dollars birthday today. She just turns day today. So yeah, we're uh Don't break that too, but yeah, no, it's uh I Tough one. I don't you know, I was told people like not really having the parents You know that I could would have hoped when I grew up but trying to be that person now and that's your job Your job is to give down the life that you didn't have that you needed Okay, not there's not a motherfucker in this room that grew up with the fucking perfect family singing I'm seeing was five other guys. Yeah, I could tell you a fucking story about every single one of them And myself and probably 98% of the people that work in this building So don't fucking feel sorry for yourself that white picket No, no listen to me that white picket fence fucking perfect family shit. That's a lie very few people have it So you can't say oh well, I Had didn't have this or that Yeah, you and everybody else bro like It's you know like it's your you have an opportunity to fucking do the right thing you learn your lesson It's like what they say about people who you know are close to like a drug addict like I got a I got a cousin um a distant cousin Who his dad is a fucking alcoholic and he's never drank before and you know that it's like they say like When you have an example you choose to be right good work against them. That's right and you're choosing the right path man and you should be proud of that Yeah, no, and I you know, I think that honestly talking you I mean that's super thankful to get to talk to you It's like kind of helps validate your feelings when you feel like you're just fighting against the world But you don't have many people sitting behind you at this time, you know, because I'm early on into all this and and being that we're obviously on a different path In most work family and it's just like you said it feels lonely at times and you know getting to talk like I've looked up to you Like as a mentor, you know, it's like I told my wife I was like, yo, engine DJ or doing a call in snout. She's like, oh my gosh I don't think I could ever do that and I was like, well, I sent in the question So get to talk to you. I mean, it's just awesome. You know like like I said, I really appreciate it like it helps Helps understand that I'm you know, if I'm not just losing my mind, you know, like why is this so hard, you know? No bro, you're not you're on the right path brother for real Yeah, you know, that's just like you get people and they all you know, you just you think you're better than us or you're this or that and say Well, I have I put in a lot of work to do what I've got you know, I'm 32 and this is our fourth house We got 43 acres and cows and horses and you know, given our kids everything we can give them, you know, and it's like Wow, why can't you got me happy for us, you know, well because they're not happy for themselves, bro Right No, nothing you know, I just said that kind of the validation thing I've been listening to you and you hear it, you know, and it's like Well, then you know, it's like crazy and the same sentence even just be talking to you. It's like I feel like, you know We're rolled away. There's no way I'm ever gonna talk to Andy, but like just I mean Listen man, I listen, I appreciate you calling in dude You know I'm just another dude out here trying to do it too. So I'm a little further down the road I'm just trying to help you younger guys Figured out. I've been through all the shit you're talking about and I'm telling you bro I understand and I understand that it sucks, but I promise you it's fucking worth it Yeah, and I appreciate you know, I appreciate that and you know, I hope to keep hopefully I can pass it on to On to the next generation and keep Keep bettering others in my soul. You know, you could be everybody's boy. Hope you're already doing that You're already doing that Okay, gotta remember that you're already doing that so keep doing it I appreciate it. I appreciate it. All right Jeremy. You'll see you brother. Appreciate you Yeah, thank you guys. You're welcome bro. Thank you Uh, I'm doing you too I love that dude. Yeah, I mean look dude. That's a common trait that like it's a common problem that anybody that chooses different path outside the norm is gonna deal with Which is most people. Yeah, of course, bro like No, most people just choose to do like everybody else and anytime you choose differently You're gonna get that shit like that's just normal and the other thing like you guys listening You know, I hear this all the time man my parents got divorced or my dad was this or my mom was this or this or that yeah bro Like fucking everybody Yeah Like fuck dude everybody's got shit like what are you gonna do to correct? So like your kids and other people don't have people the same shit like you know you're not thought about too Bro because like you know I look at it this way too and by well hold on by the way That shit is the reason that you're on the path you're on Like it's nobody I've never met someone who's self-made That comes from a cush situation The reason that they are fucking doing what they do is because they've had to crawl out of fucking darkness In some way shape or form It might not be the same as yours But there's something there that they had a fucking crawl the fuck out of and they they hated it so fucking much That they were willing to do anything to get as far away from it as possible and that's just So we can't sit here and look at people Who have these cushed up rings and all these advantages and all this shit and say oh Well, they got lucky no mother fucker you got lucky because those mother fuckers never had to learn how to fight They never had to learn how to crawl through the shit They never had to learn how to fucking take blows and get the fuck back up you did And that's an advantage you got lucky they didn't get fucking lucky like dude It is real and it's it is real and dude people Think like oh man that guy had everything he got lucky no dude. He's hand to cap for life now You learned all these skills you learned all these these these Character traits you built all this shit inside of you this grit this fortitude all the things that make people successful You had to have they didn't and that's a huge advantage when you meet someone like that in the battlefield bro You fucking destroy them because they don't have those skills. They never had to develop them. Yeah Brothers right. I like it like this too. It's like you know all the negative shit people will say when you're trying to go down that path and do Get shit just wait to wait wait wait to hear what they say when you don't do shit with your life. Yeah, see what they say then Yeah, that's right. You know I'm saying right Before the years old you ain't did shit. Yeah, that's right bro. They go talk to you on that too And more importantly, what are you gonna think right at 40 years old right if you don't do shit And you're gonna think god dude. I listen to all these fucking losers and now look what I got to show for it It's real shit. Yeah, that's real man guys. Let's uh, let's get our next next question. This is a right-end question Uh, let's talk about it guys. Any question number two, any Even when I achieve something I Instantly look for the next mountain. I just miss compliments down place success and hold myself to standards I'd never apply to anyone else. I don't know if I was raised this way or just became this way But I want to feel pride without shame. How do I allow myself to be proud without feeling like I'm being arrogant a week Oh, what do you mean a little gratitude? I guess I don't understand you did the work you built the shit Be proud of it. What are you talking about? It's very fucking simple Why the fuck do you give a shit with that person over there thinks about what you did? Were they there when you were grinding it out Were they there when you were you know, everybody likes to talk about how lucky someone got you know Like I just said a minute ago. That's the that's the wrong perspective None of these motherfuckers that ever criticized me spent a day in the fucking store at me my entire life. I spent Fucking years None of them ever came and helped me do anything none of them were there when I was struggling None of them they're there when I wanted to kill myself because shit was so hard None of them So I don't fucking care what they think about me driving a fucking boogati to work Or my other one to work. I don't fucking care. I don't care. Yeah, bro. I don't care You work there during the hard times you have nothing to say to me that can Take me away or or make me feel less proud of what I've done. I've changed Fuck dude. I don't even know how many lies with 75 hard and what we do with our companies and I have things to be proud of and no one could take that for me. No one's gonna shame me out of it No one's gonna make me feel bad about it. I did What they chose not to do they could have came and done something similar with me They didn't so I don't give a shit and you can you get you need to get a little more of that energy, bro Were they there to help you do any of this? Were they there to help you pull through the mud? Were they there to you know Can soul you and you didn't have anybody clearly not So why do you care what they say now that you're doing better? I don't yeah for sure I mean, well, I mean you also talk about this too It's like because I feel like there's a little nuance in the sense of like I guess just being hard on yourself not allowing yourself to be proud of the shit that you did You know, I'm saying when you're always moving that goal post setting the next fucking that milestone that you're you're reaching When your goals are so fucking big How do you make sure that like to be proud in those moments when you do get those wins? Well, I mean dude you have to acknowledge how far you came yeah, I mean you said it It's gratitude you take inventory look man It's you can take inventory and acknowledge how far you've come And still be hungry for much more You know like and that's why you want to take a dedicated amount of time to like every day to say man, you know There's a tough day and do what I want to do, but look I've come pretty far so far, you know and Yeah, it's very simple man. It's just like you caught up and fucking spending too much time in that reflection The reflection zone You know, I'm saying all the shit that you did. Do you see that? Yeah, man because that's like the victim therapy culture we deal with now You know, they got all this shit pumping out and everybody's brain tone They're broken and they need therapy and they have trauma and they fucking need a journal seven hours a day And have this morning routine and do all this shit And like it makes everybody think they're fucked up, you know like when you're an entrepreneur and you're trying to build shit It's just fucking hard Yeah, and you know what you kind of have to be fucked up to be any good at it You know what I mean you kind of have to have something to prove you kind of have to be a little insecure You kind of have to have those things those are the fuels that drive people, okay? And the reality is is the world benefits from that so how can you say that's bad? You know what I mean? Like we have to people are eating because of that bro. Yes, we have to understand that the shit that's written for everybody else is not written for entrepreneurs All these things, you know the mental health and this and that and fucking this Bro that's written for people who They don't have the fucking darkness and they don't know how to fucking leverage it to be better You know they they're they're feeling sorry for themselves. They're making excuses They know they haven't done what they're supposed to do, but then they make you know Some sort of justification or philosophy that is really just a you know I didn't do it excuse Dressed up in a nice outfit, you know in a comfy little bed and some frills and shit like it's It's bullshit, okay? Like motherfucker entrepreneurship and building success as hard as fuck. It's hard. It's hard It's never gonna be easy. You're always gonna feel like you're fucked up You're always gonna feel like you're behind you're always gonna feel like you know Maybe I'm not any good at this, but dude if you keep showing up and you keep executing you keep doing what you're supposed to do The results will sprout and you will gain a little bit more confidence But dude even when you gain more confidence you'll be in a new level and when you're at a new level Guess what happens all the same shit happens again you doubt your question your insecure You push harder you go to the next let's just a repetitive cycle dude. It's a hard life But many many many people Benefit from it. So it's something to be proud of it doesn't mean you're fucked up It doesn't mean you have to rid yourself of that when you rid yourself of all that shit you rid yourself of your fuel All right, and when you rid yourself of your fuel the gross stops when the gross stops people starve What's worse? You being a little crazy or motherfucker starving? Yeah, you know what I'm saying like when you put it like that Like shit man. Yeah, man. I do we look we've grown this culture has changed from You know like when I'm just glad I grew up when I did because The culture's so different like Entrepreneurs successful people people would drive hustle grit fortitude tough mother fuckers that refuse to quit We're celebrated. They were you were told this is how you should be Yeah, now we have the opposite those people are fucked up Well, who's telling you you're fucked up a bunch of nerds with a fucking four letter degree That haven't done shit and sitting in a living room with fucking house slippers on and taking notes about what they think is wrong with you The fuck out of here.

That's awesome So uh, what do you think I can help you with man? Yeah, so honestly brother, I gotta I got a lot on my chest But I'll start off by reading you the question I submitted in 250 characters and then I guess we'll open there so um My question says that I typed in and submitted it says 25 years old I own two gyms After three and a half years. It's really for but after four years of working for free I am now profitable. I need to pass out flyers But I fear rejection outside of my own gym doors. How do I overcome this paralyzing fear? Well look man, let me ask you this Do you actually make people better at your gym Yes Yes, yes the growth has been all referral based off of the incredible Transformation then and service and throughout the years of being unprofitable I had you know the my spurts where I'd have to let up a couple people go and be there seven days a week for a year and a half And then bring trainers on and I'm there six to seven days a week and I treat everybody Amazing and the transformations and the results are there and that's why I get so many referrals But at the end of the day with my overhead and my rent and all my expenses That's not enough and I've known that's not enough since day one to actually profit and the life that I want to live hold on We're gonna get to that in a second But you believe that Josh cares enough to actually help people get results Yes, 100 percent. Okay If you're very passionate about what I do, okay, so if that's the case Then you should have zero discomfort trying to help people out on the street and talking to them and offering them Your services or at least making them aware Because you actually do care and you're not just trying to sell some bullshit And you actually are gonna help them get results and if they do reject you which lots of people will That's okay because the the 20 percent the two out of 10 that are gonna talk to you You're gonna build relationships with them and you're gonna change their mother fucking lives Okay, so you can't push out Because the eight people are not gonna fucking want to hear it You got to show up for the two that are gonna change your fucking lives All right, so that's the first thing now. Let's let's get into this other thing about the profitability go ahead and talk about that Well on that note when it comes to when it comes to that like I I agree I agree there's there's something in my brain where where I'm like all right I have I run both locations all their operations by myself all the employees are the trainers I have eight employees right now, but I'm running the operations and I look at myself and I say What would be the best thing to do right now to grow and generate revenue and the answer is walk out because I chose the location next to a big retailer for this purpose and Walk out and bring clients in and sign them up and change their lives so they bring in referrals and we grow But my brain I fucking do other shit I grabbed the flyers and I walked to the door and then and I ended up doing something else I have something deep down that keeps holding me back and I know the answers because I've listened to you since 27 said these shit 100 times. What's the answer go fucking do it. Don't be a pussy Go to the grocery store and talk to every go to the grocery store and talk to every person in there And don't leave till you talk to every person in there and I know these things I've been listening to you since I was 16 years old But my fucking brain I I push out and and I know the answer that's the problem is you could have cut off the MFCO project six episodes in you already said everything that need to be said the problem We won't be coming there So don't listen you won't be come out there kick you out the fucking door bro Like I will come out there. Yeah, you're out of the door And I will not let you back in your own fucking gym until you bring at least two more people like bro listen to me You have to do this and and here's an important thing It's not just about growing your gym. It's about growing your skill set. Okay People are gonna reject you up and down the path It's gonna happen for the next 25 years and still you're so big That everybody's coming to you and you get to pick and choose all right That's where I'm at now. There's nobody that brings me anything. Why don't pick and choose I'm not asking for anything And it's very it's really fucking nice. It's really nice But it didn't get that way until I was willing to go down the path for you know 15 years Of getting told to eat shit and learning how to handle people telling you to eat shit is a massive skill set because most people can't do it so Yeah, bro, so like look man You're building this up to be worse than it's gonna be all right There's lots of things that can help you agree if people are gonna be rude Be nice back, you know, I'm saying well, I hope you have a great day brother like Sorry to bother you know, just be polite back when they're rude and a lot of times You know, just like when they walk in your gym or you know, you go in somewhere like you've had a bad day You're fucking dog died or some shit happened you You there's a book called the four agreements and one of the main four agreements is don't take anything personally And that really helped me realize Like their reactions are not my control I if I go at it with the right intent and my intent is to actually help them Then I'm doing what I can do and maybe I present it wrong at first But eventually I learn how to present it better so that it converts higher And it produces a better result But ultimately dude this isn't about you just bringing people in the gym This is more about you building this the the the tenacious relentless ability To talk to people because dude, I'm gonna tell you this and this is very important The more and this is really important for the business that you're in Because people are never gonna stop working out but the more that technology Infiltrates our society The more valuable Communication skills are going to be all right and you're 25 years old dude You grew up on a fucking phone you grew up with technology So it is a little bit harder for you because it's abnormal For someone of your age to do what I'm telling you to go do But I'm going to tell you dude and this is real shit That skill is gonna become so rare That it becomes extremely valuable and why it's gonna be valuable to you is going to be because the way that your gym is going to scale and grow Is gonna be by you building community around your gym and you could only build community with other human beings If you are great at dealing with other human beings So when you tie all of this together This is practice for you bro This is this is reps. This is what you have to do and if you don't do it You're just not gonna be as successful as you could be Not even close so You know you I know you know this But dude you know when you're getting ready to walk out that door and you start to get that fucking You know like that that bitch voices in your head. It's like fuck like bro Just walk right through it just keep walking and just go do it And you're gonna find out bro after the first time or third time you get rejected It's not even a big deal. It's not a big deal. Yeah, and let me tell you something else. Do you do you are you married? Well there I've been with my girls since I was 16 I've done a lot of things right in my life This is the only one thing that fucking eats me alive every day. Okay. Yeah. We're married I'm married to vinegar my fur at one for one bro. Okay, since we were 16. Okay. Well, I was gonna say For most men in your situation they they usually aren't married and your ability to talk to people is gonna dictate the quality of the of the of the Of the mate that you were trapped so this is this this this translates into in all areas of life So while that doesn't apply to you. It's important for the other young men and young people to hear So dude You've just got to force your way through it man and once you go through it once or twice It's gonna it's like the first time you walked into a gym bro the first time you walked doing a gym You were shit in your pants. I know you were because I was too. It's so was everybody else. It's very uncomfortable But once you've done it you're like what the fuck was I worried about what was I nervous about and dude That's this is just a mental block and it's gonna take force the first two or three times And You know why it's eating you bro is because you're letting it Linger if you go take this action fucking today and you go out there and give out five fucking flyers Even if it's just five and they all say fuck off you're gonna realize holy shit I've been let myself get eat up over over nothing and it's gonna free you I know that yeah, then go do it I know I know that's why fucking You can do this for seven years over my phone listen to me hang up the fucking phone and go fucking do it Because I it's gonna make you feel better I agree agree and then at the end of the day go ahead Um and the part and if I can just be extra clear the part that That I've been torturing myself with is the fact that like who the I don't know one person in my fucking life that will work four years for free seven days a weekend And go through the stress and I've done all the other shit that's so much fucking harder than this Yeah, but this is the one thing I've let eat me alive I worked for three for four years and I had chest pains for six months I thought I was gonna fucking die last year from old from stress But that one thing that I haven't been doing is the solution to all of my issues Which is why it eats me alive because it's the obvious answer that I know all right bro Well, do you want to feel better today or do you want us to keep going? Yeah, I agree I agree you agree When if you already know what the fuck man Go fucking do it. Yeah, listen dude. Yeah, dude Go do it you're You're like you said you've already done all this shit What's the worst that's gonna happen some fucking Not gonna tell you to work out today. Yeah, tell him to go eat a fucking hot dog, bro Like it doesn't matter like dude just do it. You're gonna you're gonna go home and you're gonna be like fuck that one that bad What the fuck and you're gonna feel lighter you're gonna be a better and you're gonna be proud of yourself You're gonna and you're probably gonna make fun of yourself. You're gonna be like the fuck was I doing? You know, so dude you got this bro like you got it dude. Just go do it you listen Just go do it. It'll fix all your shit Yeah, I agree. Yeah 100 percent. Well, thank you, man. It sounds like That's that's all that you need that you need to say and there's nothing else for me to say at that point then Listen, bro. This will build this will build your courage. Listen You can't win in business without courage. It's impossible. You can't win without courage The reason that you know all this stuff happened the last four to six years is because most people don't have it if you want to win In real life in business You got to have courage and what you need to do is you need to understand that this is an investment in your courage That is going to be required for you to level up. It's just this There's gonna be much much much harder things than this down the road I'll give you an example dude like This isn't the same thing, but it's it's a similar block that I dealt with When I had my first retail store, I was so scared To open the second store. I was so scared to open the second store. I thought I knew I thought people were gonna cheat me I thought people I thought it wasn't you know, uh gonna work I had all these things that would go wrong in my head And Guess what they all happened every fucking one of them But had I not went ahead and did it even though I was scared I wouldn't have you know I don't know we got like 40 stores now and we're opening more like literally all the time First form wouldn't exist none of this shit would have happened man. You wouldn't be talking to me You need to pull the trigger dude because what it's gonna do is it's gonna free you Up and build your courage and allow you to realize you don't have anything to be scared of dude You're anything to be scared of like it's it's a hundred percent mental And if you don't do it, if you don't do it You're probably gonna fucking lose in business. That's the truth and you need to understand that yeah Yeah, and keep in mind when I submitted this question I went in here knowing that I'm gonna sound fucking retard No, no, no, I knew that because I've been listening to you for seven years. I found stupid The answer but I wanted you to sit on that city God you dude. I'm making you understand Listen that first of all that's not stupid. That's a real concern It's a really good question because a lot of people struggle with it It's super ones of the people that don't ask the shit the stupid ones are the people that don't do it And think that they can get around doing that and they're just gonna be able to ignore that part of their life Josh understands. This is a big fucking deal. This isn't about the flyers working This is about overcoming something he's afraid of yeah, that's a big deal Okay, like I know a lot of people are listening or like we'll tell him to do this or matter this motherfucker We're not talking about that. We're talking about him getting over a mental block And you have to learn how to do this because there's gonna be more down the road All right, so dude. This is not stupid. You're not stupid. I'm not shitting on you But it's very important because If you don't learn how to overcome the mental blocks, bro There's gonna be more of them and you won't be able to overcome those and it's gonna limit your success for you Your girl your future family and everything you got going on, bro, and I'm not gonna allow that to happen Yeah, I absolutely. Yes. Thank you 100% and the the the part that that makes it that really made me realize that I have to address this now Which I have always known is as of January started making a chunk of cash every month road locations are profiting great And I still feel empty and dead and unfulfilled because the profits and being in the green and it doesn't mean anything to me because I'm still ignoring Literally what's in front of my fucking face. Yeah, so until this is addressed no matter how much money I make Ignoring uh something that's in front of my face is gonna fucking keep me up at night like it has for for four years Bro the fact that it keeps you up at night is a great thing because it means you're aware that it's something that you need to overcome Okay, but this is so simple you could overcome it today real talk you could overcome it today Yeah, and you should all right good. Yeah All right brother listen man. You're in a good spot. Just fucking you know Follow through you said you're gonna do it today go fucking do it I'm gonna take you to find out too. Yeah, DJ's gonna follow up Was that your number you were texting me on DJ? Yeah What's the show? I'm gonna hit you up. I'm gonna text you like 10 times a day bro, okay I'm gonna check in and if you don't text me back I'm gonna be pissed bro. I thought we're friends Sweet man. All right guys, go get it bro Yes, sir appreciate you guys. Thank you for everything. Thank you bro. Go do it. You got this Yes, sir. All right Love it. Yeah, man look dude. That's not it. It's not about the flyers. It's not about it's about overcoming the mental Block yeah, I was thinking about it too because he said he's been with his girls since they were like 16 So the reality of it too? He's never had to really face rejection at all. Well, you know, I'm saying like yeah, I mean that I mean I mean when you like girls and you know, you're young and you don't have the luxury of having one since your 16 You're gonna get used to be told fuck off Kind of comes with the territory So I love it man. Yeah, well guys Andy that was three. All right guys. Hey, let's go out. Let's get it. Let's make it a good week and we'll see you tomorrow You
