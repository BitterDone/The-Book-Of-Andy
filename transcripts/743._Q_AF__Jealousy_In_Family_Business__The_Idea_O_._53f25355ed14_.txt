guys Andy I got three good with the first thing you can do to get better is to get yourself a nice cold bottle of aqua Pazante you know it just rolls off your tongue guys I used to have a hard time reading the questions and headlines and outlines but ever since I've started drinking Pazante aqua Pazante water stuff just flows off my tongue like they flow out the pipes and flip Michigan that's not bad one back I'm telling these yeah that's good all right guys Andy question number one Andy and DJ man I need some help with the situation my company was recently acquired by a family on an operated company in eight short months our new CEO has placed his two sons in high-level leadership roles one a 23 year old guy is now a leader in business development and the other a 28 year old guy is the director of operations at one of our facilities granted I'm only 35 I've also clawed my way from being a temporary employee making $7 an hour to a professional in the business side of our organization over the course of 15 years here's my conundrum I feel a little jealousy that these two guys who have no experience in our industry were awarded very respectable positions without the positions being posted I respect the CEO but not as decision how do I get over this shit and just move on anything is appreciated thanks for everything you guys do well you can go start your own company and work at it for a couple decades and then you can hire whoever the fuck you feel like hiring how about that okay like you didn't build the company you don't get to make those decisions because you didn't take the risk and you didn't make the investment and while I think that's probably a poor business move on his part to put unqualified people in a position of power and authority and important position strategically for your company that aren't qualified that's a bad chess move doesn't matter if they're your brother doesn't matter if they're son doesn't matter if it's whoever it's just not good business so that's his right to make those decisions and I think it's probably pretty stupid and you probably think it's pretty stupid so what can you do well nothing okay you're not related to the guy and you know I don't know man like I don't know why this would bother you why why do you fucking care like aren't you worried about your performance the only way that this would bother me is if I was losing because of someone else being put in front of me that wasn't qualified and if that's the case then maybe you should look for a different career maybe you should go to a different place that's not going to have an epitism issues or family business issues but I can tell you this you're gonna have that you're gonna have drawbacks there as well you know and family businesses they tend to care about their employees a lot more than people who don't um sometimes things like this happen and they're not received well and people get pissed off but the reality is is if you're focused on yourself and you're focused on how good you are you should shine head and shoulders above them if you've been doing this for so long and if you had to claw your way into the position that you're in shouldn't be easy for you to show why you're better than they are you know I would put that on full display through your performance do look man here's the deal too many of you guys waste way too much time worried about what's going on with other people and yeah I understand it can make you jealous and yeah I understand it can piss you off and yeah I can understand that it ain't fair but guess what life is not fucking fair and you all worry about this like it is you're you're expecting something that will never be it will never be fair it will never ever ever ever ever ever be fair ever now what are you gonna sit on the sideline and cry about how it's not fair are you gonna write emails into the show and say Andy this isn't fair what should I do or are you going to say well it's not fair it's my job to be undeniably great at what I do because if I'm undeniably great at what I do then it doesn't really matter if they recognize me here because they'll recognize me in other places if that's what I need to do as well and so many people spend so much time worried about what other people are doing that they never become great at what they do and so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and the nepotism and the brother or the son or whoever's ahead of you stays ahead of you because you're so worried about what that person's doing and not worried at all about developing your own skillset and this is one holds so many people back so if I were you I would have a come to Jesus myself and say this well it's not fucking fair so how do I make it as fair as possible for me well you make it as fair as possible for you by being great at what you do and that takes you not looking at them but looking at what it is that you do how good you actually are and making the adjustments to be great from the position that you were currently in and if everybody did this your career and your life and everything else will go much better and it will go much faster but you know it doesn't it doesn't always happen like that you know employees look at other employees or and they say oh that I got this and that I got that like two little kids like oh that guy got an extra half scoop of ice cream on my fucking ice cream cone you sound like a bunch of fucking communist bro not everybody's gonna get the same because not everybody's value the same and guess what because those are that man's sons they are going to be more valuable to him than you are that's reality dude I don't know you yes yes like dude what do you I can understand you could be a little upset about that I can understand that it that it irritates you but at the end of the day it's reality dude and you have to come to terms with it and whatever hardships or whatever frustrations or walls or boundaries that come in front of you it's your job to fucking run through those okay and that's not going to happen because you're complaining about Joe over here getting this preferential treatment because he's this dude son so if I were you I would stop focusing any energy on them and focus on what you can do and focus on how you can get better and if that's not rewarded it will be rewarded somewhere else yeah I love that man it's like you know I think about like and I'm sure you know there's better than I do man but it's like no champion win as you're running the race very rarely will you see the guy running in first place look behind and see where everybody else is in the race very rarely and when they do they typically always get caught that the people come behind the winners focus on winning yeah losers focus on winners yeah that's reality and dude this is something that people just can't get through their head they want everything to be fucking fair it is not ever going to be fair ever they're going to be people that are better looking than you they're going to be people have better genetics than you they're going to be people that are smarter than you they're gonna have people that have no money than you or grew up in a better family or have more advantages or have more opportunities so what okay it's your job to assess where are you and then take the action to get where you want to go regardless of where you start regardless of where someone else starts and so many people tell themselves this ridiculous story about all these advantages that other people have when in reality a lot of times these people even have those advantages so it becomes a victimizing story that people tell I can't get ahead because the two bosses sons are in charge of everything or this place sucked them quick they go work somewhere else bro but I bet you a hundred bucks you're gonna go over to the other place you're gonna find some fucking problem over there that's the same exact deal over here that guy's got this that guy got that that guy got this bro that's loser shit winner Tom Brady that didn't at the last whatever he was the six round pick or whatever right he didn't sit on the fucking sidelines of the game and say fuck it's not fair that drew blood so it's getting to play it's not fair that you know so and so is getting all this credit it's not no he said fuck I'm gonna fucking put the work in I'm gonna become great I'm gonna worry about myself I'm gonna take more reps I'm gonna spend more time in film I'm gonna spend more time in the weight room I'm going to get better and you know what happened he becomes the greatest of all time because he's not looking over here and he's not looking over there he's looking right in front of him to what he could control to improve his situation and guess what that works for everybody but we spend so much time looking over here and looking over there and what if and what if I do that and you know these are this a different circumstance we make all these excuses instead of just buckling down and saying I am going to become great at this and whatever happens as a result of that is what happens and I can tell you that the result of becoming great at anything is always good it's never you don't go backwards there's no one whoever you know had some natural ability in the NFL that focused on the shit they had to do in front of them that had a shitty career sound happened bro maybe they get hurt and they tear their knee up or something but dude not fair yeah right it's not fair it's never gonna be fair bro love that man let me actually this too because you know you obviously 25 years in business you've met a lot of different owners leaders in their fields and industries in the companies this this concept I want to touch on this this concept of you know this bringing in family members or whatever the case is right like you said you know this was not a good decision just for people that look at you know your companies or take a look at first one for example style he's your brother yeah you grew up with them yeah but style had experience before Sal was the number one salesman Sal was the number one salesman at his previous a place of employment which was a global company for two years in a row number one in the world Sal's extremely smart he's an extremely good operator he's extremely good with people and with sales and he's qualified there's nobody there was nobody more qualified to do that job nobody yeah now he just happened to be my brother so so what's your advice to business owners that are considering bringing in make sure they look it's the same advice I give people when it comes to business partners a lot of people want to do business with their friends because they think it's gonna be fun to do business with their friends but they stop to ask themselves is there a benefit to me doing business with this friend or is it just something that I want to do and you should ask like what does this person bring do they bring anything do they bring a different skill set that I have do they bring money do they bring connections what do they bring if they just bring being your friend that's not enough to partner with them and the same goes for hiring them if it's just your family member and they don't bring a skill set you you shouldn't put them in the game bro we're trying to win here this is like hey would I would I send my brother out on the field and the fucking super ball if he's not fucking good enough to play yeah that's the seriousness of the game that we play an entrepreneur ship other people are putting the best people in the position and you're putting your fucking brother because he's your brother that doesn't make sense are you putting your friend because he's your friend those companies lose or at the very least they just sort of flounder out there you know to win you got to put the best people in the best positions to win and that's why I said it's not a good idea most of the time now if those two sons let's maybe there's context left off of that question maybe those two there is well I'm just saying maybe those two sons come from maybe the 29 year old comes from another company where he was kicking ass you know I'm saying right maybe the 23 year old has some other quality who knows maybe he knows something about technology that you don't know we don't know the full context there so and that's another thing people do they like to tell half the story about why it's not fair right oh so and so got this well is he better than you well yeah but well that's a big piece of leave out bro yeah yeah man so I mean dude look I have very little tolerance for even question for questions like this because I think it's bitch shit you need to worry about yourself you need to worry about getting better for yourself you need not worry about what so and so has or what offer they got bro everything even's out in the end everything even's out easy come easy go if you if you really had to work to build those skills and those those younger guys don't have the skills it's gonna become a parent okay so just wait the truth always comes out the truth always materializes about people's real skill set and the real value during that time instead of sitting here watching them waiting him for a fail you should figure out like how I'm gonna get so much better that it's obvious that whenever these guys mess up it's my job to be in that position that's how I would look at I love it or I would go somewhere where I was valued you know but I I really think that you know most of the time when people say things like this they find problems anywhere they go yeah grass is gonna be green where you order yeah yeah I love it man I love it guys Andy question number two hey Andy how do you feel about this idea of being quote unquote obsessed I feel like it gets overused by a lot of people can you give me some insight into what being obsessed should actually look like what does real obsession mean I would be willing to bet that the person who asks this question loses a lot okay and I'm gonna explain why you have to this idea of entrepreneurship all right we're talking in the context of entrepreneurship this idea of entrepreneurship has been glorified and built up to be this thing that everybody thinks they can do everybody thinks they can just be an entrepreneur because we have all these people on the internet that say they're an entrepreneur and post all these lies about how much money they're making how many followers they have how you know they're buying engagement they're creating a facade that people believe and they're trying to present the best possible story guys this is bullshit okay real entrepreneurship is the most competitive game that a human being can play all right is more competitive than baseball it is more competitive than football it is more competitive than soccer it's more competitive than fucking anything it's literally live or die economically like it is the most cutthroat savage real fucking shit that you could ever do and if you aren't built that way you're just going to be another notch on someone else's wall when they fucking crush you okay to win in this game when you look at like high level athletes like the plate you know they maybe they win the Heisman or they're an all-american or they're an all pro or an all-star player these people dedicate their entire lives to becoming that everything then they wake up in the morning everything they do throughout the day is dedicated towards this one thing outside of maybe a couple other things they got to do to live right maybe they spend an hour with their kids or whatever but they usually don't and people bitch so oh there's no balance no shit because that's what it takes to be great shit so when I hear this shit like the people say about you know oh everybody's out of balance or you know do you really have to be obsessed the answer is yes and if you're not obsessed you will lose and it's not overblown I think it's understated I think the amount of obsession dedication it takes to build a real company is understated not overstated I think most people have zero clue what it's actually like or what it actually takes to become a success in the game of entrepreneurship they believe that entrepreneurship is about freedom they believe entrepreneurship is about being your own boss they believe entrepreneurship is about owning some cool cars and traveling the world and working for anywhere just like all these morons fucking tell you and it's not okay it's it's not freedom and you're not your own boss guess who's the boss the customer is the boss okay guess how long it took me to buy a nice car took me 11 years all right and by the way I've got a more real business than any of these fuckers that tell you this shit any single one of them let me see their place let's see the product let's see it ordered let's let's go look through their portfolio of companies and let's see where they stand up okay a lot of this is smoking mere shit a lot of it how many of these guys own an an international brand that people recognize when you walk down the street fucking none of them and they all tell you the same shit oh you know balance oh this is you know I work from here I do this I do that bro it's a lie so do you have to be obsessed yes you have to wake up every single day and basically work for a long time to develop the skills that you're looking to create to be competitive at this and then after you develop the skills you have to understand that there's other people out there with the skills already who have had the skills for 20 years that used the skills better than you so it never gets easier in the beginning you're developing the skills and it feels super hard but then when you actually get to the game you're competing as motherfuckers have had the skills for 20 years and you just learned them so now you got to try hard again like there's never a place where this gets easy there's never a place where you can coast there's never a place where you get to like take your your your foot off the gas and and and just live your life that's not what you signed up for and all this shit you read on the internet all this shit about balance all this shit about happiness all this all that is written for other people that is not written for high-level performers in the game of entrepreneurship okay so a lot of you guys I'm just being fucking real with you a lot of you guys need to forget the idea of even being an entrepreneur because you're not fucking built for it you're just not and I could get on here and I could say well you know everybody can do this buy my shit but I'm not gonna lie to you because I don't want you to waste five years of your life and then be like oh well it didn't work out for me it didn't work out for you because you're not willing to do what it takes because you believe the internet instead of what reality really is you know my message it's hard for me to sell that message how do I sell a message like this hey it's gonna be hardest fucks be the hardest thing you ever did it's gonna take longer than you think it's gonna take actually it's gonna take 10 times longer you're gonna lose all your friends you're gonna lose girlfriends you're gonna lose boyfriends you're gonna lose uh you know all kinds of time that you could have spent doing things with your friends you're gonna have to give up weekends you're gonna have to do this for 20 years how do you sell that to people how's that that sound cool and that sounds fucking cool but nobody and the reason nobody tells you that is because one none of these motherfuckers have built anything and number two they can't sell it okay so that's the reality yes you have to be obsessed yes everything you do should be geared towards becoming the person that you need to become to operate the way you want to operate and you know it's the most competitive game in the world and that's why I cringe when I see all these people to say oh I'm not competing with anyone I'm just trying to do dude you're gonna get killed you know and I don't know how to say this any simpler like it's it's cutthroat it's kill or be killed and if you're not obsessed on becoming the best possible version of yourself and building the best possible operation that you can possibly build you're gonna get beat and that's just reality dude let me actually say did you know did you know that reality when you first started in 19 or was it like I'm was there a mo no that's why the first 10 years bro I fucking coasted through and got my balls kicked out I thought it took way less than what it actually took and when I finally got sick of it and I finally realized that I wanted to do this and I finally like put it all together in my head that's when shit changed that's when we went from you know not making any money to make it a lot of money that's when our business went from flatline growth to growing like crazy it's it's just an acceptance of reality dude how how can you compete on the same soccer team as a guy who practices six hours a day when you're not practicing but you know 30 minutes a day how you how you gonna compete with that are you that good no it's arrogant steered it's it's an overestimation of one's own abilities with combined with a misunderstanding of what it actually takes so when you overestimate your own abilities and then you underestimate how hard it is you're setting yourself up for failure every single time and that's the problem with Instagram and internet entrepreneurship is it sets people up for a false expectation of what it's actually going to take and how good you actually need to be and for that reason they fail and then they believe that you know oh I just don't have what it takes well you might have what it takes if you understood what it actually takes maybe you're willing to do that but because you consume content from a bunch of fucking idiots have never built a mother fucking thing your mind is warped to reality and so when someone like me comes along and says you gotta do this this this this this this your shit right now and you gotta become not shitty and become great and it's gonna take you years to do you don't like hearing that shit you rather go listen to some idiot who tells you oh well you gotta do is do this and this and this and dude and you you make money for six months and then you're out of business and your reputation's ruined your names ruined your brands ruined and nobody wants to do shit with you so you know yeah it's fucking yeah you have to be obsessed and not even a little obsessed it has to be the focus of your entire life that's the reality and and for entrepreneurs that want to make a lot of money that answer is the same you if you think that you're gonna have balance and you're gonna fucking you know someday make you know a million dollars a year whatever you think you're gonna make which by the way that's what you need to make to live in the kind of house that some of you guys want to live in if you think you're gonna get that by showing up to work and work until five o'clock and not putting in time to become better and not like becoming obsessed with your own development you're you're delusional it's just what it takes so you know I didn't make the rules of the game but that is the game and you can argue with me all day you could fucking say oh Andy you're talking the old ways now I'm talking the only way you just don't get it yet guys Andy let's get to our third or final question question number three man real quick you need another word from our sponsor you cracked the is that our other one oh no this is uh this is royale oh tell me about that way yeah so this is uh this is royale AF uh this is a little bit different than aqua bazzante sure yeah this is uh like the european version so this comes from the uh you know corroded pipes of Sicily um thousand year old aqua ducks that are rich with iron and vitamins and you know other contaminants um and the idea is is that you want to drink most of these contaminants because it makes your immune system better you know like you know if you're in a sterile environment you don't put anything bad in your body your immune system goes away so that's why I chose to work with these guys yeah yeah pazzante is listen I mean there is nothing on this planet the taste is good I drank royale AF it cured everything it cured all my inflammation I'm smarter I'm faster I'm stronger my penis is longer and more more round girthy it is Sicilian you can't ask me that off top of my head bro I got it bro you got it now man that was weak pazzante is such a superior product I mean listen you know good better best man it's all right aqua pazzante I got stuck with this royale AF luxury real AF H2O I love it what to say here ingredients water warning drinking might cause you to be a realist uh warning drinking will turn you into a pazzante yeah it's good it's good you know what I'm saying on that last bro these people don't understand because they not that look dude when you fucking when you when you're at the bot most of you guys are at the bottom of fucking Mount Everest let's just be fucking real you have these big goals these big dreams these big aspirations for yourself and you see mother fuckers up there at the top and you're like well I wonder how hard you got to work to be at the top and the guy at the top is like fuck that took everything I got bro and I'm smart and I've been doing this for 10 years and that took everything I got and the guy at the bottom is like fuck dude I go taking that I'll chill it'll work you know I could just and that's that's the misunderstanding dude take me two days again to the top it's a misunderstanding and it's because of this predatory entrepreneurship culture on the internet right all these stories of these people who you know make a few doubt like dude it the fake it till you make it culture right I'm gonna buy a nice car I'm gonna stand in front of it then I'm gonna tell you how much money I made and then I'm gonna sell you this program to tell you how much money I made but in reality I made the money selling you the program telling you how much money I made that's the entrepreneurship culture in a nutshell and that's the reason that people can't understand how hard it actually is to build something that has an equitable back end exit which is what the fuck you want you're not in this for just cash flow dude you're in this for an equitable return on your time investment so you're gonna get paid during the time you do it and then when you're ready to be done you have a big huge asset that you could sell and that's one entrepreneurship's about it's not just about cash flow bro you know yeah man I love it and then if it is about cash flow you gotta figure out how to invest properly which is hard to because there's a million trillion investors that are more hooked up and better than you and faster than you and more funded than you and have better relationships than you so like you don't think you have to become good at that like bro here's the bottom line you have to be great if you are not great you won't win so whatever it takes for you to be great whether you call that obsession or dedication or discipline doesn't fucking matter what matters is is that you go from where the fuck you are to where you need to be to win and that is it so call it whatever you want but it's hardest fucking it takes everything you got love it love it guys Andy question number three uh hi Andy and DJ my question is simple Andy do people really change i'm 35 years old and I've spent a big chunk of my life being selfish and just all around not being a good person i'm an addict and alcoholic i've been sober for three months and i'm trying to do better doing 75 hard i got a good job recently i want to be a better person um but you hear all the time that people don't really change so i guess i'm worried that i'll end up going back to being the person because that's the person i've always been uh thanks again for all you guys do Andy do people really change what's it what should take on that we out but you got to really want to change bro at 36 years old i was 350 fucking pounds i drank four nights a week i ate whatever the fuck i wanted i i haven't had Taco Bell in like 10 years dude i haven't i drink i mean how many times do i drink any year maybe three four maybe tops yeah right i used to drink four times yeah i drink i used to drink that many times in a week okay um so yeah people can change dude but you got to understand that you have to want to change and you should want to change because the time is running out and we are all on borrowed time and our time is is is much less than what we believe it is and by the time you're 45 you'll realize that right now you're still 35 you feel like you're kind of young i'm still a young guy i got all these options and you do but it if snap you're gonna be 45 and another snap you're gonna be 55 and another snap you're gonna be 65 and if you're still talking about one to be a better person there's not be enough time okay so i would recommend looking and assessing where you are now and i would say all right i don't like who i was which it sounds like you've already come to that conclusion and then just take the actions in the opposite direction all of this shit that you've heard about how hard it is and how people you know gotta go to these things for 50 years to stay you're focusing on the wrong shit okay when you focus on what you have to give up if you take a drink a guy who drinks and you say all right no beer for you that you can't have beer the all the guys gonna think about is when he can have his next beer because all the brain here is this beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer beer and all it does is it ends up breaking them same people same reason that when people go on a diet and they say can't have pizza okay well then the person's like pizza pizza pizza pizza and that's all they think about until they give into that all right so you have to change the way that you think and what i mean by that is you have to focus on who you're becoming and what you're gaining not what you're giving up to get there because when you start to focus on how much better you're getting and how much your life is getting better and how much more proud of yourself you are now all of a sudden those things that were causing that you start to see those things as the enemy you see those things as the reason that you were unhappy you see those things as i don't ever want to go back there because i know what that did to me it's the same reason when i say that people who celebrate 75 hard with a cake and whiskey and wine and all this shit they didn't learn and it means they didn't do the program because if you actually did the program you would have gotten so much fucking progress in that short time of 75 days that at the end of the 75 days you are literally afraid to come off the program you're like fuck i don't want to go back and you start to see these things like alcohol and food and these bad habits as the legit enemy of the life that you are now proud that you've created so instead of looking at it and saying well i've got to give up all this start saying well this is who i'm going to become and this is going to be awesome this is what my life is going to be like and keep your focus ahead and not behind and it's not as hard to let those things go okay this is a mental game this is not a physical game it's a mental game i had a guy message me the other day and he's like man i'm trying to get in shape i just hate healthy food now it's not that you hate healthy food it's that you've never been healthy so you don't know how much better it is and what you are now you see what i'm saying and i could promise you that if you were actually who you could be you would hate the food more than you fucking hate the work it takes to get there so my recommendation would be for you sir would be to live the live hard lifestyle because that's the thing that's cured me it's cured hundreds of thousands of other people from this habitual relapsing and that's why it's so funny when people are like oh it's not sustainable oh really it's not i'm pretty sure it's only fucking program that ever changed anybody because it addresses the issue at the core which is your mental fortitude your ability to adhere your ability to make decisions for yourself in the moment that are going to benefit the long-term version of you not the instant gratification that you would get from indulging in whatever the vice is now and when you start to understand this mentally and you start to live that way those things that have brought you the frustration the anger the life that you're not proud of become the fucking enemy you hate them you despise them like when i see people socially drinking all the time i think they're the weakest fucking bitches on the face of the earth and then i look at them and they're usually fucking out of shape and they're not making any money and they're celebrating every week and what the fuck are you celebrating bro you're broke you have a shitty car you have a shitty fucking relationship you're not in shape you look like shit but you're celebrating what are you celebrating you see what i'm saying so it's just a perspective switch i absolutely know for a undeniable fact because i've witnessed it hundreds of thousands if not millions of times over my course of my career and nutritional supplements fitness and with live hard program people change all the time dude it's just a decision that you got to make and you got to take the actions of the person that you want to become and when you think about you know like we've mentioned just a minute ago fake it till you make it when we think about like what fake it till you make it actually means it doesn't mean go out and buy a car and stand in front of it and you know fake your wealth to get money that's how it fake it till you make it means fake it till you make it actually means make the decisions that that person that you know you want to be like would make even when you're you now and eventually you become that person okay that's what fake it till you make it so decide who you want to be start making the decisions that person would make and eventually you legitimately become that in your life and it won't feel like that today and it won't feel like that tomorrow and because you lived your life the way that you've lived it for 35 years and you're not proud of it it's probably going to take a minute for you to adjust to being the kind of person you want to be but if you keep following with those actions over and over and over and over and over again of the person that you want to be like eventually you become that person and it's reality and like dude that's what it is it's just it's that simple dude so yeah you could change bro and you should change because you have people depending on you whether you have a family or whether you have you know friends or whether you have people peers at work there's people looking at you and they're saying fuck you know Joe either is as a great role model for me or I don't even pay attention to Joe because he's a piece of shit and dude if you're listening to this show it's because you care about shit you don't listen to this show just to be entertained you listen to this show because you care yeah we have entertainment on the show but this is a show that people who give a fuck listen to you because they want to get better and they realize that them being better makes everything else better and so you need to start thinking about it dude it's not just about you it's about your obligation to live a life that maximizes your potential as a human and maybe you're not a religious person but dude I'm gonna tell you this God wants you to be the best version of yourself do you have a son do you do you want your girls to be the best they could be Joe do you want your daughter to be the best as she could be if she lived below if those if your daughter's ended up living a life that was way below your potential would you be disappointed absolutely God's the same way God looks at us the same way he says I gave you all this potential all these gifts all this ability and you didn't do anything with it because you were lazy or because you let these things get in the way and that's a disappointment to God you're dis honoring your obligation to God you're dishonoring your obligation to your fellow citizen your neighbor your family and especially yourself by sitting there and saying I'm going to accept this version of myself that's less than what I could be and I think everybody falls into that trap because we're all propagated immensely in society that that is okay we see it on TV what do the men look like on TV yeah they look like fat middle age we're looking dudes that are standing in the backyard in a webric head of cooking hot dogs that answer to their wives correct okay what a messenger they sending they're sending the message of this is okay to be like this when they put a woman on a health magazine that's 400 pounds they say it's healthy what message are they selling they're saying to women you could be like this and this is normal and this is okay why do they do that well they do that because they want to they it's for control reasons if you're not at the best that you can be you are much easier to control and if you're much easier to control you're not going to have a fair shake in the way things that you know work out in terms of what we call freedom or what we desire as freedom so for us to fix what's going on in the country we have to fix the fix the culture to fix the culture we have to fix ourselves so it's not just about you bro it's about everybody it's about the people you're related to it's about the people to see you in the gas stations about the people who see you in the grocery store it's about your peers at work it's about the example that you set and if we don't do that and if you don't do that as an individual you have no right to bitch about the way things are in society because you're not contributing to the solution so get in shape stop drinking make good decisions treat people right put good things in your brain control what you control and stick to that and make the decisions of the person that you want to become not the decisions of the person that you have been and things are going to change bro and they're going to change forever as long as you keep following that formula i love it man absolutely love it man great great questions great answers man guys 80 that was three all right guys let's have a good week go pay the fee
