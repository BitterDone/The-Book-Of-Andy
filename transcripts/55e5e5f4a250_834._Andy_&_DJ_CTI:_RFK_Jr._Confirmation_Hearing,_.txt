What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate about in the lives the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome the motherfucking reality guys. We have Andy and DJ crews the motherfucking in there. That's what we're going to do. What's up dude? Hi, we're just getting right into it man. I'm in a hurry. Yep. I just got out of a tasting 47 energy drinks and I'm cracked out of my mind. Yeah. Yeah. So we're just going to get it going right now. Don't forget to pay the fee. Don't be a hoe. Share the show. All right. What's going on brother? We got a lot. Let's try to punch it in here then. Yeah. You guys are used to the girth but we're going to see what we could get here. You know this is the something I talked about before I always get you know a little flat but I think I have an equivocal proof of what cowboys are gay. Dallas Cowboys football team. No. Yep. Jerry Jones compares owning the cowboys to smiles and glory holes. What? What you know about glory holes bro? You're kind of telling on yourself there a little bit. You're not supposed to talk about those things. That's within the circle of trust. Is this like a old people thing? Because I know Jerry Jones got way he's like one for the glory holes. No. Jerry Jones. What do you mean? I'm saying like is it an older thing to where you just like get to that point bro and you just start like just saying weird shit? You know this is funny that you bring this up. Okay. Cause I've thought a lot about this. So you know I'm in my 40s. But I shut up. But by the way I keep getting better. So like I don't know what you're damn out you're fine. Yeah you're good bro. I mean fuck dude. Good bottle of wine. That's exactly right. So let's but I think about this right? Like I see clips of me on the internet and I'm like what the fuck is wrong with that guy. You know what I'm saying? Like it's not just you guys it's me too. And cause like and dude you've been around me long enough and you guys here in the room you know I say whatever I want anytime wherever you want. Yeah. And I never really figured out why I'm like that. But I thought about it. And I think this is why I think because I've been doing what I do since I was 19 and I've been working seven days a week for 26 years full fucking days basically a lot of hours. Okay and if you add up all the hours that I've worked I've already worked an entire lifetime of work. All right. And when you work an entire lifetime of work that actually makes your brain kind of like an old man right. Okay. All right. So like and so I think I picked this up because I got so much. So many hours of shit that I've dealt with that finally like I just don't give a fuck. So I don't think it's actually like age. I think it's like how much stuff you deal with and eventually you just stop giving a fuck. You're like bro I don't have time to fucking deal with your perception of what I'm going to say. So I'm just going to say it. Smiles and glory. Yeah. That's right. And I don't know where he's coming from. Well that's the thing. So Jerry Jones may not be giving cowboy fans a lot to cheer about but he is dispensing pure gold when it comes to one line. So they axed him basically at a reporter. You know the cowboy has got knocked out of the playoffs and the divisions and all of that good stuff. And they axed him what it was like owning the cowboys. And he said smiles and glory. I got a clip man. Let's check it out. There's a very low percentage of this that is smiles and glory holds. Very low percentage. Well fuck bro I get what he's saying. What he's saying is it's a fun. All right. Like everybody thinks that doing things are look man. Imagine everything that you did the whole world saw. Okay. And like dude everybody criticizes everything that you do all the time. All right. I fully so yes sometimes but listen bro. Entrepreneurship which is what he is. Ain't fucking fun bro. It's not fun. It's very rarely fun. It is a you sign up for an eternal beating and you know sometimes you win. It's like I tell everybody bro. You know 2% of the time you win 10% of the time you don't know what the fuck's going on. And you know that 88% of the time you're getting your ass beat. And that's how it works man. So I get what you say. It's like it ain't always sunshine. Yeah what he's saying is it ain't always getting your dick sucked. You know because dick getting your dick sucks fun. It's pretty nice. Yeah that's what I'm saying. I mean everybody can universally agree that you like that. Okay yeah right. Do you like it? I love it. Yeah. Do you guys like it? You. Is he showing they do that in India? We don't have 1 billion people in it like that. All right that makes sense. There we go. All right. All right. I'm gonna sue 3. Yeah. All right. What's up guys. He's plugging himself over here. Do not redeem. All right. Yeah okay. Okay so you guys aren't sucking him over there bro. You're just planting them seas deep in there man. Which is being efficient. That's right. But we'll take over. Yeah so just a little misunderstanding. Somebody read their DMs. Who's India's? India's. India's going to take over the fucking world through population. Everyone should tie. All right. Yeah. All right so the lesson here is don't be an entrepreneur unless you want to get your ass kicked most of the time and the payoff is you get to drive a nice car. Yeah. Yeah. Well Jerry Jones is fucking rich. I mean he's fucking good. Oh yeah. Yeah. Because I mean he pretty much owns Dallas damn near right. He's one of the richest men in the world. Yeah. All right. So they always smiles and glory holds. I love it. Well let's get into this cruise guys. We got a lot of stuff. But I gotta say this. I mean you're gonna get your ass beat either way. That's the problem. That's what people don't understand. Like it like you're. It's like it's do you want. Do you want to get an ass beating with a reward or do you want to get an ass beating with no reward just that is it's very simply that choice. That is the choice. Do you want to be successful? Okay. If so you got to do these things that are very hard and you get something for it later. Do you want to be lazy? So you get to do things that aren't very hard but eventually the real shit comes and beats the fuck out of your whole life. So you're gonna get the beating. You know what I'm saying? Mine is well get the reward. Mine is well get the nice. That's what I. Yeah. That's how I look at it. I love it man. Well guys, let's get into this cruise. Got a lot of stuff to cover today. Remember if you want to see any of these pictures or articles, links, videos, go to AndyFacela.com you guys can find them all linked there with that being said. Headline number one. Big talk of the town today. You know, obviously not all of Trump's cabinet is in yet. There's still a few that are going through their confirmation hearings. Cash Patel for example, he doesn't even start his until tomorrow I believe. But got RFK in. RFK's confirmation hearing. There's a lot of interesting exchanges that are happening there with RFK Jr. And again, Trump's trying to pick him to lead the US Department of Health and Human Services. So it's a big department covers FDA. I believe EPA is in there. The CDC, right? Like I mean, the health, the actual physical health of the country. Basically all the people that fuck this during COVID. Very, very important positions. Yes. Very, very important position. And you know, RFK was on the ballot. He ran as an independent, fold it, you know, not too far after, right? Because independence don't really work in this country. But you know, dropped out, endorsed Donald Trump and then you know, things have been good. Couple of big things has happened so far. RFK Jr. says, link between anti depressants and school shooters should be studied. Yeah. You know what else should be studied? The link between school shooters and the amount of communication they have with three letter agencies. Well, it's funny. You say that because his follow up actually included that. He says, I think he kind of hinted to it. But his full statement was quote, it should be studied along with other potential culprits. If that's not a fucking nod, I don't know what else. Yes. I mean, because I mean, we've covered that shit on the show thousands of times. And but he says, yeah, quote, the science shows. This is a Senator Tina Smith. She says the science shows that there is no link between school shootings and anti depressants. And RFK Jr. is not back that there couldn't have been published scientific studies on that because of hippo rules, which is one of the things that he's trying to write. These people just can do. They throw these. It's like when you're arguing, well, it's like when you're arguing with a leftist and you say shit and they just make shit up on the way back. Well, it's funny. And they say things like, well, doctor say or the science says or experts say, well, who the fuck are the experts? Oh, all people that think just like you, right? Well, they say the vaccine said, well, who says that? Yeah. Well, the studies said, well, who funded those studies? Yeah. Oh, the motherfuckers that made the vaccine. Of course it works. No shit. Come on, everybody knows this. The problem is the old bro, everybody doesn't know it. That's the problem. People don't know that these studies that say things are safe and efficacious are funded by the people who make that, right? They don't know that, right? And then the doctors who tell you that. And they also don't know that studies can be manipulated and are manipulated based upon the funding that they receive. Do you think that a big farmer company that hires a company that does studies on, you know, the effectiveness of medications is going to turn around and say, your medication doesn't work when they get tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year to study their medications? Like, dude, no, nobody's doing that. They're going to say, hmm, how do we make this look like it works? How do we make this look like it's safe? And they're experts at that. That's what they do. And that is something that Americans do not understand about these quote unquote experts or studies. It's, it's like me saying, hey, DJ, do a study on this energy drink. It's best fucking to pay it. I'm going to pay it. And then by the way, I got 100 more behind me than I'm going to pay you to do. You're not going to come to me and say that fucking sucks because I'm going to cut all this money off from you. And that's what's going on here. And Americans don't understand that. It's great. And to that, to that same point, then that same pharmaceutical company gets to directly advertise the shit to us, right? And like, and we see it in the commercials that make these commercials look all nice and people happy and shit. But then like the last 30 seconds is this monotone reading of all the fucking bad shit that's going to happen to you. If you take it, yeah, you know what I'm saying? But like, and it's unique to America because we're one of the only countries. I think there's only like two countries that allow to directly advertise us, which is I think I hope another thing that he can fucking fit. Well, and then think of this, if you're bombard, okay, if you watch cable television or dish or any of these things, almost every ad or every other ad that comes up is pharmaceutical. All right. So when you think of the mental health crisis that we have in this country, quote unquote, mental health crisis, could it be that people just don't feel good because they're not doing things like eating right, training, moving their body, drinking water, getting in the sun, having a mission, having a purpose. And then they don't feel good about that. And then they see all these TV ads that convince them that they need these medications to fix a problem that it's actually fixed within decisions they make daily. Right. Or you add social media into that and you have people that are showing you the best parts of their life and making you think they like, something's wrong with you. If you're not grunting Lamborghini, 100%. But the thing, but what I'm saying here is that there's a prime fertile soil that is intentionally set up for people to be made to think that they are victims and need these drugs. When in reality, very simple things fix them. And anybody who lives the live hard lifestyle understands this because all of a sudden, they do things, like workout twice a day, drinking down the water, put some good shit in their brain, get outside, all these things that are part of the program, they make them feel fucking great. And then it builds the discipline that they have belief and they cultivate confidence and they build all these things. And now all of a sudden they realize, holy shit, the reason I didn't feel good was because I wasn't actually being a fucking human being and being in control of my environment. And now all of a sudden they don't need all this shit, right? But these people intentionally propagate being a victim so they can sell more fucking drugs. So they make you feel like shit intentionally so that you will be a mega consumer of everything that they make. How is that okay? That's not okay. And it's not okay that these senators and congressmen and all these people that are talking to RFK are trying to protect their pockets. The matrix so to speak, from making people sick, like what the fuck is going on? Well, it's because the former companies pay them too. Dude, I know, but what I'm saying is from a moral standpoint, think of how big of a piece of shit you have to be to intentionally advocate for human illness and depression and terrible mental health and physical health for a couple bucks on your fucking campaign. You're a piece of shit, bro. You're going to burn in hell. 100% well, it's even more fucked up too about the situation, man. Is the mainstream media again, we know they lie. We know they do this shit all the time, but they just got exposed pretty badly with this specific situation. Not sure if you guys saw this fake news busted far left hack has prewritten negative headline on her screen before the RFK junior hearing even starts. Did you see this shit? So this lady, here's a video, the hearing has not even began yet. She's sitting there at her little press desk and she's just already typing up a little article. Here's a clip, took this out because they zoom in on it. When you zoom in on what she's writing, the screen literally says, RFK junior faces grilling on anti vaccine comments and animal mutilation at confirmation hearing Trump live up to it hasn't even fucking started. Well, yeah, I mean, look, dude, I mean, why would you assume anything else? I don't, I don't under like this shouldn't be a shock to anybody at this point. Yeah. I mean, it's just the first time that I've seen it where, you know, yeah, but see all these people like that are on the inside. They understand how this works. They are no longer reporting the news. They're creating the news. And that's what they look at themselves as their purpose to be when I was younger and when journalism was journalism, these people went to school because they cared about the fucking truth. Now they want to be journalists because they understand that they can control the narrative. Yeah. And it's a completely different mentality. And it's not good. You don't who gives you the right to control the narrative of truth. Nobody. It's an elitist, ego-tistical, disgusting mentality. Like that you think you could control the truth. Like how, who the fuck you think you are? You grew up, you grew up over here down the street. You went to college and now you think you could control the fucking world. Right. It used to be like a fucking house catches on fire. They go report, hey, a house caught on fire. Now there's an, I think a house is going to catch on fire at 3 p.m. It should, should enough. Yeah. Like it makes zero sense, man. But there was some other interesting exchanges when the hearing actually began. One of those being Comrade Bernie Sanders. This does say some cool shit the other day, but now he's kind of fucking himself up again. He lost his shit today with RFK actually. This headline reads Comrade Bernie Sanders blows up and goes on a crazy tirade about onesies after RFK Junior refuses to fall for a stupid gotcha question. Let's check this clip up. You have started a group called the Children's Health Defense. You're the original. Right now as I understand that on their website they are selling what's called onesies. These are little things building for babies. One of them is titled Unfaxed on Afraid. Next one in the soul for 26 bucks a piece by the way. Next one is no Vax, no problem. They are coming before this committee and you say you are pro-vaccine. Just want to ask some questions. And yet your organization is making money selling a child's product to parents for 26 bucks which has fundamental doubt on the usefulness of vaccines. Can you tell us now that you will, now that you are pro-vaccine, that you're going to have your organization take these products off the market? Senator, I have no power over that organization. You've heard of it, I resigned from the board. Yeah, I was just a few months ago. You founded that. You certainly have power. You can make that. How do you support about this? I've had nothing to do with this. Are you supportive of these onesies? I'm supporting your vaccines. Are you supportive of this clothing which is a currently anti-vaccine? I am supportive of vaccines. I want good science and I want to protect that. You will not tell the organization you founded not to continue selling that product. Thank you. I want the link actually. Listen, here, listen, this generalization that everybody likes to do about everything, okay, is the problem in our communication in this country, all right? You can be okay with vaccines as long and exactly what he says. If science exists behind them, the problem is there's no good science. But now for all vaccines, their vaccine used to mean that you took it and whatever the fuck you had went away forever. That's what it used to mean. And then somewhere along the line, it's changing and just getting a shot, okay? They did that because under the definition of vaccine, when you define a drug as a vaccine, you cannot be sued for the side effects of the vaccine. So they are now calling things vaccines that aren't vaccines by the old definition so that they can have legal immunity for whatever fucking happens and make billions of dollars, all right? That's what people fail to understand. Do you know how many people say, oh, I can't wait till the COVID vaccine. We see these commercials that say, if you took the COVID vaccine, you're not going to see those because they're immune from those lawsuits, all right? And that's why they call these things vaccines. RFK is telling the truth. You can be okay with some vaccines if the science is right, but the science is not right on a lot of these vaccines and it certainly was it right on the COVID vaccine at all on any of them, okay? It was a huge, and we don't know yet. We don't know what it was. I think I know what it was. It was a fucking sea. I think I know what it was. It was a depopulation tactic at worst and at best, it was a tactic to create a situation where people had to take more drugs to counteract the side effects of that. So it was either a money making play or a legit depopulation play. Some of the people that estimate the deaths on the vaccines globally right now are saying upwards of fucking 15 to 17 million people have died, all right? I'm not saying that's a fact. Yes, I'm saying that's an estimate on the upper end. So we have to realize, like these generalizations are what's hurting people, like bro, just because black dude fucking shoots somebody doesn't mean all black people are criminals. Just because a politician steals money doesn't mean they all steal money. Well, most of them do that. But the reality is, is like these generalizations that are made in society, all white people are racist. That's what is hurting our ability to unite. And these motherfuckers, it's amazing to me how stupid these people are in Washington, DC. The reality of what's happened here is that all the winners, all the smart people, okay? All the people who go out and build things from nothing, those people go out and take advantage of the fertile soil of this country to make money. People who aren't equipped and aren't skilled, they figure out how to make money by going to the fucking Washington. And that has to change. We have to get back to a country where the people who are the producers and are responsible get more involved in the government. And that's also why these people fucking hate Trump so much and they hate all these independent people so much because they're not, they're people who have proven themselves outside of that corrupt ecosystem. 100% man. 100% guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the chat. What about being so let's go check out the chat. Yeah, this first one. Yeah, it's from, it's from El Tal Avon. El Tal Avon, Ivan, 1503. Oh, please, bunch of yapping. You guys along with your country haven't changed. It's based of racism. Be honest, he's probably not here anymore. He's probably not here anymore in the country. And you haven't changed. It's based on, he said, I think he's saying it's based on racism. Okay. Okay. All right, all right, man. Then leave. Don't come here. I'm a fuck. Oh, you heard me so much. Yeah, I mean, look, dude, you know what? If you're not American, get the fuck out. How about that? Is that racist? Is it? No, I don't think it is either. It's a matter of time. Every other country in the face of the earth since the history of time is operated that way. All right. We have Chinese people, Japanese people. India has Indians fucking around has Iranians. English have English Americans have Americans. And guess what? If you ain't American, you could fucking leave. If that's racist, then we're all fucking racist here. Okay. Like whatever whole world's based on. Yeah, yeah. I haven't changed. It's based on racism. Okay. I better shut up and delete my whole fucking channel before I get called racist the same 15 years ago. Nobody gives a fuck. Yep. 100%. I don't call us, but get the fuck out of here. It'll tie to Ivan. Yeah. And why the fuck are you watching? If it's so much, you happen. What's that say about you dumb ass? This is nice comment comes from a council of Andrews. Council of Andrews. He says, Andrew is the best name. Source. Trust me, bro. We have a scholarship for Andrews. This is a legit organization. It is highly accredited. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And obviously very intelligent. And I am honored to be a part of it. Now, the council of Andrews. Do you have to like join it or you just born into it? Well, you know, you can be, you can join it. You can be born into it. You could change your name into it. Really? Okay. Yeah. But, you know, pretty much there's a hierarchy of, you know, and I'm at the top. I might change my name. To what? Andy. Well, it's Andrew. I'll change it to Andrew. Okay. That'd be weird. Huh? That'd be weird. Isn't it weird that all my family calls me Andrew and everybody else in the world? No, it's Andy. Everybody knows you. Yeah. It's very rare. I see anybody call you Andrew actually. Yeah. I mean, this is my dad. One person. Sound my dad, my mom. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I am. I'm honored. Thank you. You see the logo? Yeah. I am the, I am the honorary scholarship winner. I like to, you know, I got nothing. But high intelligence and big mouth. I like it. Yeah. All right. Some might argue low intelligence is a big mouth. Yeah. But then I would just show you my wallet. This last, last comment comes from at BDSS. I don't know what that means. What does it mean? BDSS. There's some slingsh it, maybe. BDSS says, 13 minute, 13.09, ending the federal reserve. Okay. You know, people are making me hard. There we go. All right. Yeah. I'm going to make you richer, too. Bro, you know, some people got mad at me about, about saying what I said. Like about Kadafi and Hitler and, uh, fucking. Sonam. I'm not saying they were great people. I'm saying that's why they were killed. That's why they were killed. And, and if you want to know why they call fucking Trump Hitler, it's, it's, it's a fucking, they understand what he's trying to do. It makes sense man. He's trying to, yes, he's trying to do the same things economically that a lot of these men were trying to do that pulled themselves off the Federal Reserve and created a situation where the Federal Reserve couldn't allow that example to happen. So they've preemptively been calling Trump Hitler not because he hates Jews. He fucking just put up law today to deport anti-Semite or pro-Homass students. So we can talk about a different time, but the point is it's not about him hating anybody. It's about what he's trying, his economically wants you to think. Yes, it's about his economic strategy and how it affects those people that control the Federal Reserve and happen to control the media. So when you wonder why they fucking scream Hitler at Trump, that's why it's not because he's going to put you in some fucking camp or some shit. Well, he actually just opened up one time on pay for who? For the illegals. Okay, for the illegals. Yeah, well, the non-Americans. They had Auschwitz, we got one time on them. No, bro, come on, you can't compare that. That's not what I'm saying. It's not the same. Yeah, and like, dude, people get all fucking crazy when you say this shit. Those people were, those people were this and they were that and they were this and they were that. Okay, well, who told you that they were this? Right. Okay. I'm sorry. And where are the, you know, where is, where is, what do they say over there about these people? You see what I'm saying? So like, we have to, like, and if you think about the media right now, like we live in an age where the media is very easily exposed for lying, but it hasn't always been that way. Okay. And if the same people have owned the media for 150 fucking years, what does that mean that they were doing before that? All right. How do you know that any of the shit that you've been told is actually true? You don't. I don't. And nobody does. Anybody who says they do unless they were fucking there is lying because we've seen for the last five or six years how hard they tried to create the narrative. And you know, me included say things like, well, when I was young, it was the news. Well, I don't know if it was the news. Now I'm actually wondering if it was the news. You know, like, I don't know if that history was exactly right. And I think that's something that we all need to come to terms with. And it doesn't mean that doesn't mean someone's a big hit or an anti-Semite or a fucking, you know, hate a Nazi or hates anybody. That just means it's smart to ask questions about things because we've seen how willing they are to manipulate the actual storyline of history. For example, like when at J6, when the year anniversary of J6, they try to do a candlelight visual and make it and you had Kamala Harris say, you know, December 7, 1941, September 11th, like she tried to create all these associations with J6, which were not even comparable. Okay. And they did that so that we all thought we're a watch that we're like, this is insane. What the fuck are they talking about? It ain't for us. It's not for us. It's for our grandkids 50 years from now to watch the news clips and say, holy shit, look what they did. And dude, it blew up in their face because it's not fucking true. Okay. So we, and that's just one example. So we've been able to see them manipulate, manipulate, manipulate, manipulate, manipulate, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to create the news cycle and the narrative. And dude, they've been doing this for 100 and fucking 50 years. So, so we have a right to ask the questions about how things really were, right? I think we're intelligent people to do that. And it doesn't mean you're a bad person because you don't trust what some group says about history when, you know, you weren't there to fucking witness it. I mean, dude, I'm from Missouri, bro. The slogan here is show me state. Show me state. I don't believe shit until I see it. That's the truth. One, two, something guys, we do appreciate you for being our last fans, BDFS. We're glad you're hard. Yeah. Full three inches. Keep liking. Keep commenting. Actually, if it's probably like a big old eight incher, you're listening to this show. Yeah. All the dudes live this show got big old hogs. What the? Okay. What? I said, listen, I didn't say do the show. One of the things it does the show is one of the, at least one for sure. I mean, statistically, yeah, at least one of us in this room. Yeah. Well, I mean, we talked about history being a lie, right? Where did that narrative come from? We said it's the show me state. Yeah. I don't know, probably that. Little red rocket guys. Hell, I know. Get the fuck out of here. Hell, I know. But two, we got some new fresh faces in the White House. Oh, yeah. Obviously, there's a lot of new people. Yeah, I rid of the dude with the fingernails and the fake gay voice. Yeah. And the first black your favorite person, immigrant lesbian, Haitian, Q tip hair, pants who pantsuit wearing world's most infamous liar. You liar. Yeah. They got rid of her. First, man, got some new blood, man. I'm going to miss her, bro. Like I was going to actually like I was like broke because her shit's so full of shit. Man, I bet she feels good not being up there. But she disappeared for like last month. If I was her, I would just go away. Like, where do you go though? Away. Because here's the problem too. Like, these people are unemployable. Yeah. Who's not higher? Someone who needs to tell lies. She was saying, like, all right guys, this is another company. We got bring it in. I mean, motherfuckers, if you can handle fucking PR, like she did. And yeah, I mean, she'll find some degenerate company to work for. Price CNN. But she will be on CNN or MSNBC. Oh, there and T. Yeah. That's the only place they could go. They're going to give her a spot. Yeah. But we got a new one now. So she KGB KGP has been replaced. Thank God. By the new White House press secretary, Carolyn Levitt. She vows to hold media accountable for lies. This lady's a badass. She's badass. She's fucking awesome. She held her first press briefing the other day. And she hit the ground running. She hit the ground running. You talk about qualified. I mean, she can fuck like bro, she's awesome. She's awesome. And it's cool too because it's been four fucking years since we've had that. Now, the Trump's former press secretary, he had K, was it him, Kaylee McEleney? McEleney. Yeah. Kaylee was good. The governor now of Arkansas, I believe. It's a good thing. Huckabee. Yeah, Sarah Huckabee. Yeah, I mean, awesome. She's badass. Awesome. Yeah. And you can obviously see they're still employed. Right. Yeah. But yeah, Carolyn's awesome, man. And she's been on a warpath. She's been lining people up and, you know, cross since he's in dot knives. Carolyn Levitt destroys clueless, leftist journalist who doesn't know what a criminal is. And he's still reporting, is asking the same questions over and over. Let's check couple of these clips out from her. I'm going to go to the immigration. I'm going to go to the immigration. The Georgia 500 arrests, ISIS made so far since President Trump came back into office. Can you just tell us the numbers? How many have a criminal record versus those who are just in the country illegally? All of them because they illegally broke our nation's laws and therefore they are criminals as far as this administration goes. I know the last administration didn't see it that way. So it's a big culture shift in our nation to view someone who breaks our immigration laws as a criminal, but that's exactly what they are. They all have a criminal record. And welcome to the break. If they broke our nation's laws, yes, they are criminals. How hard is it? Hold on. How hard is it to understand this? Like criminals, by definition, are people who break the law. So if you come here illegally, you are a criminal. By definition. How hard is that to grasp? They can't grasp this with the gun sheet either. Okay. They're going to make laws. You're going to make laws and put up no guns in the school. Okay. Criminals don't care about your laws because by definition, they are criminals. I do not understand how the shooter got here. How can these people pretend that they are intelligently superior to everybody else and not grasp a very simple concept of word definition if you break a law. You are a criminal. Criminals don't obey laws. So you're going to make laws to control the criminals. That's pretty fucking stupid. It does not make sense to anybody. Did we have a big enough note? You know what the criminals think? That's right. That's what the school guy shot up because obviously the sign was too small. You have a bigger sign. You know what I'm saying? I got a bad idea. Let's take all the other good people's guns. Let's take their guns away. Yeah. And the criminals, guess what they're going to do. They're going to realize, holy shit. I'm the holy one with guns. I can do whatever I want. Like these motherfuckers that put signs in front of their house to say we believe in gun laws. Well, that's the house I'm going to rob. I'm going to do that one first. You know what I'm saying? Like what is wrong with you guys? Listen dude, I don't understand how some of these motherfuckers get dressed. I really don't. Do you? How do you think KGB got dressed? You must be the first blind secretary too. Oh man, but let's take another clip off from. I feel bad for her, dude. I kind of want to send her like bad for her. I kind of want to send her a card and say thank you for all the material for the last four years. And the fashion advice. Yeah, they would get her on. She ain't coming. I don't know fucking way. Bro, you could always tell when she knew she was lying because she started laughing. You know what I'm saying? I bet if you got her and you gave her a couple drinks and we were just hanging out and she knew that we like no record. She'd be like holy shit dude. You don't even know what the fuck I had to deal with. But yeah, I'll listen. Her replacement is awesome. Yeah, Carolyn, Caroline, I mean, it's so weird seeing competent people like take questions and like it's actually worth like it's bizarre. Bro, check this clip out from from Carolyn. Miller. Thanks, Caroline. A question that we've asked your predecessors of both parties in this job. When you're up here in this briefing room speaking to the American public, do you view yourself and your role as speaking on advocating on behalf of the president or providing the unbarish truth that is not to lie, not to obfuscate to the American people? I commit to telling the truth from this podium every single day. I commit to speaking on behalf of the president of the United States. That is my job. And I will say it's very easy to speak truth from this podium when you have a president who is implementing policies that are wildly popular with the American people. And that's exactly what this administration is doing. It's correcting the lies and the wrongs of the past four years. Many of the lies that have been told to your faces in this very briefing room. I will not do that. But since you brought up truth, seek I would like to point out while I vow to provide the truth from this podium, we ask that all of you in this room hold yourselves to that same standard. We know for a fact there have been lies that have been pushed by many legacy media outlets in this country about this president, about his family. And we will not accept that. We will call you out when we feel that your reporting is wrong or there is misinformation about this White House. So yes, I will hold myself to the truth and I expect everyone in this room to do the same. And Caroline, even with all of this great truth and all this shit working right now, it's awesome to see. I want you to look at this political headline that they decided to push out. Project 2025 is already massively reshaping America. They're still trying to push this project 2025 shit. They're still pushing it. Like we, you know, yeah, Caroline talking about, you know, the truth and honesty. Not after that, they want to push this bullshit. It's nonsense. But you know what's funny, man, is the mainstream media continues to fall apart. Did you see last week that CNN, their total gross number of viewers were like less than 500,000? No. And that was the fucking inauguration and everything, bro. Well, I mean fucking terrible. And then they have a, they, they have a platform to stand on and talk about truth. Bro, the reason nobody's watching them is because they know that they're not saying anything is true. Bro, and like, they're saying anything that's kind of true at this point. Well, not only that, but again, it's so easy to expose it to. Yeah. Like this that comes out far left New York magazine caught cropping black people out of all white Trump party. Did you see this shit? Yeah. Yeah, bro, that's a, that's a CJA's party. He threw a person. So they push this fucking, they, they, they crop the, they, and you can see the full picture here. I mean, I would say, I would say that that is representative. Right. Good, good, good cut there like 13% in the picture. Yeah. Right. I mean, yeah, like that's representative of the Democrat. What is? I mean, like, that's the demographic, right? But they crop the picture out. It's all white people. So cut all the black people out. It's all young white people and suits that look good. And then, but then, bro, but look, and then they put in the fucking article though, have you noticed the entire room is white or almost everyone is white. You mean out of the picture that you fucking crop the black people out of? Well, I mean, they've been cropping you guys out of everything else for fucking, uh, a hunt, fucking 70 years. What the fuck do they, it's just Elon Musk called it out. He shut this, this tweet, he says they literally did the meme. Yeah. Yeah. They did. They did the meme. But other good stuff is happening. We'll keep this rolling. A couple of other little cool updates that have happened. We got the new Secretary of Defense, Pete Hexath. He just did a pretty big, dick move. Pentagon pulling general Miele's security detail and clearance immediately. He may even face demotion and retirement. You see that? Any thoughts on that at all? Yeah. I think it was a great move. I mean, the dudes are fucking trader. Is it trade to truck country? I think it should be way worse than just that. You got to start somewhere. Well, it's good start. It's a damn good start. It's because the pulling of a security detail and the clearance means you won't know when it's coming. Yeah. I'm saying so. I mean, it's great. Plus, these people have made millions of fucking dollars in the last four years. He can go higher as long. He can, like, what taxpayers should be paying for this fucking dude. He's a fucking trader, my personal opinion. It's not an opinion. He called China ahead and said, hey, if an attack, whatever to have come from us, I will call you ahead of time and let you know. That's the, he absolutely is a trader. 100%. Okay. So, fuck that guy. Fuck the cook. But yeah, let's head on to you, man. Guys, let us know what you guys think down in the comments. With that being said, let's keep this cruise cruise. And we got final headline number three. You like, you ever been to Chicago? Yeah, I love Chicago. I like Chicago. Yeah. I love Chicago. You can see pretty much anything. Yeah. I love that, you know, the Cardinals own the Cubs pretty much forever. I love that. That's true. You know, that's true. That's true. But I love going there because they like to act like that's not the truth. Cup fans are weird. No, they're whole fucking fan base is weird. Like the black hawks fans and everybody, like, they pretend like cakes. It's weird. You know, here's what I will say. The Chicago people are tough as fuck. Oh, they are. Okay. Yeah. Like, you know, it's like, I don't know, you know, it's like, I'm just, you gotta root for a team like the Cubs and you keep showing up. You keep showing up. You keep showing up year after year after year. I mean, dude, I was glad I actually was happy when they won that World Series because I was worried about my fucking homies up there, bro. Like, yeah, you gotta throw, you know, you can starve people, but you gotta throw them something. They're going down, then. Yeah. But they are fighters, bro. Yeah, they're tough. They're fighters. Yeah. But I, I, I do, like, real talk. I love Chicago. Awesome. And I love that I love the relationship people in St. Louis have with Chicago people because we hate them, but it's also like if someone else walked in the room, we will fuck you up. You know, say it. I can talk shit about it. Yeah. That's it. That's exactly the relationship between Cardinals and Cubs fans and, and St. Louis people in Chicago people. Yeah. It's real. It's actually cool. It's like brothers, like, like, we're going to beat the shit out of each other. But if dude walks in randomly and says something, we're going to gang up on you and you're getting the fuck out of here. But yeah, Chicago's full of fighters, apparently, from the sports fans to the city of Dalton. Did you see this? We've covered this lady a few times. Dalton dictator Tiffany Hinyard jumps into chaotic brawl between angry activists, her boyfriend losing her wig after she's called a bitch during a tense board meeting. Bro, listen, this shit is fucking wild. It is absolutely wild. There was a board meeting. She's actually about, she's on the way out. I was just talking to a buddy who's up in Chicago actually about this. She's on the way out. I think her, her 10 years up in like February, so less than a month. And yeah, Mayor Tiffany Hinyard throwing herself into a huge brawl that broke out at a town board meeting with her, when her boyfriend charged an activist who called her a bitch. This started flying after Jedadaya Brown called Hinyard a half-assed mayor at the local Illinois meeting, accusing her of sleeping her way to the top. Quote, you go, bitch. The fuming activist called the mayor of Dalton Village and then all hell broke loose. Let's check the clip up. Fucking white supremacy bro. Look at all that white supremacy. I like it. Not for why you guys think I like it. I like it because it's good to see the citizens, the people, finally saying enough of this bullshit. It's good to see bro. I like it for that aspect of it. And obviously we struggle with black home black crime and they're living up to those stereotypes. But I'm glad to see the people are fucking over the shit. It's good to see. I'm not putting my that's my take. Yeah, where's the rest of it? Where's the where's the rest of it? That's what I'm saying. We got to finish the job here guys. You got to start somewhere though. It's a start. Yeah, it's a start. She lost her wig. Yeah, well, that's a start. She should got a better one. Dude, that lady's a total bitch bro. For real. Like she gets out there and rules over everybody. People hate her and then steals. Yeah. Well, that out fucking steals. I mean, look dude, listen. You can't have a society that doesn't hold anybody accountable and then expect people to not take advantage of that. Right. I mean, it's fairly simple. It's just like the criminal breaking the law definition. Correct. I mean, it's the same, same concept here. But she's not the only mayor though that, you know, is a ruffalo of some feathers around the country right now. Let's go up to Minneapolis. Minneapolis, Minnesota. Minneapolis mayor announces city will not cooperate with Trump's deportation policy. Do you see this? Yes. Bro, for those of you who have not seen her this, let's check this clip out first and then we'll get into it. I want to speak directly to people who are undocumented. We love you. We care about you. In the city of Minneapolis, we will stand up for you and we will do anything in our power to help because you're not an alien in our city. You're a neighbor. Look at they stole the fucking house. Now in Minneapolis, we have what is called a separation ordinance. And that separation ordinance states clearly that our city officials, our police officers and beyond will not be gathering information, showing who is and who is not documented. We do not ask the question with regard to immigration status and because we haven't asked the question, we don't have any data to show documentation status in our city. Our police officers will not be cooperating with federal law enforcement around federal immigration law. We enforce state and local laws here in Minneapolis and we will do so to the best of our ability. But as for cooperation with ICE, the answer is no. Okay. I highly doubt that because the next thing is going to be him getting rated and put a jail 100% and that guy doesn't look like a guy that would be able to handle jail. Oh, just fine. I don't think he knows. I want to point something out and I'm just going to say it because everybody's thinking it. She lied. She ain't no sign language, bro. Do you see that shit? I don't know sign language, dude. Me either, but I don't think that was it. I'm sure it was. These people aren't that bad, are they? Bro, no, listen, that was a lady in Florida. Yeah, I remember we covered that. Okay. Yeah. Maybe that is it. Let's see. I'm going to play it without the audio and just watch this shit because to me, she, she's sizzling. Like she knows what this is fucking plant. Let's see. Look what she does with a tug. She lying. No, I don't know, man. I don't know enough. But even without the sound, that guy looks like he's going to hate jail. That girl, look at the girl in the back right, man. She's just like. Dude, these people look miserable, don't they? They always do. They always try, because they're always trying to play this moral, high card authority. Like, oh, I'm so, I'm so disappointed. It's a sad day for democracy. It's what you've done. It's just inexcusable. Andy, I want you to know you're not an alien. What are you, what are you going to do to what actions are you going to take to make this right with the people that you offended? I'm going to save democracy. I'm going to save. I'm going to save. Are you playing on apologizing? Probably, actually, I publish it. I mean, that's how these people look. He's not going to make it. And how about that? Who is that back there? What's that girl's name? Ilan Omar. Yeah, Ilian Omar, who doesn't even belong to brother. You know, to brother. That, I don't, is that true? I think that's true. I don't know if that's true for citizenship. But, but regardless, she openly states that her interest lie was Somali. Somali. Okay. Well, when is she being deported? Right. Okay. We shouldn't have people who have interests of other countries no matter what country it is in our government. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. At all. But here's the thing, man. You know, and we've talked about it. No matter what country. No. Whatever country. But here's the thing. We've covered this because it's always, it's always these fucking politicians, right? Who want us to believe that these are the decisions as best for us. But when you actually talk to the communities, when you actually talk to the victims, when you talk to the communities, you have to deal with these fucking decisions that these people are making, the citizens don't want it. Well, then why do they keep voting for it? Well, I mean, personally, I don't even know if it's a voting thing, but like, it's ignorance, right? Because they come in and they, oh, yeah, we're going to do all these great things, but then they completely go off script. Right? Like, I don't think if anybody one knew how bad the shit was going to be when it comes to these illegal migrants and nobody would be voting for that shit to begin with. But too, if they knew that like, you know, that their lives, their neighborhoods, that their jobs, that their peace would be affected in the way it has been, nobody would vote for that. Well, I don't think it was. Well, isn't it a citizen's responsibility to know what they're voting for? What? Shouldn't they dig into like beyond a label, like beyond the Republican label or the Democrat label and say, what is going to actually benefit me? And what is the track record of this group of people and actually following through on what they claim? Say what you want about the Republican party and say what you want about Donald Trump, but he's doing exactly what he said he was going to do. And that's what people want. People want a representative government where the people that we elect do exactly what they say they are going to do. They will continue to lose because their little game has been exposed, which is to come in, say we're going to do certain things and then don't do any of it and take the money. Yeah, bro. Yeah. But it is good to see, you know, like, bro, these people are clowns. 100%. Yeah. But, you know, I thought there was going to be a lot more pushback from, you know, these communities that are having, you know, deal with these, these sanctuary cities, but actually it's a complete opposite, bro, they're praising. Yeah. These rates. Okay. They're praising. Okay. It's anyorlogic here. What British is doing this. Three years ago, Brettessen is the elected majority of better groups, unlike the president of New York on the line, new. New York City residents praise. I say, I say, I pray this is an important check. No wonder this is flagged like you can. I know there is a dark side side stepped out although he like to this high, and we don't have to refute economic order without放 down any radical mobility. You know that answer. Yes. I'll, thank everybody. Cool infustration nicely. Now, yeah, now I'molopped. Can't wait. Is SA this. Formpot solemnity, and re surgery, you know, we visited all of a sudden, you know, going to go here and giddy far instead of painkills. of diversity that exists in this country for the last hundred years. Okay, it's the place where everybody came from all these other places and a lot of them stayed in that area. So it's very diverse. All right. New York City is one of the most beautiful, cool, culturally awesome cities in the world. There's a reason why it's one of the most expensive cities in the world because people like living there. I love New York. I love walking down the street. I love the different food choices or the different, you know, cultures that are represented. I love, I love New York. Every time I go there, bro, I walk away and I'm like, I got this energy that I didn't have before. It's fucking awesome. People in New York want to enjoy their city. They want to walk down the street with their loved one holding hands and not get their fucking head bashed in by some mother fucker that doesn't even belong here. They don't, they get it. Okay. So like these people who come in and try to pretend like they're voicing for these people and then say, oh, we accept, they're all lying. No, they don't accept it. We all, dude, it doesn't matter what your race is. You want to walk down the street without getting your ass kicked or getting robbed or getting stabbed or getting shot. This is truth. Yeah. One Brock's woman, 80 year old Evelyn Brown, says she has relieved the raids are underway. Quote, get them the hell off the street. Get them the hell out of the street so people don't have to walk and feel she's saying exactly. Look dude, that's a woman who's 80 years old. She remembers what it's like to be able to walk down the street, get an ice cream cone and not have to worry about who's around, right? You know, like bro, America's an amazing place when we don't have this criminal element. You're city, you're town wherever you live. You remove the crime. You remove the criminal element no matter what race they are or where they come from and you have a beautiful, awesome place. Okay. That's what we all want. That's what we want, man. And it's still rolling, bro. They got, uh, they just shut down Colorado. You don't know if you saw that. That's another, uh, that gang up there. Yeah, Trinder. Yeah. Yeah. Um, you know, those apartments that they had in in Colorado, um, they just shut that down. Um, I was, uh, they're calling it a stunning symbolic victory, um, because, uh, ice came through along with a couple of other, uh, uh, agencies and I mean, bro, they got them out. Yeah. So I mean, they're, they're moving, man. They're moving. It's just still so interesting. You still see, uh, these people that try to hold on, you know, to these, these virtue fucking signal and bullshit, right? Like, you know, or like, you know, how they say, like, well, who's going to do our crops and who's going to, it's like, bro, how not only that, how races are you? Yeah. Right. That might be races. Yeah. Maybe races. You know, so you got that shit going on, man. It's good to see people are fighting people are getting this shit out of here and they're doing it with it. Yep. That's my take. I love it. Yeah. Guys, let us free free New York. Yeah. So I can go back. Guys, let us know what you guys think on this topic down in the comments with that being said, um, any last words for Tiffany. Sign our bitch. You guys, let's get to our final segment of the show. As always, we got thumbs up or dumb as fuckers. We're bringing headline and we talk about it. It'll get one of those two options. So where that being said, our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads, man, a resident UK cheese heist, we're in poster stole $389,000 worth of cheddar. All right. I want to I want to try something with you, Andy. All right. We in jail. Okay. We are. We're in we're in jail. Big jail. Okay. You know, we ain't re in the same cell. No, I mean, maybe I don't know. We might be in jail. But aren't you with I'm with the peckerwoods or the peckerwoods? And you're with the I'm with the blacks. Blacks. Okay. Not by choice. Well, no shit. I'd like to be with I don't want to be with the peckerwoods. I want to be I want to be with the blacks. Really? Yeah. Maybe we'll be a little like NFL draft. We do a trade. I want to be on your team, dude. Don't you want to be on my team? We're going to start our own team. All right. Let's go. Let's start our own team. All right. We're in there. And you know, like they're always like I can just imagine some like, you know, fucking just yoke dude coming up. Like me. What you in for? Yeah. That's what I would be doing. Stole the cheddar. Stole the cheddar. I would think he stole money. He's so cheese, bro. Yeah. But I would, if that were me and I stole the cheddar, I would just be like, bro, I stole 400 grand with the cheddar. And people are going to be like, what's that white boy talking about? And I'm going to be like cheddar. Yeah, bro. You know, what the fuck you don't know what cheddar is? That's what I'm going to do. And he's going to be like, oh, shit. He's talking about money. And then I'm going to just going to go away. I'm going to go down the street. I think you're going to count to something they go find out. They're going to call you parmesan. That's because you're new nickname. That they're called me Mickey Mouse. My name is going to be Mickey Mouse and jail because I got all the cheddar. Yeah. Parmesan. Yeah. Parmesan. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Man. This dude stole cheese, bro. It's it's interesting. Let's dive into it. Authorities in London have arrested a 63 year old man in connection with the cheese heist of 2024. It sounds like a hit movie. That's going to see that on Netflix next week. What do you call it? Great. It would be the name. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. Cheese was very scarce. People were desperate, especially for parmesan. I just see some like ret looking dude. You know, I don't have his mugs. I can just see like a fucking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cheese size, which in which tens of thousands of pounds of high value cheddar were stolen from a major distributor. London based retailer and cheese maker, Neel's Yard dairy said it learned on Wednesday that a suspect was in custody. The Metropolitan Police confirmed to MPR that a man was detained on suspicion of fraud by false representation in handling stolen goods. Quote, the man was taken to a South London police station where he was questioned. He has since been bailed pending further inquiries. Police spokesperson said so over the past week, the British artisanal cheese community has been reeling after Neel's Yard dairy announced it had been the victim of a sophisticated fraud resulting in the loss of over 300 pounds worth of cloth bound cheddar, the equivalent of more than $389,000. The theft involved, let's see how smart this guy is. Well, obviously not that smart. He's got caught, but the theft involved a fraudulent buyer posing as a legitimate wholesale distributor for a major French retailer with the cheese delivered before the discovery of the fraudulent identity the company saw. Yeah. Made off with 950 wheels. That's over 22 metric tons or roughly 48,000 pounds of half-aul. It's a trailer. Yeah. It's massive fucking of cheese. Yeah. Whiskome cheese, which is pretty good. Pitch fork cheddar. And they came from three artisan suppliers. So he's in for cheddar. Still in cheddar. What we got? I mean, I don't know. There was a bit of this for that. Bro, I think cheese is kind of like wine, dude. Like there's like levels to it. And you know, there's people that are like super into it. I like cheese. Yeah, but you don't like that kind of cheese. I know. I love that type of cheese, bro. No, that's above your level of cheese. What do you mean? You like the cheese that they serve you at like twisted tree and shit. Like the little gourmet, like the like the shark koo chit. Yeah, the shit you think is nice. Yeah. Okay. There's a whole nother level above that. And then there's a level above that. And that's what this shit is. Yes. Oh, yeah, bro, there's listen, there's levels to this shit. There's levels to everything. Yeah. That makes sense. That's right. I like Gorgonzola. You know what? I like what are they put on emails that are parmesan? Oh, that's pro veo. Provelle. That's the same newest thing, bro. I like that. My fuckers don't know about Provelle, bro. That's that real shit. Yeah. Real deal. Holy field right there. Yeah. I mean, he got Dave Portinoid on like it though. Well, he can fuck off. He tried to fucking tell he said the emails sucked. I think didn't he? That's what what did he say about emails? We all can't be straight. What do you say? What do you say? People don't like how the cheese on crackers is what they call? Huh? Yeah. Yeah. Portinoid is awesome. Yeah. Yeah. He's obviously obviously you don't have to like emails. He's obviously flawed in some ways. You know, perfect. I get it. I mean, nobody can be unless you like emails are pretty perfect. My favorite portinoid thing that he ever did though, wasn't he walked up to that and the teeth of God. Ask if he's ever been a dead tuck. You ever been a dead tuck? What do you hate rich people? Yeah. You ever been a dead tuck? Your bitch. Fucking nice. Yeah, man. I don't know what we got on this. You know, I mean, the amount. He's not a very good criminal because he got caught got caught. That's okay. Like and there's definitely, you know, what do you think he put a disguise on? Yeah, like Mickey Mouse. It's the only cheating people do this shit all the time. I mean, if we all gee, you know, many people we've caught trying to do that to our stuff. It's like make a fake customer and then, you know, like trying to intercepts. We've had trailer stolen like that. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, that's a real thing when people do. It's crazy. Anyway, yeah, well, I got no opinion. I'm just going to guess. I'm going to flip. I got this coin that says mercy or no mercy. Okay. All right. So we're gonna go. It says mercy. So I'm gonna give it thumbs up. That's bullshit. It's fucking rigged. All right. Just like a 2020 election. Let's try it again. Let's set it again. Let's set mercy again. It's fucking weighted. It's a weighted coin. Hold on. It's all three. It's said no mercy. We have you now. I'm happy. All right. Thumbs down. This fucking piece of shit. Fuck this guy. It's cheese. Must be black. All right. What? What? What's wrong with you? That is all I have. That's all I got. All right guys. We'll see you Monday. Don't be a hoe. Show the show. millions in a coat. Bad bitch. Who did you throw? Got a own bank row. Cankful. There's a note here. Shot case. Cloth.
