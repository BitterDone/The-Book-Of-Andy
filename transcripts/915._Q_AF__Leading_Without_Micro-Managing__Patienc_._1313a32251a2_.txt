Share the show. All right, don't be a hoe, don't be a hoe, baby. What's going on? Nothing. Same, same. Oh, look at that. You've done it a big word. Where'd you get that? You got it on my secret stash? No, I stole it from Chris. No, that's my stash. Oh, what? Yeah, mine came. See, I steal for Chris too. Well, mine came halfway drunk, so it did. I saw you up there earlier, I wonder what you're doing. Dude, those are my power outstations with Chris, bro. Dude, it's a smart dude, man. I know, bro. He's fucking smart, and so I always try to give him at least like an hour of his, like, or I've got to do his smartness on me. That's it, man. Yeah, we talk about a plethora of things and how to power your house with solar. You're just a purifier water. That's right, that's right. But you know, I leave a better man every time. That's right. It's good. It's good. Yeah. But yeah, I stole this from him, so that's great. But yeah, man, what's going on with you? Nothing, dude. Ready to kick ass. Yeah, it's a nice Monday. Yep, it sure is. It's not Monday. I gotta stop doing that to myself. But we can pretend. Yeah. It was weird, because I think today, or yesterday technically was like the first day that it wasn't the devil's armpit. Bro. Fuck. Word. But they're saying like, we can't breathe out there, you know? Now? Yeah, like air quality index alert or some shit. It's better than it was two days ago. It's true. It's just true. Yeah. Did you want to tell people what happened to me yesterday? Oh, the Deerbra. Yeah. Where I had to pull my Steve Irwin. Yeah, you turned into PETA. Yeah, I turned into PETA. Steve Irwin all come on. Bro, Deerra, cool though, man. You said it was a... Bro, I had to rescue a deer yesterday. A fucking, not a baby deer, but like a middle sized deer. Like a toddler deer. Yeah, like a preteen. Yeah, that was right. You know what I'm saying? And it was like stuck between this guard... So where I do the cardio, there's a guard rail, like a car guard rail and then a fence. And it was stuck between the guard rail and the fence. And so I'm walking, doing my 75-hart outdoor cardio and I'm walking by and fucking, bro, there's a big bush, like half the size of this room and it starts going... And I'm like, holy fuck dude, like... And I take off running, bro. You want to give me... Bro, I thought it was like big foot, man. I'm like, what the fuck is going on? So I start running down the path. I like run away and I see the thing still shaking and then I hear this... And I was like, what is going on? And I was actually on the phone with one of my buddies. I'm like, dude, I gotta call you back. So I went over there and there's this deer that's like... You know, I don't know, maybe 50 pounds, you know, 60 pounds. And it's jumping and it just keeps jumping straight up in the air. Like it couldn't get over the guard rail and the fence is like eight feet tall. So it's just... And then it's like freaking out. And I'm like, dude, this thing's going to stick its foot in like one of those holes and the fence will break its fucking leg. Or it's going to starve. I don't know what's going on. So dude, I walk over there and it's... And as I get closer, man, this thing's getting like very upset. Bap, bap, bap. You know, like, wow. Dude, do sound weird. Yeah, it's weird sound, bro. And so I fucking grabbed it. And like, bro, I never grabbed a deer before. Like, I don't know, like... I didn't know like how strong they are or anything. I figured it was like a dog. So I grabbed it, dude. I'm going to tell you right now, the motherfucker's got a lot of muscle on it, bro. Yeah, dude. So it jumps as I grab it and go, man, and it's... Dude, it's head smashes my face. And like, I was like stunned. You know how like you wrestle with your dog and they hit in the face? It was like that. So then I took a couple steps back and I looked at it and I'm like, all right, I got to like get this thing. So I like went over there, dude. And I fucking grabbed it. And like this, like hard. And it's going, bro. Like, I probably thought I was going to eat it. For sure. Yeah. And then, you know, I put it on the ground and it ran off. I would have... Think smack me right in the face, dude. You head by me, you know what? Fuck you, dude. That's what I thought for a minute. I was kind of pissed for a minute. I was like, I'm like, you know what? It is what it is. But then I thought about it. I'm like, bro, I'm going to go home. And I'm going to wonder if that thing's like stuck there. Yep. Or if it broke its leg. But yeah, that was my good deed for the day yesterday. I mean, that's pretty good deed. Yeah, that's pretty good deed. I mean, there's not so many people can say they handled a deer. Yeah. I mean, dude, he was, you know, he was a formidable opponent. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, he came back and fucking face was all that. Yeah, dude. I'm like, I came back, DJ's like, what happened? You could punch the face. No, fuck. I mean, a deer got me. Yeah, fuck. Deer got you. Yeah, we got, you know, it's funny. I feel like you get fucked up in the weirdest ways. We got to have better stories, bro. Bro, you know what? Yeah, no kid. I puncture my hand on a toilet paper holder. Yeah, it's like fucking, we got to come up so better. Yeah. No, it's anyway, that's my deer story. Yeah, it's nice. Yeah. I did feel like I did something worthy. I don't know if you know that's good. You know, I'm with Z-Shambro. If you're good, kind of animals, good things happen to you, bro. Yeah, I believe it's true. That's it. I couldn't walk past it, man. It's not in me. I just couldn't believe how strong they were. Bro, you ever, like, you probably never have. But like, have you ever felt like a, like a pretty big fish, like a, like a, like a sailfish or like a, like a baby shark or something? No, bro. It's like handling a fucking tornado. Like, they're so strong. And it's like, yeah, that's what the deer was like, bro. It was like strong. I was surprised. I think I've never had like a wild animal like that. I mean, snakes. I've handled some pretty big, Goddamit. Yes, some big white snakes. I heard you like you're right on them too. I've handled a few large reptiles in my life. I've handled some pretty big snakes. Yeah, fuck, man. I can't win for your hangout with a mirror all weekend, huh? Yeah, that's what it is. Seven of them get you long. That's what it is. That's a, all right, let's get to it. Let's do it, man. For you, like, totally out yourself. You do like some nice music. You know the worst when you have to like, I swear I'm not gay. That makes it 10 times worse. How do I roll with it, bro? No, it's not the wrong one. I'm just not. Yeah. Okay. Well, what do we got today? We got some callers. We got some really good questions. We got Q and A of, again, starting the Monday off great for you guys. We got three good ones lined up. Let's give it the first one to call show. Yeah, let's get a Lissa on the line. Hello, Lissa speaking. Hey, Lissa, this is DJ. What's going on? What's up, DJ? How are you? Oh, you know, can't complain. Just, you know, another day and just out here living life. Living your best life. Living my best. That's right. Yolo. Yeah, he sure is. Lissa, what's up? It's Andy. What's up, Andy? How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing well. Doing well. So where are other days? I'm doing well. So where are other days in Pensacola? Oh, OK, Pensacola. Man, Pensacola is beautiful place. It's nice. Yeah. Bro, this is the. It's hot and shit right now, though. Yeah. I will say that. But you guys got the, they got beautiful beaches down there, man. It's, it's good, like old Florida vibes right in that area. I don't know. Not, not, not like, you know, not like before the Civil War. Right. I'm saying. OK. I'm going to say that's a time. It's a war. Yeah. Oh, that's sick. It's absolutely a lot like the Midwest, believe it or not. It is. Is it really? Yeah. It's a good as it gets. Like Midwest close to beat. Love it. So what can we help you with? Let me see what my question was because I don't even remember whatever you just wanted to call that. Yeah. I, uh, quit my career as a legal nurse consultant last year and bought our gym, our gym owner decided to go to med school. So I was like, all right. Well, I'm not going to let this place shut down. And over the past year, we've, uh, basically hired in a whole staff and we've launched a new nutrition shop and, um, I guess my question really is like in my past career, I was so detailed oriented because if I wasn't, it could possibly cost their firm like millions of dollars or a client anyway. And now the, I'm kind of the new to leadership, right? And I know that the last thing you need to do as a leader is just tell somebody what to do. And my coaches have been awesome and they're all part time. And they all have other jobs and there's just like this fine line of like, how in the weeds do I get with the details? Because essentially like, or crossfit with the crossfit gym, like coaching is the product, right? So I now want it to be awesome. But at what point do you kind of set back and be like, all right, you're being a little too, too overbearing and into the details and just be like, all right, this is good enough because you've got eight thousand other fires to put out. Well let me ask you this is did something happen to where you feel like you crossed over into being too detailed oriented or are you concerned that you aren't being enough or, like, was there an event that happened that caused this question to come about? There really wasn't, there's not been an event. Okay. Though I feel like, I feel like that I'm a little bit too detailed oriented when it comes to like, you know, your coach in a class and like, this is the standardized way of doing the whiteboard and things like that. So I always preface it like, it's like a Peloton class. You bring your personality, bring your music, bring your own flair, but at the end of the day, like, this is the standard. Okay. I got it. So basically you're just trying to audit yourself as a leader. Right. Okay. Depending on what your goal is with, with this gym, it really depends on how standardized you need to make the systems inside the gym. All right. So if you, if you're goal, and I don't know what it is, but I'm going to run through all the options, if your goal is to just operate the gym and your local community and have a nice business and enjoy it, then the level of detail in your systems can be a little more relaxed. You can let people kind of come in, be the personality, you know, do what they're going to do. The downside of that is that there will be coaches that are more popular and there will be coaches that are less popular and the coaches that are more popular are probably more popular because people like their methods better. If you don't have minimal systems inside of your gym to standardize everything, you run the risk of losing clients if that coach were to leave. All right. So, so that's basically, I'm going to keep it small. I don't have to have a whole lot of systems. What's the upside to upside is it's, you know, somewhat easy to manage. The downside is you're vulnerable to people taking your business elsewhere and that's kind of the game. The next step forward would say, okay, I want to open multiple gyms. If you want to, and by the way, I would recommend what I'm about to tell you, even if you're not going to run multiple gyms, you need to have a minimum standardize operating system inside of your gym so that there is similarities that are branded between all the coaches, meaning there is a way of doing things for your gym that is done consistently throughout the different coaching classes and, you know, group activities that you guys do. That could be simple rules. That could be simple structure that you set up and then they agree to abide by. And if you pull all your coaches in, you say, hey, this is what I think will be good for all of us to do. These are the systems. This is the flow. This is how we should do things. They're probably all going to agree that it's a great way to standardize everything anyway, because at the end of the day, that way you have people who are coming in maybe for one class and then they don't get stuck with the actual coach. They might come in for the morning class or the night class or the midday class and feel like they're getting the class from your gym, not just from that coach. So that makes your customers a little bit more yours as opposed to your coaches, which creates more security for yourself and your brand and your gym. And quite honestly, a better experience for the users because they can recognize that there is a certain way that you do things, meaning the brand, the gym does things. And then if you wanted to expand across the country or across the world, that would be very standardized programming so that people are getting very similar things everywhere they go. Think like orange theory or something like that, right? Right. Where you go in there, you go to any orange theory and you kind of know what you're going to get. So those are the kind of like the top, you know, I guess one, two, three, five minute, you know, description of how you should look at this. But as far as being detail oriented, I have never found there to be a problem with being two detail oriented because remember, your level of detail is going to be run at 80% 70% of what you set out. So if you're running, let's say at 100% high detail, your team's going to naturally have some some bleed off and they're probably going to keep 70 to 80% of that detail. And then if there's another layer below that, they're going to keep 70 80% of that leader's detail. So I actually think it's very, very, very important for the leader of a business to be extremely diligent on their details so that the flow downward doesn't get so watered down that by the time the customer sees it, it's just, you know, a bunch of, it's a bunch of shit everywhere. Right. Yeah. So, but dude, you know, ultimately, you know, being a leader and developing and building a new business and all of these things, you know, you're always going to have that question of, man, am I doing this right? Or should I be more, should I be less? That is, that is a very strong quality that that self auditing that you're doing. That's a strong quality of a great leader, great leaders audit themselves all the time. They're always asking was I too much, was I too soft, was I too hard, was I too detail, was I too lacks. Did I go, you know, did I say this the wrong way? Or should I have done it this way? These are, these are the questions that naturally form us into a great leader over the course of time. And the fact that you're even asking that without an issue coming about to force you to ask that tells me that you're going to eventually be a really fucking strong leader if you're not already. So, so yeah, I mean, what are your thoughts on all of that? I completely agree with you. And yeah, there's one thing that I've taken away from listening to you guys over the years. It's just like, you know, you talk about back in the day where you used to completely lose your shit. Oh, yeah. You just accept it because it was kind of hard growing, right? So I do constantly ask myself these questions and try to audit myself, but you know, there are some days where I'm a toe of bitch. Yeah. Well, welcome to entrepreneurship. I have meltdowns about once a month. Like dude, this is like you say back in the day. That's like, that was like Tuesday this week, you know what I'm saying? Like, and I'm not lying. Like it was legitimately. But like dude, this is, this is what happens, dude. When you're carrying, you know, all of this uncertainty, all of this doubt, all of this pressure, sometimes the pressure has to get released. And you know what? Sometimes when you're not disciplined or you're new or you're not really sure what you're doing because you're emotionally wound up, that pressure can be released in the wrong areas. And then that's a simple, that's a simple, you know, again, you're going to audit yourself and you're going to say, fuck, I shouldn't have done that. Sometimes you're going to release the pressure on people and you're like, you know what? They needed that. And you're going to learn that over the course of time. So I'll give you this. All these things that you're thinking about, I still think about every single day. I mean, every single day. I think the best leaders literally audit every handling of every problem and every conversation they have with their team over the course of their career. I don't think they ever get to a point, at least I've never met someone who gets to a point where they stop doing that and that I would consider great. So don't worry about being too, just stop getting better, you know. Exactly. Yeah. And the minute you stop, you get worse and that's the way the game goes. So yeah, man, I would develop some basic systems, some basic frameworks around how you want things to run and then obviously give the coaches the freedom to, you know, be them. You know, that is what Pelotimes about. That's why people like Pelotime because they can go to Steve or Amy or, you know, Brian or whoever the fuck they got this week and they like those people and you want that same thing in your gym, but you also want to know that, you know, when I sign up, when I sign in for my morning class, it's going to be similar to the evening class. It's not going to be some completely different thing, you know, right? Yeah. So what's the name of your gym? We got it. We got Alfa Omega performance. There you go. Alfa Omega. I like it. If you walk in the Alfa nutrition shop, we have all of the first form. That's what's up. That's what's up. Energy drinks. There we go. The world's greatest energy. Everybody loves a meat stick. They do. Especially DJ. DJ is a big fan of meat sticks. Hey, what, uh, what's your favorite meat stick? My favorite meat stick. Oh, I don't, I don't really give them the meat sticks. Oh, DJ. I'm more of a chocolate pretzel DJ. And I do like the chocolate pretzel protein bars. Have you had the whole food bars yet? The power pros? I have. They're really good. Dude, I can't, I can't stop eating them, man. Candy bars. Anyway, they don't fit into my macros. We need to cut that shit in half. I do. It's like, it's like eating fucking cookie dough, man. Yeah. All right. Well, anything else could help you with? No, I think we're good. Thank you so much for taking my call. And I've had a great day. Awesome day. Well, thank you so much for all the support for the show. And then obviously for first form. And who knows do you for, you know, taking care of the people in your community with this amazing gym and nutrition that you're doing? I think that's amazing. And you know, if there's anything else you can help with, you know, where you can find us. Yes. All right. Thanks so much. Appreciate you. All right. Have a good one. You too. Bye. Did I love the conversation just on leadership? Because I feel like there's so much involved in it, right? And one of the things that I've always been perplexed by, if you will, is like the idea of micromanaging as a leader. Like, and it's like hearing that like, like, and it's, because I think that was the first time I've heard it explained like that, like as far as what you give out at 100% gets diluted. Yeah, it gets diluted. It gets diluted. Yeah, for sure. It made me rethink on the micromanaging because like, for me, my standpoint, I'm like, I don't want to be a micromanaging, right? But in that line, it's like, well, shit, like if I know that only it's not so much micromanaging, it's just holding the standard, bro. And one of the things she said that I forgot to address was at the beginning of the call, she said, you know, I know as a leader, one of the worst things to do is to tell people what to do. Actually, sometimes that's exactly what's needed. And we live in this society now where we have a lot of people giving advice that don't lead anybody, right? How many of these people on the internet give an advice about leadership, have an actual team that they lead? I don't know that many. I see a lot of people regurgitating things and saying things like, oh, well, the best leaderships let people do what they want. That is not leadership. Leadership by definition is you do, then they do. You do, then they do. Okay. That is what the fuck leadership is about. And then occasionally, especially when you're in the beginning part of business, you do have to turn around and be like, hey, not like that, like this, not like that, like this. Like you have to think of it. Like I like to talk about how Nick Saban coaches, right? Nick Saban, his whole thing is we don't practice till we get it right. We practice till we can't get it wrong. And he doesn't sit there and not tell people what to do because he wants his players to be comfortable. That's not what wins fucking national titles, bro. And it's also not what wins in business. What wins in business is telling your people exactly what to do until they know it's so well that you don't have to tell him anymore. So there's phases to when you have to assert your dominance in terms of, like, this is what the fuck we're doing. And then when they start to get it, you back off and everybody's happier because now you don't have to do that. And they don't have to have you up their ass. Because they don't like that either. So like once the standard is set, you know, yes, there's some leeway and you can allow for some, I guess, flavor from the leadership, right? Everybody wants to say, oh, there's my leadership style. Listen, there's only one leadership style that fucking matters. And guess which one it is. It's the one that wins. That's it. Okay. So you can talk about your leadership style. But if you're not winning, it sucks. All right. So we got to realize what leadership really is. Leadership is gathering a whole bunch of people, getting them focused on a single goal and then winning at that goal. And if they're not winning at that goal, you have to understand that your leadership style is ineffective. And a great leadership style that works every single time is you hold the standard, you do what you want them to do at the level or exceeding the level that you want them to do it. And then when they don't hold it, you got to tell them to fucking do it. And if you do that long enough, people either catch on or they wash out and either way, you win. Love it. I love it. Absolutely. Love it. Guys, let's go down to comments. What you guys thought about that question and answer. We got to write it. Okay. Let's do it right in. Good morning, guys. Yes. Salutations. Just wanted to ask, how do you deal with having to wait on things? Recently, I feel like I've hit a point where I am doing everything that I can do in my business that is small but growing and currently hardly making money. I have a few pending groundbreaking projects that I am waiting on that fund these projects to really put big things in motion set back after set back. I am filling my hands tied and out of control on all these pending things. I hate sitting around and doing small pointless projects for little to no reason. Now, to keep my mind occupied from feeling like I'm not doing enough. I don't know if I'm just impatient or lazy, but whatever it is is driving me crazy and up the wall, ultimately frustrating. I feel like I can't sit around and wait for things to happen. Thanks for what you guys are doing. God bless. How do you go? How how is that lazy? What do you mean by that? Yeah. Or I guess just feeling lazy because you're just waiting for someone. Oh, I got it. Yeah. Look, here's the deal, dude. You have to, everybody has to understand this. Whenever it is you're trying to build, whatever it is you're trying to create or become for yourself, there is an element that is out of your control. It is called time. Okay. And there's not been a person in the history of earth that has been able to exclude the ingredient of time to the recipe of success. It's never, ever happened. It may appear to you that it's happened because you don't see the five, 10, 15 years of work before someone just comes out of nowhere and is successful overnight. All right. You have to understand nobody has built a business and two weeks. Nobody has gone from fat to fit in two weeks. Nobody has solved all of their life problems in two weeks. And here's the thing. It would be great if we could handle everything ourselves and do everything ourselves and get everything done at our pace. But the reality is part of being successful. Anything in life is that it usually requires the help of other people. Now if you know, we're talking about technology and the advancement, yes, we can get a little, we can get more done with less people now than we ever have been able to that does not exclude the element of time from the success equation. All right. You have to understand you are not going to ever be the first person that gets to where they want to go with time not being an aspect. Time means something for a lot of different reasons and business and selling a product. It could mean the time it takes to develop a product. It could be in marketing the amount of times a customer has to see your product before they feel comfortable to sell. It could be in your brand, the amount of, you know, time that you take to build a brand and actually be received authentically by the customer base to be accepted as your brand. These things take time losing weight takes time, getting a shape takes time, making money takes time. There's no way around it. But here's the good news. The fact that you are impatient about it means that you are probably relentless on all the things that you need to do to get there, which is great because how you build something amazing requires a skill set and a concept that I have talked about for a decade. It is called aggressive patience. Okay. And what that means is that you have to understand that not only isn't going to take time. So you have to be patient, but also during the time that you are waiting, you have to be executing day after day after day after day, as if you can will and force this goal into reality. Okay. Because when people hear be patient, you know what they hear? Sitting your chair, kick your feet up on the desk and it'll just happen. That is not how it works. Okay. You have to come in. You have to dedicate yourself. You have to execute day after day after day after day at the highest level that you possibly can for as long as you can and still it's going to take time. All right. You can't outwork the time. But when you come in and you push and you push and you push and you push, you can collapse that time down to the minimum amount that will be required to produce what you're trying to produce. Okay. And a lot of people think they can change this. And dude, I have an analogy that I use all the time. And if you've listened to me, you know it. Okay. You go and you say, I want to make the best cake ever. I want to cook the best cake in the history of cakes. So you go find the best award-winning cake recipe that's won all the awards and all the Michelin restaurants. Everybody swears it's the greatest cake in the world and you get the recipe. All right. And then you start mixing in the recipe and you're doing it exactly what they say. A quarter cup of this, two cups of that, one stick of this and you're mixing in the bowl. You do everything perfect. There's no way to fuck this up. And then you say, you know what? I bet if I turn the temperature up on this cake to 800 degrees, I can get it to come out and half the time. And so the recipe calls for 400 degrees and 45 minutes and you say, I want it in 20. So you turn the temperature up and you put it in there for 20 minutes and you pull it out and guess what? The cake's burnt. It's gross. Nobody wants to eat it. Okay. And that's because you didn't give enough time for the cake to bake. All right. And you have to understand you could be making other things during that time. You could be making the icing. You could be making the ice cream. You could be doing this and this and this, all these ancillary things that go with the big goals. And this is very representative of what aggressive patience looks like in a very simple example. Okay. You have a goal. You're trying to build it. You're doing all the things right day by day by day. It's still going to take time, bro. So you have to show up and you have to understand that I have to go as hard as I can every single day. And then it's still going to take time. Period. And you're not going to be the first person to change that. That's the way it works. So the fact that you are impatient tells me that you're wired. You even said it yourself. I don't like being bored or I feel lazy when I'm waiting. That's because you don't understand that you can't afford to do nothing. You still have to do everything you can during that time to force the result. So it also made me think too. It's like, you know, I was I was getting this image of like a farmer. You know, I'm saying planting a crop. Yeah. So it's the same thing. Bro, if you go out and fucking field, you know, and, and that's another analogy. I've used often like if you if you want to plant corn. All right. Let's take this attitude and polite to farming. Yeah. Real simple. If you want to go to the fuck if every farmer went out in the fucking field and put the seeds of corn into the field and came back the next day and looked at it and said, all right. Now this happened yet. Maybe I'll come back tomorrow. So they go back tomorrow on the second day. Look at the ground. Nothing's happened yet. Third day, fourth day, fifth day. Nothing's happened yet. And they said, fuck, I've been doing this for five fucking days. Nothing's happening. And they walked away and they said, fuck, it doesn't work. What would happen to the whole world? We'd all starve. Okay. We have to understand things take time. Okay. That farmer any farmer, they don't go to the field every day to check their shit. Do they? No. They are doing other things because they know that corn is going to take time. And while the corn takes time, I can do all the other things that are required to bring that product to market, get it where it needs to go and run the business. And I can do other things like the point is is that you have it's, it's no different. You have to understand that time is a part of it. And being patient doesn't mean sitting around under the shade tree, waiting for shit to happen. It means I'm accepting that it's going to take a long time. But I'm also going to do everything I can every single day until that comes to fruition. I want to hit on this too. I think this is important to you, man. And I correct me if I'm wrong, man. But it's like, okay. So you planted the corn and I'm not no farmer. I don't, let's say it takes six months before you get that fucking harvest. Well, soybean, I mean, what? So if you just planted a couple of seeds, you got three stocks coming in six months, right? Cool. But like soybeans, they, they, they, they, they fucking fruit in three months. Could you go plant some soybeans? You know, I mean, dude, that's, that's your weight for that corn and harvest before you plant the next one. No, dude, it's, it, listen, it's, it's very simple. You run the play of the power, if you don't have a power list, okay? Go fucking listen to episode 16 on real AF, understand the power list system. All right. Use the power list every day. It is automatically built to maintain aggressive patience. Like you don't have to fucking, it's, that is the system for aggressive patience. Yeah. So, uh, yeah, man. I mean, look, everybody gets frustrated. Everybody wishes they could have it tomorrow. Everybody wishes that they could, you know, be everything they want to be in a week. But here's the truth. Success is boring and it's mundane and it takes time. And the reason that most people fail isn't necessarily because of how hard it is. It's because of how boring it is and how repetitive it is and how hard it is to, to do boring, repetitive things when you don't have any sign of the result actually showing up. And that's why people can't succeed. So, you can be more alive in a bit. Huh? Yeah. It'll be the moral. Yes. 100% dude. But most people don't have a concept of what it actually takes. You know, we live in an instant gratification world. We can order our food immediately. It could be here in 30 minutes. We got a microwave. We can make food in two minutes. We can call every single person that we've ever known since we were born and go on the internet and talk to them instantly. We live in a society where our day to day operations are not aligned with the processes of what it takes to build real results. And that's a very difficult thing for people to understand because if most of life is easy, convenient and fast, then it would make sense that building something that's really good. We'll also be easy and fast. And you know, this is why we get things like luck and, you know, that dude got lucky and this and that. You didn't see the 10 years before that, bro. You know what I mean? So we have to understand. You know, just because everything in our life is pretty, pretty comfortable, doesn't change the recipe for how long it takes to actually build something. But here's the good news. You know, with the amount of technology that we have now, you could cut down, you know, what took me 10 years, you can cut that down to, you know, three or four years. You know what I mean? So we are in a massive advantage to where things can go quicker, but that doesn't change the fact that they still take time. And the reason that business usually still takes time is because one, you lack the skills. You don't know how to lead. You don't know how to sell. You don't know how to do shit. It takes time to learn that. Number two, you're going to make mistakes that are going to hold you up. That's reality. That happens all the time as long as you're smart enough to learn from them. That's a good thing. Number three, you know, when we think about like the adoption of a new business or a new product, there is an element to time in the consumer's mind before they choose to buy. They have to see it an average of nine times before they even consider buying it. All right. So that takes time. There's just all kinds of elements that take time. And yeah, I wish we could snap a finger and I wish it was as true as a lot of the Instagram ads that we see where it's like, oh, this AI fucking app will just build your business in one day. Okay. Cool. It's still going to take a year for customers to truly fucking trust that you're actually delivering what it is that you say you're going to deliver. We live in a time of the highest skepticism, which means we have to be more frequently in their face to get the same response that we got 15 years ago. You see what I'm saying? So when nine times might have been 10 years ago, today it could be 20 times. You know what I mean? So there's all kinds of elements, dude, that create the gap of time that we can definitely shrink and cut down and and compress. But you can only do that if you show up every day and give it everything you fucking got. You know, and if you're waiting around like, you know, for other people to do things and this and that and the other dude, it won't get done. Like the truth of the matter is, and this is just my, my, this is my 26 and a half years of business experience. Speaking and highly successful business experience. Other people don't run as hard as I run. They just don't. And when I, when I want things done from a vendor, I have to be all the way up their mother fucking ass to work on my timeline. And eventually, just like we spoke with with Alyssa, once the standard is set that they know that Andy works on this timeline. And I've worked with Andy a number of years and this is how he works. Now all of a sudden, they know my sense of urgency. They know where I'm trying to get to. They know that when I call them, I'm talking about fucking tomorrow, not next year. You know what I mean? And while I understand that they're not going to get it to me tomorrow, they understand that that's what I expect, which collapses the time. So having urgency, consistently and being aggressively patient are fucking requirements of building anything great. And the fact that you're impatient, I think is a great thing. I think I think it is great to be impatient in business, even though it's required for success. And I know it's agonizing, but here's the opposite. The opposite is it'll happen when it happens. And guess what happens for those people? Never. I love it, man. Yeah, jump down the comments. Let's know what you guys think. We got one final question here. Let's get another calling and going. We got Jeremy. Jeremy, Jeremy, let's get Jeremy on the call. Hello. There we go. What's up, Jeremy? How you doing, brother? All right. How's it going, DJ? Yeah, not too bad, man. Thanks for asking how you doing. Oh, you're enjoying this nice weather we got. So where are you at? So I'm in Southeast Indiana. All right. It is nice here in the Midwest, isn't it? This is Midwest call day, baby. Jeremy, what's happening, man? Oh, you know, just enjoying the weather and working outside. Why it's nice. So what are you working on? So I'm in the construction business. So I actually just wrapped up putting some signing on a house and just got home. So cool. That's too bad. What can we help you with, brother? So I've been dealing with this for a little while. But my question is, how do you get over the hump from like working in your business to actually working on your business? And I'll give you a little of a example backstory. So I've been doing this construction business since 2019. And the last, I'm going to say year and a half, I've hired some more guys, but I still find myself like if I'm sitting here at my desk trying to get new clients and work on new stuff, I find myself, I would say anxious or I don't know what you want to call it, but like, like I'm wasting my time, like I need to be out there working with my hands. I need to be working doing something, you know what I mean? Yeah. I guess I come from that blue collar. No family where I need to work on something. You care. I don't feel like I'm making any progress. You care, bro. You care. That's a great thing. Sorry to interrupt. But go out of your good. So I guess that's my question. Like how do you get past that hump of like, man, I'm worried I'm not doing anything, but yet I am making progress. Does that make sense? Yeah. Oh, dude, 100%. I can listen, I'll give you a solid answer on this. What you're going through and this, this transition is one of the most difficult transitions for any entrepreneur that's scaling because it is completely averse to what we've had to do to get to this point. I'll give you my example on this. Okay. I worked in the stores for years and years and years and years and years. Now retail store. And then one day we got to a point where I couldn't work in the store anymore because there were so many things to do outside of me taking transactions and working with customers, which by the way, to this day is still my favorite thing to do. I love it. And I bet you love doing the work as well. Do you? Don't you? Yes. Yeah. So here's what happens. We go for those of you that aren't in this position yet, you're going to learn a lot here. All right. So you're going to go out, you're going to build a business and you're going to be doing a lot of the work yourself. So much so then in some businesses, you are the product. All right. You are the product yourself. And then you're going to want to scale. So you start adding some people and you start adding some systems and you start looking to build a bigger company that can do more of what it is that you do. And then all of a sudden you realize, wait, I can't do what I'm doing. And then still grow the company. And so what happens is we as operators who take a lot of pride in what we do, like I loved working with people one on one. I fucking loved it. And Jeremy loves doing work with his hands. But when we go to scale, all of a sudden that goes away. And now we have to trust other people to do it, which is fine. But here's the thing. There's all this guilt that comes with us not being out there with the guys. And it makes us feel this weird way like these guys are going to think I'm better than them or I don't have to do the work because it's so counterintuitive to what we've always done. And almost for me when I went through it, I felt guilty. I was like, I was like, dude, I feel like a lazy fuck like all these guys are doing the work and I'm not really doing it. I'm sure there's also some fear of like the standard being maintained too. Sure. But but at the end of the day, man, it really came down to, you know, understanding very simply that those guys aren't going to have jobs if I don't step back and run the company. And Jeremy, I think what you're going through, dude, is very similar to what I went through. Does any of that sound familiar to you? Yeah. I mean, 100% because I feel like I don't, and it's not that I don't trust my guys because my guys do good work. Like there's multiple days where you know, we're working on two jobs, but I just feel like I got to be, I got to be part of it. I got to go, if I got my guys on one job, I got to go do this other job. Like, you know, I mean, that makes sense. Yeah, dude, totally. Listen, bro, here's the thing. Okay. You, you can operate like that, but you won't get any bigger because you are basically getting, you're stretching yourself to a point where you can't be in multiple places at once. I mean, one of my best friends on the huge construction company, dude, they got jobs going on in multiple cities all over the country all the time. He couldn't have got there if he never got over the fact of not being on the job himself. And the thing, I also struggle with the same sort of concept when I went from one store to two stores. I think that was one of the hardest decisions that I ever, as weird as a fucking sounds now. One of the hardest things for us to get over was opening the second store. Man, someone's going to steal. It's not going to work. People won't do the job that I think they should do. And then one day, a dawn on me, I'm driving down the street and I'm looking and I'm like, well, there's McDonald's. They've got seven gazillion locations. There's Wendy's. There's this. There's that. And I start looking. I'm like, how the fuck are all these people doing all this shit? And then I realized it was me. It was me not understanding that this is doable for me just like it was doable for everybody else. And Jeremy, bro, you know, every construction company that you've ever looked up to or modeled yourself after or want to be like, those guys went through this same process that you're going through. We're going to feel weird. We're going to feel out of sorts. It's something new to us. Like how many times did something new feel comfortable when you first started doing it? It doesn't, it doesn't work that way. So we have to understand, brother, that becoming a real operator of a real company involves us moving from working in the business to working on the business. And for me to help you get a little bit more comfortable with that, your guys that you obviously care a lot about are going to make a lot more fucking money. The faster you move through this process, into strategically working on the business so that you can scale it out properly and always have work for these dudes. So my, my, my little, you know, closing, I guess advice and then you can ask some follow ups if you want to is just to understand, brother, that this is normal. Everybody goes through it. Unless they stay small, they don't go through it. And that's okay. Some people like that, you know, some people like to have a one off floor shop where they talk to all the customers. And that's what they like. And that's okay. Some, like I know guys, the own one, dude, one of my cousins has a construction company. He's got one crew. He does one project at a time. He's done that his whole life. He's had a great life and he fucking loves it. There's nothing wrong with that. But to scale past that requires what Jeremy's talking about. And it's a very out of sorts. Like almost, not almost like emotional move because if you're any sort of of a person like an operator, especially, you know, like someone who cares about the people. You want to do the work with them, bro. You don't want to be the guy who's like. You know, you kind of go for your whole life where you're like, oh, you know, fuck the boss and then you're like, wait. That's not the boss. Yeah. And then you start to realize that your guys are probably like, fuck you. Right. But like, dude, you know, and they probably are sometimes. But if they know that you care and they know that you're working to scale the business and they know that Jeremy gives a fuck. And you know, occasionally he shows up and he's out there doing a little bit of the work. That goes a long way, bro. And, you know, ultimately, dude, you know, this is normal. And you'll get through it and it's required. And if you don't do it, your guys are going to have less security than what they would have. If you would. And I would also say this. You are in an industry where you are primed to grow with the amount of technology that is replacing every other. Professional out there. This is a good time for you to build the infrastructure of your company. I actually think you're in a really good strategic spot with the timing of everything going on in the world. So what do you think, bro? Right. Yeah, I mean, it makes sense. Like I said, I mean, it's just I got to get past that hump of just. I want to I want to work with my hands still. But yeah, I know at 34 years old, I'm not where I want to be. I don't want to keep waiting and waiting and waiting. So what's your goal for the company? So I've. So a little backstory. So I started out just putting on seamless gutters. That's where I started. I was actually working two businesses in 2019. I was working two jobs in 2019 to get my business started. And then I've stood. I've just every year I've built on to that. So I started doing sideings off its started to just keep progressing. Well, now I want to get into building houses. And then progress into custom houses. And build that into because I like. I like high end. I like providing high end things. Absolutely. I'm very I'm very detailed when it comes to that. I built my own house and stuff. So I'm very detailed. So I want to build high end homes. That's that's my end goal. And not necessarily be a national builder, but just be a high end home builder that somebody comes to and says, hey, I like your product. Let's go with you. There you go. I totally get that. So. Yeah. Well, I mean, it doesn't change the conversation. You're still going to have to run the business. And you're going to have to move yourself from, you know, the artist to the organizer, so to speak. But that doesn't mean you can't show up. Dude, look, one of the best ways to build culture is to show up and do the work with your team once in a while. You know what I mean? So I was just as that. Does this have to be like a cold turkey thing or can you phase it? No, it's a phase. That's why it's so hard. Yeah. It's not like you show up one day and that you're like, okay, now my new job is this. Yeah. That's not how it goes. There's like a nuanced transition where, you know, you're, you find yourself spending less and less and less and less and less and less time. Doing what you used to do. And now you're feeling like, fuck, dude, like the guys probably think I'm lazy or they think I'm like skipping out or they, you know, like, you know, and all the shit goes through your head because you're not like doing the work. But and you also aware that that your team doesn't really see all the shit you're doing. So you're like, fuck, man. So it's this weird psychological transition. But ultimately, you have to realize that your company will be extremely limited if you don't make that transition. And, you know, like I said, two or three times already, your guys won't have the opportunities that they would have if you were to go out and organize and build a great custom home business for them to work inside of. So yeah, bro, just keep doing it, man. It's a, it's a, it's a awkward time for any operator to go through that. And the more you do it, the more you'll get used to it and it'll it'll naturally transition for you. It's hard, bro. I feel you on this one. I remember, I remember it took me a couple years for me to like, it actually took me out. I think about three or four years to get very comfortable not being in the stores talking to people. And then, you know, still I'll fucking stop through or we'll go to an event and my still my favorite thing dude is talking to people about what they got going on and helping them get through it. You know, so I get to do, I get to do that in different ways like this now, you know, but. But yeah, bro, I feel you dude. It's not just you. It's a normal part of of every operator that built any company ever. And the fact that you're even at that point is really awesome because most people never get there. Right. Well, I appreciate you guys. Yeah, brother. Okay, my call. All right. Well, hey, if you, if you got any more questions, bro, hit us back up. All right, that'll work. I appreciate it guys. All right, have a good day. Thanks, Jeremy. Appreciate you, bro. See you guys. See you. Yeah, that's awesome. I wonder if it's too like I was so hard. Yeah, it's such, it's such a psychological like mine. Fuck. Yeah. It really is. Especially if you care, bro, it's so hard because. Yeah, that core competency, you know, for him, it's building. Forever, that's your like, that's your skill set. Right. And then all of a sudden, it's like, oh, I have to learn this entirely new skill set, which is called operating a business. Yeah. Now, there is another option that he could do. He could hire an experienced CEO to do the working on the business and he could still work in the business. I don't think that's a good idea until he's gone through the process of understanding how to become the operator of a business. Yeah. And then I needed an idea. And he could eventually hire someone to run the business and then move back into more of that. But that would be something you'd do like maybe like when you're semi-retired type of thing. Yeah. Yeah. I was wondering, I would almost make it a point like, okay, every Monday, I'm going to the fucking field. That's how you got to do it. You know what I'm saying? That's how you got to do it. Everything else, I do the rest of it. Yeah, when I was doing it, I should have said this when I was on the phone with them. But when I was doing it, I would make a, when I was going through the transition, I would make it a point. To hit like two of my stores every day. Yeah. You know what I mean? Because I'm working from my phone most of the time anyway, even at that time, making phone calls and texts. And so, yeah, I would play that out. I would play out the visits. I would show up. I would help a customer or two. Help my guys. We didn't have a layered leadership structure that was very solid at that time back in like, you know, we're talking like before, first form even exists. We're talking like two thousand fucking six seven. You know what I mean? But showing up after the job, bring a cooler Corona. Yeah, I'm just showing up. That's right. That's it. That's it, bro. And in your due and then let them also know what you got going on. Be transparent about what you're working on. Hey, I'm trying to do this. I'm trying to do that. I'm trying to do this part of the reason that people go through like a little coup when that happens because it does happen. Like if you handle it wrong, like you just stop showing up and you don't communicate. Yeah. All of a sudden your guys are like, who were the fuck did Jeremy go? You fucked that can bail. Yeah, right. But if you were transparent about the big goals in your company and you show how their careers are going to fit into that goal. Now you get a lot of help because they know that Jeremy's out building the company doing, you know, X, Y and Z because he's being transparent. And they're willing to do the great job to do their part. You know, building anything great when it comes to a company requires multiple people in multiple areas to do an excellent job collaborating on everybody's part to come up with a win. Right. It's no different than a fucking football game. The fucking lines got a block. The receivers got to run good routes. The running bass got to run hard. Quarterback, you know, got to be able to stand in the pocket and get fucking pounded. And like, dude, these are things that are required, you know, and it's precision. If everybody does the great thing about football, the reason I love football is so much is because of every individual does their job to the highest standard. It's almost impossible to fucking lose. And that's the same way in business. If you have everybody on your team taking pride in every detail that they that they have as a responsibility and everybody understands that we're all in the boat and we're all rowing. And even though I'm not there driving nails and putting up two by fours, you're trying to do my job. When you can communicate that to your team, you have a much more effective team. And a lot of people, you know, they will they will put value higher value on certain positions on the team. And that's a reality, right? Like the quarterbacks going to get paid the most. That's what it is. Okay. But when you're running the team and you really understand what a team is, you understand that everybody's position is valuable. You know, every seat on that fucking boat is valuable. And everybody has to row with precision towards the same goal because if the if we have two guys on the left side of the boat, you know, we're in a big boat where everybody's rowing, right? And they're rowing at a different pace than everybody over here on the right. The boat's just going to go in circles, dude. It's not going to go anywhere you want it to go. So it's almost like conducting a symphony. You know, everybody's got to be doing their job. Everybody has to understand their role. Everybody has to execute at a high level. And you as a leader have to make them understand that my role as a leader is not any more important than your role. But it is fucking important. And I have to get us here. That's my job. And you guys have to fucking row. And if it requires me to get back there and fucking row, I'll row two. But ultimately my job is to fucking guide us through the the iceberg field. So we don't seek the fucking ship. You know what I mean? And, you know, I think the best leaders, the ones I've been around are ones that make it a point to let their team know that one everybody's extremely valuable. So here and my companies, you know, the guys in the back, the packed the boxes, but I tell them all the time, you're most mother, you're most fucking important people here. You're the last person attached to product for the customer gets it. That makes you the most important person, you know, like, you said to build, you have to build that understanding that like we're all in the team, we all have a role. And if we do our roles, we'll fucking win. And everybody will get paid. If we don't do our jobs, we're going to struggle. And that's going to suck for all of us. Yeah, that's real man. That's real guys. And that's a hell of a way to start a Monday. Yep. All right, guys, let's have a great week. And don't forget, don't be a hoe. Show the show.
