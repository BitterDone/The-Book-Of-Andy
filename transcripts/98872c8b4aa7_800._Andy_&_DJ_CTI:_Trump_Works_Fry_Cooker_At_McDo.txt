so I'm I'm the operator actually yeah I don't I just wear black shit yeah man anyway yeah well let's dive into this I wanted to bring this up there was a new survey that went out where they pulled and they figured out the top 10 most rudest US cities in the country oh man now I think the results were actually kind of kind of shocking okay but but let's see I love the rude cities you know I go I get along with those people yeah like or someone on the East Coast a lot of them yeah I see those are my people I love it out there a lot of them some of the West coast yeah I don't know what else people well I thought was interesting I mean let's do some foreshadowing who you think what cities do you think are top three give me a top three top three rudest cities in the country what would you say I'll give you four okay top four I bet New York City okay I bet Washington DC okay I'm in order now okay I bet Boston and I bet Philadelphia okay all right so let's let's see what was good I mean those are so I think I would say those are some good yeah I love all those places right I fit right in dude you know why I like those places because no one's full of shit it's on it they just fucking tell you how it is man 100% I just love that 100% but yeah so so the rudest US cities in 2024 so it's a survey that was done by pre-ply a language learning experts and they did the study and they they had some key takeaways but let's look at their top 10 Miami is first hmm interestingly enough then Philadelphia Tampa Louisville Oakland Boston Memphis Las Vegas Long Beach and Charlotte at number 10 so I got three out of the four three out of four yeah yeah for sure um yeah man I don't agree with this list there's some there's some pretty Charlotte's not rude that's not a rude place I've been there many a times I feel like I've went through there before those people are super nice yeah um Tennessee's not a rude place Memphis is kind of hot yeah Memphis is a lot I mean I don't think it's rude they're not rude I mean Luvio Kentucky rude never been there Tampa Florida rude yeah I don't know I don't know I don't think Miami's rude I think Miami's just got a different culture bro and people get like weird about it yeah you know because Miami's culture is like heavily Latin and it's guy I love the fucking vibe Miami dude yeah feels like you're in a different country but still America yeah for sure you know I do like that except you all fucking hunk your horns 4,000 times a day like it's a bunch of dumbasses that don't know how to drive I know fans you get shot doing that here yeah you do get shot honking at wrong people here you do um you do now I mean now I could see I don't know man I'm surprised New York City to make it on that list dude I'm surprised St. Louis didn't make it on bro everybody thinks everybody comes here and thinks St. Louis is the nicest city ever everybody that comes here from out of town they're always saying I can't believe our nice to people are we got some good people no no no I mean in the city not just here yeah like I think St. Louis people are fucking super nice I don't see I feel like we got some assholes well everybody's got some assholes yeah but like I mean I thought we would have been we didn't even make top 50 well I don't think we deserve it I think St. Louis is a great city yeah huh I mean dude dude I don't know man like I'm proud to be from St. Louis I know people fucking dog it out but I love it here yeah I love Missouri I love St. Louis I love Kansas City you know I don't feel like people here rude yeah well you know what's interesting too that uh I took this map this was from the survey and I tried to do an overlay of like political affiliations just to see like red versus blue and a lot of these places uh they're all blue they're blue all of them yeah right because people that those people are miserable it's weird man it's not weird but how happy can you be if you don't even know the fundamental difference between a man and a woman yeah you got me your whole life must be in chaos that's true you know I'm not being serious yeah like if you have a plus on top of it dude the the rigid nature of the rules to be a politically correct person are so hard to follow that it makes people miserable you know even when they root for it because eventually it they eat their own you know they do something wrong and they say something wrong and they tell a joke wrong or you know so it doesn't surprise me that people in those places are rude they're just angry at the world because they don't know reality oh man all right well guys tell us what you guys think about that list who do you think is the rudest place that you've been to New York yeah I think New York yeah I was I think New York's rude but I like it it's like in daring maybe they maybe they didn't get on the list because everybody just knows how rude they are it's like they cut off the the fucking top you know they're even counting yeah yeah Hall of Fame yeah they're just talking about the curve you know yeah I thought New York would have been up there I mean Philadelphia bro they just tell you to fucking eat shit you don't give a fuck yeah but I like it again like I said I just I don't know I like to know where I stand yeah that's true you know just let me know yeah yeah well guys let us know what you guys think down in the comments on the root of cities and I mean DJ it's Oakland even a city anymore I mean it's a battleground yeah opens I mean I bet they are rude you know you got a leadership that have run that that area into the ground bro yeah sad they lost a baseball team they lost their football team or or all their streets look like a dump like I'd probably be not in so good mood too yeah that's true that's nothing against the good people of Oakland but guys quit electing the same dumbasses yeah that makes sense man guys let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get into our headlines remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them all link there with that being said let's get into our first line of headlines headline number one this was this was a this was a big talk Trump at Mickey D's oh yeah yeah Donald Trump works fried cooker at McDonald's and Mag of Faith will line up to order I'll take whatever he gives me so this was interesting so and uh festerville travaux pennsylvania okay uh and the race for president Donald Trump is really cooking let him cook let him cook uh wearing a red tie and apron the former president served up some fries and political shade against his rival during the behind the counter stint at McDonald's on sunday which drew a monster crowd to the festerville travaux fast food restaurant now Trump's always been a big fan of mcadise yeah mcadise yeah mcadise McDonald's mcadise do you know what that's from yeah I know where that's from that's a fundamental movie of black hold you what coming to america okay well you know the program might got on me earlier actually yeah yeah uh you never saw brave heart I've seen brave

some stuff bro you have to see shit brave heart patriot yeah you have a scene days of the fall you know some days at thunder I'm not seeing days of thunder you seen tab done the original the original one I've seen both which one's better uh you know the original obviously but the second one actually wasn't that bad wasn't bad at all yeah anyway mcadise but Trump's always been a fan of McDonald's I remember when Clemson won championship that year he brought them to the White House and served them McDonald's with some chick filet he's always been a fan he's got chick filet and McDonald's chick filet and McDonald's really is that what that is on the side there yep oh chick filet and McDonald's he's always been a fan um of McDonald's apparently it's his buddy that owns a couple of franchises uh in Pennsylvania so he went there this is him getting off the plane to talk about it let's check this out I'm going for a job right now at McDonald's I've had I really wanted to do this all my life and now I'm gonna do because she didn't do it thank you very much I'll see you at me go it's such a troll man because she didn't do it he's just such a troll uh but yeah so that's that's him getting off uh getting off Trump force one to hit there this is him walking into the McDonald's check this out in this here she has this is in this she has a different order sure take off my jacket I think the press wants to see this for you it's a wealthy guy he owns a lot of big tunnels that's great thank you yeah I just tried what's your favorite thing or I'm going I like it all I like everything but I do like the franchise where I'll be working I listen to uh come on she said it was so hot it was so hot it was such a tough job I turned you have a man that's been doing it for many years at the French French one we're gonna send me a word how to do it right now thank you welcome here he's ready to get to work he's ready he got right to work I mean check this out keep the tight let the shoulder never touches the human hand nice and full nice and full is important everybody hates getting their fries when they're halfway full oh I'll be pissed yeah I'll be be ever you ever you ever you ever drive through a drive through with your with your significant other and you look in the bag and the fries are both filled and then by the time you get home they're both half empty that's where it is dude that is weird weird it's a weird thing man why do the dead text now oh oh so you do that I do yeah before they even get it I get that so you you want or the so you make sure that when you get home they're equal yep and you don't know what happens to it was like 10% for the big guy 10% out of each one though right each one so it's really not out of yours it's correct yeah for my mind state my mind stays oh yeah but I'm I'm I'm collected that's a weird thing and they go to jail if they don't pay they what's jail look like what's jail look like in the in the Johnson Household no fries for you right but yeah so obviously Trump did this because there was some talk about Kamamala saying that she worked at McDonald's but interestingly enough there's no record of her ever working at McDonald's she first talked about doing working at McDonald's at a union event in 2009 okay and then as of August of this year this campaign act comes out from Kamala check this out here she grew up in a middle class home she was the daughter of a working mom and she worked at McDonald's while she got her degree Kamala Harris knows what it's like to be middle class it's why she's determined to lower healthcare costs and make housing more affordable Donald Trump has no plan to help the middle class just more tax cuts for billionaires being president is about who you fight for and she's fighting for people like you I'm Kamala Harris and I approve this message yeah so you know that comes out in the McDonald's they release this statement where they say specifically that that none of their franchises have any records for Kamala Harris working at McDonald's even her run-and-make got triggered Mr. Walls sent him to the walls he posted on Twitter saying this guy quote saying this guy spent decades stifling workers pay cut overtime benefits for millions of people and opposed any effort to raise a minimum wage you know who has actually worked at McDonald's joined workers on picket lines and fights for working people at Kamala Harris so it's interesting and then after that he released another statement saying hey listen I'm a knucklehead she didn't actually work at McDonald's no he did not she worked on the parking lot at a McDonald's yeah yeah and you know I'm just a knucklehead knucklehead stuff yeah he's knucklehead you know but everybody freaked out on this man establish a media establishment media freaked out you guys could control the headlines all you want I mean they're saying crazy shit man they did freak out about it freaked out which is so weird well I mean yeah did you see what's that kid's name that Harry Harry's size yeah yeah did you see that video he put out this was staged no shit bro well I mean that was all over the thing you know but like oh it was it was staged yeah like a fake white house stage set you mean like a fake COVID shot you mean like fucking everything it was staged yeah well I mean like and and here and to the bro the your guys mr. sissin you're your whatever bro like I'm you know whatever dude sissin dude you listen man that everything they do is staged Kamala Harris get the same speech 47 times dude and there's proof of it and seven different like hey I can appreciate that you think that you're on the right team because you're getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars but bro you're selling your own people down the drain brother and like I don't have anything ill will against Harry sissin he's a young man he's trying to figure it out but bro like you're gonna get to be 40 you're gonna figure out the way the world really works and you're gonna be like fuck what was I doing it's gonna be embarrassing and by the way no shit it was staged it's called politics it's called optics and right now Donald Trump is crushing Kamala Harris and the optics then you got JD Vance at a bar porn beers and these dudes are trying to like white dudes for Harris right you know bro you guys are sitting in some redneck bar about to get yourself killed you know try to pretend like your normal dudes no it ain't working yeah no and well I mean I think to the point too you know everybody talking about it was staged there like there is an actual security risk of doing dude he's been shot at twice already you know I'm saying yes like like no shit they got to shut down the McDonald's no no so they got to vet the people come out of way they're like all the people with they went through the drive-through they had to rehearse and practice no shit yeah dude holy cow man yeah last thing we need is an olive McDonald's so do you like round them a girl rolls up at the drive-through and shoots them through the window like bro come on man of course it's all staged everything these people do a stage on both sides and to pretend like it isn't as ridiculous it's called optics it's called marketing that's what the fuck these people do and by the way you know let's let's bring this into perspective here okay I can appreciate Donald Trump going to do you have more I mean yeah I mean other than the media just continuing their bullshit you know Trump's wild-lewed rhetoric reaches a new new extreme saying that his erratic autocratic and vulgar behavior and he hints at four years of unpredictable leadership that may lie ahead if he's elected president in 15 days I mean just more bullshit that's all that is well these people are scared bro they're terrified they're terrified questions about Trump's stamina and cognition okay well Joe Biden called a lid on every single day he spent more vacation time than any president ever he didn't do one pre he did one presser I believe which then you guys got got mad at him because he threw Kamala under the bus you know who's being hidden who's who's has cognitive abilities you have you have Kamala Harris on Brett there getting totally baited into that that was beautiful work by the way and I'm not a huge Brett bear guy I don't like any of these media guys to be honest but that was pretty good you know you walked her right into that shit he is crazy he is it so when did you first know that Joe Biden was mentally declared like it's like oh my god but you know here's what I would say about this it's just part of the game it's part of marketing you know I think people who love Trump loved it and that's why he's getting so much backlash on it because the people who don't live Trump realize that it was a good move for Trump and they're pissed but let's let's not lose perspective here you know you have all these people in North Carolina that still don't have power and still don't have you know infrastructure and still aren't able to get food and water the normal way and you know let's not move on from the real things that are happening in the world that that are really people are really suffering and I think it's important especially with the amount of political disturbance that's going to happen for the next few months I think it's important to reel it back into real Americans that are that are suffering and hurting and I just hope that people don't forget about that you know I've been working with a number of groups on the ground and he's there's just a lot of work to do man you know well Trump went back there today where to know with Carolina they actually raised like eight million dollars for the the people in need down there which was it which I thought was pretty pretty fucking cool he's back there yeah you know and so we've been working with a hunter seven foundation and also save our allies Dan Holloway Tim Kennedy and Wentz been down there a lot a lot of people are down there my buddy John Paramore Jared Connell who was an executive here at first form you know my buddy Vinnie who we talked about you know earlier these guys are taking time out of their lives to go there on the ground and really help these people I just hope that people realize that these people are looking at an entire winter without infrastructure you know it's gonna be hard and let's not forget about it just because the hype is around Trump serving french fries I mean we can all laugh at it and think it's a good move or whatever we own the lives you know whatever they say but like bro maturegared yeah let's let's let's remember dude like let's I just don't want people to lose it because of the news cycle you know what I mean yeah I'm not that's real man so that's what I kept thinking yesterday I was like look at all these posts about Trump serving fries and like no one's even saying anything about North Carolina anymore makes me wonder like I don't want the the help to dry up you know well I think that's probably why he also went back down there too good you know I'm saying yeah I didn't know he went yeah he's there right now at the time of the recording yeah he's right back down there so yeah but yeah guys jumping on he had a massive crowd to you thousands of people showed him the McDonald's at the stage event yeah of course he did and look how young those people looked though yeah bro listen Gen Z starting to wake up they understand the failed policies that you know have been supported and propagated and put into play by the generation ahead of them and they were they they've started to realize how backwards it is and how it's going to affect their opportunities in the long run so yeah it doesn't surprise me and by the way it's passed when these movements get to a certain point of like critical mass and critical momentum it's it's passed the point of stopping and Trump is him whatever you want to call it has has crossed that line now now it's not cool anymore to be a Democrat it's not cool anymore to be a liberal and for years and years and years and years probably the last 12 to 15 years that I can remember that was the cool party and it wasn't cool to be a Republican it wasn't cool to vote for the other side and and now that's flipped and it's it's too it's too powerful now I do think they're still going to try to cheat the election and say that you know Kamala one magically or whatever but dude you can't argue with the crowds you can't argue with the fanfare everybody that you see is voting for Trump and the people that aren't are stuck there there are people who are on the far far far left progressive side of things and you know you're you guys aren't going to stop at this point it's become the cool thing and so just like you had a lot of kids who didn't necessarily understand what they were voting for with voting Democrat for the last you know that has now flipped where the younger kids are not seeing it cool to be affiliated with Kamala Harris they're seeing it cool to be affiliated with Donald Trump and that's once things crossover like that and they become full momentum movements which this has especially in the last 30 40 days really started I think in July when they shot at them there's no stopping it so like I don't see how they're going to prevent him from becoming president without some sort of like we talk about you know drastic event happening where it shuts the world down you know what I call black swan event what's you know it's not what I call it's what it's called yeah so we'll see yeah well guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think about make Trump down in the comments with that being

got not a lot of backlash it's actually smart marketing it's just not they don't understand where they are in the spec they're off the mark yes because when when women do have the power to influence for how man vote but when things get how they are now that goes out the window about the way and if they ran this ad if they ran this ad on Trump's side it would be very effective right but here it's not going to be effective because it's anti what's cool and people are misunderstanding who controls the power in the social momentum right now you see what I'm saying does that make sense absolutely yeah so like if they had a if they had an ad where you know it's like because everybody knows it's conservative women are look way better right I mean generally it seems to be the case you have some beta dude walk in they all pop fucking balloons that video is gonna go viral yeah you go fucking viral yeah you know um it's real for sure bro for sure but I mean the internet went crazy on this one yeah uh this this person said uh Jackson said quote now one person is going to watch this ad and think hmm I should vote for Kamala so I can get some pussy no in fact if you're a normal dude you're gonna watch this ad you'd be like thank God I don't want to date those girls it'd be miserable oh bro no um this black man said HP greencraft he says as always black woman wanting to keep black men down suck my dick hard what that's not what he says it says shaking my damn head yeah redo this one sorry I'll leave that in anyway what's the next one yeah you know have you thought that for a minute you think that's what that means suck my dick hard you just playing right no yeah all right let's see next one uh queer lips of truth the second said uh how is this going to convince black men this is insulting um another one uh red was the target audience gay men and women oh man I mean dude now that wasn't the only trick Kamala had up her sleeve Lizzo oh no good Lizzo got deployed she got deployed uh Lizzo got deployed if Kamala wins the whole country will be like Detroit oh let's dive into this this is the video okay she she was at a let's check this out I'm so proud to be from this

first I know it's not enough we can laugh I mean we can laugh a little bit yeah because they got second place hey at least we're we're fucking winners hey hey dude I love how she catches herself it's just like proud like Detroit everybody's like fuck Detroit we like Detroit that's why we vote for Trump bro look at this video man this is from a police officer in Detroit cruising through the city of uh in the city streets there's just fires bro listen everybody in the crowd cheered for that like it shows you the lemmings these people are like I mean even if someone were to say we're making a whole country like St. Louis I'd be like well the whole country we got listen we got some work to do all right we got a good base yeah we got some work to do the next time next time I think we go full regalia oh fuck dude man that's that's bad yeah I got none to say man I you know I've been trying to say you know I got nothing to say yeah trying to be nice I didn't have to say about Lizzo man she looks good she's lost a bunch of weight she's looking good she's it's a good start yeah I did you see the video that she got going on to her plane what she said this is how bad bitch blah blah blah it's like bro we're so sick of this shit we're so sick of this shit we're so sick of this bad bitch I'm fucking badass like shit like bro people are like not being able to pay their bills you know what I'm saying like people are not being able to go in and and take care of their families like no one gets a fuck about bad bitch and no one cares about you either no she doesn't look good looking process yeah no she doesn't she got it's a good start yeah that's like saying I'm gonna run a marathon I'm at mile three yeah run a good race so far so good yeah we'll see yeah so far so good man but yeah I mean you guys know we got so as of today you guys are listening we are exactly two weeks out from this election all right now we've talked all the time about you know how they're gonna try to steal this shit right and here we are two weeks out I just want you to guys to be aware of the the the multitude of bull shit that's happening around the country right now this first one I want you guys to check out this headline reads 31,000 mail in ballots requested at ineligible addresses and one swing state and once this is in one state yeah okay mail and ballots are being requested by the thousands in locations which are undeliverable in Wisconsin if nobody is there who the hell is requesting that ballot this is the heart of the 2024 steel and it is happening in plain sight for the world to see this was a great article by the gateway pundit got great guys and girls over there but they listed it out in depth 2700 permanently moved out of state 2300 addresses are not deliverable or or or not found in the USPS database 7500 incorrect or missing a secondary address so like the apartment number for example 513 door not accessible there are over 1200 of these addresses are listed as vacant for more than 90 days as meaning the person to not receive their mail from more than 90 days or not necessarily an empty house but just not active in the USPS database 3400 of those addresses are duplicates and 10,000 almost 11,000 of them not all components of the address match up to what is in the USPS database so all in total almost 31,000 of these and the gateway pundits asking some you know three very simple questions the question is who is requesting the ballots for people that have moved that's a great question that should be should be answered who is requesting duplicate ballots be sent to one address right and who is requesting a ballot to an undeliverable address I think those are some really really good questions good questions to be asking another places we go to Michigan another swing state they have more registered voters on voter rolls than eligible voters this is another great deep dive that was done by check my vote um where all of these things are listed out and it just takes a couple of seconds just to go through and do the math how many votes did Biden win west constant by in 2020 look that up while you're telling this story but um be according uh to the article article goes into detail on this says the july 2023 u.s census population in michigan was 10 million 37,261 okay with almost eight million citizens over the age of 18 but interestingly enough according to check my vote michigan's most recent qualified voter files or the qvf it shows 8.4 million registered voters on Michigan's QVF. That's a difference of almost 500,000 votes. 500,000 votes. Yeah. And so you have that in Wisconsin. What'd you say? 20,682. In Wisconsin. And they're manufacturing extra 30,000 votes. Right. So that covers it right there. Coincidence. Right there. It must be a coincidence. Like, first of all, can they not figure out? Can they not figure out who's requesting that? Did it, what do you do? You, you, you anonymously call in with like a voice changer. Oh, say, so ballots to the, just address. Like, is that what the fuck these people are doing? Or could you actually track down their phone numbers and track down their information and figure out who's doing this and hold them accountable for fucking treason? How about that? How about we do that? How about the FBI does another fucking job? How about that? I mean, I think that, that's a, it makes too much sense. Why wouldn't they be trying to do that? Because they don't want Trump to be president. They're going to do the same shit. Do listen. This is what's going to happen. If they don't turn the grid off and they don't start a fucking war, here's what's going to happen. We're going to go to bed at midnight. And when we wake up, they're going to magically tell us that Kamala one. And then they're going to show us the chart of the votes. And it's going to look exactly like the one from 2020 where it goes up and then it goes vertical and passes Trump. And then it goes continues to follow the same pattern. And all of us are going to be like, what the fuck? And all the talking heads are going to be like, can you believe this? And then they're going to be stealing the country. That's what's going to happen, dude. And people better be ready for that. Because dude, there isn't a place, in my opinion, there is not a world where Donald Trump wins the election. And they just let him go in without some sort of massive controversy or violence or straight up, you know, yeah, what are you going to do about it from them? And that's that's what these people think. Think about the attitude that you would have to have as an individual to think that this is okay to do. Like think how brainwashed you would have to be and how insane you would have to be to think that the rest of the people in your country don't have a right to say what it is they believe, who they want to vote for, who they want representing them. Like think about that. Like that is that is fucked up, dude. That's that's way worse than ego. That's evil shit. Yeah. In Michigan, those people deserve to be in prison forever, forever, forever, ever, that not a year, not probation, not a fine forever. You are fundamentally interfering with other citizens rights in this country and it's damaging the country. And because these people don't understand anything other than what the MSM tells them, they think they're being patriots. They think, oh, I'm justified in doing this because look how bad this guy is because the media for the last eight years have lied and lied and lied and lied again and made these people believe this dude is the anti-Christ and they think they're doing the right thing. Right. Dude, evil people don't sit around and think, oh man, we're going to do all this evil shit. They sit around and they think, oh, we're right. They're wrong. They just don't know any better. So we got to do this. It's a duty. And whenever this thing is, it's usually a mass violation of their rights. This is how leftists think. This is how authoritarian think people say, oh, Trump's an authoritarian. No, bro, signing fucking executive 30 executive orders on day one without passing them through Congress. That's authoritarian. Creating a situation where people are forced to take a vaccine or they lose their job. That's authoritarian. Creating a scenario where people's votes don't even count and you're willing to ignore a massive part of the population. That's authoritarian. Okay. Going to wars and spending hundreds of billions of dollars without the approval of the American people, that's authoritarian. All right. So we live in an authoritarian environment already. And when they call Trump, that it makes me laugh because I'm like, dude, what are you? Are you not aware of what's going on here? It's not that they aren't aware. It's that they think it's okay. They think it's justified. They think, oh, this is okay for me to go along with because I'm a patriot. I'm saving the, I'm saving democracy. Right. And this is how the Democrats and the media have, and the big businesses, the big fortune 100 companies have brainwashed a large part of the population to be willing to commit illegal acts and think that it's no big deal. It's no big deal. Well, I'm just doing my duty. That's that's not okay. And these people should go to jail. Yeah. And just for context in the state of Michigan, so in 2020, Trump lost allegedly by 155,000 votes. They already have almost three times that. Yeah. 486,000 votes in these new, yeah, new voters. Yeah. And see, dude, they'll populate. But dude, leftists see that, leftists see that. And what do you think they think? All right. Good. Good. Good. I'm glad they're doing it. And that's the problem. That's the problem. It's bred into through brainwashing, their mentality for years and years and years and years. It's installed into their brain that this is okay to do. It's not okay. It's against the Constitution. It's treasonous act to interfere with the election. And people who do it should be held accountable. It's insane. Yeah. But like, and the interesting thing is that you have this going off, right? And one thing that nothing has been a constant theme of this show, something we've talked about, plenty of times. Honestly, to some degree, part of the issue here is that the left, they cheat, they steal, they do all of this unethical bullshit and the right will try to always take this higher road. Yeah. And it fucks us sometimes. All the time. Right? And the thing is, it's like, you have this clear setup to steal this shit. It's already happening in these important states, where the margins were not that big. And then Elon Musk is coming out saying that he's going to be giving away a million dollars a day to random people who sound up for a petition. They register people to vote and they bring another person to come vote with them. Right? It's a great concept. It's a great concept. The problem is that he's already being hammered for that. You know, I'm saying even just trying to do something like this. It's ethical. That's on the high road. Well, what's the difference between him giving was at 15 days left, 15 million dollars and Mark Zuckerberg donating 400 million in the last election cycle. Right. What about that? Right. So you had a problem with that. No problem. But this is okay. This is the problem. Or this is a problem and that's okay. You know, and you know, the crazy thing is that, you know, with all of that happening, you know, one of the biggest issues and we covered this. Or what about this? What about George Soros backing all these prosecutors and all of these Democrat cities who haven't prosecuted crime in the last fucking eight years who have allowed our Democrat cities to become exactly what we looked at and Detroit. Okay. You guys don't have a problem with that. You don't think that's, you think that's okay? Like it's crazy to me that like it's just crazy to me how much destruction and devastation and crime and just bad things that these people are willing to overlook to get their way. You know, yeah, man. You know, and with all of that going on, you know, we covered heavily the 2020 election. And you know, it wasn't like they just cheated one way. It was multiple different ways in different states. Like no state had the same bullshit going on, right? in Georgia was the pipe bursting and clearing the room and then these magical fucking briefcases come from under the table, right? It was different in all these different states. But one thing that was that was very consistent in all of the states was the dominion voting systems, right? And you know, they just put out their warning. This headline reads, dominion voting systems issues, a chilling warning to conservatives weeks before the election. And so let's dive into this a little bit. Dominion voting systems has issued a chilling warning to conservatives just weeks before the all important presidential election in a post on the Twitter platform. The company said that it was quote, closely monitoring claims that its machines may be compromised. Quote, dominion is closely monitoring claims around the 2024 election and strongly encourages use of verified credible sources of info. The post who's that? Who are the credible verified sources of information? Who we say are? I would like to hear that from Dominion. Your people, CNN, yeah, you're way hold on. You're people, right? Like what? Who is? Who falls into that? Let's get that definition while we're at it. Yeah. You know, but it was the last line of their posts that really raised the mob browser. They said quote, we remain fully prepared to defend our company and our customers against lies and those who spread them. I guess like in a you mean, you mean how the Democrats were claiming this weekend that, you know, their votes were being flipped to Trump? Do you see that? I did see a little bit of that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, you know, I think what they were doing is it's like it's how we talked about with the Alex Jones thing, right? They lost suit that, you know, a billion fucking dollars, right? Like I think that's what they were kind of like, you know, pushing towards like anybody that tries to question it, don't forget, you know, we sued Fox News and they had to pay us, you know, almost a billion dollars. You know what I'm saying? They got it at all. So they settled for $787 million. Fucking dollars. You know, so don't don't question it, you know, because you know, we'll sue you. Yeah. Right. So you can't question anything about these digital machines that we have no control over that work connected to the internet that are connected to the internet. Yeah. Allegedly. Okay. Okay. All right. Yeah. Okay. Question it all. And see how far that goes. Yeah. It's crazy, man. It's crazy. Guys, jumping on this conversation, let us know what you guys think down in the comments. That being said, let's get to our final headline of the show. At line number three, it's covered a little bit. It's been happening. Let's talk about it. Let me ask you something. So I'm curious to what people think about this. So Trump has hundreds of thousands of people showing up on a regular basis everywhere he goes. You have Kamala throwing rallies, but they're busing in and paying people to go to the rallies. Okay. Two very different things. You have Trump doing them literally every day. You have Kamala doing them once a week. Okay. We have tons of anecdotal real evidence and statistical data that shows that many, many people who voted for Biden are now voting for Trump. And nobody that voted for Trump is voting for Kamala. Okay. Then we have the Vegas line, the actual money line, which shows Trump at like 65 and hurt like 35. All right. It's fluctuating, but it's about that. So what happens on the day after the election, when they came out, they come out and they say, you know, oh, by the way, we're the winners. What happens? Everybody's seeing it. Everybody knows it. Everybody's seeing the movement. They're seeing the crowds. They're seeing people show up and show out. They're seeing all of this shit. What happens when that happens? I think that's something that everybody should think about. I take it a step further. I think I think like legitimately what I believe is going to happen when we wake up on November 6th is they're going to show a landslide victory for Kamala. And I think they're going to dare us to do something. That's how I feel that they're going to try to do to make it ain't going to be close. Yeah, but they're going to give it to her. And like, yeah, I know we won. Look, well, that's what's happened in every single communist country that's ever existed. If you look at what happened in Brazil, look at all the people who were out for what's his face, Bolsonaro. And I mean, dude, millions and millions and millions of people and then Luna wins. Right. Nobody believes that. Right. That's how they do it. So like America, Americans are thinking, well, clearly Trump's going to win. And they don't understand these people don't care if the optics show that or they don't care. They're going to get their way. And they're willing to put up with a bump in the road for a few days or a few weeks to maintain what they're trying to do over the course of their life. And over the course of their life, these people are communist. And they're trying to conquer our country. And you know, I get really tired of people on Instagram. And everywhere saying that I don't know what communism is about. Why don't you ask the people who came from communist countries, what communism is about? Why don't you ask all the people who are here from communist places, what communism about? Because those people will tell you this is exactly what the fuck we're dealing with. Okay. So all of you knuckleheads out there that think this isn't communism, you're mistaken. And you're you're being fooled. And you're being fooled to vote for something that's ultimately going to destroy you and your family and your lifestyle. And that's not me saying that. That's people who come from communist countries that come here and see what's going on here and saying, fuck, we've already seen this. This is what's going on. And you know, to say, oh, you don't know what communist, no, you don't know what communism is. You have no idea, no fucking idea. You think it's like 1991, uh, USSR breadlines. That's only part of it. All right. The real fun part, the part that everybody doesn't understand is the genocide that comes along with a communist revolution, which has come along with every single communist revolution that's ever happened in history. There's a genocide and the genocide is the resistance. It's people who do not go along with them. It's people who resist them. It's people who dissent from them. And then it's also guess who it is. It's the people who rooted for them to be in office who didn't know what the fuck they were rooting for called the useful idiots. So if you can look at this and you say, oh, this isn't communism, you're in Saint bro, you're the useful idiot. You're part of their actual plan. And if you actually read about it in any way shape or form, like if you went back in red marks, are you going to read rules for radicals? Are you going to read miles, read book and you read these, these different pieces, which I've read all of those, you will find out that what we're looking at here is very real and it is communism and it's going to fucking hurt you. And it's not going to hurt you a little bit. It's going to drastically change your life. And so voting for this, being ignorant puts you in the category of what they define useful idiots. That's their words. That's not my words. That's their words. So I would think long and hard before you jump to this and think, oh man, this is so great. And I hate Donald Trump and only vote for them because you hate this one guy. You should ask yourself why they hate him. Why do they hate him? Why hate him so bad? What did you do? What did he do? The four years he was here. Oh, he made some mean tweets. So you're telling me that's why they hate him that much? Oh, he, he's a, you know, he's a rapist. He's a felon. Okay, well, you haven't followed those cases. Have you followed those cases at all? Because if you had, you would very clearly be able to see the bias and justice system, which is the fundamental problem that is trying to be corrected here. Okay, we're not able to get fair trial as patriotic Americans anymore. That should be enough sign to everybody. Like the fact, even if you're a leftist and see, this is the difference. I will say this, even if you're a Democrat, because leftists don't care how they win. They don't fucking give a shit. They just want to win, which we need more of that, to be honest. But if you ask a Democrat, why it is, why is it that patriotic Americans like, for example, Daniel Penny, who stopped a guy in New York City from hurting women and children and all kinds of people, and the guy actually died. Okay, because this guy was a Marine and he choked him out. Why is that guy being treated one way? And then all of these criminals who are murdering people in the streets who are undocumented, who are heroically aren't even being deported or held accountable. Why is that? If you can answer that for me in a real reasonable way, you'll find out exactly why we're talking about communism here, because that is the double standard is right in everybody's face. Everybody can see it. And the problem is is that people root for it because it's like, oh, yeah, we got them. We got their team, but you don't realize, bro, you're sinking your own boat. You're drilling holes in the bottom of your own boat. You don't even know it. And so we have a big problem here. And the big problem is, and I agree with you, that come November 6th or 10th or whatever, when all the dust settles, they're going to fucking say that she won and they're going to try to make us forget just like they did in 2020. In 2020, Donald Trump did rallies nearly every day leading up to the election with 60, 70, 100,000 people. Joe Biden was in his basement. Joe Biden didn't have anybody show up. Joe Biden did rallies inside of gyms with COVID circles drawn on the ground. Okay. It was very clear that that guy could not get anybody. And it's been very clear for the last four years that nobody really voted for this guy. The more you watch him, the more you're like 81 million people, more than Obama, get the fuck out of here. All right. So when we break all this down and we start analyzing it and we start thinking about it, it's pretty obvious, but they acted like it didn't even happen. They acted like all this shit didn't even happen. Look what they're doing with Kamala. She is the least popular vice president in the history. And they're trying to paint it out like she's getting 50% of the vote right now. She's not getting 50% of the vote. The Vegas Lions don't they do not fucking lie. They are not wrong. Okay. But they're going to come out and they're going to say she won and we're going to we as Americans are going to have to decide what the fuck do we do from there? These people who are in the CIA who are in the FBI who are police department, sheriff department, all of these people, they're going to have a critical point in time in their history as human beings where they have to make a decision. Do I stand by my oath and defend the people of this country or do I stand by the corrupt government who clearly just cheated because it's my job and it's my paycheck. And there's going to be a fundamental very deep, very real question that these people have to ask themselves because they are the barrier between a tyrannical government and the citizens just like there are barrier between the crime and the citizens. They also hold that responsibility between the government and the citizens. So it's going to be weird, dude. And I would be and I will I will definitely say that I was wrong if I'm wrong. Like if I'm wrong, I'll say I was wrong. But I am very concerned that that that's what's going to happen. And the American people are just going to fucking like do what they've been doing. Oh, can you believe they're doing this clearly? No, no, shit, man. They don't care what you can see and not see. They don't care. Yeah. They don't care if it's unfair. They don't care if if it looks crazy. They don't care. All they care about is they get the result they want. And that willingness to win and do whatever violates our constitutional reality in this country. Okay. We shouldn't have people in this country that think it's okay to take the will of the people out of the people's hands. That's tyranny almost by definition. The people who hold the power are able to take the power from us just because they want to. Yeah, because the people want something different. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, we're being shown in real time that for a long time, this country has been a facade. It hasn't been what people claim it to be. And you know what? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Trump does win. And maybe he does. And everything goes as normal. And then I'll be able to say, well, I guess I read it wrong. We guess what? He still has to get an office. Even if it does win the election, there still has to be a peaceful transfer of power that'll happen till the fucking January. The only thing that makes me think that it's possible for him to win is how fucking afraid they are. Like it's very clear that they're afraid, very, very clear. And dude, it's going to be important. Like I've been saying over and over for you guys, you know, you have to go vote. You have to get everybody you know to vote. You cannot believe these tactics like Trump's going to, it's a landslide. No. Only if we vote. That's only if you vote and you get everybody else to vote. And you make sure that all your friends and all your families are voting. Everybody has to vote. They have to vote. You have to vote. No one's going to do it for you. The reason that we lose so much is because everybody thinks everybody else is going to do it. It's a bystander effect. Everybody else sees everybody sees a problem. And everybody thinks that, you know, everybody else is going to solve the problem. Dude, there's like 200,000 registered hunters that in our state alone, they aren't registered to vote. That would vote for Trump. Like what the fuck is that? Like what do you guys think? You're out in the country. You think this isn't going to come for you, dude? You're not going to be able to get food. You're not going to be able to get gas. You're not going to be able to do shit. You all think life's going to go on for you as normal out in the rural areas? No. They're going to come for your shit too. Do you think that all these places were hundreds of millions of people were executed over the last century? Do you think they didn't have rural areas? You think they didn't have farms? You think you're the first motherfucker that thought, oh, I can live in the country. Nobody will fuck with me? Bro, they're coming for your shit too. You rural Americans out there to think like this doesn't affect you. You're insane. It's going to affect you the most because you have the least amount of available resources close to you, which means you're going to be the first fucking starve. They don't, people are not understanding what's happening here, dude. They think it's normal political ebbs and flows and, and, and, and dude, I don't think it is. I don't think it is. Amen, guys. Jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said. Let's get to our third and final headline headline. Number three, got to cover it. Let's go to the middle east. Just do a little temp check on that and see what's happening. Plus a little unique twist that I think they're kind of hiding under the under the surface here. So let's dive into this. First headline, Hezbollah drone targets Netanyahu's house. No injuries. All right. So a Hezbollah drone that evaded Israeli air defenses, managed to strike near or at the private home of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu early Saturday, though he was not physically present and there were no reported injuries. Even pausing right there was kind of interesting because again, I mean, Israel has some of the most advanced air defense mechanisms in the world. And so how this one magically evaded the air defense systems to hit the prime. Like, okay, all right. But in a statement that was released by the Israel, Israel defense forces said, quote, during the past hour, three UAVs or unmanned aerial vehicles were identified crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Two of the UAVs were intercepted. One additional UAV hit a structure in the area of Cesaraya. No injuries were reported during the incident. Sirens were activated in the Gullat military base. The presence of additional hostile aircraft in the area has been ruled out. The incident is under review. So you know, that happened. But there's something interesting. Didn't happen. Biden and Harris, they failed to call Netanyahu after the assassination attempt. Trump and Starmer and Johnson do times. Visor reported that Trump spoke with Netanyahu after the event as well as Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, United Kingdom Prime Minister, Kier Starmer called Netanyahu and also said that he had been alarmed by the drone attack. But neither President Biden nor Vice President Harris apparently bothered to call sources said. Now, Biden did speak with Netanyahu earlier in the week after Israeli soldiers killed him as leader Yaya Sinwar. And a chance encounter in Rafa Biden and Harris opposed Israel entering Rafa despite the likelihood of finding homosleaders there. Biden had has had a frosty relationship with Netanyahu. Harris used a meeting with Netanyahu to issue a statement blasting Israel for quote human suffering in Gaza. Now, to your point about being able to trust different things. You know, I think it's very, very interesting. I found this article that was posted on insider. I'm sorry, the intercept, which is, I mean, you talk about true journalism. That's what these people do. They are the ones that expose that story about how the FBI got people to engage in some domestic terrorist behaviors. Same, same, same, same site here. They have a new article that just came out that I thought was wild. Let's look at this headline. The Pentagon wants to use AI to create deep fake internet users. Now, on the surface of this, I'm like, okay, I mean, yeah, I mean, everybody's using AI. There's deep folks all around. It gets deeper than that. Yeah, because everybody's aware of bots now. Everybody knows they've been manipulating the entire world with bots for the last 15 years. So now let's create some AI generated users that no one could tell the difference about. Not even AI. That's the scary part here. Let's dive into this. This article given credit was written by Sam Biddle. Okay. So the article reads, the United States secretive special operations command is looking for companies to help create deep fake internet users. So convincing that neither humans nor computers will be able to detect they are fake, according to a procurement document reviewed by the intercept. The plan mentioned in a new 76 page wish list by the Department of Defense's joint special operations command of JSOC outlines advanced technologies desired for countries most elite clan, destined military efforts. Special operation forces are interested in technologies that can generate convincing online personas for use on social media platforms, social networking sites, and other online content, the entry reads. Here is a screenshot from that procurement order. This is the first page. Obviously, you know, we link this stuff on the website for you guys. But, but diving into this document, the document specifies that JSOC wants the ability to create online user profiles that quote, appeared to be a unique individual that is recognizable as human, but does not exist in the real world with each featuring quote, multiple expressions and government identification quality photos. In addition to still images of fake people, the document notes that the quote, the solution should include facial and background imagery, facial and background video and audio layers, and JSOC hopes to be able to generate quote, selfie video from these fabricated humans. These videos will feature more than fake people. Each deep fake selfie will come with a matching fake background quote to create a virtual environment undetectable by social media algorithms. The Pentagon has already been caught using phony social media users. You just pointed out the bots. We found all of that shit out in 2022 with meta and Twitter. They removed a propaganda network using fake accounts operated by US Central Command, our own DOD, including some with profile pictures generated with methods similar to those outlined by JSOC. A 2024 rotors investigation revealed a special operations command campaign using fake social media users aimed at undermining foreign confidence in China's COVID vaccine. This is the headline from that article. This was a post. Now again, we knew bots back then. You could clearly identify it. Laila at Laila, 1, 2, 7, 3, 1, 3, 1, 7. Right? Like, okay. All right. Bought. Got it. But like this was an example. This page was operated by our US military targeted at China. I'm translating it. It says hashtag China is the virus. Do you want that? COVID came from China vaccines came from China beneath the the message is a picture of then Philippine president Rodrigo Duro Tay saying China prioritized us first. Please I'll give you more islands Pogo and back sand Pogo refers to the Philippine offshore gaming operations. Online gambling companies that boom during the watch days administration black sand refers to a type of mining. But but you have that but then on top of that, you know, two year point about, you know, there we got the election coming up. You got the DOD putting in procurement requests for companies help them generate this fake shit. And I think people kind of forget because this happened back in 2023 also covered by the intercept in San Biddle. US special forces want to use deep fakes for siops. They've been using them for years, bro. They mean using bots. They who knows how long they've been using bots. Mark pardon me thinks that the whole reason the social media was invented is so that they could control the social narrative. It could do just with fake traffic. You know, it took us until 2021 or two to figure out what they were doing at mass and still a lot of people don't realize it. A lot of people still don't realize that there were millions and millions and millions of fake accounts inside Twitter that were operated from inside Twitter at the direction of the United States government to post and comment and boost favorable content, which is leftist communist content. And suppress any sort of resistance whatsoever part of how they suppressed it was not just through bands or censoring, but it was also through piling on and canceling, right? If you made a post that was, let's say pro Trump, all of a sudden you'd get 50. They're talking shit. That's right. 50,000 comments in the next, you know, two hours saying how you're a piece of shit and threatening you and intimidating you and bullying you and not making any more of those posts. That's been going on for a long time. That happened to me in 2016. I made a post against Hillary Clinton. And then within five minutes, I had like thousands of comments, which were legitimately impossible to the point where I had to take the post down because of how many comments were coming. And that's how they control the narrative. So if you could proper up the things you want and show the social proof and people don't know the difference and you could suppress the things that you don't want. And people don't know the difference. They are naturally going to join the crowd. Most people, nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd. And these people understand that and they've been doing this for a long time. Now they just want to do it more effectively so that you can't tell the difference. And it's no surprise that it's our own government that wants to do it. Why would they want to do it if it wasn't to create a scenario to create fake momentum and control the social narrative? Okay. US special forces wants to use deep fakes for siops. They spent years warning people that siops and these deep fakes that could destabilize democratic societies. And now they want to do them. Yeah. So our own special forces and our own intelligence agencies want to destabilize our country through the use of deep fake bots. Why would they want to do that? And why not? Where our shit is so corrupt, dude, it's unbelievable. It's unbelievable that people just will not. I mean, definitely people are standing up more and more now. But like, okay, what happens on November 6th when they tell you that Trump didn't win the election and everybody gets scared and you all go back into your fucking holes. You see what I'm saying? It's going to get harder and harder and harder and harder to take our country back. And most of the people that live in this country want Trump to become president. And you have a small group of people who are willing to lie, cheat, steal and manipulate to keep that from happening. And that's wrong. That is not okay. And dude, people who are voting for Kamala, they cannot give you a single fucking reason that is factually true as to why she would be the choice for them and president. It's always shit like this. I don't like Trump. And that's why she's leaning into this anti-Trump thing. She's finally figured out in the last two weeks of her election that the more aggressive she gets against Donald Trump, the more enraged her following gets, the less critical thinking happens, the more likely they are to vote for her, which is why you have her out on the stage screaming at the top for lungs, saying, never again, stand behind the seal of the president of the United States as loud as she can. Like she's like, she's honestly, she sounds like fucking Hitler. Okay. These people to vote three times. Yeah, that's right. And dude, this is, this is bad. These people don't care if it's the will of people. They do not fucking care. And I think we're going to see, I don't know what we're going to see. I think we're going to see some crazy shit. I think we're going to see some crazy fucking shit in the next fucking three months. Yeah, man, guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. I was that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. Bro, listen to what they could do with this. They could prosecute you and send you to prison for something that you didn't even say. They could potentially even execute you for something that you never said or did. Think about that. And they could say, here's the proof. Look at it. And it could be a I generated and they could fucking kill you or your family members or their friends because you simply hold a different opinion than what they want you to hold. Like understand this. This is not, this is not okay. Like let's say, from, let's say, you know, they want to ruin somebody. What's to say that they won't go shoot up a school and then post video of you doing it and say, look who did it and rage the entire country into, and to fucking executing you for something you never did or even talked about. And then they come up with all the fake shit you said online that you didn't say they could fucking make all these fake clips of me saying this shit on my shirt. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, bro. Like, dude, this is the real scary part about that. And he's like to your point. Is that again, like, it's not just the simple fact that it's AI that is going to trick the minds of humans is that they're pushing for shit that will literally trick the mind of AI. Like, there's AI checkers out there. Right. You can put it. Yeah, but why is it that these people feel like they're the ones like these people have God complex, bro. Like why are they the ones that want to call who gives these people the fucking right to fuck with our reality like this? And they're using our money to do it. Bro, that is that is mental abuse and psychological manipulation for the good of who for the good of them a tyrannical government that doesn't give any fucks about the citizens of the United States. And if you think as a citizen of the United States that our government cares about you as an individual as a whole, you're insane. It's not just the left or the right. It's everybody. It's all of our citizenship are neglected and abused and financially enslaved by our own government. And it makes me giggle when people say, oh, well, they, you know, they're on our side. They're not on anybody's side, bro. The people running this play are not on anybody's side. Yes, we have a few great elected officials that care about people. But far more than that, we have people that are there for their own interests. So we need a lot of change, bro. And it's not just one candidate. It's we need to change the entire culture of our country. We need to change the entire culture of a political system. There needs to be rules put in place to keep this from happening. Like there should be rules in place. Like if you get caught using AI for something like this, you go jail forever. You never get out. You know what I mean? Like I don't know what the solution is, but I know that this is not good. Guys, jumping on this conversation, let us know what you guys think down in the comments. I would that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. This is where we bring a headline in. We talk about it. It'll get one of those two options. So what that being said, thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline. Read, do you remember this one a couple of weeks ago? About the dude eating his boogers on live TV NFL player. Yeah. Hmm. Guess what? He did again. Not him. Who? Aaron Rogers is caught in disgusting act during Jets' loss to Steelers. It's his third pick of the game. That's pretty good actually. That's pretty good. There have been many low points for the New York Jets over the years. The butt fumble and Bill Bellichek defection to the rival New England Patriots stand out. Although anything after the team Super Bowl three upset of the Baltimore Colts in 1969 deserves consideration. But while falling to two and five with Sunday nights, 37 to 15 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, quarterback Aaron Rogers found a new way to crystallize the embarrassment of Jets fans. Jets season is going up in flames. And Aaron Rogers is on the sideline eating his boogers. One fan wrote on social media after NBC cameras appeared to show the four time MVP doing exactly that Sunday night was bad enough for Rogers who was reunited with former Packers teammate Devonte Adams only to connect with the all pro receiver on just three of nine targets. And then there were Rogers two interceptions on the night, which only gave fans more ammunition online. Referring to the footage of Rogers tending to his nostrils, one fam remarked it was quote his third pick of the game. Here is the video. Let's check it out. This year play a Thursday night game against Houston on Halloween at MetLife. This year play a Thursday night game against Houston on Halloween at MetLife. What was the what was the mouth move there? I'm eating it bro. No, come on man, not Aaron Rogers. That's coincidence. I'm giving Rogers a pass. First of all, that wasn't even a real pick. That was like a that was like a itch. It was a scratch. Yeah. Okay. I'm not fucking I'm not I'm not piling on my boy like that. I like Aaron Rogers. Definitely not eating his boogers. Dude smart. Period. Yeah. Well, others prefer the to attack Rogers for proudly refusing to take any COVID-19 vaccine. Somebody said, Vax. Somebody will said, I've been mect inside of fix. Do horses eat their boogers. Look man. Come on. We're not doing my boy like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I don't I don't I don't I don't see it man. You don't I'll see it. I think he's in there. I think we both going to say he's in there. That is not in there. That's an itch on the end of your nose like this. And then he went like this. I don't know what the fuck that thing was. Maybe he's got a mustache hair in his fucking mouth. I do get those. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. And like, dude, you're already there. See you like one of these. I do get those. You know what I'm saying? I don't I don't see it now. I thought the mince you was more of a booger eater than oh he definitely is fucking booger. Yeah. That's that I don't know. I'm not saying I think they're just hating on him bro because he didn't want to he speaks out. He speaks his mind. You know, they're looking for any we know how that goes. They look for anything they can fucking get. I'm standing with my man. You saying? I'm saying I'm standing with Eradger. So only two picks. They're the only three two picks. Bro, it was hard to watch that game. I watched it man. I could think about with my boy Gary Vee just blow this fucking gasket. Yeah, man. Yeah. I don't know. Come on. That's bullshit. All right. Well guys, you let us know what you guys know bro. He was listening. He was doing something. Yeah. He had one of them little radios in his hand. He was talking into it. Whatever he was doing, he wasn't eating his boogers. All right. Damn it. All right. I'm not playing. I'm not playing right. That's fine. All right. You think he was eating boogers? I think I think he got a little something. You think he ate that. I think he got a little something. No. I think we'll a little bit. That's fake news. Yeah, maybe maybe guys, you let us know Andy guys. That's all I got man. He ain't no boogers. Hey, listen, here's what I got. I got one more thing besides booger talk. Make sure you vote. Make sure you get your friends to vote. Make sure you get their friends to vote. Do your part. Show up. Okay. The reality of the situation is is they are counting on you thinking that everyone else will handle the problem. And guess what? That's not going to happen. So make sure that you go out and you fucking do your civic duty, even if you think it's fixed, even if you think it's rigged, because the only way to know that it's rigged is for everybody to vote and then I still have it stolen. So it's very, very important. Whoever you are, even if you don't believe in the government, even if you don't believe in voting, even if you don't believe in any of this shit, to go out and vote for the candidate that you think is the best candidate, which by the way, is Donald Trump. You're going to tell you that right now. Okay. You may not realize that you may not understand it. But this other thing that's happening in this country will destroy your lives. It will destroy your existence. And whether you think the hard times are right now that you're facing are on Trump or not, you're going to find out firsthand that they aren't if she wins. And it's going to not be like it is now. It's going to get way, way, way worse. All right. So go vote. Don't think other people are going to handle your shit. Make sure that you're living the standard. Make sure that you're being the best example, because the at the end of the day, guys, it's a cultural revolution that's needed in this country. If we had strong men, if we had strong leaders, this would have never happened. So you have to go out and you have to be part of the change. You have to live the change. You have to be better. You have to lead by example. You have to change your own reality. And when everybody changes their own reality, reality will change. All right. So that's the show. Don't be a hoe.
