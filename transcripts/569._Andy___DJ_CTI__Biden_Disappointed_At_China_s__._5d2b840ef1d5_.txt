you get those daily wins that that piles up that's how you build confidence I just hate that like you know how easy it was before for me to just lie about or like make an excuse about doing shit like bro I was up every single day partly because I couldn't sleep worth shit but I'm still up seven eight o'clock in the morning getting my workouts done you know I'm saying just laps you know I'm saying laps around we are I think we're staying on maybe like a 50 about 15 acres of just land you know I'm saying I'm up doing my morning walks you know everybody else is still sleeping shit just like bro

you're fucking off I'm working yeah you're doing whatever it is that you do that makes you fucking miserable and I'm doing whatever I need to do to make me not miserable that's how it is yeah that's how it is I don't want to share this this funny story though so on the way back home so I obviously I'm riding my bike to these places and coming back home I'm trying to race the the the fuel gauge versus with a GPS is saying you know I'm saying I thought I was gonna make it but end up didn't make it out it's probably about you know 30 minutes away from home still south of like Perryville area and so I stopped at this gas station stop that this loves gas station and I've probably been riding for about almost two hours straight okay rolling and so I have to stop for gas I'm like I ain't gonna make it all the way home so the last little fill up right and this truck pulls up to red truck and we're sitting there because the I was at a love gas station and the gas pumps were shut down they were like recycling them whatever and this truck that pulled in you know he was an older older white guy and he was like you know I'm not fucking waiting there's another you know gas station across the highway or whatever so he pulls off and looking at this truck and on the back as he's bumper stickers and is like you know there's giant fuck Biden bumper sticker right and this other bumper sticker that read Joe Biden is Hillary Clinton with a smaller penis right I'm like do that's fucking awesome you know I'm saying so I'm sitting there waiting him like I it's been like 15 minutes pumps don't they work I'm like fuck I'm gonna go to the other gas station so I go over there he's still there and he gets out he's like oh a long time no see you know I'm saying I'm all you know kid up in my my bike or stuff and I'm like yeah I'm like hey man I like your bumper stickers he's like oh I appreciate it you know I'm saying you know and that was pretty much it right yeah I get back on my bike and I recycle my playlist in the first song that I have on my playlist is Richmond North Richmond right Siri press play you know I'm saying tell me why me and him for the next two minutes are having a karaoke session in the fucking parking lot of this gas station oh he heard it singing the song word for fucking word yeah word for word and I do do it it's just awesome to be able to get those real life temps of where America's at you know here's this you know he's probably 60 years old yeah I'm standing he's screaming at the top of his lungs and it's like we can still relate like that's what truly that's truly what America's about yeah people are sick of it dude they're over it yeah you know and just like knowing how many more people and like aware of the shit that's going on it's cool to see man it's cool yeah I think people are generally sick of being told that they hate each other and that you know the the people that don't look like you or don't come from where you are where you're born where you come from or your enemy and that you know every joke you tell everything you say every every comment is racist like everybody's fucking tired of it dude yeah like everybody yeah like even even the Democrat and the people who bought into this shit for so long they're realizing what they've perpetuated now and it's disgusting to a lot of those people because I see in my DMs every day yeah man well it's like just just knowing that even despite all the things that they try to throw at us what unites us and what what bonds us as Americans and what makes us you know they're the same we're far more similar than we are different like despite everything that thrown at us that still remains true you know I'm saying and like we just have to be aware they're like hey no we're all being fucking played we're all being oppressed by the same people we're all you know being lied to by the same people yeah everybody starting to see it we're all struggling you know I'm saying off the hands of the same people and so like you know what unites us and we we are far more similar than we are different and I think it's just taking those moments just the pause you know and even if it's just the conversation like hey nice bumper stickers yeah and just see where it takes you yeah you know I'm saying because everybody's on the same page right now yeah I think so too man yeah it's cool but I know one place that I was not at what's going on in Burning Man man have you been seeing that shit first first well I mean listen I know listen I feel like the Burning Man attendee their leprechauns bro what'd you got not much I mean look man that's just a my jam that's not it I grew up playing sports I grew up lifting weights and fucking doing violent shit and fucking making money and shit like yeah I you know like Burning Man I mean this whole spiritual movement of like you know let's take some drugs and let's walk around and fucking goofy looking shit I have to shit it is just ain't for me and like these people are like oh you know you're gonna discover yourself no I've discovered myself look around you know what I'm saying I don't need to I don't need to go to these festivals and like fucking act like people try to convince you to go yes all the time yeah because like a lot of my friends ago they go yeah well I mean dude to me and like this is gonna piss some people off but like it's lemming shit that's what I you know like what is it lemming it's like lemming shit it's like sheep shit it's like it's like you know oh this is the cool thing yeah and like and then people go and they try to justify it and act like it's this spiritual experience bro you went and did fucking mushrooms in the desert and probably listen to fucking in-s-in music dude like it ate that fuck like it ate that cool bro it came with that enlightenment I put my tin foil hat on three days a week here brother like sometimes I run around naked with it on you know what I'm saying like it's great I have my own Burning Man like like bro I'm just it's fucking weird dude it's like this whole to me and like dude I get it like I'm not dogging people if you want to go and do that shit that's cool we could be friends and all that but we probably ain't got to be but like dude it's just not my fucking thing dude like we're now they're stuck out there apparently yeah yeah I mean dude throw a fucking few thousand people that you know live in a sheltered environment all right and put him in some harsh conditions and yeah they're gonna get even good conditions and throw a fucking wrench at it's you know it's not gonna have a good outcome yeah I mean like dude I was laughing about it our boy Diplo was out there did you see that our boy Diplo was he yeah he was out there yeah he got he's one of the ones that got turned apparently had to like walk for like five miles before somebody picked him up oh man yeah so it was with Chris rock like a hard yeah here's a video so they were walking for like five miles before they're picking up I guess inside the road I mean you know look dude that's shit ain't for me I don't give a fuck like this whole this whole fake enlightenment like spiritual shit that like infest the internet right now it's like it's just a bunch of people hiding from reality in my opinion you know it's a bunch of people trying to create an alternative reality it's filled and I'm not saying all the people but it's filled with people who once had goals and dreams for themselves who who found that it's like pretty hard to build your life the way you want it and you know these people then adopt this other persona which is like I'm going on a spiritual journey and they become some sort of internet spirit guide you know posting all this in light and shit talking to us like we're fucking dumbasses right and it's like you know bro like do your shit but you don't have to justify it all like that's where my problem comes like the issue is yeah like my issue isn't let they go do this shit and all that it's that they try to convince you that you're like morally inferior spiritually inferior for not doing it right and it's like all right man like whatever the fuck you say wait so you tell me you haven't stuck a tree limbed up your butt dude yeah or you know you don't do coffee animals like you you you don't ground you know is that what is called no I'm just saying that's a you know you don't you don't very you don't have a 30 point morning routine like it's like dude I'm just over it man I just hope like I can appreciate anybody who's doing things they need to do to like get better and deal with things but like bro it's played out it's a it's become like a it's become like a persona on the internet just like the like the fake internet guru right like it's like it's like a different version of the dude standing in front of a rented hurricane talking about how he's gonna make you millions in dollars you know what I'm saying like that's to me that's all I see and if that offends you too fucking bad like that's just my mind dude I just I hope I hope everybody there gets out okay you know I mean they got nothing to do so what they were just making yeah they could stay there definitely yeah well I mean that guys do any of our listeners go to Burning Man or you guys turn it out there let us know in the comments broke imagine me like dude serious like I want to paint a picture bro like imagine me going to this fucking shit yeah and like me and Emily go to this thing right and then like we dress up and like these like mm-hmm yeah it's just it's to me it's like kid shit you know what I mean it's just not I don't know like I've never been I've never been someone that bought into like what was cool just because everybody did it yeah and I'm not really into like being dirty and sweating for fucking four days I like showers and I like the luxuries of my finest state that I've earned you know what I'm saying like I like that shit yeah like this this shit ain't for me I'm not gonna fucking give up this you know one of the nicest states in the fucking world uh to go live in the fucking desert for four days with a bunch of people I don't know dressed up like a fucking idiot you know taking drugs I could take drugs at my house you know saying it's still be naked yeah like this is not for me bro that's real man I get it that's cool that's all right and then you know here's the thing I get the cobblets I'm gonna get from this is Andy you don't know what you're missing you're just insecure about your okay bro you know like shut the fuck up like people just need to do their lives and shut up about it you know hey I went to Burning Man I did drugs I got fucked up it was awesome like just leave it at that I don't have to fucking tell me this gigantic spiritual fucking reformation that you had over three days of getting you know seeing some boobies and like getting you know we used to just call that partying yeah like thousand yeah bro like before the internet it was way cooler dude like you would go on on a boat bro there's fucking titties everywhere everybody's partying it was fucking awesome now a day the internet's ruined everything yeah it's okay you even have fun anymore because nobody wants to have fun because they know they're gonna end up on the fucking internet that's a fact that's a fact it was a fact like don't you got a hat like like to get into Burning Man like how many beads do you think you got a war an old ones though like you know every dude there that goes to Burning Man has like a requirement of the certain amount of beads that they have to wear I don't know that oh yeah like you know those big beads like you know that spiritual bro if you don't have like beads no is that real thing yeah that's a real thing beads like kind of a man bun ish look oh that was a requirement yeah like it's just I just look at this picture and I just imagine this made bro dude the smell like that's that pick I can smell that picture it smells like sewage tell me I'm lying I do know this though I did see something though so apparently like you know you can't walk barefoot there and so like that's a fucking Ebola or something bro yeah like your feet will get fucked up because of like the the sand I guess it was a dry lake bed or some shit and like if you walk barefoot you basically you'll have to end up cutting your dick off is what I was well that's what I've been seeing well there is a rainbow in a picture yeah yeah I don't know guys let's get on my first time I mean dude that picture it looks like a gay sewer party that's the fucking looks like dude oh shit bro imagine if I showed up and I said DJ we're going to Burning Man and I got like come on bro I did see some crazy shit oh I got a post taken down yesterday you did in my story yeah what was a post so I posted uh this article about uh the forest fires going on in Louisiana did you see that not bro listen I'll tell you this so with a part of Mississippi we were in it first of all the the campsite that we were on yeah guess what the name of the street was called what it was coon coon road oh really yeah in this city this angle I was a little I was I was I was I was I was I was a first time in my life bro I was like all right we're the fuck they got us you know I'm saying they fucking got you at the matrix bro coon road let me let me yeah coon road in in Sardis Mississippi oh man uh it was the first time in a minute man I was cuz I pulled up on myself is night you know I'm saying like shit man where do they got us that you know I'm saying but uh I think that just for you yeah so I read this article 33,000 acres or some shit like that in Louisiana I got started on fire by some arsonous right shit yeah and I commented I made a post and I said dude these climate fucks are setting fire and ruining our forestry and our natural habitat for a political to further a political agenda that they have that they claimed to love and care about they claim that exists so they think destroying the planet is justified to get their way and this is the problem that we have in society with all of these movements is that people are unwilling to accept whether their opinions are right or wrong based upon the facts they get emotionally invested in these views and then they think that it's all about being right and this is how shit gets really fucked up and so we have this group of climate activists all over the world it's happening in Greece too it's happening in Canada it's happening in California and now it's been proven in Louisiana that the 33,000 acres which was yesterday so it's more today right I have been burning because of these activists starting fires and dude like my opinion is those people should be executed yeah like dude if you're willing to that those trees and that forest and and this lands that belongs to the fucking humans like that's that's the earth dude and you're destroying something that's taken hundreds of years to build like dude if you're if we catch these arsonists who are you know these climate activists doing this shit these people should be put to death yeah like they should be given the death penalty well worse pd like know what about all the wildlife in those second four dude like there's so much not I will say this like but anyway that's why I took that that's why they took it down for that I said that that's crazy man like climate climate change is only happening because climate change isn't happening well let that sink climate change is happening because there's trillions and of dollars available for financing programs and they have to have the justification to finance the programs and those programs only exist if there's a problem so if there's no problem those programs don't exist and there's no funding exactly so and they use the climate agenda as we talk about on the show quite often to push a communist ideology and if you don't believe me on that you can go watch the film agenda and agenda to out of all there's tons of tons of documentaries to talk about this but I think those are the two most well done and I think they're palatable for most people some of them get like pretty far out there right yeah but this one lays it out and connects the dots for people and a lot of people you know because when you talk to people it's common sense right do you care about the earth of course yeah like do you care about the environment yeah but if you don't care the way they care right meaning sacrifice everything and go along with all the lies that are told about climate then you're you're you're you're the villain and it doesn't matter what happened to you like these people are insane dude these are these people who are climate activists like this on that level they're fucking insane and if they're willing to set fires and burn down forests that took literally hundreds or thousands of years to grow they deserve to be killed that's my personal opinion because dude no amount of money can even fix that you can't raise billions of dollars and rebuild the forest like that's going to take hundreds of years to get back you know what I'm saying you're doing irreparable damage that cannot even be recovered in our lifetime like that's no different than murdering a human being no it's no different and it's actually murdering a lot of human beings because we need those forests to produce the fucking oxygen that we breathe as humans it's dude I can't stand those people I can't stand it that's wild shit man that's wild shit man but guys let's uh it's good to our first headline remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for sale at calm and you can find them link there or you can also drop down in the youtube description below and find them like there as well so with that being said let's get into our first headline man first headline headline number one reads Biden says he's disappointed China's G reportedly will skip upcoming G20 summit in India now this is an interesting one right so President Biden told reporters Sunday he was quote unquote disappointed uh uh Chinese president Xi Jinping reportedly will not attend the upcoming G20 summit schedule to take place in India this week quote I'm disappointed but I'm gonna get to see him Biden told reporters and robo beach Delaware without elaborating right now I tried to do some digging I wondered man why you know what would make Xi skip it you know I'm saying you know they have a pretty decent relationship now know we've had a lot of struggles you know I'm saying a lot of weird things happening but I couldn't find anything to pinpoint why Xi pinged out until I saw this next headline FBI tracks over 100 incidents of Chinese nationals posing as tourists to breach US military sites maybe is that why he's that why he pulled out but this report just come out and magically he's pulled out of the G20 summit right let's a little it's interesting so let's dive into this so this is a Fox News article reading the FBI and DOD have reportedly tracked more than 100 incidents of Chinese nationals posing as tourists to attempt to breach US military bases and other federal sites those responsible dubbed quote unquote gate crashes range from Chinese nationals detected crossing into a US missile range in New Mexico to scuba divers caught swimming and murky waters near a US government rocket launch site in Florida several US officials recently told the Wall Street Journal the growing trend represents a potential espionage threat as authorities believe the Chinese government in some cases is compelling nationals into service in order to test out and report back about security practices at the installations the FBI Department of Defense and other agencies held a review late last year centered around deterring these incidents is not known how many incidents were benign in nature for example some Chinese nationals claim to have been following Google maps to the nearest McDonald's a Burger King which happens to be located near a military base very convenient and more concerning incidents Chinese nationals arrived saying they had a reservation at a hotel on a military base recently a group of Chinese nationals reporting to be tourists try to force their way past guards at Fort Wayne Wright Alaska claiming they had reservations at a commercial hotel on the base according to the journal Fort Wayne Wright is home to the US Army's 11th Airborne Division focused on Arctic warfare Pentagon spokesperson told the journal that in some cases Chinese nationals have achieved unauthorized access to military bases by speeding through security checkpoints and those incidents they are they are quote often cited criminally barred from future installation access and us courted off base the spokesperson said I thought that if you just ran through checkpoints they killed you'd be shot and killed very very interesting man and again everybody's talking about it from Yahoo News CNN MSNBC they're all talking about it now I thought this was an interesting topic to bring through because outside of it you know bringing in flashbacks from that movie Olympus is fallen right at the same exact time and we've talked about it countless on the podcast we have military age Chinese men that are coming through our border every single day by the thousands yes so she's pulling out of the summit this report comes out today Andy what do you got on this well let's not also forget about the weather balloon that was allowed to go all the way across the United States and happen to pass over some of the most important military bases that we have in this country with the most secret technology that we have and it was a lot of do so when interrupted by the Biden administration and then finally symbolically shot down after it had done its job then it was confirmed after the fact that they actually did get all that information they were looking for now we have military age males coming across the border by the thousands as you pointed out every single day and it's been happening for the last two and a half years at the tune of hundreds of thousands of Chinese military age males now right now in the United States we have now them going on and actually observing security protocols at some of these bases like close up and that's not to cut you there's there's a there's a case on hand let me pull it up real quick because this is very very important US officials also describe Chinese nationals at the White House leaving tours to take photos of the grounds communications equipment and positions of secret service in other guards yeah why would they why would they want to know that information okay and then on top of it let's talk about the thousands of acres of property that has been accumulated by the Chinese surrounding key strategic military bases in the United States all right they're planning to take us over and people do not understand that and Biden has taken money to give them all the strategic advantage that they would ever need to do so he allowed the weather balloon to go across he allows these people to come across the border he allows these spies to do these things with no punishment um he's destroying the unity of the country intentionally he's created disasters in the most of the cities in this country intentionally via the crime and the identity politics and the division and the not prosecuting of of any sort of crime whatsoever um I mean dude this guy's and we've been saying this for years he's been putting us on a silver platter for China to come in and get whatever they want and now it that's just what's disturbing about this to me is that these people are observing like actual on-site protocols and you don't observe those on-site protocols unless you are planning something in the somewhat near future of how to actually get in control of these situations it's reconnaissance and the the that's the key thing when it comes to reconnaissance you got to have the most up-to-date information right you can't rely on information that was taken two years ago because things change right and so you know this isn't good um I think we're going to have the most turbulent next 12 to 16 months in the history of the country I think there's a real possibility that that we could have unrest meaning a war on our soil uh and I've been warning about this for years none of this shocks me none of this surprises me this is what I've seen coming and what I've been trying to communicate to you guys coming and you know I would appreciate it as if you guys would like go out like when when all this stuff starts to happen and people start talking about other hosts on other shows who got shit right if you guys would uh go tell them like do this guy's been talking about this for fucking years because I have been and you got half of you guys think I'm crazy you know oh there's conspiracy well conspiracy is a real thing conspiracy theory is a theory and it seems that all my conspiracy theories are actual real conspiracies by the way that they unfold so everything that I've said about Biden serving up China uh serving us up to China has unfolded more and more and more and more it's not going the other way no it's not going more in fact um China issued a threat last Thursday through their media that if we help Taiwan and their quote was there will be lethal consequences for the United States so these guys are getting ready to rock and they're getting ready to roll and their kids are in summer camp learn how to shoot guns and learn how to train and learn how to fight and our kids are learning from women with fucking rainbow hair colors how to cut out their dicks so you do the math on where we're at you parents better start raising your kids right because if you don't start raising your kids right they're going to get fucking slaughtered by these other people in other countries we don't live in this uh iron dome of security where we're untouchable like you guys think no that that's been the fallacy and the that's been sold to that if we were bordered by hostile countries like some other countries are these people would have a very real understanding that this could happen at any time and this sort of preparation would be normal but because that's never actually happened here because of the strategic location that our country actually holds meaning it's hard to invade all right um because of that nobody takes a serious and everybody thinks that America's this you know amazing place that can never be fucked with and you know and then by the way they villainize all the people who would stand up and defend uh this country for are against those people right so we have our own people these progressive liberal dumbasses in here villainizing masculinity villainizing men feminizing young boys making them weak making them soft teaching them bullshit like gender ideology and the only reason they're able to do that is because they think that we're not touchable and we are touchable and we have a generation of kids from the age of 0 to 20 that unless things majorly change are going to be incapable of actually defending this country in just 10 more years we're not talking this isn't 20 years we're talking within the next 10 if we're not already there I mean that depends on how strong the 20 the 20 year old generation is right now which by all accounts it doesn't seem like it's real fucking strong and it certainly doesn't feel like it's very patriotic so I don't know man no yeah that do the strategic thing that's something people like China is not going to roll up their worships on our coast no they're going to send as many people as they got people inside and then a switch would flip and those people would all become soldiers are they're already here they're here man they're here people listen dude what Americans got coming does it deserves people get pissed when I say that we deserve it you guys have you guys have gotten so unfocused on reality and you've lost you've lost and you're also by the way a lot of a lot of Americans have been cowardly yeah all the red flags yeah you guys you guys haven't spoken up you haven't fucking said what you know to be true you don't even share my fucking show sometimes because you're afraid it's gonna offend people and now we're in a situation like think about that like you can't even share content that you believe in because you're afraid and you think that we're gonna like win a war against another country like you're not even willing to stand up to these weak little malnourished like pussies who who fucking go to burn a man yeah I'm just saying not burning man but you get what I'm saying yeah who are like these little you know people who look like they haven't had an ounce of nourishment in the last 20 years and if sat in the dark and somebody's basement they look like skin hanging off of skeleton or their fat as fuck and they got fucked up hair and they're all fucking weird and they're talking about how they're gonna you know your kids should be you know your boy should be a girl and your girl should be a boy and you're a racist for not fucking agreeing with it and blah blah blah and you fucking pussies wouldn't stand up to those people and now look where we are yeah so I've never I've never bent the need of those people and I never will they can fucking fuck off and until Americans get to that point we're gonna continue to get weaker and weaker and weaker and we need a cultural revival of masculinity to happen right now I don't care if it's toxic or not you guys all fucking say well toxic masculinity yeah until you need some of it right until you fucking eat some of it until you need someone to fight a war until you need someone to fucking protect you until someone bus out of gun and there's no fucking men around they all hide behind the women then what then then you want your toxic don't you fucking women don't even want it bro look at all the women that complain about how there's no men yeah look at them dude you guys did that you guys yes you guys are you guys made the bed and now you're laying in it you're the one that said for the last 10 years that men are bullshit and we don't need men and men are fucking stupid and men are racist and power hungry and the patriarchy and all this stuff you guys said and now what do we have we have a bunch of men who duplicate beg and wine and plead and have no ounce of masculinity in their body or in their bones whatsoever they have no ability to take care of the family they have no ability to protect our country and feminism did that okay so mate you know when you guys look around all you women you say oh there's no good men just remember who did that it's what's that man guys jumping on this conversation let's know guys where you say and hashtag gate crashes and let us know where you guys are you optimistic about our ability to defend ourselves against the Chinese opponent I mean I would say I would say here's the only positive that I could see right I think this is going to be like like I mean everybody's going to move red on I think it gets us some of that part and the only thing that makes me somewhat optimistic is the fact of knowing that like you know all of our true American patriots the guys that were in the military they're gone they're they're now on the streets with us you know I'm saying so if it was to come to that okay I feel like there's going to be certain I can agree with that strong most of those men are in their late 30s or early 40s or older yeah all right so how many more years can they do that that's true very true yeah I mean like if they were if China was to do some shit tomorrow our age range right our eight that's right yeah tomorrow tomorrow but in five years or 10 years no fucking way I mean looking because the the the actual masculine men which are usually of the ages of late 30s to like 50 right that are still somewhat active and healthy able to train and fight those men are going to be old men and the young men are not becoming men yeah you know they're on spirit they're on spiritual journeys yeah you know what I'm saying yeah there's a massive vacuum there man dude I even see these talking heads these guys that got podcasts you know trying to break down masculinity on their podcasts when like it's very clear that they have very little of it you know what I mean like dude just fucking be a man stand the fuck up for what is right eat right train hard work hard provide protect tell the truth stand on what you believe be a fucking man either state holy shit dude it's not that hard it's real simple yeah take care of people do the right thing be a good example say yes when you mean yes and follow through and when you mean no follow through on that too like this is not hard take initiative take charge make some decisions be a fucking leader in your household these things matter and they matter more now than they've ever mattered before and no masculinity coach or man camp or this or that or this is going to get you this is basic shit y'all know what to do go fucking do it like it's very simple every single man listing right now shaking their head being like yeah that's pretty much it you know like be useful like this is a hard dude no it's not man you don't need permission to be a fucking man you don't got to get a certification to be a man you don't got to go to a man camp you don't got a fucking you know you don't got a hunt and like cut eat raw meat like bro it's basic shit I mean you can no you can't that's a good skill to have what I'm saying like we have we have like polar things happening right yeah we have this movement of of feminine men breaking down masculinity who think they're being masculine they think there's this new version of masculinity like that they've created right which is like this vulnerable fucking soft version no that's not masculinity you know what else doesn't masculinity talking about how you only raw meat 24 seven and going out living in the woods and fucking hunting and bro no we're talking about like good man you know I'm saying like you don't have to be because because do this is confusing people right it's either you got to be this fucking soft little spoon or you got to go out and like if you don't wipe your ass with poison ivy for fun like you're not a man you know what I'm saying like this is absurd it's absurd shit being a strong masculine man is not that fucking hard to understand it takes some effort you have to put some work into it it's not a natural thing it's hard but fucking we need it man what wipe your ass with poison ivy well you know what I'm talking about like these guys who take it upon themselves to declare and decide what a man it's what man it is yes and it's like you know if you don't run 280 miles and fucking do all this shit you're not a man and if you know and over here if you don't cry about your fucking childhood and go on a spiritual journey and dress up and go to burning man you're not a man either it's like shut the fuck up none of you guys are we're talking about basic shit yeah we're talking basic shit that we need you know what I'm saying like dude and women need to call for it like that's the thing like man will do anything for fucking pussy I don't know if you figured it out yet but like when dude start figuring out that they're never gonna get a shot at it ever unless they hold these fucking values uh then guess what they will transform into those things magically women run the show here they got the remote control they're complaining about masculinity but they keep it mute on it you know what I'm saying I just saw this study or something that they took like uh it took more like I don't know if it was the term and dodge in this story or what but that they know just they just said liberal men they took liberal men and they gave them testosterone yeah they started voting conservative yeah bro that's real shit why people make fuck people make fun of Alex Jones they say Alex because Alex Jones his delivery he gets drunk and he goes fucking crazy and shit like on Rogan right no I think it's hilarious it's funny to me because I also understand he's passionate about message what he's yes I broke but the thing is he's telling the truth he was telling the truth 20 years ago when he talked about Atrazine being in the water and Atrazine turned in the frog's game and y'all made fun of them y'all said oh the frogs are gay ha ha ha Alex Jones is an idiot and it turns out holy shit they do have Atrazine in the water and it does lower testosterone and the average testosterone of the average man now that's in his 20s is that of a man even just 25 years ago that was in his 60s okay so this isn't like conspiracy theory this is a conspiracy to demasculinize men and why would they want to demasculinize men in America there's only one mother fucking reason and it's to conquer it that's fuck yeah go take some fucking test holy shit Andy you're you're where y'all test up you got damn right absolutely yeah fucking love it bro breakfast lunch you

two let them to read Fauci is concerned that people won't comply with masking recommendations return quote I hope they abide this your boy ain't it I'm telling you right now dude like if I was president of the United States he would be my number one person that goes to the gallows yeah yeah like immediately yeah straight to jail yeah so let's do good yeah let's let's dive into this so in a Saturday interview former White House chief medical advisor uh Anthony Fauci spoke out in defense of masking up amid today's rising covid cases in the event that mask are again recommended he is quote concern that people will not abide by recommendations he said in the interview uh quote I would hope that if we get to the point that the volume of cases is a suck because I really like him it's again I mean I don't I gotta pretty decent Fauci yes yes yes yes yes well it was never it was never mandated mask yeah it was only required dude that fucking guy fuck that guy everybody smells like mesmerized you know that clone that old school yeah I don't think about what Fauci smells like bro no well it's like you know what burn a man smells like yeah but yeah but I gotta be similar old people smell the same they do do they not what is the smell you know the smell smells like mothballs it smells like a decaying corpse it's still alive I don't know what the fuck the smell is bro I'm just being real the same call fake as fuck where does it come from like like sure that because they're dying okay yeah almost time it is what it is man I'm fucking asshole it is what it is so what age does that kick in when I think it starts a little bit at a time I think when you get to like a certain point of life where things start going backwards that's when it starts like I probably start I'm probably starting to get a little of it like my fucking hairs turn to gray like I'm fucking like you know I'll probably walking around people get it like a little tiny bitty with a mothball like what the fuck was that but a stats can be yeah yeah mothballs and but a stats can pretty sure pretty pretty soon we're like an afghan robe we're gonna say it like you just wake up one day you got pockets just full of butterscotch candy he's like no oh man the fuckers are good though I'm very that's like a worters oh shit all right sorry guys we're back if you're still listening oh oh man look Jones advocating wait not for you for me oh all right which part the wake up the whole fuck all right all right oh that shit oh shit yeah you got me here am I so my back at baseline now one of them is down there on coon road oh man oh guys if you still listening let's uh worse I had I need a fucking noon slippery yeah oh my god dude all right there's something fuck around me all right so uh yes so Fauci said quote I would hope that if we get to the point that the volume of cases is such and organizations like the CDC recommends CDC does not mandate anything oh right so very interesting uh talk point on him but I gotta hold fucking I gotta hold rant about this whole thing yeah everybody goes as true all right keep going all right uh he's a CDC does not mandate anything but recommends that people were were masked I would hope that people abide by that recommendation and take into account the risk to themselves and their families Fauci told CNN Fauci who also served as the director of the National Institute of Alligy and infectious diseases at the National Institute of Health until December of 2022 also called into questioning a January 2023 Cochrane study that found mass to be ineffective right so quote when you're talking about the effect on the pandemic as a whole the data is less strong Fauci said but when you talk about an individual basis of someone protecting themselves there's no doubt that there's many studies that show that there is an advantage to mask now the Cochrane study that he's talking about it was been called the gold standard analysis where they analyze 78 different studies including over a million people um into whether a mask were effective or not and what they concluded um was insane they concluded that surgical masks the regular little face diapers that most people wear they only reduced your COVID risk by 5% okay and then they also concluded that the risk of wearing mask far outweighed any benefit because they brought them to the effect uh of the effects that they had on kids and children um and all of that that that that was insane um but I do want to bring something else another win I don't know if you got a chance to see it because it is fresh fresh off the press um this uh AP News article headline reads court revives doctors lawsuits saying FDA overstepped its authority with anti-Ivermectant campaign massive massive win on that fact where they concluded that uh basically the FDA is not doctors and they had no legal authority um to endorse uh denounce or advise is what the judge wrote on that um so anyway we got on this COVID 2.0 man I think it's a little bigger than what we're covering just here in the scope of this article because I can happen to catch a couple other points um we had yesterday the government of New Zealand on TV saying that they did not force anybody to take the vaccine and that it was voluntary so basically the guy gets up there and he's like yeah it was a hard time and there was a lot of pressure but there was no mandating of the vaccine it was your own decision and then today we actually had Trudeau come out and say the same thing they're all them okay right and then we also have Fauci come out and say the same thing so these are three of the main characters because New Zealand New Zealand had that A hern lady um remember just send to A hern who was and she resigned under the pressure of all this shit and remember she was laughing at everybody and she was on the she was on the podium and somebody asked her a question and they were like oh so you're saying that you know there's no freedom and this and that without the vaccine she's like yep and then she laughs right there's a clip we should find it and put it in the show for people to watch cabinet has decided today that vaccinations will be mandated for everyone who works in any workplace where a vaccine certificate is required for entry so you basically said this is going to be like almost like you probably don't see like this the two different classes of people if you're vaccinated or if you're unvaccinated you have all these rights if you are vaccinated that is what it is so yep yep you know it's interesting that within like 36 hours all these people came out and did that and I was thinking like why are they all coming out right now and saying that they didn't mandate the vaccine last time and they didn't they didn't uh mandate mask which we know to be false okay there's tons and tons and tons of organizations that literally fired millions of people because they wouldn't get the vaccine no all right both federal federal I mean it's been all over correct they're they're now they're pretending like they didn't do any of this and there's only one or two there's only two reasons I can think of as to why they would pretend they didn't do this one they feel like accountability is unavoidable okay which I don't think that they're there yet I don't think they believe that I actually think it's the second reason I'm about to say and I think the reason that they're all coming here and if you remember I said this a couple years ago or at least a year to a year and a half ago I said this about Trump I said they're going to use his fucking operation warp speed against him and I said eventually what's going to happen is they're going to start admitting that the vaccines are killing people and the vaccines are hurting people and then they're going to say well it's Trump's fault because he's the one that initiated operation warp speed which then put the vaccine out globally all right so what I see is some really bad chests drop it off the hill and this is why I said a year to a year and a half ago uh maybe we can find the clip even and let me tell you a DT this is what the fuck they're going to do to you when you go out there and you brag about this motherfucking vaccine they are going to use that against you they in that they are going to do it before primaries or before 24 but what they're going to do is they're going to pivot the narrative and put out the data of the actual vaccine injuries and then they're going to say Trump closed us down Trump ruined the economy Trump pushed the vaccine and he caused all this shit and unless he comes out right now and start preaching accountability for the people they're going to flip this narrative it will be pinned on him and will be fucked yeah this is why I said Trump has to come out and denounce the vaccine but he didn't and I said if he didn't this is what they would do and now they're doing it you know and that's what I see happening here these people this is not an accident that the New Zealand government comes out that uh Fauci comes out that uh Castro Jr comes out up there in Canada you know what I'm saying like it's not it's not an accident like this is it this is there's this is a coordinated move you see what I'm saying yeah well I couldn't think of this fucking name I gotta get you know brother that's good yeah you know what I'm talking about yeah it's fucking what's his name true though true though yeah um you know he the and I bet we're gonna have I bet I bet by tomorrow when this show airs I bet there's more world leaders that come out and say this and this seems like to me it feels like a coordinated move of exactly what I said was going to happen which was if Trump didn't back out the vaccine and tell people that he was pressured into pushing that everybody was scared that they would eventually then turn on him and try to blame it on him and bro it's funny you bring this up because a couple things here right like I was actually in the room when we had this conversation whether the Trump's close advisors I said this to his fucking team to their faces you know so like we know he then we know the message was received yeah release hope to you know um and listen Trump has the ego thing right like I mean he pushes it out he's very proud I get all of that stuff man but this is not that he's got that advice you want to listen Trump's very smart he's been around a long time he's much smarter than me he's got way more experience than me all right but he has bad advisors around him yeah he needs to get some other people around him that are smart yep that actually like aren't going to just say yes because they want to like get closer to him that are going to actually tell him the truth because I could have told him this fucking two years ago right you know and and by the way that's what I believe happened like a lot of people pin the operation worth speed on Trump and they say blah blah blah but if you remember how the media the environment there was he was trying to navigate through that situation and so there was immense amounts of pressure on him you know they're listen do you not remember the videos that they put out at the beginning of the shit where people were falling over dead and like they're walking down the street and all of a sudden they follow like the amount and the white suits come and yes yes and then you got to take in fact into into effect what we know now that he was surrounded by a bunch of people that were turning on him yeah which have now been exposed over the course of time and so when we look at like this whole thing of how operation warp speed came about he talks about that Trump talks about that like he he did not know that you know he didn't know who to trust he thought he could trust people and why he was in and now he knows he can but he knows who he can't trust I mean dude look I think his ass is in a sling on this thing because like dude there's people getting sick and there's people dying and there's people and he continues to say it was a great innovation and wasn't a great innovation bro it was a weapon that they strategically put out you bought it hook line a sinker and you're too proud to admit it and if you would just admit it and say they fuck and got me to then people would get behind you a little bit yeah but like dude this shit of coming out every every month saying it was a great uh innovate when when people's when there's a 40% all cause mortality rate increase right now 40% so like dude they're gonna blame that on him when it's funny say that because I mean I mean I feel like as a listener you guys are probably thinking well what's the point of blaming on him guys they don't want the dude to run and they're already spinning that up they're moving trying to get them out of this select they're not even trying to get them out of the election bro they're gonna kill the dude yeah they're they're they're they're moved on from persecution into how are we gonna remove this guy from the planet because they think if they cut the head of the snake off that all these people are just gonna go away when in reality what's going to happen is if they did do that a whole new group of leaders are gonna step in and there's gonna be a shit ton of them and these people are gonna be fucked yeah so yeah well quick just quickly on this headline what's your take on this uh FDA lawsuit case with the iVermekin shit I I think it's crimes against humanity dude yeah I mean we couldn't we couldn't get iVermekin intentionally and the reason that we couldn't get it is because if there was an effective therapeutic to this virus and it was known they couldn't declare a state of emergency if they couldn't declare a state of emergency they couldn't do all the stuff that they did shut down small business transfer of the wealth etc etc etc you know push forward uh the put see people a lot of people don't talk about what they did here too remember what they did with the prisons they let all the people out of the prisons okay because they wanted disorder and they wanted crime and they wanted and and now we have it all right so dude this is part of the crimes against humanity you know case and these people intentionally lie to us about effective therapeutics and because they intentionally lied because they wanted their funding because they wanted to transfer the wealth because they wanted the authoritarian control people died and they should be held accountable 100% man guys jumping on this conversation let us know in the comments what you guys think hashtag mask off bro half of the people listening to the show right now shamed other people for taking iVermekton yeah called them fucking horses and shit you know i'm saying yeah remember what they did a Joe Rogan yep brother to the point where they edited a video I just want to know where the line in the sand's gonna be yeah like what are they gonna have to do to get people like to like get the courage to stand the fuck up yeah like what is gonna be because dude what's gonna happen people don't understand there's a window where you can stand up and it's still easy to stop and the longer you let it go the stronger they get the weaker we get the harder it is to stop the more casualties the more pain the more the more frustration and destruction that we're gonna have to endure to fix it like if people would just use their voices right now we we would be able to stop this if they would just stand up right now and just be like good old-fashioned american fuck you i'm not doing this shit i'm not buying any of your stuff i'm not listening to you over here who has mental problems about how i need to raise my kids i'm not teaching my kids to cut off their dicks i'm not doing any of this shit fuck you and if america just did that as a whole the game would be over all they have to do is not comply to any of it no and just and just saying fuck you and then shame the fuck out of the people that go for it that's real shit yeah that's like they do to us because it works yep those people need to be put the work we're beat the the tail is wagging the dog most of society agrees that this is out of control and so we have a very small minority that's very loud who thinks they have the power and all it has to happen is the the dog has to turn around and bite the mother fucking flea that's on his tail you know what i'm saying like it's not that hard to understand these people are not in numbers they're not strong they're not they're they're weak and they're in slow numbers but if we get them to continue to have the momentum and the power that they're accumulating through social and we continue to give them the power they're gonna use it so american needs to get back to who they are dude which is you know fucking fuck you that's what shit man guys this is going to our third and final headline headline number three headline number three reads archives as joe biden baraka obama permission to release robbert peter's alias emails so this email scandals turned out to be a little bit different than what we thought it was and actually it's a lot more concerning um so let's dive into this this is a bright bar article reading the national archives acts permission from president joe biden and former president baraka obama if the agency can release joe biden's email alias emails and records according to the house oversight committee uh the committee requested the archives on august 17th this year to hand over all documents and communications in which then vice president joe biden you pseudonym such as robbert peter's robbert and where and jrb where uh the archives deadline to reply to the committee's request was august 31st now today and e september 4th right okay uh joe biden used three emails email alias is to share government information and discuss business with hunter biden and associate according to the southeastern legal foundation or sslf uh the archives reportedly possesses about 5400 emails and records related to the alias's uh quote today is the deadline for the national archives to produce the records related to the nvp joe biden pseudonym the oversight committee said thursday evening quote uh nara has informed us that the emails and records have been sent to representatives for former president Biden uh president obama and joe biden for their approval to be released quote given president biden's promise to be the most transparent administration in history we're calling on him to follow through with this and provide these records to the american people the committee added um now nara typically notifies current and former president to both requests for and propose disclosure of records of former president according to the agency quote the purpose of the notification is to give counsel on behalf of the incumbent president the right to assert apical um constitutionally based privileges to prohibit access to or release of presidential or vice presidential records although these records were for created by a prior president the incumbent president may believe that it is appropriate to assert executive privilege to bar the release of these records now got a bag up a little bit so lawmakers began scrutinizing joe biden's alias email addresses in twenty twenty one senator ron johnson out of was constant and senator chuck grassley out of Iowa authors of a twenty twenty senate report on the biden family issued letters to the white house and our requesting the content of email addresses on three separate occasions but the archive stone wall request okay and it wasn't just obama and it wasn't just biden they actually revealed that it was six obama administration officials that used the alias emails obama hillary holder lynch jackson and biden now i'm going to focus in on biden and hillary and joe obviously um but obama uses alias email addresses to communicate with the secretary of state two time failed presidential candidate hilly re clinton and political reported that 2016 joe biden robberpeters he was communicating about the rush of Ukraine stuff or about the Ukraine stuff about poor shinko and all of that you got hilly re clinton we know about her email scandals now why aren't they releasing these emails does it detail all the stuff about crossfire hurricane still dacier is this how they were communicating all those stuff outside of the in-person meetings which has been confirmed over and over again now my question is we have trump smug shot what is the gop doing that are these senators what are they doing they're being told not to do anything or they won't be able to get any money in their campaigns like is that worth more how this works dude that's how it works the these people are owned by private corporations and private donors who are telling them yeah make a ruckus but don't actually do anything or else we're not going to donate to your reelection campaign that's that's what's happening like do they not understand that they won't be a fucking reelection if this stuff continues they think that they will be on the inside of whatever happens like they're going to hold their seat yeah correct yeah they're they're going to be exempt from whatever happens this is a commentate of any corrupt government system that's existed forever and and what a historically the same thing happens to all of them eventually they all get killed all right because they stop representing the people they start representing themselves they start looking at themselves as above the people and eventually the people get tired of it and kill them and this has happened thousands of times across human history so they're belief that they believe that they're untouchable or they're on the inside or they're first of all they're not okay uh second of all uh they're really not because eventually people get tired of it and handle the business so I don't know you know one thing that I'm sick of which I think a lot of Americans are sick of is the whole little gang of Barack Obama Joe Biden Hillary Clinton this whole thing like these say it's the same people involved in all this shit you know what I'm saying yeah that's disrupting our lives we're never going to get these years back the time that's been wasted we're not getting back we're not getting back those two and a half years where they shut our country down your kids aren't getting it back you know like people don't think about that they think we're going to live forever and then they don't think about like what they're actually taking from us they're not just taking you know it's not just minor inconveniences they're taking a life from us over extended periods of time because of their lies and their corruption oh what do you mean the lockdown was only two yeah okay fine Hillary Clinton made up a document out of thin air that that made the media talk about this one issue Trump Russia collusion for seven years now all right she made it up and when we think about the arguments and we think about the disruption and we think about the division and we think about the lies and we think about all the things that have come from that one document in this country and how damaging it's been to society and there's no accountability for it no one thinks of the things in these terms dude you have to back up from the painting to see the full scale of what's going on and we're not getting back these years you know we're supposed to have peace prosperity we're supposed to be able to focus on our own lives and and work to achieve the at least have the opportunity to work to achieve the American dream peacefully with our we don't have peace in this country we've got division everywhere we go people are fucking assholes because these people have repeated people against each other for so long bro like when are we going to realize that it's this elite class of people that are literally ruining the American existence for all of us when we're supposed this is supposed to be the prime of my life and I have to come in here and talk about these fucking assholes you know what I'm saying like how like what how differently could your life have looked the last seven years yeah seven years dude and not only that we take the 10 years before that when we were dealing with the beginning stages of the demoralization process okay when they took out the the reality from society they took out the truth no dude they they started teaching kids that showing up was worthy of winning they started telling them it didn't matter what place you got they started telling them you could be a girl or a boy or whatever you wanted to be they start they remove skill sets from the educational process they remove the history of America the true history of America from the education process they they've created this scenario where they've literally demoralized our country completely so this wasn't just the last seven years it was the 15 years before that too where they removed the pledge of allegiance and they made everything offensive and they told you you couldn't say this and you couldn't say that and you can't talk about these things otherwise you'd be canceled all of those things take our peace from society and nobody talks about the quality of life that these people and they're greed and their power thirst has removed from our lives that will never get back we're so we should be able to have a very common sense America we should be able to have the for sake of a lack of a better terms the 2000 America without the corruption right the result of that corruption going on there too but like I'm talking about where people work culturally yes yeah like dude winnings great kicking ass is fun we celebrate winners we celebrate the American dream in order to win at the American dream it doesn't matter if you're black white yellow red or brown or whatever else if you work hard as fuck you're gonna have a shot at it etc etc etc etc etc and they removed all those things and created all this division in its place and that's caused us quality of life that we cannot get back how many arguments have you been in over this shit over the last 15 years no I'm being serious I'm just talking to everybody how many how many arguments how many times did you have to swallow shit from people who were totally full of shit who lack common sense who don't know reality and because on the news they're telling them they're right you've had to swallow it and just take it like dude we've all we're all in that position and I think fortunately I think people are getting tired of it they're at least starting to recognize it but dude it's time to restore America to what America is supposed to be land of the free home of the brave equal opportunity work hard celebrate winning winning is good try to get first place do the best you can be the best you can like be exceptional be in good shape live live a high standard life like these things that embody America treat people right help people you those things have to come back no and they got in the old here's the other thing people think that someone's going to come back and like wave the magic wand and these things are just gonna come back that's not how it comes back it comes back through your actions and through your life this is why I talk about all the time personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion the revolution that you're waiting for is inside of you and you're not living that revolution on a day by day basis and that's why no revolution culturally is occurring that's it you might do it on Sunday dude I'm just telling you that's it that is the only reason it's not occurring and it would occur very fast if everybody bought into it yeah that's some real shit man I think then just to add on to this point you know we talk about this impeachment process right because they try to play by the books but even with this man it's like McCarthy bro like what do you do it like what do you do and bro and like the thing is like they're talking about this impeachment he's saying that oh well you know to make sure to have a you know majority vote to push through the impeachment or to start the impeachment process right but here's the thing this bible autobioree this says eat so even if right so if the house were to move forward with opening an impeachment query in September or October for what it is worth the investigation would likely take months before any vote on articles of impeachment against Biden if such a vote ever comes that could mean an impeachment and a trial for Biden and the Senate Senate rules require a trial quickly after an impeachment is delivered from the house could come right before November 2024 election in the summer or fall this 2024 but how was this a year-long process when all of the facts when all of the stuff is out because they're not trying to do anything they're trying to appear to do things exactly that would tell you what people ain't gonna like this Biden's gonna win the election next time people don't get that because you guys are still being cowards and you're still being silent and you're still sitting on the sidelines and you're not understanding a very basic reality these people are out registering voters for this whole migrant crisis they're registering all those voters for Joe Biden when they do you know why Joe Biden stands up there and smirks when shit goes wrong because he knows it he knows it's in the fucking bag bro no matter he knows it okay these people are going to sit on 30 40 million mail-in votes before the election even starts all right and we have we have Republicans out here quote unquote conservatives who won't get off their ass and play the same game like every fucking person out here listening right now like you should be engaged in the process you should be registering people to vote you should volunteer your business you small business owners to be a place where people can register to vote go figure out how to do those things because dude I'm gonna tell you these people are going and by the way people say yeah they're cheating actually that's not cheating because it's actually allowed within the law the framework of the law in many states and because they're utilizing these techniques and the other team isn't they continue to lose so like dude until these people and the Republican party truly fucking start playing the game the right way they're playing with one or two arms high tie behind their back there's here as the way the way things sit right now even with the gigantic amount of momentum that Trump has these people are still gonna win because they're gonna have 40 million votes going in on the fucking first day they won't start counting till the week after and dude and nobody's doing anything about it that's real shit man you know it's it's gonna take people to get engaged and the reason nobody's doing anything about it bro is because half the people are afraid to stand up and say yeah I support Trump because they've been bullied so hard for supporting Trump and until you guys get over this and until you get over all this cowardice and this abuse that you've been doiled out by the other side of the aisle for the last 15 years and stand the fuck up and be proud and be unapologetic and stand up for what you believe until that happens we're gonna continue to lose and I can tell you this if we lose that election next year and then and Biden wins America as we know it and most of the world is probably done they're gonna try to confiscate the guns they're they're gonna do they're gonna do unfathomable acts of evil to the American people that resist them we're talking about jail we're talking about quarantine we're talking about possible execution we're talking about exile we're talking about complete removal of the opposition from society and that's not conspiracy theory these are Bolshevik communists these people have operated for a long time if you go read about Bolsheviks and look at what their standard mo is they remove the opposition the second that they get the power people who call for tolerance only like tolerance and call for tolerance until they're in control then they don't believe in tolerance anymore they believe in execution of their political opponents and what they're doing to Trump is just the very very very tiny tip of the iceberg they're going to come for every motherfucker that ever stood against them at scale so you should be worried and you should be nervous and you should be scared and it should scare your ass off the fucking couch and get engaged in doing the shit that's legal in your neighborhood to make sure that people are fucking voting to her shit man guys jumping on these comments hashtag emails let us know with that being said I was our third and final headline at this time as always for our final segment of the show thumbs up or dumbest fuck that's what we bring a headline in we talk about it and it'll get one of these two options so with that being said our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads Michigan police officer saves babies life during traffic stop I thought this was this was pretty fucking cool got a video for you bright bar articles diving to it during a traffic stop a Michigan police officer saved the life of a baby in a speeding Camaro who's not breathing the frantic driver of a Chevrolet Camaro was going between 75 and 80 miles per hour and a 45 mile per hour zone near 12 mile and shroner and Detroit Michigan on the way to the hospital the Detroit news reported here's the video from a local news affiliate police bodycam video showing the dramatic moments officers arrive on the scene to save the life of a child who wasn't breathing thanks for being here with us for the news at five I'm Kimberly Gill I'm Devon skill you and it all started with a Warren officer on patrol watching a Camaro fly past him and then things took a turn Sean lay live with a look at this newly released video but this officer knew what to do Sean video you need to see to believe where the camera is right now that's basically where the officer is approaching this driver the driver jumps right out you'll see this on video absolutely hysterical because inside is a baby boy about 18 months old he is not breathing as you say Devon the officer he stays calm you know it's exactly what to do it's all on camera the video is absolutely intense but the actual event was even more intense six o'clock Tuesday evening a Camaro flies by a Warren police officer that officer is on speed and distracted driving patrol but once he gets to that car everything changes and uncle and a mom of a baby boy they are panicking here's why the boy is not breathing he's turning blue that officer is Brandon Frazier with the uncle in his face the officer does not hesitate I look inside there's a child that's clearly having some kind of medical emergency hands and over to me a spit and I'll tape a saliva around his mouth looks like maybe choking put him on my forearm and administered a few back back blows to him had some saliva and I don't know what it was kind of regurgitate out onto my arm officer Frazier immediately got that boy breathing again here's how something vomit or flim from an illness was keeping him from breathing a few blows to the back and the boy was breathing again it was a big relief for sure when the child started breathing and you saw that color come back to round its lips you realize something something happened here and we're heading in the right direction back here live officer Frazier with those quick thinking actions tapping the boy on his back getting him breathing again the other Warren officers who rushed to the scene also they didn't hesitate doing the right thing putting the baby in a squad car getting the baby to the hospital within seconds right up the road guys were told that baby is okay tonight we're live and more and Sean lay local for back to you just incredible Sean we appreciate it yeah so he's been nominated for a life saving award by supervisors and yeah man this is the shit that should be shown about police when I saw this video and for those of you that are listening on audio the little boy and his family happened to be black the officer is white and when I see this video that's what America looks like to me America he didn't stop and look at the family and so it's a black family I'm not going to help him or vice versa like with shit is the fan bro here in America we got each other's backs and that's what the fuck we're supposed to be that's who we are in our hearts and this is the kind of shit that should be shown and I think we could all agree would we not watch the news and when we not care about what's going on if they actually told us the good shit that we did it was more of this yeah but they don't and and the thing is they don't tell us the good shit that they do because the good shit happens at a rate of a million to one of the bad shit you know what I'm saying so like dude we think about the message difference because I mean this is amazing obviously a thumbs up but think about the messaging difference that it would feel what would it would feel like in the world like what culture would feel like if instead of blowing up these big issues and politicizing them for a political reason for a vote okay instead they just told the truth about society like the actual truth this kind of stuff happens 50 fucking times a day bro with police officers across the country and never gets any attention see what I'm saying absolutely bro like dude like think of the anxiety think of the fear think of the frustration think of the division that these people have intentionally created in our culture for their benefit we the people have to get smarter we have to get over that and I think it's happening I think people are realizing that we don't all hate each other and these people are fucking all of us and I think the it's starting to click a little bit you know this should have happened in 2020 but the fact that it's starting to happen now is a good sign but I would like to live in America where these are the kinds of things that we get to see we get to see the heroic nature of the Americans we get to see them coming together we get to see people working together and like dude when I go out in public and I'm having a good time I'm not looking around to see who's black and who's white and who's Asian who I don't give a fuck do you give a fuck no I mean I might check from my wall of every now shut the fuck you know what I'm saying no real shit yeah nobody gives a fuck bro and that's everywhere like that's everywhere bro Americans are cool people and we've been made to hate each other for the benefit of these creepy old mouthball smelling motherfuckers for real that's real shit dude I'm sick of it and we should all be sick of it that's real man well yeah obviously thumbs up yeah that was amazing and he deserves every awardee you get I love that story absolutely man absolutely beautiful man
