and the paint like that I appreciate it though yeah man hey hey hey you want me to do it it's like holy shit they're going right out of the gates okay I have nothing to add to this guys if you don't know Andy Andy is an entrepreneur father former Navy seal adrenaline secosiest enthusiast yeah uh all around fucking badass dude man um what else what about that last part now it's take aggressively average in mediocre is what I aim for every day but yeah set the bar low trip underneath it most days and you're gonna be okay yeah that's about it it covers it all all right yeah well that's fair that's fair uh I like the comb over yeah that's a good look man what was this what was this picture that's a lot of hair gel that was actually taken in Singapore no shit yeah that was doing I was a keynote speaker for an Asia business summit for Barclays Bank of all things oh sweet man I can dress up okay sometimes it's a good look man there's also a long time ago I don't think I looked that young anymore so a little bit more gray hair yeah come over as a good look man I like it I wish I could do a better look yeah yeah that is better I think I was made I'll wear you in the picture I think 25 oh so 2000 I was 25 yeah what's going on here so the first deployment I did how can I impact this all right so there are east and west coast seal teams odd numbers are on the west even numbers are on the east internally inside of the seal community we would consider the conventional special operations you would call it the white side seal teams the black side of that would be the jaysock command commonly referred to or known as development group so I went through selection for that command in 2002 which anybody who knows anything about history knows that was very proximal to a huge event in the United States the invasion of Afghanistan one did that actually happen it was late in 2002 I was in training when that was happening and one of the tasks for that command was providing security for homicars I was the person with actually happening the picture is we're getting ready to leave and he was signing a piece of Afghan currency basically as a souvenir so they actually pulled us out of that selection process for that command a little bit early and surged us over there so we could it's called rip or relieve in place the squadron that was there so they could get back retrain refrit just takes refit takes some time off and yeah that was my first trip into Afghanistan deployment with that command it was post the assassination attempt so really we it was a security detail we hung out protected him when he was inside of the palace in the government office traveled around town and a little bit was not that long of period of time nothing happened while we were there but that's the tail end of that first deployment now are those grenades two different size fuck yeah what so tell me a lot of this hold on so I know that you have a grenade problem it's big and sometimes you have a grenade problem that's small you have to have the tools for the job so they're the minimum the different sizes I didn't either until I got over there and I saw that I was like I like to have options yeah and they're both equally ineffective that they look bigger in this picture than they did in person there one of them was very very tiny it would probably would have worked in a phone booth and the other one you know I wish grenades you know you watch any movie they pull the pen a lot of times I'd like to cook it off not a good idea because there's variation in the fuse and they throw it in this huge fireball goes off like a 55 gallon drum full of gas in real life it goes crack and a little bit of dust comes up so so you don't in the movies you you pull the pen in real life and let it go oh yeah yeah you don't fuck around no you don't cook those things off to go away to lose a hand huh they say that there's a three to five second fuse yeah how do I know if I have a three to five second it's pinhuck get behind something now you said you brought up in the movies dude and so I don't know much you know I never served and I don't know much about Navy seals and what's going on I got you know we got some mutual friends and stuff so I did some research um last night I watched these two documentaries on hopefully one was Charlie Sheen on Navy Seals and I wanted to get your take on which one of these is more accurate all right so we have under siege from Steven Seagull yep okay and we have Navy Seals from Charlie Sheen I'd say if you combine the two you have the entire career from a non-fiction perspective in the shell yeah I mean is this pretty accurate or uh no however the one in your right hand Navy Seals I probably watched that a hundred times before I joined I thought it was going to be very close to what the job was like it was nothing like that whatsoever and then under siege how Steven Seagull who is a ferocious piece of shit as a human being was able to actually continue to make I mean just do some research on his treatment of women and just start right there and I'll let you guys do your own research um how he was able to continue to make movies or even star in that role is just beyond me have you ever seen his like magic oh yes Confuse ship people send it to me every single what the fuck is that you know I don't actually it's it's made up yeah short answer you know when I watch those videos I'm more concerned with the person that is willingly pretending yeah then I am with him up there trying to do the bullshit too all the people that are bullshit too all the people in that room they know they're flying and falling down yeah do they go get cocktails afterwards and say hey that we all know this is fake right do they ever have a moment where they sit down and say hey that we like we agree this is bullshit but we're gonna participate anyway or do they actually believe that to me is so much more fascinating than like the master I always watch the people in the background never the master himself uh they're probably like dude you see that move Steve got me in yeah I saw that one thing her lock yeah he took it easy on me today yeah you could have fucking killed me yeah but then if they ever were to try it on anybody ever yeah what do you mean I can't block at knife by just turning my stomach and the guy fault like it's like an apology and they grabbed me here yeah I mean I don't know I actually think that it speaks to some people are so desperate desperate to be a part of a group of any kind that they will literally detach their cognitive reasoning ability to do so the value of being involved in that circle is more important than the reality of it yeah there's no there's no self identity or worth or a steam in those individuals yeah yeah for sure dude it's sad actually it is sad but also I drive an immense amount of entertainment from it so I support it's actually fun to watch that's not what's positive makes my business pretty amazing and then you're like but it's fake but still but yeah so when you so when you decided to become a Navy SEAL did you guys do like the golf cart polo shit has like that looked fun if you saw it in that movie we didn't do it unfortunately yeah because I figured that would be the reason to join what are those Andy are those what are those see what are those calls that one might be a blu-ray this is called a DVD DJ what is that so this is what we watched DJs only 27 years old 28 28 I know what a DVD is yeah but if you ever watch one yeah I've watched them okay I know what VHS is to you now you now don't go past that I don't know anything about blu-ray yeah I do blu-ray I know laser disk they're like a floppy disk no laser disk was like a DVD but it was like big like this like I know beta males well we all know that these days yeah that's a fucking fact yeah those are the two most common movies I actually get questions about though really yeah I wish that I wish the Navy SEALs one was real I went into the community thinking this was what it's gonna be like and uh no no dude I watched that movie in the theater when it came out Navy SEALs yeah good man yeah good man I I was I grew up wanting when I played golf that's all I ever did was play golf polo I would just drive the golf carts and hit the like at least one round of golf every single time a lot of country clubs don't like that no they don't yeah that's why I don't golf anymore yeah I was politely asked to knock them back anyway so dude what is this oh pick up the uh the elk the elk that is a big fucking oak dude that is a big elk um I'm a bow too what I'll say is this though depending on the angle that you take the picture from and I was with a very high level photographer they can make it look bigger than it is so that's actually sitting at the wall on a house photographer yeah it's it's you know they get the right angle they twist the antlers toward him that was at a DJ does a dick pics lighting matters I've been taking I can never shoot from below always shoot from the these guys number yeah um that is it a ranch in Utah it's a private ranch I was invited to go there I think that was the first or second year that I had ever bohunted and sick a paid for my opportunity to be there and that was actually on the last day on the last hunting opportunity and it was the most elk I've ever been around right before I shot that elk though I'll send you this video once I can get find it on my phone that thing walked in straight to me to three yards oh where I was sitting there and I hadn't drawn back I was legitimately wondering like what self defense situations would look like with an elk and then decided in that moment that I would kick the cameraman at it and then run the other guy legitimately sharing with you legitimately what I thought as it was coming there was a cameraman right I'm like okay this is what I'm gonna do he's gotta go I'm gonna sacrifice him for me afterwards there was no time in the moment this thing was coming in on a rope and it was scream and I'm fucking me or you bro yeah it's gonna be you it was coming in yeah and so I eventually just stood up because it saw us and then it backed off a bit and it bounded off and maybe stopped a 10 year I was able to stand up and shoot it this was 50 yards from where I shot it it's it was an intense experience you people hear the bugling of elk if you watch it on TV or on your phone it sounds amazing but when you're that close when it's reverberating inside of your body it was pretty intense it was awesome it's huge dude it was big I've never hunted before so I don't know anything about huh that would uh yeah I don't know if I would start people on a bow if they had never hunted it's a little bit more challenging and there's less tolerance for mistakes because you have to get so close I've shot a I've shot a bow quite a bit yeah it was never my honey combining the two is tough you have to get pretty close to animals rifles a buy you a little bit more uh space and you can you can make some more mistakes but it was wild I've hunted there since then and I've never had an experience like that one it's it was fantastic that's cool yeah how much how much meat comes off of me I'm like that oh man I would say you probably get somewhere between four to five hundred usable pounds of meat holy shit yeah so you got to like fucking give it away and stuff freezer full yeah well I am fortunate and I usually will get a couple elk elk tags per year which does not equate filling your freezer every time I think last year I had three elk tags and I got one elk yeah anytime I fill my freezer I immediately just start giving away to friends and family it is so good yeah I've had it a couple times the couple my buddies have have uh let me try elk before at their house it's good it's good I liked it a lot higher protein value than your normal meat you're gonna get at the supermarket and it's cool to tell a story to like when anytime I'm cooking for my kids or no we had elk lasagna the other night yeah and it's like oh I'm not going to eat dresses like hold on you little shit let me tell you the story about me carrying that out of my back that doesn't go in the garbage you're eating that right now I like that yeah that's fucking you mount this thing yes head only I have never been a huge fan of like the full body mount or some people take it down to right in front of the front shoulder um I'll actually like the euro mount so it actually gets skinned and caped and then um I think bleach so you just have the skull and then the antler where do you have that at that's it my house Montana okay yeah I showed a bowl there I was with Glover or mutual friend Glover two years ago he shot one uh one day I shot mine two days later and I have both of those up at the uh coffee shop oh that's yeah yeah and I point out to everybody if you notice one is slightly smaller mics obviously and then mind is the more regal elk on the right hand side yeah and I said just with the elks or is that like is that does that cross over to everything else I mean he's Asian I'm fucking love bro he's a fucking best fucking love best yeah dude so uh speaking of your coffee shop you have and super awesome black rifle coffee shop we have the only black rifle coffee shop in the state of Montana yeah so let's talk about that because that's in the fucking news right now you know I'm friends with the guys I don't know Evan but I know uh JT and Matt and they they're great dudes and uh I see them getting fucking attacked again over this act blue shit that has already been addressed like a thousand times yeah so can we get like to the bottom of this once and for all because like honestly I'm just tired of seeing like good people yeah be drugged out by people who are on the same team I mean we can try and here's what'll happen this that first came out I remember seeing it a few years ago and it seems to be on like a 12 month cycle where it pops up again so I don't even know where you start other than people think that the act blue platform is actually a political party in and of itself so I always start by letting people know it's actually just a payment processing platform yes it is dedicated towards causes that are on the democratic or left side of the aisle house but in and of itself it's very I guess it's probably not similar to PayPal it would be what would it be like maybe go fund me they take they strip a small portion of what you donate and then the rest of the money goes towards the cause that you wanted to go through so a few years ago the first time I had heard about it um Evan the founder of black rifle has made two donations that I'm aware of one of them he lost a bet so he donated I think it was 500 bucks to the Obama campaign and the other donation that he made was to Tulsi Gabbard because she is a personal friend of his in fellow veteran and we'll get Tulsi cool I haven't met her yet we've communicated I had a few opportunities to try to have her on my show and it just hasn't happened yet but she seems to be yeah she seems for as far as part of her on either but we talk we talk in the DMs and stuff and yeah she seems cool as fuck yeah and yeah so I'll come back to Evan's donations in a minute because I think it's important on how act blue actually works so what I have seen in the last few days is people are it's a very tightly cropped image of um and I it's a it might be an SEC filing it's it's something where it it's a searchable database and somebody at some point in time took a screenshot of the list of people who have donated and put in their employment black rifle coffee and there's actually two versions it says black rifle coffee and then underneath it says black rifle it doesn't have the image that I have seen circulated it doesn't have their names and so it's cropped and at least in my opinion in an attempt to make it look like black rifle coffee as a company is supporting democratic party right and that is the message that is being largely permeated throughout social media whatever news sources people may want and it's it's wildly inaccurate and as far as I can tell this latest round that has come out was actually started by a competitive coffee company two black rifle so it makes a little bit more sense as to why it's making the rounds again because anybody can go on there and so I get that because I was fucking around with act blue this morning two day in real time to try to understand what you can get around what you can do well how much can you play around with could you actually get a group of friends and utterly troll an individual or organization and the answer is you absolutely can but if you back off from that initial screen grab optic it would have the names if you went even farther than that it would have the amounts and some of those amounts are like two dollars and fifty cents you know one black rifle coffee as an organization and it says on act blue and all of this is self certified there's no team of wizards behind the curtain that we're verifying this information at least based on my own experience on the platform right before you hit pay there's like five little things and it says by submitting your payment and broadly describing what I saw this morning by submitting your payment you are you are agreeing to our terms of service you're saying you're an individual you're not this is your money you're not making a donation on behalf of an organization or a pact and there were two more and you click on it your money's gone and then you can show up on this database so black rifle coffee as an organization is not donating to the democratic party I'd also challenge anybody let's say every name that appears on that list is real and I think there's eight eight entries and some of them are repeat names I mean how many people do you have working for you what's your head count here for five hundred or five hundred in the office there's a zero percent chance they all have this homogenous idea of the world should be yeah and and their belief system whether that be religious personal you know spiritual economic all of those things I could give two shits if people inside a black rifle coffee employees donated money to the democratic party I don't give a shit one of the most beautiful things in our country that I appreciate is the ability for all of us to sit in this room have different beliefs and go live our life totally agree to the best of our ability now what's interesting about act blue and I'll get back to what I was talking about about Evan actually putting his name on there and black rifle coffee I went on there this morning and made a donation to a democratic senator I think it was in Montana it's like five or ten whole dollars I hope he saves a moose within or does something cool and it says employment and I put gray rifle coffee and what's your position head barista and I just hit donate and off it went and my point in saying all that is maybe just because you find it on the internet you shouldn't believe it yeah your fleet of employees we could task them with just crucifying any organization that would be considered on the conservative side of the house donation after donation after donation after donation you can put down there whatever you want yeah the fact that Evan put down black rifle coffee should show to people he doesn't give a fuck that they know he's donating that's right he does he's not trying to hide it he actually is you don't have to like this guy's a fucking idiot you don't have to put down any information if you don't want to he chose to put that there on a platform I assume at the time he knew would be searchable because it doesn't matter people just need to do their own research and just don't believe everything you see on the internet don't you think this lens is self to a bigger conversation about the responsibility we have as a culture to recognize cancel culture as a societal weapon for division meaning for the last 10 or so years the left has had a monopoly on cancel culture right pretty much if you didn't tell the line or you even spoke out of line there was very little tolerance for difference of opinion the exact opposite of what I think you and I share in common in terms of what we think the country should look like you might have differences in opinion but those are okay and we can talk about those things and as long as you're not stepping on my toes I'm not going to step on your toes and we're all going to get along and what I've seen and noticed is the cancel culture has shifted from the left to the right and I feel like a lot of people on the right are not understanding like because they've been abused for so long by the left they now have the power and that power is being wielded irresponsibly against people who for the most part have the same belief systems and believe in the same things that they do because you know they don't agree with every single detail someone says you know like we saw this a lot with like the Trump and DeSantis thing right all of these people want the same outcome but they're killing each other internally on the same team over you know get there yeah right exactly dude and so now we have a social power base that's over on the right side and at some my opinion at some point in time we've got to come to a realization that like this societal weapon because that's what it is cancel culture it is a weapon to make people fall in line with whatever the narrative whoever holds the power is we have to like understand that this is not good for the country in any way shape or form it's not good for us to try to hammer people and ruin their lives and get them fired and destroy their companies because they may have a different belief that we have even though the core belief system that we have is very much so aligned and when I look at this situation with the black rifle guys I see that because the people who are canceling them these people if you go look at every other single post that they talk about they're talking about the same shit that those guys believe in yeah you know so it's it's very frustrating to watch this happen and it would be nice if we could get to a point like and I don't know where the line is right like like when we see the anhyzer bush thing happen with Dylan Mulvaney like part of me is like okay well that was necessary as a show of force of hey we're not going to accept this in our culture but then it's like well how far do we take this do we take this to where we we do what they did you know what I'm saying yeah like what do you think I mean I think Bud Light is piss beer to begin with and it shouldn't have been consumed ever by anybody personal opinions don't come after me Bud Light lawyers I'm not a fan of your product I agree with you it's almost like you can't there's no way to be enough of the the thing that people think you are without getting attacked by some fringe element it just keeps going farther and farther and farther and farther yeah like we're talking when you're out there you know working out you know people have appropriated the term patriot yeah and it means it seems to mean two different things depending on what side of the political aisle that you are on and I hate that our country has almost been reduced to a binary left and right and everything is a bifurcation of that the cancel culture thing I agree it absolutely is a weapon and I hope that people can recognize that it's optional I mean there are egregious errors that I think are made by individuals and organizations sometime and I think one of the key things that's missing before people hop on that bandwagon with a vigor that is shocking is that how many of us would survive the lens and scrutiny of some of these people I am a galactic fuck up me too I have made so many mistakes and if all people got to see was mistake after mistake after mistake I wouldn't blame them yeah for canceling me but they're willing to use in a lens that they themselves couldn't survive and I'm not I'm not I don't say that to try to excuse behaviors from individuals or organizations it's just in this realization okay this is a weapon I do have a choice whether or not I can participate in this should I take a breath just educate myself a little bit more do I need to hop on this bad wagon there's another option too that's a quiet one just vote with your fucking wallet yeah you know you don't have to like throw gasoline on the fire if you don't like bud light which I advocate people not liking bud light because of the taste don't drink bud light yeah drink whatever they're of course light whatever their competition would be you know like vote with your wallet don't waste your time on social media don't virtue signal to me the things that you believe in because I have my own life to live and my own mistakes to make it's it's a fucking mess and I don't know where it goes especially when the the needle keeps going and going and going and going like what is patriotic enough at this point what does it mean to be a patriot like do you have to wear a certain color hat and say a certain color thing and I was certain bumper sticker if you don't have those things well fuck you you're not part of our group right I don't know where it goes yeah I don't know where it leads yeah I don't think it leads anywhere good no it doesn't I agree with you it's something that we have to come to terms with and be adults about and say hey what is this country supposed to actually be it's supposed to be free yeah now there are things that as a culture we're not going to accept we're not going to accept grown men uh shaking their dicks in front of kids at drag shows when they're three years old that's not that's not something that we're going to accept we're not going to accept men getting in a swimming pool or on a basketball court or in a volleyball game and beat the shit out of women that's not that's not acceptable but outside of those collective standards you know that harming people and that do dangerous things to other people's kids and other people's lives I mean really man we're supposed to kind of do our own thing here and live our own lives and like you know you don't have to like what everybody does I think that's a big common misconception about what freedom actually means you know freedom is it like you say it's not like it's not like a one-track narrow definition if you really want freedom that means you're going to have to have tolerance for some lifestyles that you don't necessarily want to live maybe it's essential that you don't like every idea that you are surrounded by yeah if you are only being told the things that you like by people that you agree with and again people who live your life however you want to I would be worried that I'm living inside of an echo chamber yeah that would concern me I'm not scared by ideas I'm not scared by people's thoughts I'm not scared by their voices I I like the fact and to me our country should be about okay you have an idea I have an idea you think my idea is shit I think your idea is shit let's pull them into the spotlight let's logically work our way through them and at the end of the day people can make their mind up offer that through an objective and logical discussion not me trying to weaponize something to shut down your voice or you weaponizing something to shut down my voice bring that shit out yeah talk about it do I think I think people are afraid of that though because I think most people's opinions because of social media they then that's right they don't have depth they they're not comfortable standing on defended huh they can't defend them no that's what I'm saying there's no mile wide and an inch deep yeah that's right they know everything but if you dig in they don't know like we see this in these little videos that you go on the street right like they go on the street and they say who you voting for oh I'm voting for Joe Biden why and then the shit that comes out of the racist yeah the shit that comes out of their mouth right after that is like comedy and that's what makes the clip because it exposes people for the lack of understanding of any of their ideas and I think the reason that we have such an aggressive you know shut up sit down take your business fuck you your fired type cultures because people just aren't capable of standing on their own opinions and and dude you the life you've led and the life I've led that's a necessity like we've had to lead people we've had to say no this is why I think this you know you can't build businesses you can't lead people you can't accomplish objectives without explaining hey this is I think this is a good idea and this is why I think it's a good idea and in your case the life you've led if you're not willing to hear the feedback fucking people get killed so there's real serious consequences to not thinking like that and I don't think that most people have that in their lives anymore you know they're just reading on the internet so shit and parroting it because it sounds good and you know they want to get a couple likes on the comment they make you know I'm very passionate about the things I believe but I don't arrive at those positions quickly right and I'm also completely open to telling people that I don't know yeah there is such a narrow bandwidth of I actually if I'm honestly assessing myself and how I feel I don't feel like I am an expert at anything there's a very narrow bandwidth of topics that are largely completely useless in society that I have a level of experience with that I feel very deeply about my opinion and where it came from and other than that I just try to sit back and take my time and educate myself and learn as much as possible I don't think there's any reward to having the fastest velocity to getting to an opinion I think it's more than anything it's there's the the risk in downside is like a hockey stick going up the faster you get to the spot I don't know when it became a faux pas to say I don't know or when somebody would come up to street with one of those cameras and ask me that and they ask me a question I would and I didn't know the answer I'd say to be honest with you I don't know enough about that to answer you yeah but I feel the same way and I think there's a lot of freedom and being able to say I don't know you know like you don't have to have the pressure on you you know you know we we talk a lot about this you know in our personal development shows you know I personally am of the opinion that a great leader will say that without reservation when it's true the best leaders that I have ever worked for I'll use an example of a commanding officer at a SEAL team so in the Navy they have end codes it's N1 through N9 and those are just the departments largely tranched out that would work for you probably similar to the infrastructure you guys have an N1 would be our admin N2 is intelligent and three is operations you have planning logistics all of those things we would do weekly meetings with the commanding officer the worst leaders that I've ever been around were the ones who tried to be the smartest person in every room that they went into the best leaders that I've ever been around were the ones who tried to staff the smartest people in each of those areas and then put them into a room and solicit for their feedback ask them questions and then make educated decisions no attempt to be the smartest person in the room they staffed their weaknesses yeah those are great leaders yeah yeah man I I think we're at a situation in culture where a lot of the lot of the false realities are going to crumble very soon I think they're crumbling now what does that look like though I don't know what do you think fuck if I know yeah I know what people are calling for you know they they're worried about a civil war and people ask me about civil war and I and I say that I'm not I'm not I don't think it's impossible I'm not truly worried about it because the the reality of executing warfare like that versus what people think it's going to be behind their computer screen just say they're a little bit different yeah nobody wants that I think if it were to kick off people might be a little hesitant to continue because of what it would require I don't think anybody out there really wants to go out and get into a gun fight with their neighbor yeah in their HOA cult attack like that's not what we're looking for here it's horrible it's horrendous and I and I don't want that for anybody so I don't know what it'll look like because again in a consequence free environment behind your screen you can say whatever you want and this is what's going to happen and this is what I'm going to do I don't know what it looks like I don't either man it's going to be interesting it you know I do think I do think that the woke the quote unquote woke progressive agenda is done it's losing steam at at the least yeah yeah I think the and I also I also think that's normal you know I I again at 46 years old I'm not going to even pretend to be an expert on all the generations that have come before me but I just talked into my dad and asking him about conversations he had had with his grandparents every generation of society had some weird pendulum swing that found its center again and then probably went back the other direction yeah so I think it's just kind of our natural way and I suspect that every generation is like that's it it's fucking over yeah we're never going to get through this one yeah yeah yeah it do it also does feel like to me though I feel like you know uh have you read that book the fourth turning no so there's a basically the theory is every 80 years there's basically a repeat of history right and you know and I agree with what you're saying the the pendulum goes back and forth and that's you know I'm around the same age as you I'm 44 and are in my life I've seen it go back and forth right and you have to and I the thing that concerns me is that I see it going further left yeah and then further right and at the end at some point in time over the course of history that usually ends with a genocide of some sort and so that's what scares me it's like you know when we were in the covid stuff and everything was going crazy you know there were no shortage of people who were on the covid ban wagon who were calling for the removal of somebody who wasn't vaccinated from society we had Justin Trudeau one of the worlds one of the leaders of the world I mean comically but he's the fucking main dude up there in Canada talking about hey we don't know what we what are we going to do with these people they're a danger to society they were building literal camps so like it concerns me when you go back and like look at the things that how they behave during that time and then like what's the result going to be now the other yeah dude and that's like that's kind of concerning what's a rubber band bro it's a rubber yeah you can only fucking stretch it so much before it snaps you know that's the unfortunate thing but but to your point Andy it's like most people are just not going to be prepared for that snap that's the reality of it's I don't know I don't know what that I don't even know yeah I don't even know if it can be avoided yeah well I think the the way to avoid it is by you know speaking some reasonable common sense shit on a regular basis well and you know also asking for accountability too right yeah I mean like that's the biggest part there was so much damage that was done I mean even just looking at the covids if there was so much damage that was done and caused at the hands of people who don't really have our interest and it's obvious everybody knows it right so a lot of people forget it and so you can't have the accountability aspect of it that will prevent that from happening again because the precedent has been set we've already shown that people are going to be mindless sheep that follow along with tyrannical rules and so it's like the only way to prevent prevent that from happening again is to hold those people accountable in our society but I don't know that enough organization organizers correct I'm telling the top of the top right like I mean I want the generals you know not the fucking front-mines soldiers right it would have been so much better during covid if they were less dogmatic and they and again it goes back to being able to say I don't know like if Fauci had gotten up and said maybe a couple times a week hey boys and girls yeah doesn't this suck dick yeah maybe don't use those words when you're announcing to the nation what is in girls yeah so sorry I apologize Fauci for recommending you open your speech with that let's go with your speech writers on that one but if they got up a couple times a week and said this is the best information we have at the time way that less dogmatic instead of telling people you have to do this or you're a threat to society or a piece of shit human being this is the best data we have at the time I think where they lost the plot is they kept going from dogmatic position to dogmatic position back and forth and back and forth and finally everybody not everybody but a large majority of people started saying you I can't tolerate this anymore you keep telling me you're an expert but you're flipping back and forth and then of course you know as time progresses on and you hear things like Fauci saying yeah I don't know where the six foot principle or rule you know or now it's been told nobody they had to wear my ass yeah and it's like I also have the internet sir and you know I would like to show you a few things or saying you know that the US doesn't fund gain a function research and it's very clear that the NIH was supporting through proxy entities what was going on in Wuhan and like it's insane but also at the same time a lot of countries were yeah I did a podcast specifically on the Wuhan lab and two Canada sent the Ebola virus to Wuhan on a commercial airliner for them to study and have Ebola in Wuhan but it's insane the level of interconnectivity that this stuff has and it's all shielded through this lens of being very dogmatic and being dishonest yeah that's what gets the array into snap I think in my in my opinion yeah people like you didn't tell me that you've last time I can clearly say like you're standing out there in the rain and you're telling the American public that it's sunny out I'm not going to listen to you right well take this up further at one point is a cross-align of like this was not just like all they messed up this was intentional like when like is that that's how I do I do 100% at least of COVID in and of itself 100% yeah I think it was 100% I think it was I think it was a complete intention like dude if you go back to that time right like if we could just fucking like getting a fucking time machine you go back to that time do you have one look at I mean I wish I was gonna say let's go for a spin we can't go that we can't go far back like too far back okay yeah 1970s let's have right there but dude it's I mean like dude they were showing clips on mainstream media of people falling out in the streets right like or or the the the fucking refrigerated trailers that they were using for mass graves and to hold all these bodies and pictures and videos of body bags on the street right and there was such a simultaneous push from every place every single government in the world every single media outlet it was all simultaneous all at the same time right and you know I mean 10 4 had or not I mean the evidence the stuff is out there right event 201 you go back and look like this stuff was planned and so like when it when does it cross that threshold of hey this was hey we just fucked up if it was an operation they fucked up though because I think what they actually showed people is that they need to think for themselves if something like this happens in the future as opposed to demanding and immediate compliance if it wasn't operation to see how far they could push it I think they fucked up I think it I think the operation wasn't just to see how far they could push it I think the objective I am of the opinion that we are in the midst of a coordinated communist revolution subversion in this country and when I look at COVID and I like zoom out and I look at it and I I felt this way while I was going on but we're a few years removed from it now and I look at what the actual result was what was the result well we had the biggest well transfer in the history of mankind and it didn't go from rich to middle class it went from middle class to already ultra rich they closed the stores they closed the restaurant 70% of business yeah a lot of those businesses do where I live there is a main street how fuck it's actually called main street too yeah there are just thinking about that it's like some of a bitch I'm probably a main street in every town but where I live is maybe got a population of 30,000 yeah what was able to stay open Walmart Home Depot yeah there was some gas stations what closed and are still empty pockmarks down main street we're small businesses that's right that's right and and I believe that was intentional and I because when when we look at like what the world economic forum wrote in COVID-19 the great reset and what Klaus Schwab pretzels these guys talk about they talk about you will own nothing and you will be happy and when we look at like how blackrock and some of these huge funds are buying up all the residential property it's very clear that there was preference given to the already ultra rich and so what I see how I see what happened they scared everybody they created massive division they created massive confusion it helped their cause for the election it put Trump in a spot where it was zero win there was zero way he could win that scenario the pressure if people people like to talk all this shit on Trump and I'm not some kind of idolizer of Donald Trump I'm just being real if you're the president of the United States and you have every single advisor around you including you know the media fucking everybody saying this is the worst thing and you don't do anything about it you lose okay now and because he did something about it now he's getting that held against them too so there was they put him in a no win but the biggest play that I saw was the was the division and then also the transfer of wealth and when you look at like what communism is all about it's about the consolidation of ownership at the very very top and nothing for everybody else and the promise is always you guys at the bottom we're gonna take care of you and it's gonna be a utopia and you don't have to work and we can do all and it's never works out that way you end up killing those people and so when I look at COVID I see a and then if we look at like the border situation and what's happening and all of these things happening in in one big play you know it's I believe it's in the intentional third worldization of the United States for the benefit of the global elite and that's that's how I that's the perspective I've seen it from the whole time now could I be wrong sure could could I be hypervigilant on it maybe but it seems to be that from my perspective thoughts are connecting yeah dude and and and it's gonna be you know I don't think people are with it anymore so it's gonna be real interesting what I you know we talked about this out in the gym earlier you know what it's going to be like from here moving forward because I believe these people have committed what I would consider crimes against humanity at scale at global scale and I believe that they understand that if they lose control they're probably gonna get held accountable and if you have someone who's back is in the wall a in that situation you have to ask yourself if you were them what would you be willing to do to maintain power and the answer is anything yeah and that's what gets me real nervous about what's going on in society especially for the next you know eight months or whatever we've got it to go until you know to that yeah so so I mean I would agree with you if your hypothesis is correct I would agree that those are absolutely crimes against humanity what would be what would be the steps that you would take to course correct that um this what do I think should be should be done what I do what can we do to yeah what can we do to change the trajectory that we're on well what I would do if it were me is probably not what anybody else would do oh tell me yeah um yeah what what I would do is I would get some 14 to 16 foot poles and I would put them in the white house front lawn and I would decapitate all the organizers of this of this play all of them and I would put their heads on the stakes and I would let their stakes I would let those stakes stay there for the next hundred years and I would remind everybody what happens to people who do things like this to regular citizens that's what I would personally do and I know that's crazy but it's a non-conventional for sure a little flag the impaler you know saying but tyrants don't stop themselves do they don't and tyranny never stops themselves these people believe that we are peasants and that that we should be subservient to them we are too stupid to live our own lives they believe that we they they have the right to take all of our money and oppress all of us and you know do all kinds of shit to make our life difficult and if we ever truly want to have freedom those people have to be held accountable and not just held accountable held accountable in a way that sends a signal for the next 200 years that hey man if you do shit like this and you start to like fuck with people's the people their country and their livelihood and all this shit and you get to a point bro this is the end of what you're going to face and if we're being honest this is what's happened in history over and over and over again and that's how this shit is stopped so you know I know that's an extreme example but that's not what I would do what I think likely could happen is that it could take 10 years and these people get prosecuted and they get you know put in prison when they're 90 you know I don't know have you ever seen the execution video of Nikolai to Chescue from Mania I'll do this it's a chilling video I don't generally look for execution videos well yeah it's not like I mean I mean I said no show it no but so so Nikolai to Chescue he was the uh you know the dictator right it was a communist installation of Romani at the time and there was a revolution the people turned on them right and him and his wife they were court martial and they were sentenced to death by fire and squad and as they're carrying you know like you know grabbing this man taking them out to the wall he is still in the tyrant mindset like he is still saying like you know like how are you guys doing I am you leading even the wife like they believe their own power and it was like it's a it's a very shocking video to watch man because it's like even at the the end of a barrel you're still holding on to that power tyrants will not release that stuff themselves you know and so I don't I think it's dangerous but I think there's the accountability piece man well the problem is bro is I feel like they'll do that to us you know like when you look at like what they've created with the domestic terrorism list are you in that about you know I haven't checked it oh yeah I give you a free reply yeah I don't know what date is this episode come out I might be yeah no shit no shit I just I just look at you know they they're taking the the you know I don't know what we you know I call it patriotic um but guys like you okay guys like me guys who have you know uh believe the same core beliefs that we believe about America um who they've always promoted as like the American standard sort of thing you know what I mean and they've taken these people and they put them on domestic terrorists and they've villainized them and they said it's the biggest threat to the country and all this shit fucking 10 years ago bro it was fly your flags support these you know what I'm saying so when I look at what's happening dude I it makes me super nervous dude I got nervous during covid I was like fuck these people win they're gonna kill all of us like and and that's what makes me real nervous about what's going on I'm nervous about this year's election cycle I think we have to restructure some things in government otherwise and I'm not an expert on government but I worry that our current system may no longer be tenable yeah like we have to have turn limits yeah we have to have single issue bill voting as opposed to these fucking 1000 page documents bills oh my god and the people will tell you like I read nothing in this yeah you know maybe at best they have an AI program now they can spit out talking points yeah um I don't think they should be able to buy uh stock while they are in office yeah um I mean those three right there lobbying should be illegal yeah the those four right there would have a huge impact on the direction and a lot of the stuff that we're talking about it you can't make a career in politics which I don't think politics was ever supposed to be a cause supposed to be service I think you serve that's why they yeah you know the founding fathers were seems like they're pretty damn smart I don't know if they could forecast the country growing to this size I I bet you they didn't even consider somebody being in politics for longer in their life than they have been out of it I thought no why would they do that they would go back and be a farmer or whatever it is so it's it makes sense to me that the document is incomplete hence we have the ability to amend it I don't I think though I'm worried that if we don't modify some of those things that the train may be too far down the track to turn around and I don't know what that looks like either yeah yeah I I share those same concerns yeah I think those rules that those four rules and I think you know there's a couple others that would that would be useful but um it's against the interest of those in power to implement those for sure and that's and that's the issue yeah like dude there's other things that we could do in society that would fix society you know like for example you know there's there's there these people are lawyers right they're all in law and a big problem in society and culture right now is false accusations um you know frivolous suits like the the the law fair that happens in this country um is insane and I think that in our legal system there should be some repercussion where like for example you know there's clearly a double standard that women can accuse men of doing things and they don't have to be true for the man to suffer the consequences of the accusation so like if a woman were to accuse a man of abuse or rape and even if he didn't do it he loses his job he loses his friends he loses his reputation that's right it all it has to take his accusation so in situations like that there should be repercussions where the person who makes the accusation would serve the sentence if it ends up not being true or something like that there needs to be some sort of recourse for these frivolous accusations and frivolous lawsuits and because dude there's so much injustice done in that and then there's so much money lost in the in the business aspect dealing with things like this I mean you're in business I'm a business dude the amount of bullshit that it takes to run a business is insane it's almost not worth it and I think they want to make it not worth it so that they can consolidate even more of the business to their buddies you know the biggest places in the world the biggest guys in the world and you know and then we talk about taxes right like taxes is another reform that needs to happen the fact that you and him and me and everybody listening here when we add up all our taxes over the course of a year we work for the government more than we work for ourselves it's not just income tax it's sales tax it's property tax it's all this other shit tax when you buy tax when you sell if we add it all that up all of us are paying paying more to the government than what our government are than what we get to keep what does that make us that makes us tax slaves in our own country that's supposed to be the freest country in the world that that has to change and you know that I believe that the reason they make it that way is to financially oppress people for control reasons you know if people don't have financial resources and they're worried about making their ends meet it's very difficult for them to concentrate on what's being happening in Washington DC or what's happening in their local politics so if you create enough division enough hardship enough confusion enough anxiety enough stress it's really hard for the average person to get activated to pay attention what's happening in the country which it gives them free reign to do whatever they want yeah if you're trying to survive you're just trying to make it through the day that's what I'm saying so like you know we I get frustrated on the show because I'm like fuck guys we got to get engaged here we got to talk we got to get you know and but then I'm like fuck dude a lot of people are are like legit panicking because they can't fucking survive yeah you know and it's it sucks dude it's not how it should be and if all of us paid 10% tax all in how much different would the life of the the middle class person look like it'd be a massive difference dude be way better as a business owner dude that's what I'm saying and and and the the the socialists and the communist people they're like oh that's greed no it's not because you don't understand what it is to run a business if truly if I'm a greedy person then I'm going to want to create way more careers and way more jobs and way more shit and that's how it flows it flows down through the capitalist system and people don't talk about that you know like okay you know you would never reinvest that tax money into your business you would just keep it or you are you a fucking moron well if I'm as greedy as you say I am then why the fuck when I take that money and grow my business so I can make even more money and by the way during that I'm building thousands of careers for people they just don't understand the flow you know and it's again it's it's it's surface level talking points it's not yeah deep talking points at a younger age I didn't understand those things either yeah that's true yeah you like well that person has more than me I want what they have and it's not fair it's not fair yeah which is I've only found the fair in northern Iho and they have or in Iowa it has cotton candy in a miracle round you know I mean that's what the fucking fair actually it doesn't actually exist in real life it's one thing I've come to my 46 years everything is unfair yeah yeah I didn't understand it at a younger age I think a lot of those arguments when it comes to wealth and the development of wealth it's interesting I know people my personal life they started at one end of the spectrum and then actually went on an entrepreneurial journey like well this sucks why do I have to pay this yeah their ideas the story arc of their ideas naturally shifted over time yeah so there is an as well as a saying experience saying about that it's it's if you're if you're young and you're conservative then you don't have a heart but if you're old and you're liberal then you don't have a brain yeah yeah and that's that's fucking true like that yeah it's true man it's true anyway that's the longest intro we ever did for the show fucking love we're 56 in yeah is that good that's great yeah I like it I like it when uh get to get yeah I guess we're in cruising now we go let's do it what he got let's get into it guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures headlines videos articles links go to any forseller.com you guys can find them link there I think set us into our first headline headline number one headline number one reads outraged American tiktokers hilariously vent their frustration to send it inches closer to banning the app with influences worrying they'll be they'll lose their jobs as creators and be forced to return to dread at nine to five jobs um so I believe it passed already uh it passed uh tiktok is gonna be forced to sail or relocate and become an American based company um but let's dive into this article a little bit so the stress of uh the stress is setting in for American tiktok influences who are taking to their favorite app to vent their frustration after the legislation that could ban the platform was passed in the house with overwhelming support on Wednesday content creators are now worried they could be forced to return to dread at nine to five careers the bill now hits to the senate uh hilarious memes also surfaced on tiktok Wednesday afternoon as users crack jokes about the potential ban of the platform that has more than a million of active users in the US this is uh here's one of the memes it came out uh says the US house is officially passed the build a ban tiktok of its uh if it's owner Chinese company bite dance refuses to sell the platform jen z on their way to storm the capital um god i love the internet sometimes and then that can be great you know for memes it's undefeated memes are probably the bro yeah real talk dude i'm here for the memes they're so good i'm talking like tears down my face laughing sometimes yeah yeah um so you know tiktok responded uh tiktok CEO tells users to protect the constitutional rights against the tiktok ban he actually really did this in the video um but he's uh he said over the last quote over the last few years we have invested to keep your data safe and our platform free from outside manipulation we have uh committed that we will continue to do so now this legislation of sign into law will lead to a ban of tiktok in the united states chew claim in the video he says quote we will not stop fighting and advocating for you we will continue to do all we can including exercising our legal rights to protect this amazing platform that we have built with you chew told users quote we we believe we can overcome this together now so this is all going did you guys see what rumble did no you can see it either no oh shit this is a first what happened oh i was just gonna take this in real quick yeah well i got to talk to you everything man but like i got to do too i am i'm gonna be like it doesn't happen i got to fuck this so this is what it feels like yeah yeah this is what it feels like to be on your game congratulations so uh so so in a very interesting move rumble uh comes out and uh they said they'll buy fucking tiktok uh the setla of its controversial free speech site rumble wants to buy an operate tiktok in the us to stop congress from banning chinese own apt uh so the uh an american company has offered to buy tiktok to prevent the chinese owned app from a nationwide ban a letter from rumble CEO Chris Pavloski is uh surfaced on the company's twitter page Tuesday declaring his online video platform is ready to quote acquire an operate tiktok in the us this is a letter that came from him i believe this was released on Tuesday i believe Tuesday uh yes or Tuesday um since then the stocks are doing great um it looks like it's trending um there's no news if uh uh and then what what he said in the letter to to be to be uh very you know very real here you know he says uh rumble's offer uh rumbles offer to serve as a partner to a contortium to acquire an operate tiktok is subject to the negotiation of definitive agreement so um they could be in talks it could not be in talks i don't know how that's gonna work out um rumble has been working on some cloud-based technology and um you know the all of the servers are here in the us and you know it is a platform that has historically been free of manipulation and um which you know that's what the twitter files and all that stuff exposed which you know like it's very easy to say that you know okay china's an enemy this is a chinese company has connections however you want to say it right but the fact that they're so vivid and controlling it is it really because of national security concerns right like is that really the reason or is it really because they have no control over it like they did with twitter and they can manipulate data and and narratives and they can manipulate through bots and they have no control over it you know you look at twitter before you on board it you look at you know meta right like our government administration our government agencies had their hands in all of these social media platforms to change things to alternatives or to get certain perceptions out there so i mean what is really the truth is if the truth that there is the national security concern or the truth is they just can't fucking cap in the ship you know i mean i think both could be true yeah i think you could you could make an argument for both being an issue i mean i can empathize for people worrying about their job being at risk i struggle to not laugh when i see a title outraged american tiktokers like that's i'm doing my best to not like laugh out loud of that one because there are people who are working in that but i mean how many of you know somebody who is a real estate agent at one time especially when the markets are going great and then it tanks and they have to figure out and evolve and figure out a different way to feed their family i have reinvented myself four or five times in my life post military i think it's okay if your income source has a potential threat to it evolve as a person read the train out in front of you and if you have to move along now i'm not saying i want that to happen to those people but welcome to fucking real life that's right you know welcome to fucking real life the business coffee shop business that i don't know the supplement business that you own we're a catastrophic world event away from that shit maybe not becoming relevant for guess whose problem that is if that happens that's my problem not somebody else's problem um you know people can research china and i and i think they should when it comes to chinese own companies in the tie to the chinese communist party what the communist party demands from those entities and organizations by dance i believe has a ccp member on their actual board itself um so i think there is potentially a national security threat there as well and i think it could equally be true that there's a less control for the people who are in power who would want to have the backside information to that i'm not a tech guy meaning i don't understand the mechanics and how all this shit works like i don't i can even imagine how much is required to keep a platform like instagram just certain like just all the other physical infrastructure pieces i feel like though that there are smart enough people in this world that could figure out a way if tiktok has got to continue to exist for some people let's find a way that it can exist outside of the control of the chinese own company you know i mean like i don't know create create another organization somewhere that meets the criteria for the us and hopefully still keeps it out of the reach of the u.s government entity i feel like there's a solution there you know i just i struggle thinking of things as a catastrophe when we're talking about being a content creator again i can empathize i don't want them to lose their job but welcome to the fucking real world yeah man you know as much as i share the opinion that uh social the world was better before social media and the internet uh when i say that people really get upset about it but it's the truth uh and we talked about this you know you and i are of the age where we lived enough of our life before and enough after i think have a valuable perspective to offer there if i wanted to talk i had to figure out where you lived yeah no shit somebody what your landline number was that your parents were probably gonna answer or walk over there and fucking knock on your talk not only that bro you had to be prepared for the real consequences yeah there's no consequences to fucking trolling you're talking shit anymore dude when i was growing up and when you were growing up if you talk the wrong shit you know what happened you had to stand on that and you get might get your ass beat you might get punched in the fucking face and you know what that's good for you sometimes because you know what it teaches you not to talk stupid shit all right and we have a whole culture of people who say whatever the fuck they want without any repercussions and then when you hold them to the fire they play victim and it's it's it that's how there's i could go on and on about this but the point is i believe that social media is fucking garbage all right and i believe the internet has made the world worse and i would gladly give that all up including all the success that is created for my personal brand my companies because i ran companies before the internet i know how to fucking run a company i'll go back to the way i did it before and we're fucking win that way so i'm not afraid of that and i would prefer that because then now i can actually do what you know business owners did back in the day they it got to be six o'clock at night they put the key in the door they locked the door they went to fuck home they could fucking chill they could have a conversation with their family spend time with their dogs or their kids or whatever they're into bro i don't have that luxury like that anymore that's i'm on the phone every day till five or till ten fucking eleven o'clock at night talking about fucking work bro because that's where the game has progressed to because of the available technology right it's like steroids and baseball like okay a couple guys start doing it then fuck a couple more guys then it's the way it is or you don't get paid and that's what's happened in business and entrepreneurship so for entrepreneurs now if you're not playing the game all the time you can't really be competitive because there's enough people that are doing that and i think that really fucks the quality of life of people and and families and i you know but it's the way it is so i'm i'm gonna win because i'm fucking winner but and baseball still being played yeah that's right the game still being played and i'm gonna play the game i'm gonna win the game but what you got to give to win the game because of the technology available is actually much more not less like what people think it is and i'm able to observe that and i don't think that's good i don't think that's a good thing um but getting to this specific topic you know when i first heard this i was like fucking good ban them all great but then i started hearing like what this was really about from some different perspectives uh i mentioned this uh uh linda from wake up from yeah wake up with linda uh her and i were talking about it and she was she was like no dude look this isn't about the chinese government this is about the control of the data and the sent their ability to censor a narrative because tiktok has woken up to what's going on so you know when we have the situation in on the internet where nobody's abiding by what the proposed ms m sm slash quote elite narrative is and everybody's like nah fuck this shit that's a big problem for these people so i've gone from you know seeing it as the china narrative that they said to seeing it as oh no this makes more sense they're afraid of everybody talking and this is the same reason they closed all the bars during covid because the seeds of revolution are sewn in taverns bro so when you have a public square that's not fucked with eventually people come to the realization of what the truth is and they can't have that so that's how i see this happening now which makes me say okay uh as much as i hate social media this should not be happening and yeah there needs to be a solution where it continues to operate and we continue we keep it from the american government doing the same thing that the chinese government's doing now there's got to be a text solution out there have you heard how tiktok is used differently in china that it is and he's like dude i've seen it like what they're out there they'll do they show it largely an educational tool yes dude they show they show fucking videos so like here dude it's it's it's act as absurd as possible and you get the most views okay there's a video of this person on the internet fucking rolling around and shit with a pig mask on and it's got like did i send you that that was you just go personal contacts oh shitha that was you shit there would i don't know it's hard to say there's a mask well the funny thing is i didn't mean for that to get that funny thing is i got to sent by all our mutual friends they all sent it to you cuz we all like fucked up shit yeah dude so fucking but dude this video's got like a hundred million views right well in china they got videos of the kids putting together Rubik's cubes that gets a hundred million views you know so we're talking about like uh uh uh i believe that that's an actual subversion technique that's happening i don't think it's accidental yeah no i don't think so no there's no way that's accidental and dude a lot of the fucking trans bulls shit that's happening in the world is pushed over here from china too it that some of the biggest trans donors of all just like George Soros does all this shit with the the prosecutors in every city there's three Chinese guys i don't have their names on top of my head these three dudes are donating billions of dollars to the trans organizations here in america and then the over in china they're fucking donating against those things so like what is that both sides of the chest dude what does that tell you if you just look at it like competition yeah that's the path that i would also take and dude does it make isn't that kind of weird how 20 years ago they started removing the ideals of competition from our youth remember like right after we graduated high school and the participation trophy started coming in and it was no longer like hey you got a work hard and win it was now like hey just show up that all comes from these motherfuckers so like we have to start recognizing these social initiatives that are actual cultural weapons against us you know things like they're it you know everybody wins uh you know removing the pledge religions from the from the schools uh you know cancel culture silent majority political correctness these are all weapons against culture here in america that do not exist over there or anywhere else yeah so here's the interesting thing on this topic though right so like you know you follow the money there's a lot of money coming from china going to Biden right a lot million since a millions of dollars right that should have already been been discovered the interesting thing here is how you know the the White House and Joe Biden they're saying that they're going to support this bill and support the band so it's like there's also going to be some implications here like okay well how does that take that relationship then because this would be a big spit in their face if you know saying you're fucking up their plans of you know however i mean could it be like all right we have a choice here um we can either do what china wants and lose because we're losing the narrative or we could try to save our own assets hmm see what i'm saying or i'm trying to jump ship well no dude look if the entire tiktok platform has woken up which i appears that it has that means their progressive narrative has fallen apart in in the in the gen z which is the main demographic so they have a choice the choice is either a piece china and let them continue to do this or guaranteed to lose the culture and probably lose their position of power and be held accountable so usually choices come down when they're hard to the lesser of two evils yeah and and that's what it seems like they're choosing that's that's how i see it yeah what do you think i agree what you're saying i could see again sometimes both think yeah right yeah yeah it's not always this or that's what i believe like it's binary like yeah maybe there's a shade of truth and all of that yeah maybe we're all idiots and we don't know what we're talking about that's i'm speaking for myself i thought definitely to that pocket but i know the money from china supporting Biden or any other political pants that shit doesn't surprise me at all it's a very odd relationship we have with that country in the first place they're one of our main trading partners but also portrayed as one of our main enemies right you look at the fentanyl crisis in the united states the precursor chemicals are clearly coming out of china being transported to mexico where they're being received by militarized chinese individuals are then being turned over to the cartel turned into fentanyl and then coming up through the southern border largely i know it comes in other ways and all over the united states we're feeling the impact of that where i live up in northwestern montana so it i wish i could say it was something that simple the the web yeah is fucking deep yeah you know from a money perspective to a trading partner to a global to what's going on in society i mean not an easy explanation exceeds my my iq for sure well i think i think also dude i think what's kind of funny about this though is that they they put that they put the effort into creating social media um to really help control the narrative and society and it's blowing up in their face that's fire completely yeah because they can't stop it yeah it's too fast that's fun yeah like little chaos yeah i like seeing them squat i like them seeing i like see i like when people do something to really like try and hurt someone else or or get an edge on someone else and then seeing it blow up in their face like that that's appropriate mainstream media sources probably don't enjoy the fact that people can be their own reporter as we fucking hate it they have they probably have to look at their revenue and the rate is all is based off of it yeah yeah they probably despise it at a very deep level yeah i was going to say it makes me appreciate it yeah yeah for sure well dude guys like you guys like me all these other guys out here doing that we are the media now you know i'm saying the media has been fractured into a thousand little pieces and we all have our own little communities that we speak to you know and like we said rogan's got a fucking ridiculously massive community but uh you know that's the media now like people don't trust msm like like they don't trust these you know plastic people on television anymore they want to they want to the and it also lends itself to business too who they want to buy from yeah you know what i'm saying like like do when we talk about black rifle and i see these guys i'm like you would rather you would rather buy what was you rather by folders you'd rather by folders from fucking uh the some of the biggest conglomerates in the world guys who don't give a fuck about you are you're you're but you're gonna drag these three dudes or four dudes who have built this amazing company you know what i'm saying like that doesn't make fucking sense bro and and we have we have a creator economy that's that's that's truly taking place where people are leaving and i actually think we're in the middle of an economic revolution as well with people's money people are starting to realize like hey dude i'm gonna buy from these guys because i fucking like that guy you know i'm saying i'm gonna buy from these guys because they're not those guys not these for origin is a good example of that bro yeah it's not as cheap as what you could get commercially made overseas but people are willing to get behind it and vote with their wallet yeah because of what it stands for beyond just the trans-assignment so yeah and how and dude you'd have to be a pretty fucked up human being to not like Pete Pete's an awesome man you know i'm saying he's a he's a great man his all the guys involved with that company are the same they're cut from the same cloth you know they sell a pair of jeans that's three times as expensive as any other pair of jeans but it'll last for 50 fucking years like they used to and your ass will look four times as good yeah well that's that's important throw that in the math now we're looking like reasonable yeah i'll spend a little extra money man my ass look good i need all the help i can get me too bro i wasn't blessed in the booty department either yeah me either you you got no booty no i got no ass well that's you got that's that's your right part right yeah that's what i'm saying yeah i just wish we were to touch the wallet part guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think what that means to us keep this cruise moving let's head over to headline number two headline number two reads west point removes duty honor country from its mission statement this is the interesting one let's dive into this a little bit this is a bright bar article reading west point superintendent army lieutenant general steve gilland on monday announced a new mission statement for the venerable institution the replaces the words duty honor country for the more generic quote army values uh so the west points previous mission statement was quote to educate train and inspire the core of cadets so that each graduate is a commissioned leader of character committed to the values of duty honor country and prepared for a career of professional excellence and service to the nation as an officer in the united states army the new statement says to build educate train and inspire the core of cadets to be commissioned leaders of character committed to the army values and ready for a lifetime professional excellence and service to the army and nation um so gilland indicated in a statement that he wanted to focus more on the quote mission essential task uh of quote build educate train and inspire versus duty honor country so he uh wrote a full message on the uh on the west points website uh says duty honor country it's foundational to the united states military academy's culture and will always remain our motto it defines who we are as an institution and as graduates of west point these three hollowed words are the hallmark of the cadet experience and bind the long gray line together across our great history our responsibility to produce leaders to fight and win on nation's wars require us to assess ourselves regularly thus over the past year and a half working with leaders from across west point and external stakeholders we reviewed our vision mission and strategy to serve this purpose we believe our mission bind the academy to the army uh the army in which our cadets will serve as a result of this assessment we recommend the following mission statement to our senior army leadership so um guys what do we got on this did they change it or do they just submit this as a recommendation oh it's changed go back once so the uh both the secretary of the army and army chief of staff they both approved the change as well uh go back to to which part uh right there yeah wow i had not heard that about this this happening i just saw this yesterday i had not heard that i don't know and again this is my own personal opinion i don't know if people realize how dangerous doing something like that is and the impact that it will have on the the young leaders coming forward into the military if you don't define your mission statement there's absolutely no way that people are going to understand what it is now the core values here at first form i through your four different locations but i've seen them yeah people have to know is is expected of them so they can perform those tasks right one of the things i see leaders making a mistake on all the time yeah my people are under performing like okay i'll go to one of their people hey can you define for me what your job is uh not really like i'll be right back yeah and then go talk to your boss because your fucking boss is doing a poor job of holding himself accountable to you you have to know what your job is before i can expect you to do it well you know the military is an extension and the action arm of united states form policy at the end of the day if you want to reduce it down to everything it's our ability to conduct and fight war to protect what we believe in in this country the duty on duty on our country you know it's always going to be a part of it but we're not going to say those things anymore and this is a little bit of an incomplete article because i bet you duty on our country is all over in west point it's on probably is i haven't been to west point but i bet you it's all over the walls there if they're going to leave that up on the wall that would be a very good thing um but they need to reinforce those things you know the core values are only as valuable as the people who read them and their understanding of it um and if you start taking away things like duty on our country and not that the other core values are bad you're going to shift you know you're you're modifying your inputs which is going to inform your output which are the young leaders in the united states army the army is a service branch that fucking fights on the ground anywhere that they are asked to go it's very different than the community that i came in in the navy um my job inside of the navy i expected direct combat engagement with our enemy because that was part of my job most people who join the navy whether they want to join for that or to avoid it they're not going to encounter that on a ship right not that you can't have naval warfare it would be tough in the modern era i think for that to kick off except for like another first world nation but if you join the army you can expect that your job is going to be a profession of arms you have to be treated like that at all times i look at this as a very and again i need to do some more research on this but i look at this just initially looking at that changing of the core values becoming a little more vague in the core values if you fuck with inputs you're going to get a different output i would ask them what is the output that they are looking for and is that actually going to serve the best interests of this country going for because changes like this they take time to it's like spinning the wheel on an aircraft carrier not that they're actually uh they're capable of being steered with the wheel but you could spin it and spin it and spin it and then much later the nose of the ship starts turning this is kind of the same thing this will take time for the nose to start turning but the same thing is true if you try to have to one stop that turn because the first thing that happens when you start spinning the wheel in the other direction is you actually stop the turn much later and then it starts coming back so this could have very very deep long-term value shifts and potential consequences inside of the military i mean in my mind if you look at any job what is the real world expectation of your job if the army the real world expectation is to conduct this nation's battles wherever they may be everything has to be reversed engineered from that it either enhances the soldier's ability on the battlefield or it needs to be stripped off and shitt can't or remodeled until you can show me that it helps enhance performance when you are being challenged with the standard that the real world is going to provide for you now anything outside of that is total bullshit in my opinion and we're talking about the leaders here like the future leaders are going to be leading correct again though that's you know the future leaders where they would truly get to that leadership position you start the academy that's this is like a 10 to 15 year fuse on this because that's how long it will take them to get into those senior officer leadership roles it's not something that'll shift overnight sure yeah i mean anyway you got on this you know my mind on when i see this and and i agree with everything that you're saying 100 percent about culture and how it changes and how you know it's it's like turning around an aircraft carrier i mean it takes forever right for sure it's a real process and when i look at this how how i see this like i have i have a my the way my mind works is i try to like zoom out and see like ask myself why why would you do this why why would you do this and when i think about that and then i see democratic senators talking about putting these military age males that are coming across the border into our military in as a way to gain citizenship and then we're talking about removing one of the core values that basically talks about loyalty to our country that's that's where my mind starts to go is is this something that they're doing to make the military more appealing and more compliant potentially towards taking action against our own citizens if need be that's what scares me that's where my mind goes automatically that is an interesting thought process because i've heard you know in talks of civil war people saying you know it's great you got a r 15 because the f-16 is going to smoke you right from a logistical perspective everybody listening write this down that's fucking true so yeah so or the predator reaper with the hellfire like don't shoot up at the sky at drones i've seen that done before it doesn't terminate well for the user uh it's an interesting thought process because my feeling has always been as as long as from everybody i've known in every branch of the military the last thing that they would ever do would be turn firepower on their civil citizens right it becomes a different value proposition when you talk about replacing those individuals joining with that different cohort it's uh i haven't spent much time thinking about that but it's an interesting point you know that but how many of those good people good hearted you know servicemen and women have they removed from service going back to the COVID error going back to the you know i'm saying so like yeah there was some i'm sure there's still a quite a few great i listen that's gonna be great people it's such a vast minority of our citizens i think it's at 0.05% right now of the u.s population is currently serving in the military it's super super small and it always has been i think six six percent was at the peak during someone near woe one and woe one two some of those people were not there voluntarily for credit right but that that's peak service six percent it were well underneath one percent right now so it's it's always been a minority but you know if it is that small of a number how much would you have to on board of people that's different saying that's what i'm saying and we have and i haven't thought about it a lot so it's an interesting point that you bring up yeah we have senators talking about it we say okay i'll put them bills yeah path to citizenship when i joined in 96 there was a path to citizenship for people who did join the military from like specifically i know the philippine so it's not a totally new concept yeah i think you're talking about no they're fast tracking this well it's also in that and if they are fast tracking it for that reasons it would be the weaponization of a policy that would again not short term but they can have some really dangerous long consequences yeah that's i'm i'm when i see what these people are doing and i'm of the opinion that between now and november they are going to try they just had a vote or a poll i can't remember if it was a poll or a vote but they not a single democrat in congress voted or pulled against the idea of not allowing these people to vote in the next election so the congress that exists right now is unanimous on the democratic side thinking that all of these people across the border should have a vote in this year's election that's worrisome okay do you think they're unanimous behind closed doors that's what i wonder do they actually i don't believe i think these people who want to hang on to power however i think a lot of them and i think they understand they've lost a lot of the minority vote that they have had without question for the last 40 years you know black america has woken up to this shit you know we have some of the biggest black voices in the world saying how i'm voting for fucking trump fuck these people and when i look at what's happening with the vote thing what would be the next step okay now these people can vote oh by the way if you want to fast track your citizenship join the military oh and by the way uh you're going to join the military and uh you know we got those domestic terrorists over there it was our old military and we got to take care of them because they're causing us fucking problems those people won't hesitate to do that so like yes people like you and your friends and the people that you were in the military with they would never do something like that and i always thought like i honestly up until covid i always felt like our military was a true line that would hold the line between uh the the government and the people and i always assume they would side with the people but when i watch what happened with covid and the amount of crazy shit that was happening i felt like there would be more leadership coming from that area of the of our the military saying hey we're not this is a right we're not going to do this uh when they're talking about building fema camps for fucking people who were unvaccinated that scared the fuck out of me dude yeah and uh and so you know i'm not sure i feel that our our military is is on the people side the way that they used to be because i feel like you know a lot of those people have retired or they have moved on and we have a different value system and and i don't i don't really know where we stand with that you know how long did it take for our law enforcement you know there was a few sheriff's offices across the country to finally stand up and say we're not arresting people for going outside without a mask bro like for months and months and months they were doing that and then eventually a couple sheriff's out in california said hey fuck this we're not doing that and then a few more joined in but i mean why did it go on that long you know why why were the riots allowed to go on the way that they were allowed to go on why why have these police officers and military not stood up and said hey this is not what the fuck we signed up for we signed up to protect the interest of our our citizens and we're not doing that and you know i'm not privy to the internal power flow of of those organizations and when i talk to the the guys you know behind closed doors they usually tell me they're like bro it's the leadership all the guys agree with what you're saying but it the leadership fucking and i'm like well uh there's a whole lot of you and not very many of them like can't you guys kind of get together and say that's called a mutiny sir i understand the ucmj i understand that however so it was violent year-old the dude yeah that's right man like there's i don't know i think this was more or less i'm a hyper vigilant person bro because like dude i grow up and i've grown up in business all right and in business if you're not hyper vigilant you fucking lose and so when i start to see a problem come up on the horizon i fucking crush it right like you'd be a little bit of problem like i just came out of a meeting right before i saw you today where like i could tell our standard on this one thing that we were doing was starting to slip and i went in there and said hey we're not fucking doing it until it's right and these these things are i'm used to like whacking the mole way out in front of the path and so like when i take my business mind and i apply it to what's going on i just see this could be really bad and that's where i that's just naturally how i think yeah i think i think bare minimum this is the moralization of our military which has been a constant thing right i got a constant thing from the the lgbt ship that's infested it uh you know these they thems in these high ranked you know positions in our military or you mean like showing all those officers cross dressing like in multiple pictures mask you see the the the pup mass general and the fucking cosplay pup mass thing you're guys internet search history might be a touch different than mine i did not see that dude i'm not doubting it yeah you know the one thing and i don't know if by design the u.s military was never supposed to stand between the government and the people uh there are actually you know passacometatist exists for exactly that reason because the military cannot be used in a policing capacity by doctrine there are more of like a weapons out external away from the shore you know what i mean it you didn't see that that's not real no that's fucking real the fuck that is real that is fucking real that is real and there's like more of them too no that's like as an as an official photo his military photo they got put out along with these here this is about what 18 months ago DJ uh yeah here's what i can say about the military you talk about you know devalue in the military for the last 10 years every branch of the military has fallen short of their recruiting goals except for the Marines and space force yeah there's a reason for it and i think it would be hard to say this is the reason i think it's easier to say things like this uh why is that ship blacked out notice how how uh oh so like uh i guess it's a big big circle but yeah i mean if i was going to do that i would use the biggest circle that i could find just a lot of people like why is it down rectangle yeah why is it down to your knees like that's just where it is so i have to use that circle uh there is nothing good in my opinion that can come from promoting that type of stuff in the military because again i look at the job that i held in the military if you reduce my job down in the military we needed to locate somebody who is likely to place where they felt the safest and arrive at their doorstep in their country in their village in their house at a time that is the least opportune for them everything that i do needs to be pointing towards that from a training equipping manpower logistics that's the that's my job everything that i do needs to make me better at that job highlighting people in pop masks especially if they're doing that from a professional perspective or getting behind that is a military writ large i don't there's no dots in my mind that connect one of those things to the other yeah but it can certainly detract because what if somebody who wanted to go down the path that i wanted to go down like i knew i wanted to be a seal since i was 11 years old and i didn't have the internet i had my father talking about his limited experiences well i had that which trust me by that time we were doing vhs and i think i ran the wheels out on that fucker like three times so you know of course back to blockbuster which you probably don't even i'm no blockbuster i still got some coins what i'm talking about but if you have ever been in one they're the best thing so i fucking struggle of not seeing behind the picture of the movie you want i'm pretty sure the movie there so you have to go to the turn in bin to see right because that's where the the good shit i do you're like looking through the slot yeah like you know through there yeah because if you see one in there you got to grab the lady and say hey can you give me that navy seals out of there and they're like fuck again so i did have that and i didn't have my dad i didn't i didn't know or meet a single seal before i joined because i didn't know a seal and i lived in Santa Cruz, California yeah so now though just using it through the lens of my own kids uh none of them have expressed the desire to go into the military which i'm fine with and i also would be fine with if they wanted to make that choice but let's say my oldest son was 11 and he had a phone and that's what's being portrayed to him as what the military is what they stand for what they do i would not you know as a parent if i was the sole point arguing against what he is seeing online like that it makes sense to me that the numbers are trending the way that they are that is not beneficial in my opinion to recruitment or the national defense yeah of our country let me actually this let me actually this because i know it's an oxymoron of uh you know military intelligence right but i know there's a lot of smart leadership so how could you be making these decisions willfully right with unless again there's some intentionality to it i would want to know where the decision was made just because you're a high ranking officer in the military admiral or general sure there are policy decisions that can be made above your head again it is your job to implement the foreign policy of the united states not create the foreign policy of the united states right trickles downhill you know so they have things that they can control and then they have things that they are dictated to do so what were you now now you were saying before we got into the putt mass thing that which is all i want to talk about you and i actually like one i got you i just ordered it so so um you were saying guns out yeah the military the role of the military yeah is basically it's a national defense tool it was never designed to be used internally to separate the people from the government right vice versa right just what happens if one happens so so what happens in a situation where let's say a whole bunch of people that are tired of what's going on decide that they want to do something out of the state and federal it would probably be a state and federal response but again you're going to run into the same problems because we're talking about neighbors right most law enforcement people live in the communities that they serve yeah so you know the civil war where the state and federal resources that are designed to respond and i don't i'm not an expert on the national guard i don't know their limitations and what they are authorized to do and not do i know they're often used in protest and this is is is is is remained at the state level most of the time so i'm saying so it would be it would be a more of a state and federal response and that is you know that's the people in your neighborhood potentially taking arms up against the people in your neighborhood because you're being directed to do so from higher i don't know what that would look like man yeah i don't want to see it either no i used to see it even i don't either civil war it's like shut the fuck up you don't even know what your ask brother i don't either at all but the problem that i see is you know we've got Joe Biden on record taking money from China we have our oil reserves being drained to the lowest strategic level ever ever we have you know a shit ton of our military assets left in Afghanistan we have multiple conflicts going on at the same time potentially with now the middle east we have this invasion happening at the border we have all of this crazy shit we have all of this nonsense far progressive ridiculous demoralization happening in our school systems and in culture and it all leads back to China and China has given this man a lot of money and the media is trying to cover that fact it's on fucking hunter Biden's laptop there's all kinds of evidence there's Tony Bobble in ski and all these other dudes coming out saying yeah they did do that and so at what point do we look and we say hey this is being intentionally done the the the destruction of this country or the third worldization of this country is being intentionally done by these people and at what point in time do the people who have taken an oath to protect the country say hey this is fucking wrong and we can't stand by and allow it to happen and that's that's where like you know where is that line I guess you know what i'm saying i do not know yeah i do not know yeah yeah i was jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments guys what you guys think with that being said let's keep this cruise moving headline number three god look at that outfit you know what i can say and dude we get you one wins or not on the right hand side oh god i need one actually yeah i'ma get you one yeah we're gonna roll around recruit people for revolution sweet oh we're we're we're two aviator helmet with goggles with that and probably like a askot yeah everybody will take a seriously probably would fighting right goodbye um head number three reads uh Georgia judge Scott McAfee dismisses three charges against Donald Trump uh this is just a little update been watching stuff going down in Georgia um it appears uh that there there may be some consequences coming out for uh Fanny Willis and uh her sexual escapades um with her lover um but yeah so so a couple of cases uh are starting to get dismissed a couple of charges are getting dismissed now um that stuff starting to roll down let's just you know skate this a little bit both county judge Scott McAfee on Wednesday dismissed three charges against former president Donald Trump and the election interference case in total uh dismissed charges include six counts in the indictment including three against Trump prosecutors can refile the quashed charges McAfee wrote in his order um Trump is still charged with more than half a dozen counts Trump was originally charged with thirteen total so um Trump faces a maximum of 76 and half years in state prison if convicted on each of the charges and consecutively enforced the associate at press reported uh the the ruling is a blow for Fulton County District Attorney Fanny Willis whose case has already been on shaky ground with an effort to have her removed from the prosecution over her romantic relationship with the colleague it's the first time charges in any of Trump's four criminal cases have been dismissed with the judge saying prosecutors failed to provide enough detail about the alleged crime uh the order comes ahead of McAfee's pending ruling on whether Fulton County prosecutor Fanny Willis will be removed from Trump case McAfee pledged on the radio last week the ruling would come this week at the end of the disqualification hearings McAfee told the court he would deliberate for two weeks the judge previously said Willis could be removed from the case uh which would hand a large victory to Trump um and so yes so three of those case uh charges were removed because they she didn't even specify what felony he violated or allegedly violated or committed um and of course we always got the race card being played um this how long reads race is an ever present source of tension in Trump Georgia case it's kind of bullshit nobody's buying that shit nobody's over it bro um there was a video I tried to pull it up it's like this black couple right because Georgia's uh in this specific area it's about about 50-50 almost right um but there was this uh this clip that's been going around viral it's like these uh two black young couple and they're asking them like you know okay well it's a BT interview right and they're asking they're asking them okay well who'd you vote for in 2008 right then the guy goes Obama Obama who 2012 Obama Obama 2016 he says Trump and his girlfriend says Biden or Hillary Clinton all right 2020 Trump uh Biden 2024 Trump she's like I'm going to go with Trump this whole racial narrative like it's over well I think I think a lot of black people you know I'm gonna go ahead and speak for all black yeah absolutely yeah because I have such experience yeah as a member as a member of the yeah I'm an honorary member of the end in in CAA yes right I'm an honorary member of the NCA that's correct so dude would we look man I think what's happening what I why I can observe is that a lot of black people in the United States are really fucking tired of being lumped in with this crazy race shit that because dude real talk uh most black people are just just like everybody else their normal motherfuckers they want to fucking make money they want to go out and uh live their lives they don't want to be fucked with they don't want crime they don't want high taxes uh they want to be treated normal you know and I feel like there's a you know this this racial tension a lot of of people are feeling it that are and they're like bro this isn't how we feel this is not what we think and they're getting they're finally getting vocal about it and you know what it's like bro you spoke out about this for a number of years and when you first started speaking out about it you were attacked very hard from the black community right oh bro I got my ass beat really oh bro uncle Tom you know yeah I mean you bro it was bad yeah and so that's kept a lot of black people from saying what they really think but I think finally they've caught enough they they're tired of the enough uh of getting lumped in with it so much that they're like no fuck this dude we're not like this you know and I think that's a beautiful thing you know um and that's what I see happening well yeah she's she's gonna go to jail huh she should she is going to go do have you been following this case down there a little bit you know I know that the legal system or I should say what's going on with Trump in the legal system it is very easy to develop an emotional reaction about it and I try to view this I I remind myself if it was me under this level of scrutiny or if I was charged with something like this what would I want to have happened I would want for people to not make up their mind until the system actually played itself out so that is what I try to tell myself because I do see this particular and this kind of speaks to the web is nation of law like you were talking about I do see that there is it seems to me that there's an essence of theater with this there's an essence of distraction with this and so I don't know what's true and what isn't and I think the safest thing for myself and for probably almost everybody is to sit back sit down take a breath don't say shit and let's let the system actually play itself out so I haven't been following it incredibly close because I quite frankly cannot determine who the fuck is telling the truth no shit and if I can't do that I'm actually not really interested in being deeply attached to it because I am then making what I think to be an objective logical decision off of potentially false information I think it's super dangerous to do that and I also I constantly go back to what if this was me I would hope that people would let the system play itself out before dragging me through the street corner well let's say if it was you and let's say for example do I get to be president first okay yeah for sure let's just say you're present sweet book deal all right do a library I want to I want to staff job here's your campaign picture yeah there you go like every time that picture I was just on the pvd podcast and so many people in the comments like what is that a fucking congressional poster I know I know it's like a red background oh shit people like are you running for office like no I swear to god I'm not it does look like a political photo yeah you take out the trees in the background and you make it like just a red or a blue picture which is seal bro it'd be awesome look tried on the pebble there you put me I'll be your I'll I'll come out I'll do what case secretary of treasury no no no bro I'm gonna come out I want to be the press secretary yeah can I be does anybody want that job holy fuck I want it I want to be I'll fucking destroy those people every single day I want to be your I would be the greatest press secretary ever they would actually not know how to deal with that that could be amazing for the short 10 year that I think you would hold the job I want to oversee your hood housing okay and food stamps and shape yeah I'm cutting all of it so basically you're gonna eliminate your own job yeah no my job I'll be fine oh we'll still need it we're just need enough fit to employ you right okay I got it so we're gonna say if it was me yeah so if it's you um and the question becomes okay we don't know who's telling the truth but if they're weaponizing the justice system and we can't trust the justice system then if we let it play out there's a good chance of injustice happening you know so like that's where my because it seems very obvious to me that you know when we look at let's say let's take St. Louis here right St. Louis had a George Soros funded prosecutor here who would not prosecute violent crime so in the black communities in St. Louis and St. Louis is always one or two in the murder capital of the United States these people were doing these violent crimes and literally spending an hour in jail being released and if you talk to the police officers here it demoralizes them they're like dude it doesn't matter if we arrest them because they get out in an hour all right so when we talk about the level of corruption that's happening in that situation and then we amplify that to let's say a case against a unpopular with the minority president like Donald Trump how how can we at this point in time how can we trust that the justice system is still just and that's where my concern because I agree with you like in most cases and the history of the United States of America that we both have grown up in I would at 1000% agree with that I'm like hey just let him let the court do their jobs but when I see for example this Trump situation where he's being forced to pay $300 or $400 million whatever ends up being to this woman in New York who has already very clearly said that he didn't actually do the things that she's the violent rape that the media is making it out to be these these think we start to see a level of corruption you know like Gagorian or whatever that guy's name is that judge he was laughing when he handed down that fine to Trump which is an unprecedented fine that's never been done in the history of fucking court so that's where my concern comes in it's like okay do we have it yeah has the tree been the tree of justice been poisoned to the point of that we can't let things play out because they're just going to throw people that they don't like and jail or find them or ruin them financially and we see case after case of this you know a lot of people not a lot of people but there's people out here who have swallowed this idea that Donald Trump has committed you know whatever they got 91 felonies or whatever right but they don't stop and ask okay are those real cases it because in their mind they're thinking like well of course yes just like number they were well no no like dude you got to remember like just like these people who who who were forced into getting the vaccine right and they were they were mad at the people who were trying to stop it they weren't mad at the people forcing them to get the vaccine they were mad at the people who were trying to get them not getting and now we have a situation where all kinds of people are having side effects there's all kinds of situations happening and those people are realizing that they got they're the victims of a of a of a play and when we look at the situation with Trump and we we see what's happening with all of these you know charges and things their their assumption just like during covid is there's no way the media would lie about all this shit there's no way doctor Fauci would lie about this thing there's no way every single media outlet is lying to us and it turns out guess what they were and so now we have a situation where the same people are falling for the same thing when it comes to the court system there's no way they would charge somebody with 91 felonies if it's not true right that's a reasonable I think that's reasonable to think and when we when we go back over the course of history you know if you would before covid I would have said all right they charges do with 91 felonies he probably did some shit right smoke there might be like that's that's what I would say but now after witnessing all of this I'm like well is there you know what I mean is this real stuff like what you know so like it's so hard to tell now it's dangerous too because you're talking about people losing faith in the foundational premises premise science that's what I'm saying dude whatever the word may be of the country but bro that's what the goal of communism is it's about the moralization and destabilization of the country so if we don't believe that our our media is telling the truth and we don't believe that our borders are secure and we don't believe that our court system is doing the right job then what do we actually have to believe in yeah you know and that's part of the globalization process globalization is about the removal of what is you know called nationalism but we call it here in America being a patriotic American you know and they're removing this and they're importing all these people that do not belong in our culture who don't have any affinity or loyalty or regard for our culture here in America and they're mixing that all in at the same time creating these doubts and these cracks and these questions about our fundamental basis of what this country really is and eventually it's going to get to a point if it continues where you know we're going to look at it and say this doesn't mean anything anymore and that's the scary part about it and so you know and and so like for a long time I've also and this kind of sort of answers my question about why nobody stepped in to fix this because it does seem like Trump is allowing it to play out and I think the reason that he's allowing it to play out I think he knows a lot of stuff obviously he knows a lot of shit we don't know I mean he's probably doing a lot of information this guy's not a fucking idiot he's he's a very successful man they make him out to be an idiot he's not a fucking idiot he's he's 80 years old bro he's been a very successful entrepreneur you take the shit that that somebody like me's learned in 25 years of being an entrepreneur and multiply that by double this guy is pretty fucking good at what he does he's a chess guy right and when we when I take that into consideration and I watch this play out it almost appears to me like it's he's allowing it to play out intentionally for the preservation of the structures that we're talking about so people could almost see going down your line of thoughts so people could see how far a strong system is going and then also it could be corrected and preserved after that you know what I mean so it doesn't burn all the way to the ground because like the minute the military steps in or the minute something happens all of that shit that's existed for 247 or eight years is over yeah we're gonna have to get the pen and paper out again right so it's it's it's just a very interesting time that's for sure what a time to be alive yeah guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think that being said man let's get to our final segment of the show as always like to do this a little bit called thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is what we bring a headline up and we give our opinion is it a thumbs up or is this dumb as fuck so for this episode's thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline headline reads New Jersey father arrested for barging into classroom to confront teen apologize to my daughter that's the headline got some man action here and let's dive into this and over protective New Jersey father has been arrested after he was caught on camera walking into a high school classroom to yell at a teenage boy and grab another student by the arm uh Aaron Thomas 38 was filmed entering the classroom at Paul's Burrow High School in Gloucestershire is that is that what is that the fuck is that what is that glasses glow chester county glass where the fuck is you don't where's the glass sister to each and there I think it's just Gloucester Gloucester yeah maybe the person wrote it left the h out you know Gloucester county on Monday yeah glad coma that's what it is yeah and glad coma county on Monday and demanding that a teenage boy apologize to his daughter quote you got a problem with my daughter he acts a teenager in the video posted to Instagram apologize to my daughter he demands the frightened child replies that he uh quote didn't do nothing to her but Thomas apparently did not accept that as an answer and his voice grew louder and more adamant quote you heard what the fuck I said apologize to my daughter now here's the clip she yeah so um Thomas was later arrested and charged with simple assault making terrorist threats trespassing and disorderly conduct he was released Tuesday until the child could be held on the charges but a judge ordered that he must have no contact with the students involved or their families and must maintain monthly contact with the court officials according to New Jersey advanced media meanwhile the 15-year-old boy who was confronted by Thomas was back in class Wednesday but was forced to leave after receiving anonymous threats on a cell phone his parents told New Jersey advanced media they condemned school officials for anonymous the anonymous they uh they condemned school officials for failing to swiftly respond as their son was being berated by the angry father um and they are considering uh considering pulling the boy out of the public school district but the son is quote totally distraught at the idea the parents also dismiss the notion the Thomas was simply trying to defend his daughter uh guys Andy what what what what did we got Andy and Andy what do we got on this I mean there's that's a no-in situation for that guy like I can totally empathize with being a father of a young daughter and you don't want the world interact with her in any way that would harm her but there is actually nothing good that could have come out of this to go into a public school everyone really bad surrounded by miners who have cell phones that had obviously made it onto social media the kid is obviously saying I didn't do anything and he's unwilling to do what you're telling him to do what's your next step pull your collar what's the escalation beyond that you're gonna start beating the shit out of a 15-year-old like apparently anonymous threats are going to continue yeah I mean if you actually want to have something done in this situation you go to the school administration as a parent and you deal with it through the school administration if you want to take it another level that I would not necessarily a van and some duck I was gonna go no big mares when I was growing up I've watched many of father beat the shit out of another father for something that their children had done that's right and I'm not advocating for that I'm just saying that's a more non-conferente or a non-traditional approach if you don't want to go to school method go talk to their parents but what you should never do as a fucking grown adult is go confront a miner and think that it's gonna go in your favor yeah because whatever I mean let's assume that it was a something verbal said and not like a horrendous sexual assault or assault of some kind if it was something that that person said there is no way that this ends other than something probably really bad happening to the parent and nothing happening to that kid so if that's what you're going for bon voyage if you actually want to have an impact on the situation I would take a different act I mean you know I've seen this happen growing up a number of times like the world's so different now I can remember things like this happening when I was growing up like like you know I've seen it happen yeah dude like I've seen I've seen I've seen I've seen I've seen parents show up at bus stop stops and shit in like choke kids I've seen like you know like me saying Lewis do yeah it's in California yeah dude and I know that sounds crazy but we live in a different time yeah and when we were growing up there was a place for I don't I don't know how to describe at minor violence like fucking like fist fighting and slapping people and shit there was just shit that happened that doesn't happen anymore that kind of kept society in line and I agree with you this guy this guy it's all downside this yes this guy grabs that kid he's in fucking jail right I think this guy and from the way that he was acting and and he seemed pretty serious about it and and I doubt that he's probably going to let it go so if I was this kid this kid's probably going to be looking over his shoulder for a while but my old I say all that to say this uh he's not going to win that way 100 percent it's a bad move at there's there's there's there's ways to handle things and then there's ways to not handle things and that's a way to not handle things and um but I'll say this too uh you know when people solve their differences with a simple fist fight uh the world was a better place and I'm not saying that a grown man should beat up a 15 year old kid I'm saying in general like swingers first listen do I don't know man like I think you're still fucked even though yeah yeah the jersey is a listen I don't think it's a 15 year old man no no I'm not saying that I'm just saying like general uh separate from this story you know the the real problem here is that there's no repercussions for any actions in society people can say whatever they want to anybody they can do whatever they want to anybody and as long as they don't touch them it's okay and bro that's that's a hard way to have a functioning society so now we have a bunch of little shitheads running around the country who think they're immune from any sort of repercussions at all and then when the repercussions happen they fucking play victim and it's like bro that's not how it works if you step on someone's toes you should expect them to stop on yours that's sort of the order amongst men that has existed for thousands of years and that's what's created a civil society I know I'm not gonna go fuck with Andy because if I fuck with Andy he's gonna fucking fuck with me back I don't want that so guess what how can we solve this without that you know what I mean and it creates a better it creates a better society when there is a little bit of fear for physical repercussions amongst men and that's and I also think it creates less violence because now when people go to violence they don't go to this fight they go to shooting people and stabbing people and do an extreme level shit because that's where the situation escalates to because there's not a simple intervention such as a this fight on the curb you know so and I know people when they hear that that's shocking to hear for a lot of younger people but the reality is is I've grown up in both situations and there was a lot more respect amongst men even young men and older men when there was a little bit of fear you watched a piece in cues that's right dude listen man I didn't I didn't want to have someone's dad up my ass when I was in fucking high school bro no like and that and and you thought about those things you're like fuck all right I'm at this guy's house his kids being a fucking fuck you know can I should I beat this kids ass well probably not because if I do his dad's gonna come downstairs and kick my ass you know like so we we there was a civility that was maintained through a respect and and the fear of some sort of physical repercussion and that doesn't exist anymore and so we have this social media world where everybody says whatever the fuck they want they get online they talk all this mad shit that they would never ever ever say if they were standing right in front of the person and then there's no repercussions of that so escalates and escalates and escalates and escalates and escalates and eventually dude people get sick of it and they snap and they're like fucking I'm gonna kill this motherfucker and they do and we see it every day so that's my take and I doubt will ever go back to those times but we need to it was better yeah that's my take I'm with it I'm with it I think I think he fucked up here bro and I think like this is not the way to handle it yeah I would have went to the father the kids father I'm going to I'm beating your ass well 100 percent I'll take those consequences yeah yeah I'm not gonna go fuck with the kid but yeah I'm gonna make sure I beat his ass in front of the kid I'm also doing that well and then actually you're saying you're next I'm your daddy now so so final thoughts thumbs up and dumb as fuck what we giving this I'm gonna dumb as fuck yeah I think he fucked up man man yeah I can I can understand his frustration and I I bet a lot of his I like I mean I get what he's trying to do I bet if we sat down with that man right here I bet his frustration would be exactly what I said dude these people say and do all this adult shit and they talk all this adult shit and they say all this shit and they forget that there's people in the real world that will fuck you up dude yeah yeah I say free my boy Aaron though I say for him yeah no jail for this guy I have no terroristic threats like come on come on yeah come on all right well cool well guys Andy Andy that's all I got well Andy I appreciate you coming on man yeah man that's wow we cover some ground yeah yeah that was awesome that was awesome guys I forgot to mention
