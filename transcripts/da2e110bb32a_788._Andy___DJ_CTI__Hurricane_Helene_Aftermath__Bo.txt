get it to our crews man let's get it to these headlines guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for sellin.com you guys can find them all link there headline number one I got to talk about the national story of the day right now going on um obviously there is a natural disaster that is happening in the country uh it's crazy it's horrible it's absolutely wild so i mean to ask for a residence battling apocalyptic aftermath of hurricane helan after deadly flooding and landslides now if you're listening to us on audio you might want to head over to youtube come check some of these images out um because man they're absolutely wild on the devastation and uh i mean do just the path of this thing it's why there's a thousand people missing right now yeah thousand people missing missing missing a hundred something dead a thousand people missing the entire community literally gone gone dude it's it's way worse i think than what people realize yeah and um of course we got to check in with what you know our leadership in this country in air quotes um has to say when they uh they they want to talk to Joe Biden about it Joe Biden uh the tellin reads Joe Biden tells Americans suffering in flood disaster zone no there won't be more resources coming we've given them all we have you know from a leadership standpoint great statement um after another uh devastating disaster hit the southern united states this week and the Biden Harris administration is nowhere to be found no they're they're found uh Biden's at his beach house and all in Kamala's in San Francisco raising money right yeah um but yeah so the south eastern united states was plunged into devastation after category four hurricane helan the strongest hurricane to ever strike florida's uh big bend region unleashed catastrophic destruction across six states helan's ferocious winds and torrential rains have claimed at least 95 lives left millions without power and trapped countless families and floodwaters particularly in north carolina were entire communities have been cut off from vital sources um now Joe Biden was actually in air force one and a couple of journalists had an opportunity to speak with him um i believe it was unscripted and let's see what he had to say yes it's a tragedy matter fact for trying to get the exact number my team advisors on the ground and Florida right now there's a distinction between the numbers that femur's used and the ones that used by uh by the locals and so it's uh it really is amazing you saw the photographs it's stunning it's unbelievable but it really is so many so such a wide area i mean they've given them all of the all everything that we have around the ground with the head of time so we'll work them hard thank you for resources the federal government's keeping it going no we've given them we have to plan a significant amount of it even though they didn't ask for it had to had not a bad communicator dude i mean that's a very first of all those adjectives are like not the ones to use amazing stunning no it's fucking horrible terrible there's a thousand Americans missing and you guys are sending eight billion dollars do you crane two days ago three days ago and you said a hundred billion now is Ukraine sending us any of that money back to help these people right is China sending any money back to us is real is Israel sending any money back or are any of these countries sending us money to take care of our people just curious because i'm pretty sure they're not and i'm pretty sure these people hate america so much and hate americans so much that they'd rather send the money overseas so they can get their fucking cut of it than take care of people when they when they need it the most and that's what we're dealing with in this country the good thing is that i have seen an amazing response from american citizens i've seen people like my buddy Vinnie who's organizing all kinds of aid and people with personal helicopters flying in aid uh bro i saw a clip from this and you know you know how i feel about most of the media but i saw this guy from fox news who was on the ground and they were asking him for a report did you see this yeah bro you see it z-sharn it was awesome he this guy it was total respect to this man and you know how hard it is for me to say that about some of the media on a national level all right this guy says hey we're cutting a break i got to help this person and fucking took his shit off waited through the water up to his fucking head and pulled this woman out of her car and brought her back that's awesome bro it was one of the coolest things i've ever seen in my life and i've seen because people are sending me clips yeah i've seen hundreds of those things yeah but for a grown man in the media to put his shit down and say hey this is more important than that and sit dude it made almost makes me emotional bro because that's what america's what's happening there is what america's true colors are no one cares that you're black or white or this or that or democrat republican the good people of the world come together in times like this and as bad as it is and as horrible as it is and i think it's going to be one of the most horrible natural disasters that i've seen in my life with a thousand people missing um it shows it shows what we're made of here yeah and uh you know don't let these people make you think it's different bro it's always been that way america is a special place and when things get hard we put our differences aside we come together and we take care of each other and um as bad as this situation has been to watch uh that's been amazing to see yeah seeing people come to it makes me have hope for for what we really are all about here yeah well i mean and we have seen this before right i mean we've seen it in 2013 with hurricane Katrina was at 2008 one of that shit sorry 2005 yeah um yeah so we've seen that with hurricane Katrina even locally bro like i mean i wasn't alive for it but the great flood of 93 here in San Louis oh we were we were we were out of school when that happened and 93 we had some of the worst flooding i think in a hundred years here in st. Louis that we ever had a hundred year flood bro we were sandbagging we were 13 i was 12 13 years old we were out saying everybody was we didn't even go to school everybody was out participating and making sure that shit was good and you know as hard as it is to watch this you know i've talked to a lot of my friends on the ground you know there's people without power for two three weeks is what they're saying without water for two three weeks um Jenna and Chris no water no power for like two weeks they told them but i mean some people bro they lost everything they they've lost everything imagine imagine you going out of the house and coming back and your shit is just gone your house is gone your pets are gone your business is gone it's fucking gone it's not like oh we got some damage like it's gone like bro that's that's nobody should have to go through that you know nobody should have to go and like the implications you know just like no look at a head man i mean we're what 36 days now yeah away from the election you know i'm saying like these are like i mean this the the effects of this is going to be definitely long-standing um there's going to be a lot lot to deal with here um for sure but i want to i want to bring up something too that that's that was interesting um especially with the timing of i guess the statement now you've set this plenty of times uh on record that something big is going to come right between now and the time of the election uh that you know some type of you know black flag event yeah you see we hear we hear Hillary Clinton said well that's interesting because i have it okay and i thought this just the timing of everything was a little weird to me yeah um not sure if you guys saw this but let's dive into this a little bit Hillary Clinton warns October surprise well up in election warns meaning it's not going to be good for them you know uh twice fell president your hopeful Hillary Clinton predicted and October surprise would up in the 2024 election during remarks for an episode of firing line show with uh Margaret Hoover which firing line show that's interesting it's so heard to be on it's interesting show maybe that's a little uh my shadowing yeah Margaret Hoover teed up Hillary Clinton by leaning into the idea that Hillary is just like Cassandra the Greek mythological figure who could see the future and the prophecies but was never believed uh let's check this clip out that sounds familiar that sounds fucking familiar i'm pretty sure i told everybody what was going to happen with the migrants four fucking years ago you know what i'm saying oh your conspiracy your racist okay anyway we'll see i can make a whole list of all the things that's for another time let's check this clip out you liken yourself to Cassandra the Greek mythological figure who could see the future and the prophecies but was never believed uh putting that Cassandra hat on for the moment but we're listening uh what is something you see happening in the near future that we should be taking more seriously well i do think that um the the press needs a consistent near i mean the the press that's not supporting trump blatantly very persistently the press that's trying to be the press be objective be you know reporting the facts um the press needs a consistent narrative about the danger that trump poses because you know people may still may still look at the dangers i don't care it doesn't it doesn't affect me i'm gonna vote for xy or z but okay but at least people need to be woken up and given the facts about what he has done is saying and would do and i anticipate that you know something will happen in october as it always does um you know the russians um as i said earlier are very active in this election um we know the Iranians are active uh as well chinese uses tiktok or they certainly did against biden and for trump i think they're a little less pro uh trump right now um so you look at where people get their information and they get their information largely from social media and so the campaign is doing the best job it can to combat combat both domestic and foreign uh faults uh disinformation but i anticipate there will be a full court press in october the the digital airwaves will be filled and why does that matter because the the press that is pro trump anyway oftentimes stories are put on digitally that then are picked up by let's say at fox and others and then those stories are stories so the mainstream press reports on them and so that story then takes on a life of its own there will be concerted efforts to distort and pervert comola heros who she is what she stands for what she's done i mean look i mean the the crazy story about me running a child trafficking operation out of a basement uh be pizzeria don't laugh don't laugh it was a huge story and it got one young man in north carolina to get in his car with his you know assault rifle and drive up to liberate these non-existent children and shoot up a pizzeria in washington dc this is dangerous stuff it starts online often on the dark web it migrates it's picked up by the pro trump media it's then reported on by everybody else which makes sure it has about a hundred percent coverage and people believe it so i don't know what it's going to be but it will be something and we'll have to work very very hard to make sure that it is exposed uh as uh the lie that it is okay so my migration is bad huh okay hold on i got a lot to say here do you have more after this or is that that i mean the only other thing out of that is that you know it appears as all where at least some funky business happening you know you got a t and t verizon they're having some national outages uh going on right now um and i don't know if that's a test of the uh okay so no other nothing else really no no all right look first of all you do you mean everything she said is what they do okay so everything she just said go back and listen to is what they have done for the last seven and a half years since 2016 and likely before that we just weren't aware of it when she talks about the kids being non-existent kid where where are all these missing children then okay i'm i'm not saying that you slaughtered them and ate them or whatever everybody else says but where are they and why is it swept under the rug i think people are starting to realize why is there a pro pedophilia narrative in the world she sat in front of a sign that said global initiative okay and this globalism which is communism in all of these countries that are supporting the world economic form there is pro pedophilia legislation being passed lowering the age of consent removing consent giving the child the right to consent at any age with an adult so you're telling me of an eight year old child if they say yeah it's okay to do that with the adult that that's okay that's what these people are saying globally now that's pushing for okay it hasn't happened here yet so pillory just explain all that to us like get up there and explain all that we you you say it's bullshit why is it bullshit we'll listen to that but up until this point of time you have not provided any solution or any correction or anything that makes sense all you've done is make a joke of it which is why people take it serious all right on top of that the Russians do you mean like how Russia interfered in the 2016 election and then Russia gate happened and all the sudden Trump was a Russian asset and then we found out that you actually made up the narrative yourself you paid for the narrative be created and it went everywhere like that narrative yeah you mean like that Russian narrative like do you really think that anybody outside your core supporters who will vote for them no matter what they aren't open to any sort of consideration or common sense or logic discussion it's all emotional it's all name calling and when people call you names bro they've lost the argument so when we talk about Russia being very active in this election are you talking about how they were active in the last election right that destroyed the last seven years of our coexistence here in this country because you personally have polarized people through various means and various causes because you personally are putting your wants and needs and dreams and desires above all the American people so is that what you're talking about you see what i'm saying so when we consider all the shit she just said what i hear is that we know some big news is about to break and it's totalized don't believe it that's what i heard her say which makes we think that it's 100% true just like you know when the hunter buying laptop story came out and it proved before the 2020 election to the point where a large percentage of democrats admitted post election that had they known about that they would have voted for Trump or not voted but it proved that Joe Biden was taking money pay for play that he was he was for sale for influence that you had hunter Biden doing all kinds of crazy shit in the name of his family not to mention you know all the stuff that's being talked about like the parties and the drugs and you know potentially speculatively underage girls all of these things got thrown out into the public and then none of the actual treasonous shit was covered you see what i'm saying so are we talking about that like you these people have done all of this shit period and when she talks about you know what trump has done and will do you guys forget that we are not total morons okay like we have four years of trump and most of the people the working class people the people who actually go out work hard whether they're just getting by or whether they're middle class or whether they're upper middle class or whether they're a small business entrepreneur that does well for themselves like i am we all did better on trump you you think you're going to convince us that it would it's been better so we know we already know what trump did during his first four years we also know what's happened the last four years we are very aware of it it's been the most chaotic the most drama filled the most divisive do we had literally our own government in the last four years creating list for patriotic americans people who for my whole entire life were celebrated as patrons people who fly american flags people who celebrate the holidays people who serve in our military people who generally just give a lot of fucks about america the people who we've been told the home of the brave the brave okay the people who have gone out those people by this government have been told to shut up or you will be on a terrorism list okay that's what we've been dealing with Hillary so fuck you how about that that's where i'm at with all of you and all of your shit and all of your people in your little cabal and all your relationships and all the establishment people who for years and years and years and years and years and years decades now you have put the american people last on your list of priorities we could be the wealthiest most successful country in the world meaning not just the people at the top i'm talking top to bottom our middle class could be so much better without these people interfering and they intentionally keep our middle and lower class people struggling and impoverished and handicapped financially oppressed financially and then divided by the media so that they can get what they want and that is not what this country is about it's not even close to what this country is about professional politicians hasn't even been a real thing in this country except the last 50 years it used to be that guys just like trump who were business people would take time away from their business to serve in our government because they care about all the people and we're getting back there that's a great thing but i promise you that whatever event she is talking about she already knows about it there's going to be a black swan major event between now and then that will disrupt everything and i when i say major event i'm thinking along the lines of nine eleven okay and what i think it could be and this is scared this is going to be scary to people but i actually think it could be shan ran talked about this on his show and i agree with them i think it could be a ten seven style attack where these these migrants bro they're not going anywhere like you don't understand there's 20 million migrants we're going off in another topic but people need to understand this math there's 20 million migrants most of which are military age males out of that 20 million there's 650,000 that have already committed violent crimes or rape all right we have about two million military and then we have another million 800,000 police okay so we have 3.8 million do you think that 20 million of all these military age males 80 percent of military age males do you think they're just going to say okay time to go back where i came from no so i believe we are going to have some major stuff here and i think it's very important that people prepare for it because they were talking on his show about being a ten seven style where these people are going door to door knocking down doors kicking doors down and killing American citizens and i i i could see that happening yeah it scares the it scares the shit out of me dude well i mean i'm not saying that to scare people but i think you need to really think about what's going on because the math doesn't math if those people decide that they want to stay and we got a problem dude a real problem no we know they have the means these people have already got their hands on weapons they've are like we know they can communicate because guess who they've been fucking phones right like we like they have the means are all they're like all of the fucking want writings are on the wall yeah it's definitely a realistic op a realistic possibility and these people did that intentionally well that's the other part like you you have this later in the show at all now we touch on migrants a little bit okay the point is is that these people did this intentionally right they did this intentionally and it's putting all america's lives at risk like if you're in the cities dude where this is happening you have to be prepared for what could happen yeah and i mean i mean you i don't mean just have guns and food and water i mean you have to mentally prepare yourself that you might have to take someone else's life to survive that is a mental conversation that every american male should be having right now yeah i mean even to the point on the iran thing that she brought up right like you know speaking of iran who gave them six billion dollars that started all of this bullshit in the middle east Biden you know what i'm saying like how does a country like iran's gdp literally doubles in the time of this man with an office went from a little bit of intentional you know what i'm saying it's like they they probably they they intentionally like do certain policies they intentionally cut certain deals that makes that shit even more of a possibility yeah and then act like they're completely on of course you know remember dude remember those stats that i just gave out the 650,000 criminals that are already here the most people think there's like eight million migrants there's like closer to 20 million and 80% of a military age males those are facts okay the real reporting that's coming out is reporting that those people who never presented with that data they watch like when she says oh the media that's pro there's only one media that's a that's big even that's pro Trump even at all kind of everybody else is way anti-Trump like let's not forget that and she's saying that those are the facts no and i don't think the fox tells all the facts either i think fox is biased the other way we have a bit our media is not media anymore it's propaganda all of it and proper once you open your eyes to the propaganda and you realize that it's not just media but it's also every song we hear every movie we see every show we watch it's worked into all this shit like i watched this movie over a weekend called civil war have you seen that movie bro i've never seen a more disgusting anti-Trump propaganda movie than that Trump support anti-Trump supporter no that's what i'm saying like they're they're the whole movie is basically they don't say it but Trump is in office and it causes civil war and blah blah blah okay like do you guys on the left realize what that would actually look like if that were to happen i mean have you seen your guys decide run down the street with the trash can lids and they're fucking pool noodles like if you see it it's not going to look like that movie like you think it is no okay and and it won't happen it's not something that's going to happen i think it could happen if they cheat again i think that could happen there's always some weird force yeah but like dude these people are lied to about Trump supporters bro they make us they make people think that they're all bigots they're all racist they're all from the country they all got fucked up teeth like bro if you watch that movie they'll never show you what they think of Trump they truly think man yeah and fact and you see it in the open the country yeah so got that wrong yeah i mean i'm just saying man like we got way too much of these people are causing normal people in everyday life who would generally get along and have civil discourse and just disagree to fucking hate each other yeah and bro that's not what america's about america's about what's happening in ashville right now nobody's stopping that person saying but like nobody stopping someone they're saving say who you vote for so happening so happening bro and people help each other and we got to all

here that is it no context nothing that was it yeah yeah we love it let's get back into this cruise man we got number two hello number two reads border patrol union calls comola Harris's Arizona visit a photo op so she I went down to AZ and I do the I want to I want to meet the person that is running their Twitter account and push out their statements for all this no no for for the border patrol bro I want to shake their hand bro they give two fucks yeah well they're tired of getting their ass beat for the last four years by these people well you know like bro ever think of the think of the hate they get yeah from people thinking it's them right and they're out here they're out here underman understaff underpaid trying to keep the border secure the best they can getting their fucking asses beat on behalf of these people and having to deal and like see and fucking do sometimes you got to stand up for yourself yeah man and I appreciate the fact that they do it yeah they're awesome bro yeah the official union of the US Border Patrol accused vice president comola Harris of using her first border visit in over three years as a photo op claiming that she just repeated the things that agents had already been saying so here's official tweet from the Border Patrol Union it reads quote vice president Harris has ignored the border problem she created for over three years she goes down there for 20 minutes for a photo op and decides to repeat some of the things the MPBC has said before but again where has she been for the last three and a half years I love it they go on the MBC vice president art del Quato made similar claims on his appearance on Fox News saying that Harris not even speak to any agents when she visited the US Mexico border in Douglas Arizona on Friday check this clip out look I stood with president Trump when he actually went to the border to areas that is you know notorious for drugs mumbling and human smuggling he stood there he spoke to the agents he's been speaking to the boots on the ground for over eight years he spoke into him asking what's going on he's gone through the national border patrol council numerous times he stood there for over an hour in over a hundred degree heat with victims of families of from illegal aliens and he spoke to reporters vice president Harris went down there and she spoke to two members of management she didn't speak to agents she spoke to two members of management and I'm going to tell you I bet money that even those two members I feel bad for them because I guarantee you they didn't even want to be there but she spoke to these two members of management and she was there for 20 minutes for a photo op that's all she did president Trump actually cares and he exactly grand downed her and met with boots on the ground and he's done it multiple times for long times at all every single time he's been there this is just nothing but a complete photo op that's all it is it's her hell marry before the election yeah calls her out and then she gets called out even more on Twitter because she posted a photo read this another photo op fake Kamala Harris pretends to be briefed on the hurricane helion damages but her earphones are not even attached to the phone no way oh well it's all smoke and mirrors so they posted this on Twitter the Kamala Harris campaign posted this picture on Twitter on Sunday where she pretended to be on the phone with FEMA discussing the damages from hurricane helion in the southern United States here is the picture she's acting like she's working so hard on a phone call and fucking earphones aren't well I mean look that could be speaker phone I've done that before I actually did that today leave the headphones in yeah I did that today real talk like I had to I was on the call all my phones because I used to wire headphones because I don't want them EMF things in my brain and uh dude they say you got to keep that phone in the terms and conditions on the apple phone it says you got to keep the phone five millimeters away from your body at all time really yeah otherwise it can like hurt you that's what that's what I now allegedly allegedly allegedly if you look in the terms and conditions it says that but anyway I was on the phone and I walked into Jason's office and I wanted to hear what was we were talking about because I was talking to one of our guys left my headphones in pulled it out put out speaker phone lay on the table so that could be that so you're voting for Kamala no basically is what you know but what I'm what I do think is weird is like how come they're trying to show this like this doesn't prove anything dude you you are not there Biden is not there nobody from your team is there and I believe Trump is there tomorrow okay he's enjoying today okay he's enjoying today well he's at astral today when the show airs um this isn't this isn't this isn't like a good look like if you're trying to really do PR uh she should be there on the ground it'd be great PR yeah but they're not going to do it because they don't care about people they don't care they care about themselves they don't care they see American people middle class and below or whatever you want to call it as less than I don't I don't understand they don't see the people as people bro they don't see lives that are less than their financial liking worth anything that's why they allow our cities to become what they've become that's why when these things happen they don't care they care about people who can do things for them and if you can't do things for them then you're a less than American a less than wife and we've heard them say this with their language over and over again I mean Hillary Clinton called Trump voters deplorable look how they showcase Trump voters look how they try to make them seem in propaganda they make them seem like they're a bunch of red net dumbasses when in reality dude everywhere you go there's people of all different cultures and uh religions and and ethnicities yeah and and intellects that vote for Trump because they're so obviously just shitty people well the other part you know just onto the same you know this the the border thing this immigration thing the illegal non-citizens okay people who should not be in this country um there's something interesting happened in Minneapolis I don't know if you saw uh read this headline Minneapolis wears in first non-US citizen as police officer we call this yeah we did we call this we say there's going to be a point there's gonna be a push where they try to solve their recruitment issues with these illegal immigrants where people who have no rights in this country will have the power to take yours yep we talked about that should be that should really bother people bro like like if they start allowing these people to have guns and authority it's their country bro they are illegal like listen and I want to make this like to do this so important to people I got to think people miss this right when people think about law enforcement they think about police officers right there is a tremendous amount of power a police officer has the ultimate right like we talk about the constitution again I think people brush over the shit man but like the rights that we have as citizens right are supposed to be protected by the government you're in a little you can't just take them you can't just take somebody's right freedom of speech they're not there to impose laws they're there to protect rights right now a police officer has the power based off of their word and their word alone to literally strip you of your rights of your right to leave to go about your business your freedom to just like they they literally have the power to remove a citizen's rights and they're giving this power to somebody who does not have those rights in the first place yeah bro this is this is beyond dangerous yeah and like there I don't see any logical reason why this would be a good idea well well they're trying to blame it on the recruitment issues which they caused okay they went around screaming defund the police for you know three years you know four years you know when they when George Floyd happened and we you know you and I said hey no we back these dudes how much backlash did we get all of it bro we're one of the only people that stood up for that shit these these police officers have been villainized in society's eyes all right so nobody wants to be a police officer anymore because they've they don't get paid enough okay let's just be real they just don't and I know most police officers don't do it for the money but they should get paid for the risks that they take they got families to fucking do listen they got to go out and put on a weapon every day and deal with people who are fucked up who are drunk who have in the worst day of their life usually when people do when police deal with these people that's one of the worst days of that person's life for one reason or another whether it's an accident or a crime or they're freaking out or domestic or whatever and police officers have to do that over and over again they deserve to have some of that money that we send over to all these causes okay that's my opinion I've been saying that for a long time now when these people when people when they start holding these police officers personally liable for someone claiming that they were injured by them or you know them arresting the wrong person the wrong way or somebody getting shot in an altercation where it's questionable and they make these people personally liable what not not all areas but in some areas they have a recruitment issue now because people like fuck dude I'm gonna get paid a little bit of money I'm gonna have to take all this risk and if I fuck up dude I'm gonna go jail okay so they've done that on purpose that is an intentional thing that they have done to create low recruitment issues so that they can do exactly this in society even the vaccine shit I mean fuck how many police departments were firing their fucking officers for not getting vaccines I know dude you know what I'm saying it's like you know yeah I bet you do got some recruitment issues yeah but the move is to go recruit non-citizens no the move is to fix the problem with the job pay them more create a situation where they're not held personally liable for things to go wrong during a normal course of policing okay there's all kinds of things they could do right to fix the job but they're not doing it since they have no dig on the police officers they can't fucking do it but no it's the people that are corrupt at the top that are saying hey let's do this and we can fill them with this and then we won't be we want to have a problem taking our guns are doing this and this and this right you know the reason they haven't taken our guns and ordered our guns to be confiscated is because they know that the everyday police officers not gonna fucking do that so who who could do that people who don't give a shit about American citizens or the laws or the culture or have any understanding of why we have guns in the first place it's insane man guys jumping on this conversation I don't know what you guys think down in the comments I would that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three thought this one was interesting we talk all the time about these people they are tyrants right it's how they talk it's the words they use and so I thought this was interesting to bring up not sure if you saw this one um scroll back up to New York New York City Mayor Eric Adam pledges to reign not resign as team files to dismiss charges but it was a very interesting choice of words yeah that's what I think too let's dive into this New York City Mayor Eric Adam spent Sunday praising God and pledging not to resign rather the democratic mayor under federal indictment for allegedly soliciting illegal campaign donations from foreign entities and falsifying paper trails to cover them up said he is quote going to reign according to the New York Post Adams spoke to the congregation of the Emanuel Presbyterian Reformed Church in the Bronx for about 30 minutes and refused to answer reporters questions afterward the post reports quote God placed me in this moment and placed in my heart to continue to move this city forward Adam said on Sunday quote and so you'll hear the small number of loud people saying but he should step down no I'm going to step up I'm not going to resign I'm not going to resign I'm going to reign now okay maybe you're just like in the heat of a speech you know I'm saying like it happens it happens all right but like that's a very interesting choice of word yeah that sounds like I'm going to rule over you and and that's it I'm going to continue to rule over you and there's nothing you could do about it yeah that's what it sounds so what I stole ten million dollars yeah well that's even if he did I still think this is retribution for him not going along with with the kabal and speaking too much on the that's what I'm in my relationship for sure um yeah so he filed a he seems filed a motion to dismiss the bribery charge from the federal indictment the charge accuses Adams of accepting luxury travel bribes in 2021 and 2022 in exchange for the New York City fire department to allow the 36th story to Kiwi center also known as the turcus house to go through despite fire safety concerns now he's back in court he's due back in court this Wednesday for conference before US district judge Dale Eho so we'll see what the host I mean see what judge hosts us and he's facing a lot of fucking time up to 45 years in prison at least found convicted now speaking of ruling and reigns and you know uh strikes and shutdowns and you know possible renegotiations did you hear about these renegotiations this is a big story that nobody's really talking about I think it's the timing of this is interesting as well the US port strikes have you been looking at this I've heard of it yeah I don't it's not good oh it's not good no and if they do the people doing it shouldn't do it you're gonna fuck the entire country dude it's it I mean I don't know what the I don't know much about it but I know yeah let's do let's do it the United States port strike by 45,000 dock workers is all but certain uh to begin at midnight all right this is an article from the AP uh saying that the union representing US dock workers has signaled that 45,000 members will walk off the job at midnight kicking off a massive strike likely to shut down ports across the east and golf coast now the coming work stoppage threatens to significantly snarled the nation's supply chain potentially leading to higher prices and delays for households and businesses if it drags on for weeks that's because the strike by members of the international Longshoreman's association could cause 36 ports which handle roughly half of the goods shipped into the into and out of the United States to shut out its operations ILA confirmed over the weekend that its members would hit the picket lines at 12 o 1 a.m. Tuesday on a Monday update the union continued to blame the United States maritime alliance which represents the ports for continuing to quote block the path toward agreement before the contract deadlines quote the ocean carriers represented by usmx want to enjoy rich billion dollar profits that they are making in 2024 while they offer ILA longshore workers an unacceptable wage package that we reject ILA said and they prepared statement uh quote ILA longshore workers deserve to be compensated for the important work they do keeping American comments moving and growing ILA also accused the shippers of quote gouging their customers with sizeable price increases for containers over recent weeks the union said that this will result an increased cost for American consumers the associated press reached out to usmx post person for comment they did not receive one now what they're saying all of our financial minds of the country are saying that this is probably going to cost about five billion dollars a day to our to our economy five billion a day all right um 36 ports yeah and what they're going to tell you that what they're going to do is they're going to tell you that you're getting gouged from the companies and the uh CEOs of companies and the owners of companies mid-size companies and and those people are gouging you at your prices in the grocery store at the gas station everywhere and you need to vote for Harris and Walls to make it better because greedy people are this is what they did last time this happened last time this happened if you remember it was I think 2020 or 2021 the same thing went down where all these ships set out in the ocean we weren't unable and then and then the news and our current political administration blamed it on entrepreneurs gouging prices which is total bullshit like people don't understand if your costs go up your price has to go up because you have all this overhead to pay for this goes back into what I was saying last week where they want to make the price of business so high that you have to unemploy layoff or fire your actual human capital so that you can adopt technology and those people will be jobless so that they can be dependent on the government forever and that is what they're trying to create here I don't know the the intimate details of this but this sounds like a piece in that dominoe play to me well I mean they've done it before I know and I don't know enough about the longshoreman's association or who runs it or how who makes those decisions but you know it feels that way yeah it feels like part of that play yeah yeah I do I mean listen I think right now to well I mean even with the hurricane shit like we have enough going on like you're talking about shutting down half of our fucking imports huh you know what I'm saying and so it's like I get the whole union thing I get the whole you know stem I get it we're in no fucking position to do this right now like no position at all you know and and and listen to this is dangerous man yeah there's a lot of things dangerous going on you know cancel cultures dangerous you know we have all these people wanting to cancel all these different companies all over the place for all these different things especially American companies you know I'm saying like when the when the AB thing happened I get it like people were pissed off but like bro those people that you're hurting are the drivers and the bar owners and the fucking the the your neighbors you know and we've got all these people riled up and all this cancel culture shit and dude all it does is hurt our own communities and our own people and um there's a lot of things dangerous going on you know political correctness not being able to speak your mind or have an opinion if you have anything to lose you can't say shit right well then how are the good ideas going to come from the smart people if the smart people who have shit to lose can't say anything how are they going to get involved what do you think like this is all preventive to keep the best and brightest out of the game and it's to keep every regular American that deserves the opportunity to build a good life you should be able to hold a regular job and afford a regular home that is consistent with that jobs pay scale like we have always had in this country we don't have that anymore bro no we they've created a scenario and they've lied to do it they've said hey look at that guy over there that guy's that guy's the wealthy guy he's the one that's cheating you when they do things like this and make it impossible for businesses and it trickles down and um you know people people unfortunately a lot of people just don't understand how shit actually works yeah man yeah man guys jump jumping on this conversation down to the comments let us know what you guys think man yeah bro it makes me nervous man for for for everybody everybody should be nervous about what's going on dude this is not right if you're young and this is your first time really paying attention what's going on you have to realize this is not how it's supposed to be it's not how it is what happened in 2020 was very abnormal what's happening now is very abnormal and what you're seeing in my opinion is the people who have controlled power for so long losing their grip on power and willing to literally flip the game table over so that they can maintain it and that's what makes me nervous I don't know what's going on with this I don't know the ins and outs but it feels like it's a part of the play to really hurt Americans make them weaker make them poorer and make them easier to control right before the election yeah and cause some serious pain to them and then these people could come out and say this is what your rich neighbor does he fucking hates you the you know all the people that create all the jobs you know I'm saying the people who sponsor your your t-ball team and your event and give you gift baskets for your church and your school and your auction and they do all this shit and then they convince everybody to cancel those fucking people how does that make sense how does that make sense okay we cannot survive with that attitude in America we need the attitude of what is going on in Asheville right now amongst the citizens everywhere we need to get together we need to unify we need to put all the bullshit aside and we need to figure out that we are under attack and being intentionally divided on racial lines on political lines on sexual orientation lines on every single fucking line socio economic lines that we can we are being divided intentionally so that we don't recognize and we spend all of our time arguing and all of our time bitching and all of our time yelling at this guy and that guy and that company in this person instead of recognizing what's truly happening which is we are being rained over by all of these people they have rained over us for years and years and years okay decades they are losing that control and they are looking to create as much dependence on them as possible which creates job security and that's happening in a number of different ways that's happening by intentionally printing all the money people don't understand this basic idea if you print more money that makes your money worthless they are stealing through inflation right so when they say oh we don't have any more resources to send to Asheville well what they are going to actually do instead of like pulling back all the money they sent to Ukraine they are just going to print more money which makes you poorer you see what I am saying so we are dealing with all these different tips and little strategic tricks and all these things they are doing which are basically creating a class of people that are always dependent on them and if you are dependent on the government to eat drink survive who are you going to vote for you are going to vote for the party that says hey personal responsibility handle your ship make good decisions and the opportunity is there are you going to vote for the people that quote unquote guarantee you a certain life see a lot of people don't like freedom because it means they have to make better decisions a lot of people don't want to go out and have personal responsibility because they know they don't have the ability to do that they don't want to do that freedom is not a completely adopted mentality by American citizens there is a lot of Americans that look at the government and they say the government's job is to provide for me that's not what this country is about that's not what it's ever been about but it's becoming that and the more it becomes that the more we move towards communism so you know I I could see it very clearly it just makes me and I also think this dude I think you know if you remember in 2020 you remember because we always talk about it Biden couldn't fill up a gym right they needed to close the world down and eliminate travel eliminate crowds eliminate all this stuff so that they didn't expose how bad Biden was this time around they're just keeping Kamala away from everything right pushing the social media correct influencers and right so if you remember the last 30 days and by the way they didn't care that there was 40 million people on the street during black lives matter all over the country and give a shit they acted like it didn't happen and COVID COVID was COVID news day away from that because that was about a just cause right we got to villainize the police the police are bad we got to defund them which creates a scenario we're dealing with now right so when you look at like what happened in 2020 where they didn't say anything about the black lives matter alley in terms of COVID being shut down they don't care bro it's not about the truth it's about what serves them and so when we look at you know the last 30 days before 2020 what did Trump do I was out every single day okay he was out every single day for the last 30 days with groups from 50,000 to 100,000 people every single day and what he was trying to do I believe now I didn't talk to him and tell me this but I believe he was trying to show actual visual representation of the support that he had versus the support that Biden had okay they don't want to show that they don't want to show apples to apples it's all a game of of you know deception it's the shell game look here not there and when we look at what Trump is doing now when he's at U F. C. and he's at Georgia Alabama and he's drawn a hundred thousand people to his speeches 75,000 people to other speeches and what are they drawing nothing of the sort okay and I think that the cultural difference is so different now because so many people are realizing what's going on that I think if they steal it this time they're gonna have a real problem on their hands because everybody sees it right so I mean it's not impossible to ignore it's not impossible I mean they're still putting her up there in the polls there's listen dude there's no way there's no way no way that the polls that she's leading in the polls or she's close in the polls there's no way bro she had a 27% approval rating before all this shit happened all the sudden everybody else just jumped on that's not happening dude this is all bullshit it's all theater and it's all a shell game to get people to think that she could potentially win with a cheat right when she does win they can say oh it was it was there it was a the most secure election in history that's what they said last time then if that's the case then why are all these why are we arguing about all these different things yeah why did Gavin Newsom just sign a bill into law uh today which would be yesterday today that you're hearing this that says you don't need an ID to vote why why we not have an ID to vote well the story they say is that our minority communities don't know how to get they don't have access to IDs to why not make a law making it easier to get IDs in why insult and tire minority populations by saying they can't get fucking IDs it can't use a computer you want to know who the racist motherfuckers are it's the people that tell you from the time that you're born that you are less than that the world's gonna discriminate against you that you're too dumb to use a computer get an ID so we got to make laws so that you can vote for us okay that's racism bro racism is also coming in every two years to communities and saying we're gonna get all this fixed we're gonna do all these things then they go up there they get the money they still have it the other people on the ground steal the other half and then they blame someone else that's racism they're okay with our minority communities getting totally destroyed as long as they can keep power in fact that's how they keep power so there's a lot of shit going on but dude I think a lot of people are seeing it I'm just gonna be smart yeah dude I think a lot of people are seeing it and what needs to happen you know I heard this stat we talked about this on the show but there are hundreds of thousands of hunters and gun owners and and officers and military they do not fucking vote they don't vote okay you guys who are out in the rural areas who say all
