City the star also noted Coons was shooting an AR 15 at the time and was the only person shooting when the injury occurred reporter KS HBTV's Ryan Gambua stood in place while Coons bandaged the wound with the election only two weeks away Coons had been stressing his military service as a way to appeal to voters and he has been running ads that show him shooting guns Coons supports at least one of Washington DC's Democrat central gun controls which is raising the minimum way age for gun purchases on the issues dot org reported that he wants to raise the age limit to purchase a gun from 18 to 21 in the state of Missouri all right now he posted on Twitter this is what he posted this was his post it's gotten over 14 million views I'm at the time recording he says says great day at the range

Americans and so this guy's on TV making fun of him saying Mark McCloskey if you apologize I'll give you a free weapons training class for me United States Marine then he shoots a steel target from ten yards away which anybody who shot a gun ever one time knows that you don't do that no that's not smart that's not that's not smart I mean then he's got Tanner rights sitting fucking ten yards back

these pictures articles links or videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can check them out there if you're listening to an audio you can also hop over to the youtube and come share this experience with us as well and so with that being said let's get to our first headline headline number one and on number one reads Biden embraces Trump law fair we gotta lock him up now this first little section let's just dive in what's happening from the left uh some crazy shit uh so President Joe Biden let the veil slip during a Thursday stop in New Hampshire Biden told a small crowd quote we got to lock him up during a screen on his nemesis Donald Trump according to several reports the president had restrained himself from publicly endorsing jelling Trump for years and then he later tried to clean it up his statement by saying politically and then he said oh and then what I mean is we got to lock him out right right right here's a clip he is talking about doing everything entire department of education he's talking he means it not in this not a joke this guy also wants to replace every civil servant every single one I think he has a rate of the supreme court ruling on immunity to be able if need be if he if with the case to actually eliminate physically eliminate shoot kill someone who is he believes to be the threat to him I mean so I know this sounds bizarre it sounds like I said this five years ago you locked me up we gotta lock him out politically locked him out politically locked him out yeah politically now he's not the only one that's been saying some wow shit um I feel like the tone has definitely been increasing here in recent weeks let's let's go to momela comela and she's made a very interesting statement today at the White House actually let's check I think it was at her house oh at the the her personal house yeah the observatory let's check this out so yesterday we learned that Donald Trump's former chief of staff John Kelly a retired four star general confirmed that wild Donald Trump was president he said he wanted generals like Adolf Hitler had Donald Trump said that because he does not want a military that is loyal to the United States constitution he wants a military that is loyal to him he wants a military who will be loyal to him personally one that will obey his orders even when he tells them to break the law or abandon their oath to the constitution of the United States in just the past week Donald Trump has repeatedly called his fellow Americans the enemy from within and even said that he would use the United States military to go after American citizens and let's be clear about who he considers to be the enemy from within anyone who refuses to bend a knee or dares to criticize him would qualify in his mind as the enemy within like judges like journalists like non-partisan election officials it is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler the man who is responsible for the deaths of six million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans that's interesting yeah I mean you know it's not like they haven't been weaponizing the DOJ against Donald Trump and judges it's not like they haven't kept you know some J6 prisoners held without due process for the last four years it's not like you know judges are obeying the constitution and you know they're just doing their job you know we have judges just making shit up like that dude up mark what's his name and Goren Goren and you know all these people so you know my take on this is very simple they're scared as fuck and by the way they're lying and projecting because that's who they are that's what they will do and they already have displayed this they already have talked and bragged about how they're gonna put Trump in jail and you know this is what communist do man communist lie and they project what it is they're trying to do and then once they get in power they do all the things they accuse someone else of wanting to do and that's what's going on here and to be you know uh real I think she looks like dog shit she knows she's losing she knows the people aren't behind her and I think they're terrified that's what's starting to come across to me she looks terrified man and like I mean she keeps trying to do these interviews and like they you know I don't know what you want to call the left mainstream media is getting a little bit more um unbiased towards her and starting you know not asking her just the typical soft block well that's because they know they're gonna lose but yeah because then they're exposing themselves right and so like they try to give her some sense what do you mean the mainstream media when they do these interviews like they're starting to ask her harder questions now right yeah well why do you think that is well I think they know they're exposing themselves when they don't well I think they know what they've done for the last eight fucking years and they realized that they have Trump coming in now who by the way has said nothing about quote unquote turning the military on American citizens in fact I believe we just covered a few shows ago where they literally switched without an announcement the ability for military personnel to shoot and kill American citizens Trump didn't do that they did that okay so this is exactly what they are trying to do what she's accusing him of is what they will do all right and it's it's interesting that there's no repercussions for what these people are saying when Donald Trump's had two attempts on his life they come out and they say we need to calm down the rhetoric Trump needs to calm down the rhetoric and here they are two weeks before the election saying he's Hitler right like bro this is total bullshit they're projecting they're terrified they don't know what's going to happen to them and you know the reason have you just be terrified yeah but listen if you've seen like Rachel Maddow and a lot of these media personalities like freaking out about how they think their show is going to be pulled off the air or they're going to be arrested and shit why do you think they're saying that because they know what they did hold on warrants them being fucking arrested for yes they know that but also their exposing what they want to do that is projection dude that is oh if we we're gonna take Rogan and we're gonna take pbd and we're gonna take Andy and we're gonna take fucking Alex Jones and we're gonna fucking fuck all these that's what they plan to do okay so when we look at what they're accusing we have to understand that what they are accusing is what they intend to do okay it's like someone who accuses someone of cheating in a relationship and that person isn't doing anything wrong there's a good fucking chance that that's the person that's doing fucked up shit the one making the accusation this is the same thing yeah man I mean look they're freaking out and to be completely honest the people she mentioned corrupt judges people who interfere with the election people who misuse their political power those people should be in jail they should be in fucking jail okay so we've been lied to we had a crimes against humanity with the with the pandemic where they lock down the country based off of bullshit's data for almost two years they fucked up families they closed businesses they ruined family legacies they stunted kids development they created rifts in society that may not ever be repaired we had doctor Fauci on TV telling people to not talk to your family not let them over for the holidays if they didn't have a covid vaccine right they tried to force that look look at how many people they fired in fact Supreme Court New York just today a lot told that everybody got fired for the covid thing gets back pay for the whole time okay so like these people did this shit and do all the big companies that stole all the middle class wealth are they gonna be forced to give it back no probably not okay so we had people had they had to watch their loved ones die on zoom we had lies about the PCR test we had lies about the cases we had lies about the deaths you know like we talk about all the time like when they were saying oh so and so died of covid when they fucking got killed the motorcycle wreck right dude this these people are are highly guilty of treason and they are freaking the fuck out because they're afraid they might be held accountable and I believe they should be no absolutely man and no it doesn't stop them over still in this push of the device of shit and pushing all that crazy shit I want to turn our attention real quick um uh Eminem or they them and him yeah that was actually pretty pretty fucking Donald Trump junior I think posted this they them and him uh listen we already saw what happened to celebrities who endorsed Biden the first time it ruins them it ruins their fucking careers ruins them okay um but they they won't stop they had uh Eminem um in Obama rally voters for Kamala Harris and Detroit let's check uh Eminem coming out I think it's important to use your voice so I'm encouraging everybody to get out and vote please I also think that people shouldn't be afraid to express their opinions and I don't think anyone wants an America where people are worried about retribution of what people will do if you make your opinion known oh stop that stop that we've had to fucking close our mouths and be afraid of being canceled for having an opinion for over 10 years what the fuck are you talking about bro you're talking crazy shit okay because the last time I remember it hasn't been leftists and democrats the big getting canceled for the last 10 years it's anybody who stepped outside of that this is just another example of projection okay we haven't been able to say anything the last fucking 10 years okay you say one thing that's outside the norm and all of a sudden you got everybody on you you got everybody on your back you got you you fucking getting fired from your job you're getting your life ruined you're getting your reputation uh destroyed for saying things that are outside for saying you like Donald Trump okay this dude's up here saying nobody should be afraid I agree with him but let's be real it's you and your fucking people that have been saying this shit and doing this shit forever and you're not aware that the tide has changed the tide has changed no one gives a flying fuck about these far leftists and they're piling on in terms of canceling anybody fuck you come get some bitch okay that's that's what I think about it that's embarrassing bro for him to get up there and say that one line he's the fucking like proponent of fucking free speech this you know but he's M&M's been saying this shit for his whole career dude which by the way I like M&M's music I'm not holding that against them it's music but like dude come on let's be fucking real you're M&M bro you go sell off these fucking clowns he's an M&M with no nuts yeah he's fucking I just that's highly disappointing to hear and see this this fucking people aren't gonna buy his shit dude no it's gonna ruin him man I mean not to be needs anymore but you know you know he's I think he's the number one selling rap artists full time yeah but no nuts man um but yeah so he brought out Obama um I thought I just thought this piece was interesting Obama comes out all right and guess what he had to say Obama says he doesn't know how we've become so divided toxic and bitter why don't you look in the mirror wait wait wait no bro listen they're just freaking out because now they're on the wrong side of it they don't realize what they've done for the last fucking 15 years and they don't realize how sick of it people are they live in their own little bubble with all people to think the same as them look man you don't see fucking Republicans or Trump supporters going up to people in random places and harassing them screaming at him and like I saw this video of the door the doorbell cam oh lady did you see that I saw that shit bro bro this old lady goes up on so do you have it yeah this this clip right here yeah I can't you know how you can go we can't answer the door right now but if you'd like to leave a message you can do it now and Bob are you the one that walks by here and always screaming at people uh no I had no idea at least in my okay people walk by and scream yeah I'm not because you are voting for the devil so I should know that no why are you voting for him um because I believe he is the moral candidate oh my god thank you for that what that's how your side asks oh my god you're gonna get more questions around in your opinion so I'm sorry have a nice day okay that you don't see that from the Republican people no that is why they're going to fucking lose whether they win the election or not they've lost culture and it's over for them they don't get it okay because culture is going to backlash on every motherfucker like that very fucking hard okay we are sick of people like that harassing us everywhere we go we are fucking over it yeah man it's crazy then you see yeah Obama coming up and saying this shit let's check this out I don't understand how we got so toxic and just so divided and so better and I get why sometimes people just don't want to pay attention to and we all have friends like that we have family members who just like ah you know it's all it's all circus out there I get that yeah so he created this yeah well let's remind them let's do it because I got some effort yeah how about uh when he was on the campaign trail and he uh told people that they should go get in their neighbors faces and argue with him like this clip if you want the next four years looking like the last eight then I'm not your candidate but if you want real change if you want to economy the rewards work and the works not just for Wall Street but also for mainstream if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs if you want health care you can afford an education so that your kids can compete then alko i need you i need you to go out and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors I want you to talk to them whether they're independent or whether they are Republican I want you to argue with them and get in their face and if they tell you that well we're not sure where he stands on guns I want you to say he believes in the second amendment if they if they tell you well he's going to raise your tax and you say no he's not he's going to lower him you are my ambassadors you guys are the ones who can make the case and if you're not got some bears with me and make some phone calls for me then I promise you we will not just win the battle we will win this general election and you and I together we're going to change this country change the world thank you everybody I mean even see an incident you know more rate most say race relations worsened under Obama that's because that was his intent yeah you know I mean just to remind everybody before Obama we didn't have BLM we didn't have ISIS we didn't have anti-foe people don't fucking get it they don't get it there too that listen I was too long ago for most of the people listening were kids when that was going on okay like children you guys don't understand before this motherfucker came around we had a great society I'm not saying George Bush was the result George Bush was a boner too okay but we as the as the as the people yeah little white red rocket right so fucking we the people culture society we all got along dude like there wasn't these there wasn't this shit going on and they've convinced the younger generation that this is somehow the new civil rights and now everybody starting to realize it's total bullshit yeah man you know and dude let's not forget Maxine Waters going in front of people saying fucking go up to their table and getting their face and blah blah blah bro they've always been this people they claim we're the party of tolerance and love no the fuck you aren't you're the party of assholes you're the party of confronting everybody you're the party of like that video we just saw getting on somebody's porch and yelling at their ring camera we don't see that from the other side it doesn't fucking happen because the other side believes in living let live which is the exact reason ironically that we were even in this position because everybody on the other side of these crazy whack jobs has always looked at it like well you know it's America man they can have their views and we let that go on for so long where these people got so in bold and then now they try to get you fired they try to ruin your life they try to crush your family they try to do everything they can to hurt you bro and and then they have the nerve to stand up and say it's the other side why are we fuck out of here everything so divided yeah go go to those tweets you just had oh yeah they're buying the sweets yeah Donald Trump is the greatest threat to our democracy Donald Trump is a genuine threat to this nation he's a threat to our freedom he's a threat to our democracy he's a literal a threat to everything America stands for these people act like we didn't have for fucking years of Donald Trump and by the way if the media and all these fucking douchebags hadn't have hammered on him for four years he would have gone a lot more shit done in a good way bro listen this everybody knows what this is about this is about these people who have profited and one in life off the backs of hardworking Americans off the sacrifice of hardworking Americans your brother your sister your dad your mom off the service of hardworking Americans these people have profited greatly all right and they are losing their golden egg and not only are they losing their golden egg they know that the emperor has no clothes everybody sees what's going on nobody thinks Kamala Harris is the actual candidate they realize that she is a figurehead of the system all right everybody's become that they've come aware of that so dude we could go on and on about Obama's in his divisiveness bro do you remember when those Dallas police officers got shot and he and he fucking like basically stoked race riots over or when he did with Mike Brown like this guy's a douchebag bro and this this woman this woman on the porch in the video I would encourage any of you listening to go watch this video if you don't watch the show just go to the timestamp watch the video dude she this is exactly who we think that they are okay we how many times have we had to deal with someone like that over the last eight years every single one of you how many times have you deal with an unhidged family member or or even somebody you don't even know freaking the fuck out because you weren't in line with all their woke d i or their green shit or their fucking leftist bullshit right or or you know redistribution of wealth or any of this shit like these people here here's a reality not not all of them but those people like this woman this woman here is a shitty fucking person who likes to pretend like she's moral think of what it would take for you to walk up and down your street and then go on a neighbor's porch and mother fuck them for having a Trump signing your yard and their yard and their own yard think what think hold on think of the ego and the entitlement and the superiority and the elitism that that person must have she talked to that woman who was in the house like she's a moron don't you know that aren't you aware he's the devil yeah watch some more msnbc lady we don't give a fuck what you think two steps away from eating tapioca put in the same bro like you mother fuckers your generation ruined this country so we have nothing to say to you it that is the generation that ruined this country by the way those people yeah man does something on this conversation you want to know why you fucking can't afford a house and why your wages haven't gone up and why shit's fucked up for you young people it's because of people like that it's people like that who continue to vote for their moral fucking high ground as opposed to understanding anything about economics or anything about how a culture should actually run they're unwilling to have any sort of reasonable discussion with anybody and their mind you're a dumbass which is why they talk to us like that that's why they talk to us like that you ask her what policies she thinks are good for America the Kamala has I get her to you she doesn't have any the only policy she has is Trump's the devil which is all these people got which is example of what fucking Kamala Harris just said on her little interview like dude people are hurting financially people are having a problem getting by and you're you're up there talking about how Trump is Hitler dude like why don't you talk about what's going to serve them how's going to help them you know fuck stupid man guys it feels like panic to me they are panicking 100% man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments and let us know man with that big set let's go cruise these comments yeah I got something for you you asked for I know I couldn't wait I thought about this morning when I woke up now do you want to you want to first or you want to later I don't care I thought about this morning I was getting in a shower I'm like fuck yeah all right fucking hate comments today I come in yeah good listen I love it because anybody who's hating they they make themselves look stupid because they're so uneducated but so stupid and of course you guys

you fucking you think I got lucky when it took me 25 fucking years asshole just in the dark yeah fuck let's cruise some of these comments guys uh let's check this first one this first one comes from a team aspire to inspire he says uh Andy uh if you're making fries and McDonald's you better make the best mother fucking fries so which he says Trump bet I listen did you see him doing it did pretty decent bro if you watched the whole put too much fucking salt in that shit there he dropped too much salt they had to stop oh I don't know I like the salt you don't like you want your fries playing no it has must be your white side talking yeah what it is yeah or the black side no the white side you want less salt that's too spicy haha you were eating the like spicy food no I like spicy I don't like hot food that different um I think there's a reasonable ratio of salt to fries yeah there is you can overdo it yeah you can definitely overdo it all right listen I watched the whole thing and he was like legit trying to do it right yeah because he was asking the lady or the person next to him he was like hey okay so this that was so how much salt this much like he cared yeah and bro listen if it good that's what matters people who take pride in whatever it is in front of them are the people who win long term that's it and it was it was cool to see him do that yeah because he didn't have to

perspective olive yes times were better but he inherits it that economy he did absolutely nothing to create it that's a fact this person must hang out with Gavin Newsom that's the fact that's right after their fucking bullshit except for it's not it's not a fact not got through fact that let's check the gd gdp growth this is from 2000 uh 2008 to 2023 okay there's the dates there and you can very clearly see very very clearly see uh that you know bomba gets in fucking tanks the fucking economy the moment he gets in yeah uh it was actually at his lowest in twenty twenty sixteen trump gets in it gets way better and then obviously covid um which rebounded you see right here very clearly 2009 Obama gets in gas prices soar they start going up and up and up trump comes in low is them Biden comes in they go back up yeah and gas prices one of the main lynch pans of people's economic uh a built freedom gas prices and taxes and grocery prices because they had it affects them every single day even the unemployment rate yeah dude I know I mean it's there it's everywhere I know that unemployment weight uh came to the lowest ever under fucking trump mm-hmm like bro these people are brainwash so that's not a fact bro it's not a fact you think it's a fact because you watch the mainstream media and you listen to what they say and if you think that this is a fact you probably also think that he is Hitler and all the and he's a rapist and he's of this and he's of that he's not any of those things none of that should dumbass yeah all right you ready for this last one yeah this last one comes from uh bs uh mic mic mic micening christ he says uh can't understand what you're saying with Donald's dick and that's pretty funny oh there are no dicks in my mouth buddy but 20 bucks is 20 bucks oh fuck dude yep I love I love people I think that shit's hilarious yeah I think it's funny yeah I think it's fun guys we appreciate I'll let you um for those of you guys that love us and especially those in haters yeah keep drinking the tea that's right thingy's up uh let's keep this this cruise moving uh let's go ahead line number two I wanted to bring this up I thought this was an interesting article um this is from uh senator tom tillis who's a Republican in north Carolina covering obviously talking about uh the hurricane um the devastation that's happened and there's some interesting shit that's moving right now um so he wrote this article um publishes article out uh with the headline reading congress must be proactive not reactive with disaster recovery um so he starts the article by saying um it is painful to hear someone's voice crack as he tells the story of how he lost his entire livelihood and the work of the generations before him Ronnie is a former in his 70s in a small town in western north Carolina his family's fortunes drastically changed last month with hurricane uh Elaine flood it and destroyed his farm washing away several lifetimes of work in the hope of passing along the family tradition to the next generation the tragedy of Ronnie's story is that it is similarly shared by thousands of other north carolinesians uh who lost their homes businesses and entire communities in the historic flooding disaster once the television cameras leave and long after the national media stop covering the extent of the devastation many north carolines like Ronnie and his family will still have their entire world turned upside down uh Elaine tragically took the lives of more than 120 north carolinesians and more than 200 across the southeast to figure that is expected to grow Elaine also caused tens of billions of dollars worth of damage to an area in western north Carolina the size of massachusetts entire towns have been reduced to rubble and mud the recovery process will be long and difficult and we require years and billions of dollars of assistance all right now where it gets interesting is he starts talking about the actual issues addressing these people living in those areas that have devastated by the hurricane and so we get into this this next one he says the most pressing need is to replenish the sba's disaster loan fund which has already run out of money few halane victims have flood insurance so the sba's various disaster recovery programs are key to long-term recovery by utilizing these programs victims can access low interest loans remember when people said they were not loans right in the female aid and they got mad because I said it was a fucking loan and then they were like oh yeah not alone it's it's a loan it's a loan that they have to pay back when their insurance settles for their claim and just like the article says right here many of them don't have insurance so um you know the the loans can be used to provide a financial cushion for small businesses that face an economic loss in the months ahead um he even talked about FEMA how FEMA has run out of money um says FEMA is also in danger running out of money and this is disaster relief fund the hurricane season isn't over until November and the national hurricane center is already monitoring tropical disturbances that cut turn uh into uh more full blown storms and they only get worse um and he he covers all of that you know and like you know even just in Louisiana this this most recent uh hurricane Milton in his devastation uh $200 million in damages just in one little area in Louisiana that was affected by it um and so you know you have all of that stuff going on um and so uh you know it's so interesting because you know again like we're in a time in this country where people should be coming together community should be coming together patriots left to right you know red or blue gay or straight should be coming together to help each other in times of need and you would think that our federal government state governments will be helping that um but that's not where the priorities are because you know as this article is coming out this article comes out uh Biden Harris-Pinigoncine's another 400 million to Ukraine for immediate needs for immediate needs um which we don't have any immediate needs here I mean I could name a couple yeah of immediate needs yeah we could go on and on past the hurricane I mean fuck yeah right we had immediate needs before the hurricane I know you know and it's more than 400 million though you got that oh yeah it's more than 400 yeah uh defense secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday during a surprise visit to Ukraine announced $400 million in US military aid to Kiev the second approximately 400 million aid package sit within one week so that's $800 million fucking dollars and less than a week yeah and they got another one coming another 400 Vladimir uh Zelensky was on TV after they gave away the first 400 talking about how they're giving them another 800 so they're doing it in chunks so that people don't freak the fuck out but there'll be another one right after this so 1.2 billion dollars when when our fucking people in North Carolina and all the places that these hurricanes have you know destroyed there's out listen man people understand what's actually going on there there is elderly people people that are in their 80s and 90s who will not have food or heat for the entire running water showers for the entire winter man like these people are sitting there having outdoor barbecues which is better than nothing right like but that's not the way in American citizen is supposed to be treated in the times of disaster and on top of that that's not the way America should be doing anything ever we shouldn't be sending money anywhere else ever for anything when our country has the problems that it has and that's something that the people have to start demanding you know like Obama just said in that video you know I understand why a lot of people uh they look they want to look away and they don't want to get involved yeah because it is such a shit show but until Americans start to get really loud about our tax system and about how it's spent and about how we're overtaxed like bro if we're sending 180 billion dollars overseas to Ukraine we are being taxed way too much okay and we can even afford that yeah listen and here's what's going on bro that war by the way is fucking over like Ukraine has lost they don't have any fucking men left okay what they're doing now just so everybody's clear is they understand that there's a good chance that they're about to be out of power so what would you do if you had a free faucet of money that was about to get turned off forever what would you do right before it got turned off forever collected with some buckets you try to run as much out of there as you can so what's happening here they don't give a shit about the optics they don't care because they care about their own personal wealth more than they care about the optics of the situation because they have the ability to cheat which they are going to cheat all right uh which is going to get real interesting if they do because the the culture is with Trump Trump has created the cool has captured the cool and cool is the best sales strategy there is so when you look at a brand like Trump and you realize that he's captured all these people that have been against him for the last eight years they got a big problem and so what they're looking at is in my opinion is hey how much more money can we fucking launder and get out of here before we have to get out office that way we'll have money to do whatever we need to do and you know maybe we can get out of these things that might happen to us like maybe we can leave and go somewhere else but dude like this is all about stealing as much as possible and if you want to wait just wait if Trump wins the election wait until you see how much money they send them between November and January and wait until you see the destruction they try to create in this country between November and January because if they think Trump's coming in back into power their goal is going to turn to 2028 and they're going to want to create as bad of a situation in America which is as hard as possible to correct for people as possible the that's what these people are about okay and think about that these are supposed to be people that represent you and I these are supposed to be people that care about us and they are going to fucking ruin our country because they didn't get their fucking way like a bunch of little brats all right so when Kamala comes out and says I know they're going to target the American people no they're not going to target the American people they're going to target fucking traders which is what the constitution calls for it calls for it we have an American duty to defend our country from enemies both foreign and domestic all right so when he says I'm going to fucking take care of the enemy within he's not talking about that lady on the porch we're not talking about those people he's talking about the people who are organizing the corruption in this country who are destroying this country many different ways and benefit across yeah that's what he's talking about so when she says that you know what I think good yeah for sure and I actually think that her coming out continuing to push like they're pushing now is actually pushing more people towards Trump it is it is man especially when they keep doing dumps it like this yeah bro these know they try to blame you know they try to put put this on the reason they're sending more money to what they're saying they're sending more money for is because they're saying roads or something no North Korea it enters the war and they're sending troops to Russia um why would Russia need North Korean troops they don't there's only three thousand of them uh there's only three thousand of like it's not even a fucking damn now this is that's probably Kim Jong-un trying to tell uh you know uh Putin like hey man let us get in the fight we don't get to do shit right we we have to send uh city diapers and balloons yeah South Korea let's get our guys some some action some action time you know like bro dude I just want somebody to look at me the way Austin looks at fucking Zelensky well he's making rich bro they're making all these people rich bro those guys got a deal they're making they're making each other rich they're happy Zelensky's getting rich as fuck go look at Zelensky's personal assets you want you want to fucking you want to know what this dude's about start digging into his personal assets now this guy is younger than me he's never owned a business he's never built anything he's just some fucking the TV do no he's a gay actor is what he is yeah okay and that has nothing to do with gay people but he is gay and he's an actor and they pull them off and he wanted if you don't believe me go look at the shit that he was playing it okay anyway yeah he's he's getting rich they're getting rich everybody's happy they're removing the resistance in Ukraine for them to do whatever they want to do we're expected to rebuild their entire country the way that they want to build it dude fuck these people 100% man yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments now time we've all been waiting for I had line three now this is I've been I've been cooking over here oh yeah oh I've been cooking so I should just let you do the whole the whole huh let you do the whole presentation I'm gonna need your help to to draw these dots together I'm gonna try not to interrupt I'm just gonna lay these dots I probably gonna but it's fine I mean I but we got to lay these dots out okay you connected dots okay you know it makes the picture yeah I'm good at that yeah I mean you do a fucking fabulous job yeah fabulous did you hear the biggest news though what even bigger than whatever this is what it's bigger than this what is it I made I made top five white guys uh-huh of what of white guys but do what measures white I made top five white guys in the world it's a very exclusive list I made it that's that that's the biggest news out today that's a fact yeah let's throw it up there on the screen just to prove it oh yeah there we go um-hmm sin martina straight up top my top five favorite white dudes who says not what's number three right there Andy for sure that's right it's you it's the biggest news in the fucking world today I'm proud of you thank you um-hmm listen do I on behalf of all the other white guys it didn't make the list I just want you to know that there's still hope for you there's at least four other spots here that could be taken because I'm gonna be on the list forever all right but with a little hard work and some big dreams some cream soda some cream soda and some relentless drive and hunger and ambition you too have the possibility to be a top five white dude except you you know but honorable mention potentially I don't think you fit on the white or the black list true yeah we have to make your own list top five uncle towns yeah you be number one I'm not think elders still has me I'm like who Larry elders oh elders yeah I'm like number two but hey man this is real shit I mean listen this is news listen sin I'm honored thank you very much sir I will take the responsibility bestowed upon me to be a representative of the top five white guys very seriously I will bring change raisins to everybody huh raisins raisins the candy corn you know what that sounds like a good mix that's like a white dude trail mix that's fucking discuss raisins and candy corn I just made it up that's nice that's why I made the top five white dudes probably put some peanuts in there too no my father you want to put pork brains in there some shit you put walnuts and cash well you want to put in there pork rinds I like pigs feet yeah right all right man I like chillin I like pigs feet let's get to our third of final headline man this is uh for real though what's it like what to be in the presence of a top five white dude does it feel good are you guys proud yeah what's it like for you Sayed I mean you know what's it like the cool the biggest accomplishment of my life yeah after working at seven eleven yeah okay well that makes sense because that's a big one I mean you did open the first seven eleven on the moon that's right yeah they have pictures of me in India that's right you know the half of India's very real moon landing that's right yes they show my picture to all their kids and tell see he he can do it you can do it that's right and you can yeah and so can all you white dudes that's right I'm just bummed they don't have a top five brown people I think he does he's got like a bunch of five holes yeah yeah yeah we have to uh we're gonna have to you know run a campaign but that's okay we could we could we're gonna win I don't know most of the people he's like listing yeah that's because you're at the bottom and we're at the top I get it I get it running different circles son I mean I understand all right let's get into headline number three uh this is uh this is a doozy all right um and we're gonna work through this I'm gonna lay him out try to make some sense of this um but you you know you actually talked a little about about this earlier in the show uh talking about Fauci and the covid the the whole bullshit pandemic and guys we spent four years covering the shit um and uh it never fails we're right we were always right um so I want to show you this first headline you know you you actually you mentioned the uh New York Supreme Court doing the overturning the firings that happened during that time back pay having to be paid out uh there was a a house report that was just put out um and this headline reads uh HS HHS spent 911 million dollars on covid vaccine messaging consistently overstayed virus risk to kids damning house report to find all right so the Department of Health and Human Services spent almost a billion dollars a billion dollars just on advertising a bullshit vaccine that's essentially what happened that's what this was all right to GOP led house energy and comments panel released a scathing 1113 page document Wednesday about the most significant public health missteps fibs and cover-ups from HHS and its sub agency the CDC during the COVID-19 pandemic quote CDC's guidance which the campaign relied on went beyond the terms of FDA's emergency use authorization to state without evidence that covid vaccines were highly effective against transmission the report states quote this ultimately had a negative impact on vaccine confidence and the CDC's credibility uh when proven untrue it also states that the CDC quote had inconsistent and flawed messaging about the effectiveness of mask uh consistently overstated the risk of covid 19 to children and still continues to recommend covid 19 vaccines for all Americans aged uh ages six months and older uh which has made the United States a global outlier in covid 19 policy because no other country they all stopped it have those guidelines that's right all right now in fact a number of countries have come out and said hey stop administering this because of the side effects and the negative effect stop completely yes to all ages yep um and so that's interesting but yes so so uh almost a billion dollars and our money was spent to lie to us is what this was all right now I thought that I found that extremely interesting okay I'm in at the same time that this is happening okay um we're going to talk about what's happening in other countries when it comes to this COVID 19 pandemic plannedemic uh bullshit uh do you see this bill gates is uh just got ordered to stay in trial in the Netherlands um over the covid vaccine injury claims in order to pay legal costs as the Dutch court dismisses the jurisdiction claims are you trying to get out of this saying that oh they don't have the jurisdiction on bill gates they said no no no bring bring it as here boy um and now he has to go to court over there because of the lies that uh he had put out um and just for quick refresher gates is one of the experts uh that they deemed as an expert I don't know what made him qualified nothing nothing he's not a doctor he's not a medical doctor he's nothing he's a rich entrepreneur it's rich fuck yeah that would be like me going in there and being like guys take I don't know shit about vaccines but take this shit it's good yeah oh by the way I own the company you know yeah but more importantly uh he had four uh statements and claims that he made uh that the lawsuit is gonna be based on um you know none of these fuckers took it no yeah none of them they took fucking sailing I I will take that to my grade me too they took fucking say me too um but the claims that they made uh they said the vaccine would stop transmissions that's a that's false and literally everybody that I know that had the vaccine they still got sick they still got COVID they got still getting COVID yes exactly um and so there's that uh they said the vaccinated could quit wearing mask it's not true because it doesn't stop the fucking transmissions um they said the vaccinated well it's not true it's not true that anybody should wear mask anyway and uh they also said the vaccinated were not going to die and uh the Netherlands are actually experiencing a big big boom and uh all kinds of mortality uh which globally has been reported up between 30 and 40 percent um hmm hmm weird weird yeah and now here's where here's where shit is what has changed in the world to create all cause mortality globally to go up 30 to 40 percent yeah now here's where shit gets real interesting okay because I've been I'm like I well what's what's all billy gates up to you know and then I see this article Dittling kids I see this art allegedly allegedly I see this article which I thought was interesting um it's headline reads bill gates privately says he has backed Harris with $50 million on nation that came out yesterday mm-hmm yeah I saw there's some like man that's that's interesting right in the article this is written by I believe this is New York Times um you know they even omitted after decades of sitting on the sidelines of politics he's never once jumped in either or side bill gates one of the richest people in the world has said uh privately that he recently donated about $50 million to a non-privileged organization that is supporting vice president Kamala Harris' presidential run according to three people briefed on the matter the donation was meant to stay under wraps mr. gates one of the founders of Microsoft has not publicly endorsed Mrs. uh Miss Harris and his donation would represent a significant change in the strategy that has previously kept him away from gifts like this um and apparently he said in a statement in response to this report he mr. gates did not explicitly address the donation or offer an endorsement of Miss Harris in the race he stressed his bipartisanship uh but he also said quote this election is different what makes it different Billy that's you know that's a great question yeah I think Elon had an answer to this a couple of weeks ago uh let's check this clip out but it's just obvious that that Biden's on a charge it's obvious that Kamala's on a charge I mean the the Kamala's they just replaced the Biden puppet with the Kamala puppet um very obviously and and it's you can tell like for the teleprop to stop swarking then the puppet stopped breaks and it's like oh the puppet just starts looping because the teleprop to broke um I don't have a teleprote there I just talk like normal human so so I mean I yeah I think this it's not from what I tell it's not one puppet master it's many but uh you know um interesting to see the cross over between the Epstein client list and Kamala's puppet masters but there's a lot of names that appear in both lists yeah now who he went on to refer to was Bill Gates he he referred to him by name in the Tucker interview you know yeah and he put that out and something like yeah you know so he says that the donor list and the Epstein list is gonna be the same and then the fuck after after that happens he goes out to support this because he knows that Trump has already pledged to release the Epstein list right you have it's it's interesting it's interesting it's very thought provoking stay with me they're they're fucking terrified bro it's wild okay now we all know that uh you know we we talked about the the diddy shit a couple of weeks ago when that stuff first broke um you know there's more crazy shit that's coming out about this all right uh Shondady combs accused of drugging personal trainer passing his body around like a party favor allegedly um talking about that uh you know there was another famous person that is identified only as celebrity a um that spit in the trainer's mouth I mean it's just so did they name the trainer uh no I think I know who it is I didn't find this John doe well I'm pretty sure I know him but really yeah because you reached out to me talk about this exactly no shit yeah um I'm right I told you about that I told you about how a guy that when that first started happening they didn't arrest them that dude reached out to me and I was like fuck it sounds so crazy I'm not sure if it's actually true yeah remember that no shit no shit um I can get them on the show anytime brother be fucking crazy uh but you you have this right you know this comes out and we you made you made a statement um during the episode we talked about this we like you know there is a Jeffrey Epstein in every industry right it's in you know I think Jeffrey Epstein was more on the politics side of stuff uh diddy obviously being in more in the hip pop scene but I believe that there is a diddy there's an Epstein in every single industry right whether it be um you know country music maybe we know what some movies we got Harvey Weinstein in the movie industry right like it's everywhere every every single industry has this for sure and uh you know I thought it's like terror cells bro to control culture and and I think I thought this too that obviously yes that's a huge report but also but these people are actually sick fucks like you know I'm saying like part like they do do this shit for the personal pleasure bro and it's the discussion um but I want to introduce to the uh to the chat all right uh enter the story former Abercrombie and Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries he's all smiles with an ankle monitor as he post 10 million bond the following sex trafficking arrest so the the ex CEO of Abercrombie and Fitch uh was just arrested and a twisted scheme to sexually exploit male models pair of the feds okay so now we have it in the clothing industry okay let's dive into this a little bit farmer Amber Crabby and Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries his male partner in a middleman prayed on and horrifically abused more than a dozen young aspiring male models as part of a twisted sex trafficking and prostitution ring federal prosecutors to set Tuesday Jeffries who's 80 years old allegedly wielded his quote power wealth and his influence to traffic scores of men for his own sexual pleasure for nearly a decade often dangling the promise of modeling careers in their faces according to the feds now the disgraced fashion boss who infamously had shirtless young male lifeguards and models parading outside and the crimey stores hold on so I just text this guy that I know he said yes that's me I wasn't passed around I fought and got jumped he goes it's just more false info I don't roll that way and they were trying to sabotage my character so it was him that's crazy yeah um but yeah they uh you know this Amber Crabby and Fitch thing gets weird man and and you know according to the indictment that was put out the the pair used a recruiter by the name of James Jacobson who is 71 to lure their victims including unsuspecting store workers and models to six sex parties across the world from 2008 to 2015 I'm also when Obama was in office I just went put that up there thought that was interesting um according to the indictment unsealed after the trio was arrested earlier Tuesday all right now Jacobson he went by a couple of different names uh in the industry he was known as Jim Jake misses cook and Todd um just interesting shit right now start doing some some some some deep dives on this oh you do you want me to tell you because I already know let's lay it out for the people okay yeah let's wax on your own fucking abacrombian Fitch he also owns Victoria's Secret he's also Jeffrey Epstein's financier he also gave Jeffrey Epstein uh power returning over all of his wealth yeah yeah yeah yeah pretty much what we've been saying for the whole time bro anyway laid out yeah let's lay it out um so so ambercrombian Fitch it's it's owned it was bought by the Limitit Inc uh in 1988 okay now um the thing with limited ink uh later known as L brands okay they own a few different major players right they own Victoria's Secret um which you know this will probably make sense in a little bit while we're seeing transgender models and Victoria's Secret fashion shows um they also own Lane Bryant okay uh plus size women's retail clothing store which is why we see the body positivity movement you know that probably will make sense here in the minute too they quit that body positivity shit Victoria's Secret though after that uh after that harbor shit happened with the Palestinians yep now that's using trance man yeah yeah and they abandoned their room yeah anyway it's sick um you know they also own body uh bathroom body works it's probably why we saw the KKK candle that makes sense now um but yeah who owns L brands okay with a $5,000 loan from his aunt Leslie Wexner began L brands under the name the Limitit that man's worth almost $8 billion dollars today um and uh what was his connection and he's a Jewish man um coming from Jewish heritage but how Jeffery Epstein used the billionaire behind Victoria's Secret because this whole operation just so you know is a msad fucking blackmail operation that they used to control our culture and our politicians so just understand that's not just him saying oh he happens to be Jewish no it's Israeli government operation being operated on our own celebrities music political figures yeah the control are fucking country yeah you know where like you said um mixed mr. Wexner authorized Epstein um to borrow money on his behalf to sign his tax returns to hire people and make acquisitions um over the years mr. Epstein obtained a new york mansion a private plane in a luxury estate in Ohio today valued at roughly a hundred million dollars altogether previously owned by mr. Wexner uh or his companies um and he drove a wedge between mr. Wexner um and all of his long term uh long time associates and friends um and so all of this is going on right and and it's all it's all coming together why how do you think that Epstein got that got got Wexner to sign over his shit i'd imagine probably because they had some shit on Wexner they intentionally had some shit on Wexner that was the whole point they went in they got some shit on them they blackmailed them they said oh now Epstein runs your shit or else we're going to do this right anyway keep going not i mean dude it's sick well people do you have more no okay you got to understand what's going on here okay Epstein Island they bring in celebrities they get them drunk or whatever drugs or whatever they have uh you know underage people all right and it doesn't have to be what you guys think like when you guys think underage people it doesn't have to be 10-year-old kids okay they could fly one of these guys here like fucking Wexner and they could have an 18 or a 17-year-old girl that looks 27 and they could get him drunk and they could and she could be rubbing on him and then next thing you know he's all doing whatever he's doing it's on videotape we own you we own you okay and so then they get Epstein to fucking get power of attorney from Wexner Wexner's now people don't understand this he signed over complete power of attorney meaning all access to his financial assets all access to his companies this guy be he was able to buy sell companies buy properties spend this dude's money however he wanted why would anyone in the world allow someone to do that unless they knew that if they didn't they were going to be exposed to be something else that was irrecoverable okay so then you have Epstein who takes the money and gets this fucking island going and they have all the celebrities all the people flying in and they come in and you know let's the same thing happens to Wexner okay they fucking get them on camera doing some fucked up shit doing some weird shit and then you have Diddy okay who's doing it with the black community and the rap community and the entertainment industry and like you said there are others too and these motherfuckers are not these is not the CIA doing this I do believe the CIA is aware of it and I believe they've used the information to do certain things that they need to get done and they have allowed these people to operate this but after they operated it for so long this blackmail operation it became something that could not be taken down because they had so much power and so much leverage on every single person that they needed to hold these people accountable all right so now you have this entire thing you know which a lot of people are like oh that's not real that's conspiracy that's bullshit bro they're making arrests of people down the line and I think this arrest of this dude from Avocromy and Fitz Jeffries is actually a really good sign that this case is actually progressing because what we're gonna probably see is all the other people that are associated all the little cells start to get cases thrown at them and that's a great thing I don't know who's leading that up but it needs to be happening but at the end of the day you guys wonder how they get all these celebrities lock step with the same messaging and they say if you don't say this and you don't say it like this we're gonna prosecute you for this and this is how they've been able to manipulate our society into this crazy shit that's you know honestly not even represented by American people how many people in our government have dual citizenship with Israel okay how many governments around the world allow dual citizens with America in their government all right we shouldn't be having dual citizens of anybody in our government would you guys be okay if we had dual citizens of Russia serving in our government would you be okay if we had dual citizens of China serving in our government no so why are we okay with dual citizens of Israel serving in our government that's not okay either all right so and when when you say this people like to say oh that's anti-Semitic no it's fucking not it's fucking truth this is what's going on okay that country is using their intelligence agency to blackmail everyone in our country to get our country to behave the way that they want to behave that's what's happening and we are seeing some arrests I think that's a good thing like it's dark yeah but you know to like the Bill Clinton was best friends with Epstein bro you know why his millennia gates fucking bolted on him because she knew what's coming down the pipe bro and she won't get drug into it which she will anyway because she was a she was a willing you know she knew you know and you know it is what it is you should have fucking stood up for the right thing when you saw the right the wrong thing happening all right but this dude is freaking the fuck out he he's committed crimes against humanity I think you know I think that's not just my opinion I think that's pretty verifiable proofs of the pudding yeah and he's also been involved with his Epstein shit he knows who's getting blackmail he knows he knows the shit and now he's freaking out because I think he thinks Kamala may lose which I think she's gonna lose and if she doesn't lose and they cheat it's gonna be a big problem for them because culture understands how much more power Trump has than they have like everybody sees it you can it's not it's it's it's not under the radar so to speak people aren't sleeping the way they were in 2020 dude no so if they come through this time and do the same shit they're gonna have a big fucking problem however I do feel like that's a real option for them to do because dude that's what they did in Brazil they they bolson error had millions of people out for them and they just said oh yeah by the way luna one now now you know they don't have the the the armory that is the people of the United States you know what I mean but it's gonna be real interesting and these people this is why I keep telling you guys for the last you know four or five years now these people are backed into a corner and they're willing to do anything they have to and I think the next two weeks there's some chance of some real bad shit happening in America and and if Trump does win the election what's going to happen between November and when he actually takes office is gonna be a total shit show it's gonna be the intentional destruction of this country anyway possible they're gonna try to kill him probably multiple times between now and then I think they'll get this war going between now and then you know it's gonna be mass chaos intentionally if he wins and there's gonna be you know it's gonna be interesting because the the police and the sheriffs and the FBI and the CIA and everybody's gonna have to make a decision about what side they're on because they're gonna force that hand in my opinion when Kamala gets up there and talks about the military doing this or that I don't I don't I don't think it's beyond her to do that between November and January you know what I mean I listen it's gonna be chaos you need to be fucking prepared for it that's the bottom line you guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments what's not how you like all these people that were part of this episode shit that did this shit with little kids and shit real talk they should be executed we should remove that from society pedophiles people who molest kids they should all be removed from society forever if you've ever read the stories that they did to these abacromy kids it's insane dude they listen I read all about it that they actually took these kids okay and it was boys only all right and they shipped them on quote unquote modeling shoots okay so they had them sign a paper here's the itinerary you're gonna go to this place to shoot this you're gonna go to this place to shoot that they fly them over to some other country or some other place and it's literally a fucking orgy and they drug the mother fuckers like did he was doing and then they injected that shit that they inject in people's dicks that makes like what porn stars do I don't know if you guys know this but there's like an injection that you can inject a little bit into your dick and it keeps it hard for like a day okay so they're put they injected these kids penises with this drug to get them hard and then they fucking rape them and these and by the way they targeted hydro sexual males because they wanted males that were going to fight and resist because that's what got them off bro if you read the shit they did to these kids abacromy and bitch would be fucking closed in a fucking minute like it's insane what they did disgusting man guys an ashton kutcher was one of their guys like you think he doesn't know what's going on bro all these dudes know all these people in Hollywood know all these radio people know and there's been a lot of people who have called them out from being inside the industry fucker we're friends with one of them Tommy Vex Tommy talks about this shit all the time and everybody thought he was crazy they dropped it from his record label they fucked up his career you see what I'm saying like dude it everybody's been black bald who's said anything about it because they're all in it well how would every single person that mentions to get black bald you'd have to have a pretty cast it yeah you'd have to have okay outcast means that there's an incast right right so who's who's the crew outcasting them oh by the way it's every record label it's every movie label it's every fucking everything allegedly allegedly allegedly so you know dude this is super bad shit that these super evil shit these people were doing and it's all coming out dude it's all it's gonna be a complete mine fuck for the average person like the Kamala voter who is like I just hate Donald Trump like you guys don't realize that you are still in the fucking dark these people voting for Trump have realized what's happening in the world and they're looking at Trump as you guys make fun of him and say oh as a savior well I mean fuck bro are you gonna save us from all this child molesting fucking blackmail shit that they do you see what I'm saying well that's why these people are pushing for the normalization of pedophilia that's why in Europe they have child consent laws meaning a child can consent to have sex with an adult why would they make that law why would they be empathetic to pedophiles why would they allow men and drag the shake their dicks in front of people why are we normalizing this disgusting behavior well the last five years they've tried to normalize it at a very fast rate and everybody's witnessed that and everybody seen it and the reason they've tried to normalize is because they were counting on societal acceptance so that when all this shit comes out everybody was like oh well you know it's okay it is legal and that's why they were trying to normalize it that's why they're still trying to normalize it and I'm of the opinion that we need to all grow up and be real motherfuckers and realize that these are defenseless children and these motherfuckers doing this shit don't deserve to live they just don't know man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said it's going to our final segment of the show thumbs up we're dumbest fucker this is what we bring a headline and we talk about it to get one of those two options um and uh every now and then they eat their own i think that's what this one is about so uh let's dive into this thumbs up or dumbest fuckhead line reads DC pizza chain under fire over racist dessert named after former mayor okay okay all right let's dive into this okay uh so the wife of a controversial farmer DC mayor isn't happy about a dessert named after her late husband quora masters berry called the newly launched Marion berry knots at a restaurant chain and pizza that's the name of the company racist and disrespectful okay berry the mayor who died is this guy it was on fucking tv doing fucking cocaine fucker hookers smoking crack yeah yeah he accidentally smoked crack accidentally smoked crack um he uh he died in 2014 rest of soul um but he was elected DC mayor in 1978 and served three consecutive terms uh he was reelected in 1994 after he served time for possession of crack cocaine garnering national attention okay uh now the restaurant decided to launch this ad this dessert called marion berry knots uh where they say quote for a good time it's the powder that's the ultimate headline grabber the marion berry knots have enough powdered sugar that will have customers bumping elbows so even uh to order and even force the DEA to look twice they posted on instagram um our our new marion berry knots will blow you away for a limited time try our marion buried field knots topped with icing and enough powdered sugar for you and a few friends uh um pizza party pizza party oh who's that guy underneath there do you all offer curbside oh that's you all right now they're gonna move up to top five black guys net list maybe you know maybe now now here's the real okay here's here this is a real that they posted on the website with this post okay check this out marion berry knots marion berry knots marion berry knots they'll blow you away all right now people immediately jumped on this company like all the races the dishes how's that racist i don't know how black people only wants to cope he did do he smoke crack he's black people only want smoke crack i know people that smoke crack did a little too yeah they did do too and what's doing with java too we got well i mean that's not a that's our racist not racist to say not only that i mean that this this restaurant is extremely liberal i mean far left liberal i didn't see no white people in there this was one of their pages uh there's some white people when they're post the fucking weird ones the weirdest or what the fuck is that where they what is that where they said uh happy pride month to all who celebrate and fuck you to those who don't yeah they have that uh another post they was that a man or a woman i think that was two dudes and jesus marion it does look like jesus bro these these guys are definitely not on the top five white people this no here's another one uh they posted this uh the length of our pies versus the length of theirs hey all right yeah um but yeah they uh they put this is on the website uh marion berry knots bump up the party with the new it's criminal how good these are hey man i think i think it's creative marketing now people were pissed uh this dude uh style channel on instagram whatever the fuck that is um and not the name this is highly disrespectful to our city you know our iconic mayor using references to drug use to promote your pizza is completely inappropriate for those who may not be aware in the 80s and 90s dc struggle with a devastating crack and the debit and making light of that history is neither funny nor clever and it's bad marketing i don't know if it's bad marketing because we're here in Missouri talking about it and it's going everywhere i mean that's the definition of great marketing uh the cocaine joke is especially offenses given that our beloved mayor is no longer with us probably because he did too much cope bro this kind of promotion is not only rude but also shows a lack of respect we need to come together show our pride for our city and honor the legacy of our mayor reminding everyone why he was truly iconic don't disrespect his memory well here's what i would say uh it seems to be a very uh you know normal thing for cocaine to be used that's probably the legacy of your city um since we you know know that there's a bag of it found in the white house you know saying yeah i mean by the way i heard that was Kamala's i heard it was Kamala's too yeah i heard Kamala's like into the fucking bookershearts season to the bookershearts where i heard bro it could be bullshit but i heard it i heard it bookershearts Kamala mama what do you call her mama mama mama mama mama mama mama bookershearts mama mama mama bookershearts mama mama mama mama i'll add something to that in Indian culture yeah that too uh not to that her name should be pronounced Kamala Kamala Kamala that's like the in that's an Indian name of course yeah you know somebody named that yeah a lot of people is that like a like Steve over here yeah okay it's very common but they're they have like americanized it yeah what's the name say it Kamala Kamala Kamala Kamala Kamala Kamala Kamala what does it have a meaning mama la Kamla bookershearts mama Hitler oh they look pretty good the bag of cocaine explains her laugh yeah no they look good she looks rough right now dude like she does she looks demoralized she looks rough she looks like dude i think she's ready to just hang it up be like i fucking well i say let her have the cocaine if i need it but those don't look bad listen man that's brilliant marketing okay like there is no such thing as bad publicity there might be in a minute but after a few weeks or after a month or after a year it becomes something the people remember and this is great marketing and i may not agree with their political ideology of that restaurant but that's fucking great marketing is it good that's all that matter yeah and it's making people mad and talking about it like that's that's a marketing tactic like dude if you look at the biggest brands in the fucking world like Jake Paul Logan Paul these dudes who they intentionally piss people off which makes them more popular so i would say this is excellent marketing especially understanding how social media works between this and the burger with the feet which one you would do top better oh i don't know man that both good the chicken sandwich with the chicken sandwich with the foot yeah no i mean both are great i'll take the crack for 200 yeah me too me too so i've never done cocaine bro or crack because i know what will happen if i do crackerswag i like it too much yeah and then it'll ruin my life crackers i just fucking go with the absences you don't want crack crackers cheap i don't want i don't want none of that shit i'm telling you bro i already know what happened yeah you guys find me over there in the fucking ditch you go to check my bank account there you know money in it yeah yeah yeah all right what we giving this man thumbs up for the i think it's thumbs up i think it's amazing marketing i think they did a good job and uh you know pizza gate is real guys andy that is all i got man all right guys don't be a hoe show the show and shit case clone
