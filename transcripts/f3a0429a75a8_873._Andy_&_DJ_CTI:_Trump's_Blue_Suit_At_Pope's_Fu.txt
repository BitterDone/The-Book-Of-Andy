It'd be sick, man Um, yeah, so you got CTI who got some cool stuff to cover interesting topics before we get that though I got you got a way in there's a debate going on right now Online can a thousand men be a gorilla a hundred man a hundred man versus one gorilla. I saw that I dude It's going around right now. I get a lot of people are talking about it It's I don't know if that's like the a hundred one one hundred man versus one gorilla now I don't know how they could I don't know how how they I mean you have to swarm them there there they would have to be who goes first that's it That's what it is first guys fuck yeah You put the lead you put the least skill guys up front just to that's what I would do like if we were if we had a hundred dudes And we had to art our organism I'd tell no here's here's what I do bro. I'm telling you what I do I'd pick out the 30 dumb mother fuckers And I'd be like you guys are the bravest Here's what you guys are gonna do. I mean that's what they do in the military They fucking convince the guys to run and they say oh you're the bravest when in reality bro That's there just to do is with the biggest balls Like imagine running towards that fucking thing and you see one of those first guys just me and flung around Fuck you're seeing a gorilla's teeth Oh, yeah, bro like they fucking tear your arm off your body dude. Well, I got a little video here So this is like the I guess fast fun facts about gorillas, right? So um According to the the the net new wing way forest national park a silver bat gorilla is stronger than 20 adult human beings combined Well That's regular humans Yeah, I mean like me that's important because I got a list here in a minute but um But let's check this I mean we're talking about regular people here. We're talking about fucking physical specimens for sure of athleticism and good looks for sure Yeah, I mean that I mean the good looks alone. I mean to make a silver bag and charisma It's right. Yeah, bro. That looks like me in South fighting when you had to break it up Did we ever tell that story of the show? No, I don't think so man For DJ's first fucking week has to break up a fight between me and sell. Yeah It was it was like a national geographic game the plane it looks just like this How strong is a silverback that's where it was because of their muscular body Scientific research has shown that a silverback gorilla is stronger than 20 adult humans combined They are able to lift up 10 times their body weight and it is estimated that a gorilla could bench press 4,000 pounds A gorilla's punch has a force of 1,800 pounds which is more than twice as hard as a professional boxer A silverback gorilla strength is needed to fight other male silverbacks and fight off predators like leopards to defend his group So we can conclude that you as human beings shouldn't mess with a fully grown adult gorilla bro 4,000 pounds that's it Yeah, maybe if we put a muscle first form We get that up to like some real numbers get past some rookie numbers Yeah, well, I mean listen listen what says we start a good idea for a human man to take all the gorilla No shit I think 100 man. I don't know. I don't know bro. I don't I don't know. I don't see it happening Like if we're talking real real talk Even if it's like for real okay, we got real athletes here, okay, we're not a fake company Everybody in this motherfucker is some sort of an athlete. Yeah, we get JB up there Dude you got you got you got all our dudes are yeah will fucking Aaron fucking Clement to use will to run So no dude even with that even with that I don't think we could do it. Yeah I would save I would say guys Let's just leave that gorilla alone leave him be yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What is so so it's going around now if we have what if we had a fight I'm like there was no choice. Yeah, well, so how would we do it? It's going around Twitter and like there's a guy Let's do put a list together. Mm-hmm. I'm entitled it 99 people that could help me beat a gorilla ass um Michael J white Brock Lesnar tank Davis Steven Adams John Jones. That's a good one. I say a steward jr 2009 Randy Orton I believe that that's believable. I think Randy might be able to do it on his own bro. Yeah Kamara Uzman Floyd Mayweather. I'm offended 89 pistons the 2004 pistons 2000 trail bro trailblazers The 2001 Ravens D. Yeah Ray Lewis. Yeah, I mean listen It's a decent list. I'm offended who we met that wasn't honest list. Yeah, I should be honest list I've already been stabbed in the fucking face. You know if the thing fucking does whatever I'm just gonna laugh at it Bro I laughed till I died bro Well apparently mr. Beast is doing uh No comment. That's not real 100 man versus a gorilla. That's mr. Beast new video I mean but like even the skeleton like bro. Yeah, I don't think there's a chance god dang look at the pelvis difference. Yeah There's no chance. I mean I know some dudes built like that. I do yeah I do historically. Yeah Oh you The fuck is wrong with you man There's something wrong with you. Yeah, I don't know dude. I don't see it happening I think I think here's what would happen. Yeah, because we have survival instincts bro, and I think what would happen is The first two or three dudes would run up there and the gorilla would just like knock their head completely off their body And nothing will cause fight or flight Especially the flight Then see as some dude decapitated by fucking gorilla. You know what I mean It really happened because before the show we were randomly talking about bite forces of different animals Yeah, it has the most, doesn't it? No, not the most but pretty high So for an average human it's 160 pounds square inch PSI. Yeah, and in an average car tires like what 50 40 whatever Yeah for gorilla it's 1300 what is it for a grizzly bear? I bet it's I bet so dude that's the argument that everybody likes to have what would win between a grizzly and a gorilla I think I think gorilla Gorilla for sure forces And what's the gorilla gorilla is 1300 gorilla god all day you're I don't think so bro I think the fucking grit what's the grizzly bear is a lot bigger right like ways a lot more shit I don't think it was dude. It's got the it's got the claws man and the teeth but look how dense that thing is though bro dude is flesh So I think I'm going with the grizzly bear bro. See I don't know I got gorilla on so a grizzly bear average male is three and a half feet between 400 to 700 pounds Wait a grizzly bear yeah says so online average now 400 to 700 pounds Hold on let's ask the internet That's what the fuck was he asking My internet my That's so racist of you my internet is better than yours. Oh, yes. I'm a better operator of the internet. I mean okay They are newer to the internet over there. I know you guys have been it in shit Who wins in a fight a grizzly or a silverback gorilla Who wins in a fight In a real life fight between a grizzly bear and a gorilla the grizzly wins almost every time and it's not even close Yes, he reasons Key reasons the grizzly wins massive size advantage a grizzly can outweigh a silverback two times the three times it's size Claws versus bare hands a grizzly has four inch claws the cattair flesh break bones And puncture deep internal organs Just like I told you man when you guys are gonna keep quit doubting me durability Grizzlies have fixed skin and layers of fat you ever seen a grizzly bite another grizzly They can't fucking hurt him dude The gorilla is not gonna fucking get in in that skin killing power A grizzly's bite and swipe strength is designed to kill massive animals like elk and bison a gorilla's bite is strong But it's fighting styles mostly intimidation grappling and biting not mortal combat against things twice its size People who think that a gorilla can be the grizzly are retarded that's not what it's not say that all right It doesn't say that it doesn't say that But it does say all the rest of the rest of the rest of it. All right So 100 a hundred humans one gorilla you think gorilla Let's ask it about the hundred humans I think it's gonna I feel like people have eggs They say you got to like attack it all at once. You got to just like overwhelming Yeah, I could see that bro, but like you'd have to have some dumb ass dudes to go up there the first guy Yeah, or he just all have to go at the same time and just say fuck it But there's gonna be that I don't think that's still gonna work. There's a dude one guy that like I everybody go on three once you and sits back That'd be me That's me You guys got this you good good job guys A hundred humans can absolutely beat a gorilla in a fight, but only if they work together and fight strategically If they charge him blindly a lot of people who get seriously injured or killed first So yeah, basically yeah, no man Hmm gorilla kills dozens before getting overwhelmed Maybe only five to ten people get badly hurt or killed if they're coordinated I mean, how to do this a lot of it realistic outcomes a hundred humans deep defeat one gorilla at a heavy cost If they don't plan or use tactics at a lighter cost if they swarm and coordinate immediately Yeah, yeah, I don't think that's gonna help Here's a quick visual imagine a rugby scrum but a hundred people versus a silverback half grab and hold the gorilla down half a tack choke break joints smother it The Indians rape the gorilla Oh All right to say that either All right, so we have that solve we solved it a hundred humans can beat a gorilla and a grizzly bear Well definitely beat a gorilla so you guys could quit fucking talking about it that's settled. Yeah, it is settled settled a jerked All right and recess So what's up? Yeah, well, let's get to our cruise man. I just wanted to address that If guys if you want to see any of these pictures or articles links videos go to Andy for solar.com You guys can find them there Um, but that being said, let's hop into our headlines Let's talk about the first one before we a little intro. I guess the first one It's been getting a lot of flak Trump's blue suit at Pope's funeral draws attention have you seen this It's everywhere people are fucking complaining about it Um, this is okay complaining about no shit this lady Vanessa Friedman Trishie likes bagels President Trump it seems is fully committed to going his own way when it comes to international relations even during the funeral of the Pope On Saturday he was joined as he joined other world leaders to pay his respects to Pope Francis He stood in St Peter Square among President manual my crown of France who was wearing black Prime Minister Kier starman of Britain in black President Javier Miele of Argentina in black and Prime Minister Georgie Maloney of Italy In black mr. Trump he was wearing blue. Oh my goodness And not even a dark midnight blue, but a clear sapphire like blue with a matching tie Amid all the black and cardinal red it popped out like a sign. Yeah Oh, yeah, right, right. I mean, it's like newsweek posted it Daily mail posted it right like this one. Yeah, nobody's talking about how it took three days for not in Yahoo to even fucking acknowledge the death of the pope And we're talking about that. Yeah, that's interesting. Oh, by the way, was he there? At all What's what's interesting too is like, you know, this guy posted on Twitter one guy shows up in a blue suit to the pope's funeral My fucker there's 50 dudes in a blue suit. That's the thing bro. Like if you crop out. Oh my god bro listen That's how crazy dude.

There's that when you send the photo to bro And I got shot looking at sapphire suit. Yeah. Oh It's like you don't see the bitch with polka dots back there real talk bro. Like I'm just saying None of these dudes give a fuck to the pope died. They're all fucking virtue signaling. It's beyond Catholic at all. That's just the thing we do Okay, yeah Trump Who wants to trump so bad? Yeah, I just thought that was interesting one. It's a clear thing. Why can't we just criticize people when they do Shit wrong and then give them credit when they do shit right. How about that? That's like what commonsense people do. Oh, they can't do that though. You know why like it's absurd the amount of stuff That they try to find on this dude And you know what I'm saying like that's that's ridiculous. That's what we're picking. Yeah Yeah, well walk right past uh, you know the piles of shit and syringes and homeless people and dogbooks cups crap pipes and Fucking litter right in your own neighborhood just walk my past that shit Don't worry about the you know the the taxes that we pay or the things you know like the blue suit Sapphire Whatever dude. Yeah anyways, I thought I was interested now and you you've had a um, I don't know if you want to call this like a A dream a hope of one day seeing heads on stakes in front of the White House absolutely um admiration right um Kind of close. We got mug shots. I Guess that works uh, White House lawn lined with the legal immigrants mug shots Painless crimes they committed showcasing ice bust and trumps first 100 days.

I know you guys listen to the show man This said this is in cutting it Okay, and first of all if you put all the illegal legal migrants that committed all the crimes it will fill up that hole on Twice now this was my favorite woman. I did like That's that dude. That's so funny. That's pretty good. Okay. That's pretty. That's pretty good It's pretty it's funny how brazen these people are until they like face reality and they get caught and then they like all their eyes out It's awesome. Yeah, it is awesome. So I mean it's not heads on stakes. We're getting there yet potentially you guys are fucking round up there man The other thing you've also mentioned we got we got to move faster we got to get these fucking people out quicker Um, we need more more rest more numbers. Then we just say that we did and then we're having this weekend There was a massive raid US Postal Service Police IRS agents Um, seeing assisting DDA Uh, ICE and FBI in the Colorado nightclub take down where 114 illegals were arrested um, so I mean Moving yeah moving right music clip Got them all lined up So I mean this is what we're talking about this is what I want to see yeah I want to see fences daily. I want to see containment areas I want to see shit that makes people understand that you don't do that here I want to see I want to see some stuff that like borders right on the line of like human rights So it teaches people a lesson, you know what I'm saying like don't come here don't fuck around You know like make them like what they do in in a in El Salvador dude put these dudes in their underwear Throw them in a fucking containment facility I'm being serious. I am listen. You guys think I'm joking shavler heads Embarrass him and then set him home and say don't ever fucking come back That's how it should be yes. We're too nice here bro And you know what it is we're not too nice most people would be okay with this but there's a segment of very loud people that That cry and they have no sense of reality dude. They've never dealt with crime. They've never dealt with real hard shit. They live in mic mansions and the fucking suburbs They don't touch this shit and they're like oh what about the criminals bro these are illegal Migrants they are illegal immigrants. They do not have the rights of the American citizen. This whole shit Yeah, there's no due process. There is no bro. These people do not have the same rights as us Round him the fuck up. They're not put him in their fucking drawers. Yeah fucking shave their heads Fucking set him home and say don't come back or it's gonna be worse You know that doesn't really hurt anybody. It's just embarrassing.

I mean I here's what I think I think they heard the show Yeah, and they're trying to appease us. They're like fuck Andy and DJ or pissed off And we better do a range since we got to happen you motherfuckers better step it up bro. Okay. This is a good. This is a good start Good start how many people 114 okay, we only got like 19 million 800 left to go It's a step in the right to yeah, okay Another good step in the right direction. We also talk about a rest on this show Right a rest need to happen. We've called for it Um DHS Wisconsin judge shielded illegal alien charge with strangulation and domestic violence Got arrested Red obstruction of justice. This just came out This was a press release. There was actually two two judges That have both been charged and arrested um On judicial misconduct and obstruction of law enforcement. What was in New Mexico, right? What was in New Mexico? And one in Milwaukee um the one in New Mexico was charged with evidence tampering um a judge by the name of uh Judge cano Okay, who was actually seen in pictures with the illegal yeah, MS 13 Absolutely um and then this uh hogan this judge in Uh, Wisconsin. She tried to hide an illegal alien from getting deported by deport deportation agents that were at a courthouse And so she no she brought him into her office and let him go out the back door. Yeah, and they ended up catching him in just so we're clear She hid the guy and scuttled him out the back door. Yeah, so this is from the official report It says according to court documents federal agents arrived with the Milwaukee County Courthouse Intending to arrest flores Rues and a public hallway following his court appearance before judge Dugan Upon learning of the agents presence in the hallway judge Dugan allegedly confronted and ordered federal agents to leave the courthouse after being married aware of a valid immigration arrest warrant Judge Dugan told agents that they needed a judicial warrant and demanded that they go to the chief judges office Once the agents were no longer in the vicinity of her courtroom judge Dugan allegedly elected not to conduct a hearing on flores Rues as criminal case Despite the fact that victims of his offense were present and instead personally Escorted flores Rues and his attorney through a restricted jewelry door exit Not typically used by defendants or attorneys his doorway led to a non-public hallway through which flores Rues and his attorney Exited her courtroom according to the affidavit judge Dugan's actions directly resulted in flores Flores Rues temporarily avoiding federal custody. He was ultimately arrested outside the courthouse Following a brief foot pursuit So yes, so she's been charged Cash Patel put it on uh Twitter No one is above the law. Yeah with the picture of her in handcuffs getting into a FBI vehicle That's a play on Joe Biden's saying. Oh, yeah, you mean this one. Yeah. Oh, you got it No one is above the law on December 1st 2024 a month before he pardon his whole entire fucking family For crimes that they never committed. Yeah, right, right. We may have committed. Yeah Now the crazy thing is right we talk about justice right and you know as that happened Uh these activist judges are now starting to rebuild hold on. I'd like to mention something real quick There's more to that story That judge cano cano whatever in New Mexico. Yeah There's speculation going around allegedly That I guess his daughter is a big influencer on the internet with like guns Hmm and is a colloduty character and uh, yeah and apparently But allegedly I don't know if this is true or not but That he may have been using her weapons to commit crimes What yeah The immigrant or the judge itself no the gang member jeez yeah Allegedly but I mean dude it's fucking weird. That's crazy. It's I mean he was in his house with a mayor I know licking it up. Yeah, I know dude. I don't know what deal is it's crazy. Yeah, it's uh, but I mean that's the I don't want to say that's true or not true But I mean it that's The rumor yeah, I guess it's wild man do these these these judges are out of pocket man It's out of pocket and the people that are trying to like you know Protect them and fucking stand up for them. They're stupid bro. They're not just out of pocket pocket. They're they're Delusional about the power that they hold in this country. They do believe they're above the law And they don't believe that they can be arrested. They don't believe that and they they're consistently especially with this uh situation with the migrants Standing in the way of us getting our country back to what we want it to be You know, and I don't think that like we talked about last week. I don't think it's okay that Judges at any level stand in front of the people's will you know, there's there's 80% of the country right now That once these people gone and these These judges most of whom were financed by who oh Different activist groups that somehow lead back to act blue and guy people like George Soros Who have funded these people these judges campaigns now if they funded these people's campaigns Don't you think it's fair to to say that they're probably telling them to stand in the way of this happening And what they're probably telling them is delay delay delay delay So that Trump can't get anything done And we end up with a situation in four years where those people are still here can potentially vote Right for the new fix that yeah their side again and so like dude these judges First of all here's the facts of the matter these people are here illegally They don't have the rights American citizens have they do not have the right to do process or a trial And that's how they're trying to hold up this this deportation effort by the Trump administration They are pretending as if these people have civil rights American civil rights Just like everybody else and they don't so they're wanting to do a trial for You know fucking 20 million people, you know what I mean that's impossible right so When we have a situation like this You know Who knows what's gonna happen? But You know what I find very amusing is how a lot of the voices on the left keep saying This is not normal. This is not normal behavior. Well is it normal behavior to Shut the entire country down for fucking two years. Is it normal behavior to You know to to prosecute a next president Radist home arrest him Charging with bullshit crimes you we're talking about judges that are violating legitimately the Constitution Okay versus made up shit That has come out to be made up by people who hate this man And you that's normal right you know like Okay Let's not forget what they did. Let's not forget they want you to forget they want you to say Oh my god, that's not normal. Look what he's doing. He's above the law. He's ruining democracy Yeah, well, we aren't a democracy. We're a constitutional fucking republic, okay? So let's get that straight first but These are the people these judges are the people like the what was the weirdo up there in New York and then the Bragg the prosecuting attorney Yeah, that guy and then Latisha James and fucking Alvin brass Yeah, and it dues down in Georgia Like all these people those are the fucking traders to this country including these people and so The reality of the situation is is there's probably going to be a lot more judge arrests And I hope there is I really do bro These people are not supposed to be Intertwined with political narratives. That's right. I mean dude the lady justice has a blindfold on for a reason and clearly Clearly that is not the way our system is working right now. They ripped that bitch off. Yeah, they did They ripped it off One of the things people like this I will refuse to hold court Activist Wisconsin judge threatens boycott After Hannah Dugan charge was shielding illegal alien from ice So a leftist judge and saw your county Wisconsin is threatening a courtroom boycott After a fellow judge was accused of shielding an illegal alien from federal authorities judge Monica Ishaam on Saturday issued a strongly worded email to judges across her state laying out her plans Quote if there is no guidance for us and no support for us I will refuse to hold court and branch to then saw your county I will not put myself or my staff who may feel compelled to help me or my community and harms way what about the thing wait Okay, go ahead. Yeah, I mean what about them? What you're putting them in harms way you're So you being arrested as harms way right? What about all the illegals and all the crime and all the bullshit that you fuckers refuse to Prosecute over the last number of years The Hannah Dugan lady like I said the illegal migra who's not supposed to be here Who was charged with strangling a fucking victim the victim was in that courtroom To see a judge who's supposed to be blindly proceeding over this case Escort that fucking dude out to avoid fucking be it like listen dude It's what I've been telling you guys for years. I know you know, bro, but these are communist These are not leftists. They're not these are full blown fucking communist insurgents Who are allowing these people to walk free Hoping that it creates more death and more destruction in our communities That's what the part that people are not understanding That it's intentional. Yeah, but it isn't it's intentional that they're letting these violent criminals go to Cause more disruption in the communities All right, that's intentional. Do you think they want to clean up the streets when Donald Trump's in office Not at all. They want people getting stabbed. They want people getting shot They want the community feel in the pain. Okay, that's the point. All right, and that disruption creates division When we have division we they get control. So this is this is intentional. It's not like oh, they're they're just some activist and they're They're worked in it. No, these are evil fucking people Evil people. They're willing to push in a political agenda through their power That hurts the people that they are obligated and have an oath to protect That's evil shit Dude, it's like it's like what president bouquet lays said of El Salvador bro He's like many people criticize me for jailing a few thousand people I don't look at it like that. I look at it. I liberated millions Like that's what it's about and like they completely forgetting about the fucking sit like bro. They who's for in Yeah, they're not forget. Yeah, they're not forget. That's what I'm saying. They're not forgetting. Yeah, that's the play Yeah, I do. It's crazy, man. That's crazy Um, yeah, I say arrest all of them arrest this fucking e-sham lady arrest. Yeah, I think she should be arrested too I'm judged that like is is doing any of that shit any of the activism shit And you know, it's crazy, bro. I saw this fucking post this dude posted how could we never see far right after this judges right right Right. Yeah, where is it at? I saw this fucking though. There's do post I couldn't I tried to find again. It's all over the weekend But this new post on Twitter is like uh If it like it was a quote like if any judge stands in the way of the people's will then you know I will personally have them remove from office and it was like if you think you know If you agree with this statement then you're a vile person because that was Hitler that said that in my trying to compare it to like what trump What's happening right now? It's like bro, bro Stop Stop it Listen any judge that violates the oath that they take That protects criminals and doesn't prosecute violent crime and releases people and doesn't press charges and dismisses all of them should be in jail. Yeah because they are They are abandoning their duty to the people that they are intended to serve. Okay These people have a job and it's one of the most important jobs in our civilization It's about holding accountable people that break the law and that is not what they're doing in fact They are intentionally not doing that For the reasons that I just stated for more death more destruction more division more crime More disruption in the community so that they can create the division they need For control that is what the fuck that's about So I mean you know To arrest that's cool. They got about you know a couple thousand more to go. Yeah, right of people in the system So we'll get there, you know, but maybe there maybe maybe there is a turn This also came out Today actually president trump now demands act blue and Adam shift be thrown in jail crooked Adam shift responds in full panic. You see this one? No, but I mean he should have been jailed long time Because a long time ago, but yeah, so president trump signed a powerful memorandum last week ordering a full federal crackdown On the legal campaign donation practices specifically targeting the embellished Democrat fund right Fundraising platform at blue and calling for crooked Adam shift to be thrown behind bars So the memorandum outlines a couple of things um It uh one is strictly prohibits making political contributions in the name of another person As well as contributions by foreign nationals Press reports and congressional investigations have uncovered deeply troubling evidence That online fundraising platforms have enabled schemes to longer excessive and prohibit contributions These activities undermine the integrity of our electoral process I direct the attorney general in consultation with the secretary of the treasury to use all lawful authority to investigate these allegations And take appropriate action to enforce the law. So uh trump pushed this out It was in the uh truth that he pushed it out Um, here it is. That's hopefully act blue the Democrats illegal scam use to raise money including From not allowed for contributions is being looked at by authorities the dims only know how to win by cheating Something which they do better than any group or party in history But now with their terrible policies and candidates and with people like crooked Adam shift who demanded a full pardon from sleepy Joe Leading the way and is almost impossible to reach their money goals the USA is wise to these scoundrels and crooks Also, why did the auto pin give shift a pardon by new nothing about it who operated the auto pin That is the biggest question me and asked in DC. They almost destroyed our country. They should be in they should all be in jail Yeah, I agree. So uh go put them in jail. Yeah, let's do it. So go put them in jail Like it's very clear like is you asking for permission from us like what did we hear here shift thing? What do you say Donald Trump is back to attacking me today because the economy has been in a tail spin under his economic mismanagement Oh really that's why he's attacking you And so have his pull numbers yeah his pull numbers are down because he's not arresting fuckers like you man That's why the the pull numbers are down Because he hasn't fully done the things he said he was gonna do quickly Okay, meaning deportations people want to see mass effort. They don't want to see a hundred at a time They want to see thousands at a time. All right That's why the pull numbers are down the pull numbers are also down because We were promised to crack down on the corruption which has not happened yet That's another reason the pull numbers are down another reason the pull numbers are down is because we haven't heard a fucking thing about the child blackmail operation that is known as the Epstein list and the crap down on all the celebrities that are leveraged by it That's another reason the pulls are down the pulls are down because of those things the polls are exactly down Adam shift because you aren't jail yet Okay, so thank you for pointing that out And then he goes on to say and the last thing he wants is people holding him accountable Attack me as much as you like mr. President. I'm not backing down. Well That's the only play you got Because if you're back down they're gonna get you anyway bro So what do you think is like nickname in high school with fucking penis face Look at his fucking face it looks like a dick hole like it's all shift my mouth it looks like it looks like the fucking tip of a dick Yeah, old shifty. Yeah, old penis face So So dude that let's be real that's why the polls are down bro Anybody with any understanding of the economy understands like we talked about That it's gonna go down before it goes up, okay, and at least these motherfuckers are honest about it instead of lying and saying inflation is transitory. It's while they intentionally created, okay, so I mean speaking to be involved at last little piece on this that just also got released. I'm sure you've seen this Teriffs will lead to income tax relief even elimination. They should so now it's getting there, bro This got tweeted out yesterday. Yeah, what's the poll numbers gonna happen whenever whenever Everybody gets their fucking income taxes Removed yeah, right we're gonna see poll numbers at 99% yes, right? Right? Yeah, but you tweet Post of this on truth souls yesterday saying quote from tariffs cut in many people's income taxes will be substantially reduced maybe even completely eliminated Focus will be on the people making less than 200 grand a year also massive numbers of jobs are already being created with new plants and factories currently being built or planned It will be a bananza for America the external revenue service is happening Well, look um, it needs to be all No, it needs to be all I'm not against alt. I would like to see $200,000 a year or less no tax Everybody else 10% flat tax no matter what okay, that's it You still have a fucking surplus bro 100% if you clean up the spending Right if you clean up all the spending you'd have enough money to run everything five times as good as what it actually is and You know most people don't understand Basic economics when it comes to running a business, but this is very simple You have your revenue in you have what it costs to run shit And then you got what's left over and what it costs to run shit is highly when it when it costs to run shit is you know Five times the amount you're bringing in you got a problem And so they need to bring it the cost down eliminate all the waste Which allows them to do what we're talking about here and Now I will say this you know him saying oh a new plants and factories being built or plant I think it's it's great to have the American made products But let's not pretend like unless you do something about AI technology that that isn't going to be all automated shit You know what I'm saying? So let's let's be honest about where we are um Because Unless there's some sort of regulation or major tax cuts For company like tax elimination for companies that employ Humans versus AI Um, it's gonna be it's gonna be all AI Why why the fuck wouldn't it be? Yeah, companies are gonna do that and look and dude the thing is is The consumers could control that but they're not they won't I don't think they won't even be left up to they won't do it Like everybody knows that Amazon's bad for the fucking economy Everybody knows that it's virtually a monopoly on commerce and it's it's damaged Monument pop business in a in a irreparable way and to bezos is credit. He's brilliant But that doesn't mean that that's an ethical thing okay and customers Instead of Say hey, I'm gonna buy from the little guy. They just buy from Amazon So like when they bitch about it like the reality is the behavior shows what they truly care about What they truly care about is how fucking easy it is and uh, you know, that's a shame because that's eventually gonna cost a lot of people their jobs You know, I mean, I think I don't think that it should even be left up to the consumer like that's where government is supposed to step in Yeah, but here's the thing like hey like we have a here look out Okay, but here's the thing. Yeah, what if we do that and then none of the other countries do it Then all of a sudden we become the stone age manufacturers versus The you know what I mean? So we have to be honest about About what's going on? Yeah, it's delicate man. It is definitely delicate, but last little piece So we're a hundred days in a hundred days in office And I knew it was coming. I honestly would have thought it would have happened a lot sooner um But uh It's here after a hundred days Let's um let's go to this weird looking guy. Let's hear what he has to say This is Congressman Shri Thanedar Donald Trump has already done real damage to our democracy But defying a unanimous nine oh supreme court ruling That has to be the final straw is time we impeach Donald J Trump The court said the wrongfully deported Kilmer Garcia must be allowed to return and receive due process Trump ignored it. He ignored the constitution He ignored the very checks and balances that keep our democracy intact This isn't an isolated incident is part of a dangerous deliberate pattern. That's why Today I introduced a resolution to impeach Donald J Trump Outlining seven articles of impeachment All right, we shouldn't allow non-natural U.S. citizens to serve in our government any capacity That's where we have we have a major problem here. Yeah, okay. Why do we have people who weren't born here allowed to serve in our government That's not right Okay, this is the kind of shit they do They come in and try to make their fucking our country like theirs Well, if that's the case then fucking stay where you came from yeah, right, right It is a bit you know, it's a big problem No, it's a huge problem and nobody wants to say it for what it is bro This is if you're not a natural born American you should not be fucking serving in our government And people will say well the first founding followers were all from fucking England. Yeah, that was fucking two hundred fifty years ago We have our own culture here now, okay? Allowing people from other places to move here and then make decisions about this country And then like in Ilyan Omar's case make public declarations of her Loyalty being to the people of Somalia over the people of the United States It's a problem. Yeah, it's a huge problem. So and by the way Who could take this guy serious bro? Hey I'm seeing like like where is he from what states he from Michigan? Yeah, how the fuck you guys vote for this guy What's wrong with you? There's a lot happening in this video. Yeah, what's wrong with you See we're still dealing with with with a complete now dude. We're dealing with the complete um Complete ignorance of people Mean what I mean by that is there there are folk the productive members of American culture have been focused on building things in productive and It's allowed The I was taken off the ball of political culture for a long time and now we have fuckers like this You know what I'm saying like that's not an American that's not an American. I'm sorry Who's an American? Well, not somebody like that. Yeah, like you know You might have came here and taken a test and become a citizen But yeah, you're an American. It's cool. Be a citizen. But a natural Americans Only should be serving a government. I don't care if you're Indian heritage or whatever, but you should have been born here Yeah, because there's only way to guarantee that your loyalty is to this country You know what I'm saying 100% This guy doesn't have I don't know bro. That's just my personal opinion. I think two pays should be outlawed Is that what that is? I'm assuming that I don't think so. I think that's just a terrible haircut. Oh bro. That's a two-page, bro That's a two-page. Yeah, I don't know. Well if it is he gets money back Yeah That's the outlaw, bro That's what these guys are gonna do, bro Is they're gonna fucking try to impeach him and hold shit up and play it. There's all this bullshit Brawms, so everybody's tired of it. It's like here we go. Yeah, everybody's tired of it. Everybody's tired of this country being Completely against the interests of its own citizens and then for them to sit there and pretend like You know, it's Donald Trump that's causing all of this shit like it's not Okay, he's exposing what the fuck you guys have been doing I don't know dude. I'm tired of it. Yeah, that's sick. The just the the the the legal law fair You know Like Everybody up there Should be working towards making this country better and that is not the case The left completely They do not have a real policy. They do their real policy is to destroy this country This one's like when's the last time like I'm a thought experiment here when's the last time We've seen anybody from their side Have any talks about any type of like bipartisan You know, I'm saying come together like let's let's at least solve something When was the last time you heard anybody over there talk about an actual strategy for anything Like hold on. Where is it all they do is call names. That's it. All they do is attack All they do is point out superficial shit like oh, we were blue suit sapphire. Yeah, we don't hear any productive conversation from that side. We don't hear any because they don't want any production, okay, they don't want anything productive All we hear is attacks and bullshit and name calling They don't have anything else they have nothing else. I feel like the I saw the minority leader or whatever like He had a group of his fucking, you know Colleagues and constituents they sat in front of the fucking capital for like six hours or some shit like that like What is that solving bro like what what is their children? Meanwhile your communities your actual constituents are fucking Being raped being fucking killed like make sure go sit on the capital steps for six hours DJ They can't try to fix it when that's what they want yeah They can't try to fix what's going on in their neighborhoods When that's what they want and people need to quit giving them the benefit of the doubt and saying I don't understand why they're not doing that because how let's let's think about it like this If your intention was to destroy Your inner cities and destroy your country and flood it with migrants so that they would Replace American culture just like they've done in England just like they've tried to they're trying to do in Ireland Just like they've done in Germany Dude these countries France Germany Ireland England their natural culture, okay, and they're they're thousand-year-old traditions are fucking done Because of the policies that these people in our government also support Okay, which is the globalist agenda. It's about removing inner Independent cultures from the world so that there can be a global Unity class of worker bees and they aren't English they aren't Irish they aren't American they're They're They're all one race they're a mulatto mixed race and They want that class and then they want the upper elite class and that's what they want so They're trying to destroy Thousands of years of fucking historical culture through migration Intentionally that's no different than a fucking genocide. It's just a different way of accomplishing it. All right, so When we think about what they're trying to do How can you try to do that and then stand up and talk about policies That oppose that agenda Right, what are you gonna say? You know what I'm saying because that is what you're trying to do So they don't have anything strategic to talk about all they do is talk about Names and and and I'm offended and you know you you call me this and then they call you names racist Big it, you know anti-Semite all this shit while they literally erase the culture of America Intentionally for their own benefit and and are are not our benefit what's the difference between killing All the English people or just sending in More migrants than there are English people and just replace them. What's the difference and then I asked them if they complain about it Cultural genocide. It's it's the it's the it's the breeding out of an entire race of fucking people And then they tell you when you pointed out that you're fucking racist. That's what it's a hate crime. Yeah, so so you so the English people don't have the right to say Hey, we have a right to exist. We like our banger's a mash. I mean, I'm just saying do we not do we not all agree that French people have a right to exist? Do we not agree that Irish people have a right to exist? What what's that's not racist? It's racist saying they don't and they project and use these names and they've done it very effectively globally To shame people because people are good people. They're not racist and they don't want to be called racist But at the end of the day There is a cultural genocide going on by the globalist And everybody's waking up to it. I mean, we see the protests in Ireland. We see the protests in England Dude, you fuckers over there better fucking rise the fuck up dude. Are you you guys are gonna be done like for real You still have a little opportunity, but there better be a mother fucking revolution over there to change this Are there won't be anymore Irish there won't be any more English there won't be anymore fucking Americans and that's reality dude Throw man guys jumping on this conversation.

Portugal and France. And Tire City's plunged into blackouts. Transport network shut down. And internet is cut off. And scenes of mayhem. This was wild. This is wild. And there's a lot of interesting updates, but I think I found the culprit. Okay. And it's not somebody that stole their power. What about stealing the copper? Yeah. Why it spread blackouts? Millions plunged into darkness amid scenes of mayhem across major European cities. The power cuts come just days after Spain's power grid ran entirely on renewable energy, including wind, solar, and hydro power for a whole day. It was the first time on April 16th. And there's lots of interesting reports. I got some clips here. I mean, the stuff's wild. Check this out. I'm sorry. It ain't funny. Like, even over there, like the first, like the natural gut instinct of everybody. So just pull off fucking phones and start recording. Well, yeah. There's lights on now. Emergency lights. Oh, yeah. Those are like battery backed up. You know, I'm saying emergency lights. It's the whole fucking country. How long has that been going on? Or is it over? It's no. Oh, fuck no. They're not even close. They, um, apparently, there's this is going on right now right now. No shit. Yeah, right now. Um, they're saying that it's going to take at least a full week to get the grid up. Um, they're already talking about bank runs and fucking, you know, how, how the money system is going to work. Um, but it's been a lot of very interesting things that come out. Um, about this in the causation of it. And so they're saying, uh, that there was a rare weather phenomenon is blamed for spain blackouts. And it may take a week. Oh, bro, it's that Antarctica shit. Was it was a, you didn't see that on redacted that dude to give the interview about that Antarctica base and the earthquake management system and the all the shit they're doing. Oh, bro, I said it to you last night. Did you? I thought you're going to put it in the show. Oh, no, no, I saw you sit there to me, but no, you just ignored it. Well, see, that's how the show is supposed to work. Like I sent shit to him and he's supposed to say, wow, that would be good in the show. But he just ignores it. That's not, that's not what happens. Okay, redacted. Just, okay, I see you. Yeah. So what the fuck was it? This dude who worked down there, testified in front of Congress. And I guess he got finally got pissed off enough and he started talking about. He started telling him all the shit that was going on there. Bro, I got a video we can plug in this. Yeah, hang on. Here we go. Yeah, check this video out, bro. You ever heard me say you're going to drink truth from a fire hose? This is that moment redacted. Just dropped an interview with Eric Hacker. He is a whistleblower who worked for Raytheon station in Antarctica. And everything you've ever heard about Antarctica, this dude just went all the way. He testified to Congress. He says the military industrial complex is upset with him. It's been hitting him with DW. So he says, fuck you. I'm dropping it all directed energy weapons capable of earthquake induction moving storms like North Carolina. He says directly the 2011 earthquake in church Christ church New Zealand was caused by them. And it can be confirmed through the Lee Taylor Clinton emails because that body count is absurd, right? Dude, put thoughts into your head. Levels of technology that would appear to be pure magic to you. And all of us like you cannot grasp you have to go listen to this on YouTube, redacted, just searched that he just dropped it. He also on rumble. He covers all of it and says there are, he indicates the massive military base underneath the Tenfer International Airport. He covers all the bases and the things they are doing to us. However, conspiracy minded you are and however paranoid and whatever you think the government is doing to us, there is some entity embedded within the government and it is doing things way worse and far beyond. Your wildest fucking dreams of how horrible these crooked sons of bitches can be to us. Like you, he puts and ties together the unexplainable mass compliance during Corona is some part of this weapon. And he describes everything all about it. The infrastructure, what it looks like, how it operates, it goes full fucking star trek. He says this is also functioning as an interstellar traffic control system, monitoring the neutrinos released from the engines of interstellar ships. It also can positively charge these neutrinos and that is how they are moving storms and doing all the other wild shit. Oh people, like all the wildest shit you have ever heard about an article, this dude just lays it out and then just gives you the details to it. Like this, the great awakening is upon us and it is far more than just the corruption and the money they have been hiding but what they have been doing with our stolen money. Exploiting us, testing weapons, honestly, says this is worldwide. And even would indicate to you that he says that we are using these weapons worldwide against an adversary indicating that it might not have even been our own government who steered that hurricane into North Carolina. That this is an active thing going on back and forth. Even indicates like how Joe Biden said that Turkey would be hit with something if they are earthquake. If they didn't comply to what he was asking and lo and behold they had that huge earthquake earthquake induction. Holy shit people, my fucking, we are learning some shit, prepare yourselves, go watch that and good luck to you. Now I know that guy, he seems like he doesn't know what he's talking about. But he actually does. I follow this dude. His Instagram is 4 3D printed parts. All right. This is where I get my info. I want to do this. I want this motherfucker on the show, bro. Listen, I'll give you guys his Instagram. You guys can watch his shit. Holy crap. Yeah. So anyway, so I went and watched the redacted video. See, this is good because it like basically summarizes what the redacted video said, but like fuck dude. I believe this guy's been on Sean Ryan too, not this guy, but the redacted. Redacted. But yeah, man. What was his name? You got to go to the redacted. It's the latest. Yeah, his this dude's Instagram is for or 3D printed Ford parts. I don't know the dude's name, but I follow him and he's pretty awesome. Clearly an expert. He's not everybody's cup of tea, but I like it. I would love for him to come on the show. But dude, real talk, man. That's what this when you were telling me about this spain, france name. First thing came my brain. Is this. I mean, I would explain the lot of stuff, right? Like this is why, you know, it's why fat people can't lose weight, bro, because he's putting in cheeseburger visions in their head and shit, you know, DJ. You got to harden your mind. It's what I'm trying to tell everybody. This is why I'm public enemy number one. Now to your point, there was a video going around a couple videos where they were talking about a technology that would affect people's moods and behaviors, depending on what wavelength of light they're more exposed to. Yeah. And most of it is found in all the screens that we use. Yeah. Yeah. It affects your mood and behavior and takes you away from the natural. That's why you should always look at your phone on night mode. Because it blocks all the blue light. Who blocks what? The bad light from your eyes. Yeah. It could be pretty sure that video justifies as factual. The original interview on that are directed YouTube channel is 40 minutes. Who's what's the guy's name? The guy who's being interviewed. Yes. It doesn't say in the descriptions kind of weird. Oh, look at that. Oh, the heart whistle blower. Yeah. Eric Hacker. And I believe he was on Sean Ryan. I think you guys can cross reference that. Yeah. Eric J. Hacker. Yeah. Hey, that shit's real, ain't it? Joe, tell him, bro. Tell him, get in there a little microphone and tell him it's real. Joseph's real is fucking real. Except what we live in the firmament. That's right. I mean, it's kind of weird, but it's discussed in different religions. The firmament. The firmament. Oh, so we're going to have that talk today. Maybe we'll say that for Friday. Yeah. Already in our in. Yeah. Is that part of the. Yeah. Really? That's what I was going to say. It's it's discussed in Quran as well. What's it say? I don't know the details, but. Have you read the Quran? The whole thing? Yes. Really? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I do remember this guy being on the. So we gave me a copy. I started reading it. It's interesting. I mean, it's a lot to read. Keith and I have been having discussions about it lately. Are you converting? No, no, no, no, no, no. We've been talking about the similarities between Christianity and Islam. And there's a lot of coinciding points. I mean, if you look at from the perspective, like you always talk about 10,000 foot perspective, it's all basically the same values. Yeah. And my personal. My personal take is it's a game of telephone that what happened. Well, it could also be the dis the observations through a different cultural lens. Oh, that's true. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I was seeing one of the videos that defined that perspective very clearly. Like you, your coworker will call you something else. Your wife would call you something else. Your dad would call you something else. That's right. You were one person. Right. So people, different people observing you from different points of views have different versions of you. Right. I think that's what happened. That's without, you know, I'm not a historical religious scholar. I do have, I did have one as a co-host for five years and about and have one and nothing. You know, he's going to be doing that. I see a project with me again. And, you know, that's what's always logically made sense to me too. That's my personal opinion. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it could be that. I don't know. So what's going on? What do you think the culprit of this? I think, I think, like I said, the main story here that nobody is like trying to remember is like Spain just went full eco green. Literally just a few days ago. Right. They put their entire fucking energy on renewable power on the national grid. That's stupid. That's what I'm not only stupid. It's bad for the environment. It's worse for the environment than the system that we run on now. We've already talked about this. This one, I'm so like I don't know. I mean, it could be some like they definitely, they already ruled out. It's not cyber. You know, it wasn't a cyber attack. How do you know we? Who rolled it out? Yeah, well, yeah. Yeah. But I think what's more likely is just these dumbfucks keep pushing this energy green new deal bullshit and it's backfire And now they fuck their entire country. I mean that's that's the problem with technology in general, right like even Like we go back to the AI thing You know when we when we start running our civilization on on technology and the skills of how to survive as a human being and the the arts and you know the know how to do things that have supported the survival of civilization for thousands of years When we start relying on technology for all that those skills diminish and eventually go away And the minute that that That infrastructure fails. It's I mean bro. It's chaos. Yeah for sure. It's mass death. It's it's starvation And you know, that's not gonna happen next year, right, but like let's be real dude You know, let's talk about farmers, right? How how you know, let's talk about like our dads, okay? Like Okay, I know it's sensitive subject, but But my point is is like my dad knows how to my dad my dad knows how to take apart Fuckin any piece of equipment Put it back together. He knows how to fucking grow shit. He knows how to Wire houses build. He knows how to do fucking everything. Yeah, and that's that's like that's mystical to me I know how to do some of those things, but now where he knows, okay? But like let's think of like Sal's kids, right? The next generation or your kids gives it gives to me. Yes, dude like they're We're losing things that were dependent on for survival and that's a very Scary situation that is being completely ignored by technology and the people making these plays and I wouldn't be surprised If the play isn't To Large parts of the human race With that exact exercise because When we hear about them talking about depopulation agenda We have to ask why that is why would they want to depopulate the planet? Oh, that's for the environment It's not for the environment. That's not why and we have plenty of space dude absolutely and and yes eventually it would be for that But it's not that now and it's not gonna be that in any time in the near future So what is the reason? Well, I believe that the reason is that They have the technology available at this point in time With artificial intelligence robotics To basically eliminate the poverty class of the world. They're not needed anymore There's no you don't need them to produce anything anymore You can do it all with technology. So the question becomes What do you do with them and what I believe these people have come to Is I believe that their play Is to somehow eliminate all of those people and I think and I'm starting to see this more and more that potentially the play is To get everybody dependent on technology throw the switch off let them fucking kill each other and starve and then turn it back on and fucking they're gone And like some thing those level fuckers. Yeah, yeah, bro. And like dude. I I don't think You know because like let's be real dude. We're talking Like I say on the show natural order always wins. So When they turn the switch off or they do whatever they're gonna do It's gonna be people to have those skill sets that end up surviving and you know and then that will be enough of the population that they need to sustain The rest of the world So, you know, that's Look, that's my deep thinking on it right um And it's probably paranoia, but dude it scares me. Yeah, it scares me what's going to happen To the world that listen something has to be done and nobody wants to talk about it Okay, the poorest people in the world are the ones that reproduce the fastest those are also the people that produce the least Okay, you don't think these fucking elite smart motherfuckers know this you don't think they're talking about it behind closed doors You don't think that they understand that it's ethically gray area or even bad, but they understand like the reality Like they understand and so dude we have to we I don't know what they're planning on doing carry the thing about but dude, okay Let's just This is not me talking. This is me talking from their point of view right how they feel right because I don't think any of this is ethically okay now but If you had an infestation of cockroaches and that infestation was growing exponentially It's a nuisance creature. It doesn't really provide anything it destroys shit What are you gonna do? Yeah, you're gonna figure out a way to fucking eliminate And I think that was what I think that's what the vaccine shit was about I think dude there's no doubt that the vaccine has have accelerated things like the data's there They've accelerated myocarditis. They've accelerated cancers. There's more people dying now to the tune of 40 fucking percent more all Cosmortality than there was in 2019 You see what I'm saying and if they were trying to remove the weakest most susceptible human beings We would consider the intelligence level of the human being okay, and if someone is blindly going to put something in their body or blindly ignore the warning signs or blindly ignore the The path to survival These people are probably thinking like well fuck them You know, and that's what makes me think like the people who resisted They weren't supposed to point out and say all you guys are stupid for taking for doing this and follow along You're like we weren't supposed to try to save people You know what I mean? Yeah, like some deep level thinking there Yeah, and dude if you think about how these people think that's how they think they're fucking evil You know like they don't they don't give a fuck they look at it like this Well if they're stupid enough to take it fucking let them we didn't force them to do anything And dude that's also a satanic thing Like Satanism They have to tell you what the fuck they do they can't just do it So they have to tell you what they're doing And you know When they talk about yeah bro when they get up on stage and talk about depopulation And what they're trying to do and they like bro you got that quote of Bill Gates allegedly saying you know Oh, we got to depopulate the planet with vaccines, you know on that Ted talk which some people say is bullshit It has been very much scrubbed of the internet, but there's still clips of it and some people say it's fake But allegedly that's what he said I mean, he's been on TV arguing for every like remember when he said you see this is what you guys don't know You don't have a choice You know he talks about He talks about these things openly and you don't think that these people have some sort of elite god complex that they make the decisions for humanity That's what they do So like dude, I think we're I think we're gonna see in our lifetime some sort of mass intentional Calling of the human race for the reason that they are not needed the way that they used to be needed Because of the technology available and I think that's completely Evil shit It'd be wild. I don't think I think that's what's happening guys you tell us what what you guys think about that down in the comments let us know Um Shit man, let's get you think about it. It's scary to think about me. Well, and it's also like you know the whole AI thing like I said this to I said this to a group last week You know and and I think I said on the show too, you know unless you're a highly productive human being that can wield the weapons that are available effectively and produce at a high level You're gonna be fucking thrown into the category of useless And they're gonna put you on universal basic income these companies It's like steroids and baseball. Okay, one guy starts using it The other guy's got to start using it and then everybody's got to use it. Okay, so When you have companies Who are not people first they are designed to make a profit starting to Fire their entire Departments and all these things and replace them with AI. We're talking about tens of thousands of fucking people It'll eventually be millions of people when when when when that starts to happen Those people are in deep shit You know what I mean? It makes the American dream completely go away for most people Unless they become effective and I think we're in a dangerous situation where people think they have time they think they have You know five ten twenty years. This is dude. This is happening This is first of all It's 10,000 times bigger than the fucking internet or social media or anything That's how fucking big it is because it's making human beings obsolete and There's two paths humans can go they can go the path of becoming a very intelligent producer Or someone who quote and how they sell it to you is live your life and be happy And but except your poor is fucked because they put you on a universal basic income and you're eating you know the fucking slap You know what I mean like it's in bio Yeah, bro, it's just the whole thing like just boggles my mind and you know, I'm pretty good at You know, you know, I we joke and say you know, I don't miss I miss sometimes, but it's very rare for real I have a very fucking strong good vision. It's what makes me successful in business and um I just I just I have a hard time seeing anything You know Good that's that's for for the people you know what I mean? Yeah, I mean there's gonna be people that win big But it's gonna create a separation of culture and class that is just it's it's a gazillion miles away from each other and and do that That's not right, you know, it's it I don't know man. Maybe I'm ultra paranoid about it, but I don't think I am and I think it's very important for those of you that are high achievers and want to win that that you you know Work hard to become very good at what you do right now Yeah, you know, yeah, man guys jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments I thought in final segment. I had my number three Um, this wasn't interesting one that just popped out um, you actually mentioned it earlier the Epstein uh, where is it at what's happening and um apparently uh, Virginia, Gufre Um, just commit suicide allegedly Now this is a big deal because I mean she was one of the the known victims of this operation She wasn't actually a victim bro. She was a victim, but she was the victim who recruited all the other girls. Hmm Oh, I didn't know that yeah One of the girls that we want to build the other yeah, so she like lure them in right yeah, she's part of it Yeah, she's not just yes. She was okay. Yes. Was she a victim for sure? Did she do a whole bunch of evil shit to help them? Yes, for sure Okay, well that I mean that's important. Yeah, that's important to know um, but yeah, I put it like She allegedly committed suicide and her attorney comes out saying that she had some positive final days And she's casting doubt on the suicide itself Um, so let's dive into this a little bit Virginia Gufre's final days were positive According to the Epstein trafficking victims attorney carry loud in here loud and cast doubt on reports that Gufre committed suicide Because she was in relatively good spirits making plans for her future last Friday It was reported that Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking victim Virginia Gufre died by suicide the 41 year old Was allegedly found dead on her form in near Gabby, Australia Okay, so um It's weird. All right now You know how the internet is nothing really goes away. There was a post that was uh the she made back in 2019 Saying I am making it publicly known that in no way shape or form am I suicidal I have made this known to my therapist and GP if something happens to me and the sake of my family do not let this go away And help me to protect them too many evil people want to see me quieted Right Well, let's be real. I mean a lot can happen fricken from 2019 for sure And also just because someone says oh they were having positive days That doesn't mean shit because the nature of bipolar disorder and depression it can come on for a single day And be so bad that people make a permanent decision to a temporary problem Anybody who struggle with mental health for real understands that it's not You can have five great days and then you know if you're a bipolar person You the neck the the six day you you could be fighting the urge to fucking kill yourself for fucking three days Four days a week straight for sure So it's it's you know these are not You know saying like we hear this all the time, you know, oh he killed himself He seemed like everything was great, you know, like yeah, but dude that's and then they say well He was hiding all these things behind the smile No, that's not exactly how it is I've dealt with these things for a long time personally these mental health struggles It's one of the reasons I live on the live hard lifestyle because it helps me regulate that um but like for me and And For my understanding from the people I've talked to I know a lot of people to struggle with these things um You know when I'm happy I'm not I'm not hiding anything. It's just like the darkness comes dude, and it's like You can't see through it. Yeah, you know what I mean? It's like a storm the storm comes and you're like fuck It's never gonna end and then it just goes away. Yeah, and you feel better Well, that's the other thing too like even in psychology, bro. It's like, you know, you have those good days Typically it coincides with suicide because you now have the energy to actually follow through on any plans you made Yeah, you know, I'm saying and like to your point if she was actually recruiting I'm sure she shows a lot of guilt. Yeah, and has a lot of fucking, you know There's some dark storms, but there's a lot of things that happen to her during this time like her her family disowned Like some of her family disowned her husband left Shit like that. Yeah, you know, now the timeline of events is is interesting And we got to go back we're looking at about a month. Okay, let's look at the last 30 days I'm not saying she that she didn't I'm just saying Or she did I'm just saying like these these statements are a little bit misleading for sure. Yeah, for sure Um, but let's look at like the last 30 days here. Okay, because A lot has happened in the last 30 days so so going back 30 days. She was actually involved in a very serious car accident And which the details of that never really were clear Um, she did like post uh pictures and stuff. They were saying like it was pretty bad She had some some really bad internal injuries, but like How it happened what exactly happened the actual report like Nobody really knew anything about it other than she had this really bad accident Now most recently she did an interview Okay, on national TV um and Layed laid it out pretty bare. I got I got this clip. Let's check the clip out First time in London I was so young Gielin woke me up in the morning and said you're gonna meet a prince today I didn't know at that point that I was going to be trafficked to that prince And then that night prince Andrew came to her house in in London and We went out to club tramp prince Andrew got me alcohol. It was in the VIP section It was i'm pretty sure it was bob cut Prince Andrew was like let's dance together and I was like okay and and We leave club tramp and I hop in the car with Gielin and Jeffrey and Gielin said he's coming back to the house And I want you to do for him what you do for Epstein I just couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe that even a royalty were involved So you got that calls it out on national TV and now she allegedly committed suicide I mean, it's definitely strange, but it not Yeah Why now yeah You know what I'm saying balls out. I mean, yeah, it's been out for a while. So why now yeah, so I don't know man like Look dude I don't know. I don't know. I know this I know being in the public eye especially when scrutinizing It can be very difficult for a lot of people you have to very have a very special personality and be very confident to deal with that kind of pressure To like legit not give a fuck what people are saying I don't think the average person is capable of that you know the cancel culture pressure the attacks the These things are very very harsh for people that aren't equipped to handle those things And I can't imagine you know a young girl Doing these things helping recruit Then having it be a worldwide media. I mean brother. That's just a lot So I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if If she did I wouldn't be surprised anything. I wouldn't be surprised if she did I wouldn't be surprised She didn't I wouldn't be surprised if she's in witness protection I there's so much crazy shit going on with this. I just I don't know. Yeah, I don't know Well, what you what you take on the what you take With where we are with the Epstein list so far I'm not sure What do you think I mean? I don't I don't know because I keep seeing a lot of stuff like oh, it's coming the rest of coming like things But then nothing well, I think there's so many people implicated in it that are in positions of power That are doing everything they can to not let that shit be known And so I just don't know bro. I just don't know. I mean it's it's uh It's frustrating, you know, it's frustrating and I think a lot of it has to do with Israel I think a lot of it has to do with our own CIA And I think those people have a very very very strong stranglehold on what happens and what doesn't happen And I think we have an administration that at least pretends To be trying to get to the bottom of it um But then you know the next day we see Trump, you know with fucking Netanyahu buddy buddy and shit like I don't know what's going on Um, but I know this When you go back to Trump's approval ratings a big reason his approval ratings are like dude when I talk to people about right now Like what's going on? You know what they say they probably say the same thing when you talk to people What do what do the people say when you talk to them? I want the fucking Epstein list. What else? I want these people going they want massive Accountability and we haven't seen it and the minute that Trump starts Bringing the hammer like he said he was gonna do and cash betel starts bringing the hammer like he said He was gonna do and pan-bondi starts bringing the hammer like they all fucking said they were gonna do You will see those approval ratings go sky high. Yeah, it's not disapproval ratings at all right now Like I think that's the other thing people are not like people who are looking around be like what the fuck You told us you were gonna do this. They're not mad at what he's doing. They want more. That's right That's exactly right and I don't know that I don't know if that team Trump realizes that Like I don't know how in tune they are to you know, they rely on all these Professional polling operations bro. You guys should just go talk people on the street You know what I'm saying like dude if you have real count the real conversations I've been having are not You know fucked on our Trump. It's dude. Why is he not doing what he said he was gonna do? You know we We want to do to look we want to see mass Mass roundups of illegals. We want to see Big names going to fucking prison. You know, you start showing us that people will change their mind about about Trump right now But the more he delays it the harder it's gonna be um, but again like You know Donald Trump is a very very very very fucking smart man and You know he plays chess and in chess there's moves that people don't understand if they don't understand the strategy so And he can't come out say this is my strategy So you know, I I'm a wait and see person, but I'm I'm starting to Get impatient like everybody else, uh, and I call it how I see it and that's just I like Donald Trump. I do like Donald Trump Um, I like his family. I know I know some of his family Uh, I know Don junior. He's cool fucking dude. These are all good people um But I can tell you guys, you know, and I would tell Don this right, you know straight up. We have very straight up conversations um The reason people are upset is because not enough of this shit is happening fast enough You know, so if you guys are listening out there in Trump world You know, don't be afraid to wield that fucking sword man because that's what people want. Yeah, the big orange sword Yeah, that it's wing. Yeah Guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think With that it is time for our final segment of the show as always we got thumbs up for dumbest fuckess We're bringing a headline in talk about it. It'll get one of those two options speaking on useless people Um, I thumbs up for dumbest fuck headline reads New New York City ad is scratch and sniff so you can stop and smell armpits on the street Now this might be some like marketing genius here.
