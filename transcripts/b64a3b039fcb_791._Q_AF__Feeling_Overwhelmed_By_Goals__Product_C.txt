no surprise I got some goons for you oh shock we got we got some goons here how many good ones I got three go all right there you go one's right guys Andy let's get better question number one Andy I I'm a 19 year old entrepreneur who just started his journey I've been working and marketing for local companies in my town for two years so this year I decided to start a marketing firm by myself I've been constantly using the power lists since I've started considering I'm at the beginning stage sometimes I get lost in my own mind by dreaming really big I want to do big shit I often think about big business ideas driving super cars owning a big mansion and all the other big aspirations the thing is I get overwhelmed by these thoughts I feel an imposter syndrome because I have those big aspirations but I just started my entrepreneurial journey what mindset should I have when it comes to this thanks to you DJ Medot and the relay F crew this show really puts a smile on my face every morning when I get that notification love from Montreal Canada all right look dude here's the thing all right it's great to have big dreams it's great to have goals it's great to want material things these are all very important drivers especially in the early days when I first started in business I've told you guys a number of times I'm a huge car guy and I've been motivated by cars my entire life I saw Lamborghini Kuntosh when I was eight years old I played with hot wheels remote control cars micro machines cars have always been a huge driver for me and we have a lot of people out here who say oh materials things are not good and all these things bro you can't listen to these people they don't know what they're talking about all right when I started my business we started with nothing we didn't have customers we didn't have the ability to market the internet wasn't a real thing social media didn't exist yet so it was slow and the only way for us to get business during those early times was for us to literally go door to door meeting people shaking hands these are things that people today would never consider doing which makes them the most effective it's a huge it's a huge opportunity but that's another that's another topic but the point is is that these material goals and these material items cars houses boats it's great to have those dreams and those dreams will help you stick out the beginning part of your business it'll help you bridge the gap from starting at zero and getting to a point where you know you have those things but once you have those things your focus and your your dreams are going to change and you're going to mature and you're going to start thinking about the other people that you work with you're going to start thinking about them building their lives you're going to start thinking about how important it is to take care of the people around you and what the mission is of your purpose of business and if you want to shrink the time from when all those things happen stop thinking in terms of your business existing to make money and start thinking of your business as a way to solve problems that consumers have and if you focus in on solving the problems and you take that serious from day one you won't have to go through the lag time I had to go through my lag time existed for 10 11 years but the reason it went that long was because I said I didn't have the internet I didn't have social media it wasn't a real thing it wasn't like it is today which collapses that window down a whole lot and then also I didn't have the perspective of my business being in existence to solve problems and create results for people all right and your business your job is to go out bring awareness to the companies that you work with bring them customers help them build a brand in my business back in those days and still today it was about helping people change their lives it was about helping people get fit helping people change their mindset their quality of life and if we did that and we focused on that the money the results everything else came and so if you're a small business owner out there and your first response to the question of why does your business exist is for you to say to make money you are not seeing it clearly and you will collapse the time by a lot from where you start to where you're trying to go by seeing it as a service seeing it as problems to solve and the better that I solve the problem the more customers I'm going to get all right so where you're at is a normal place or it's easy to get overwhelmed because we're starting at zero and we look at the prices some of these things and we see houses that are 10 million dollars or we see cars that are a million dollars and we see all these things and we're like it's unfathomable whenever you're at that beginning stage because dude you probably got 200 bucks man you're trying to figure out how to eat okay but as somebody who has went from that to where I am now and where I think you're trying to go we just have to focus like you said on winning one day at a time getting very clear on deconstructing the process from where you want to be to where you want to go backwards okay where do you want to go and how are you going to get there and how does that equate backwards to where you are now and what do you have to do to work forward and I would spend that's not something that you can answer in five seconds that's something you need to sit down you need to really think about it's probably helpful to have a whiteboard or something like that and really just work backwards from where you're trying to go to where you are and then you'll know what the steps are to get there and guys this isn't crazy this isn't rocket science it's not magic it is the result of doing the things that you know you need to do even when you don't feel like doing them which is discipline and that's what we talk about with the live hard program and the 75 hard program most people's problem isn't that they don't know what to do or can't figure out what to do it's that they can't do the thing they know they need to do when especially they don't feel like doing it and if you can fix that problem and you can fix the problem of adhering to anything now your options are limitless because you're able to pick any plan you want to pick and you'll be able to follow that plan and get where it is you want to go so my advice to you is to collapse the time frame down by deconstructing where you want to be back to where you are and understanding that if you focus 100% on making the best product the best solution making sure that whatever your customers and your case it's going to be these businesses that you're working with are thrilled with the results that you provide you won't have a problem getting where you want to go all right it's when people start to think about the money that they're going to get from these businesses like most of the marketers that do what you do they're thinking how can we charge this company a lot of money and how can we automate the process and make it easy on us and give them enough results where they're not pissed off satisfy yes and that's where people really mess up they look at it as customer satisfaction customer satisfaction is very simply you doing enough to not piss the customer off they're satisfied right all right does that sound like a business that you can go scale based on word of mouth which is how people buy people don't believe ads people don't believe marketing they go off word of mouth so your job as a marketer is to bring awareness that creates the conversation amongst individuals that said hey what did you see about these guys or did you see this company out here blah blah I say yeah I dealt with them do they're awesome or yeah I dealt with them dude it's totally full shit right okay and that's the conversation so you bring the awareness the conversation happens based upon the results that you deliver and the problem is most people never see that conversation so they think it's not happening and they think they can get by by you know sort of screwing their customers or doing the least amount or charging the most for the for the shittiest product and guys people are just smarter than that they're way smarter than that they're way smarter than you give them credit for they may not to your face tell you hey this is what I think of your product or service but they're not gonna call you back and they're not gonna refer you to someone else who wants you know to grow their company yeah that actually stuff like we you know we we've we've had talks before and you've mentioned this and I'm probably not going to say it as eloquently as you will but you said something to the effect where like you know those you know in that 10 year span of time right you you had nothing wasn't really making any money sometimes all you had was those visions and dreams yes of the kooing touches yes can we talk a little bit about that yeah I mean dude there's a lot of people out there I actually argue with Gary Vee about this quite a bit because Gary is from New York uh he doesn't drive cars yeah that's right he's never been around car cultures so there's been sometimes and I love Gary by the way but there's been sometimes where we've had some back and forth because he's shitting on these he's like man you go out and and other guys do this too you know they say oh you want to be broke go buy cars well look uh yeah that's one way to look at it or you could look at it like for me where I was passionate about cars my whole life and because I wanted to have these kind of cars I worked my ass off and as I worked my ass off and I created more and more and more jobs all right I became more successful and now because I've hit all those financial goals and I have all the material shit that I want um somewhere along the line I could tell you exactly when it was it was 2014 for me it flipped from I need to win to I need to help my team win I need to focus my effort on them I need to help them grow I need to help them and so you know this whole thing of like these material goals are selfish they only are selfish if you never convert over to the bigger purpose and the bigger mission and most people do because I can tell you this once you have a few cars and once you have a nice house and once you have some shit it loses its luster it's no different than when you guys go out and buy a new pair of Jordans and a week later you're like I don't give a shit right it's the same thing only it's on a big scale so what happens is is you naturally cross over from being this person who had all these materialistic dreams to having purposeful meaningful missions in your life that benefit other people and no one talks about that no one ever talks about that because the reality is most people never get there but I'm going to tell you this there are a gazillion times I wanted to quit there I can't even tell you how many times broke literally almost every day for the first 10 years because dude it was we're doing all this work we're not making any money not seeing anything I'm getting anything dude and uh you know those visions and those goals are the things that keep you going when you know you don't feel like keeping going and you know people either get that or they don't but I'm here to tell you and this is the truth and you shouldn't listen to any single person that tells you anything like that your materialistic goals are selfish or to self-centered or there are moral or there bro that's fucking loser talk all right loser say that shit because they're never going to have it they don't think of the big picture when you have big goals and you have big dreams and you do all these things you you become it's it's it's the same thing we talk about all the time you got to be selfish before your selfless and that has to be a natural progression of your life and it has to happen in reality so uh most people never talk about this most people never talk about switching over from you know goals for yourself to goals for everybody around you and the truth is when you make that transition over it gets way better it's way more fun it's way more fun to see your friends win your people win it's way more fun to see people that work for you go out and buy you know million dollar multi-million dollar homes and drive nice car that shit is awesome it is the coolest thing ever but nobody ever talks about that right you know so i yeah man those visions and those dreams this is why i'm a big believer in vision boards as much as people you know might shit on them and say oh you don't look yeah you don't need it but it's a good reminder and i tell you this i think there's a real quantum physical metaphysical reality to visualization and producing reality because when i go look at my vision board from 15 years ago everything that's on it every single mother fucking thing i have every single one it's happened so you know i i don't put any value into people that don't talk about those things i think a lot of people once they start making money they try to act cool like it doesn't matter they try to act cool like they're just doing it like i'm just a winner i just want to compete blah blah blah bro listen dude like what are you gonna do sitting in front of your computer for fucking ever and just talk about you know making money and not do anything with your life right like bro i'm here to live some life bro i'm gonna drive cool cars i'm gonna live in nice houses i'm gonna travel whenever the fuck i want to do and that's that well the truth is a lot of people eat because of that too that's the whole point where we just we were we were just at a company event last night with 700 people at it all these families all these children i was talking to Eric right and he was up there and we were talking about it and i was saying dude you know what's crazy 10 years ago it was just a bunch of us do sit around drinking beer now look at all this look at all these people that are married look at all these kids they're all going to school they're all eating these people are all providing for their families and i was talking about how like fulfilling that is to see which i don't really take too much time to sit down and like smell the roses but when i do it's not looking at my cars it's looking at the the things i'm talking about like last night dude how cool was that seeing all the families running around all the kids running around everybody having a good time dude that is that's what the fuck it's about all because you wanted a fucking coup yeah and everybody's crazy and everybody told me i was greedy and materialistic and a piece of shit for saying i wanted cool stuff so you don't have to pick this or that they happen both if you keep going i fucking love it man i love it guys Andy question number two man uh hey Andy i appreciate all the two dude brother seriously my question for you is on business supply and diversity in products i have a skin care line for men no we aren't crying in the pool while we make them just great ingredients don't lie don't lie i love this guy yeah but just great about the sign up for his frequent oh yeah i understand yeah he says uh just great ingredients from body wash to beard wash and lotions all for men free of chemicals you know the good stuff i offer a variety of men's care line products and all in total it's about seven different items i am planning to add about five more items uh to offer and i was told by a good friend of mine when i showed him what was next that it was a little overwhelming i guess my question is in the beginning because i am only two years in is there such a thing of too many options not being a good thing i think that's a genuine concern all right because a lot of people try to do this in business they try to make as much stuff as they can and what ends up happening is they don't understand they confuse the customer there's there's a theory that's out there and it's real i'm gonna tell you this it's called the paradox of choice and the paradox of choice is basically means when you give the consumer too many choices to make they will make no choice and they will leave all right so you have to make very certain that however you choose to present these products to the consumer that it's not confusing now there's some things to take into consideration with your friend's opinion is he interested in then skincare at all or does it just look like the matrix to him because he doesn't have any interest in it right okay it might not be the best person take advice from because maybe he doesn't give a shit maybe he doesn't have a beard maybe he doesn't care about chemicals being in his shampoo so we have to like think about who are we taking advice from is this a potential consumer is just some dude all right it sounds like it's just some dude my advice would be to go out find some people who are interested in what it is and then ask them and i bet that when you ask them they're not going to be confused by seven to 12 skews most people won't but if you do this if you say hey i've got this beard wash and it comes in this one that makes your beard a little bit softer this one that makes it extra soft this one that makes it that people will say fuck this too confusing i just give me the beard wash right like that's what it comes down to so yeah it's a real thing to confuse your customer and it will push them out the door no question there's all kinds of analytical data that you could find about this especially in e-commerce where you know the more choices the less conversion the more clicks through a website the less conversion it's all based around the same principle which is people get confused pretty fucking easy so i don't think the if every skew that you have is a different skew like let's say ones for hair ones for body ones deodorant ones for beard that's not going to confuse somebody but when you have four different beard washes and five different deodorant that's going to confuse people we won't go buy it okay so that's how you should be thinking about it um i wouldn't put too much into what that guy says unless he is a uh market expert which i don't think he is he just said it was his buddy right moves for yeah don't don't ask your quote unquote buddies what they think about your business all right this is a bigger problem stop asking regular motherfuckers about your business they don't know shit everybody thinks they know shit but they don't know anything it's like whenever you guys were having your baby and all the other women had every fucking thing to say about how you should do your shit right it's the same thing in business you got all these people that have you know they think their business experts because i don't know they bought shit at some point in their i don't know i don't know why they think this that eliminate stand i don't know i don't know where it comes from it's like one of the it's one of the main things people chirping on with zero experience and think that they're completely right and they're most of the time they aren't so you got to be very careful who you ask advice from because most of these people just quite honestly don't know and they can lead you down the wrong path if you listen to the wrong person so when you go out and you say hey man what do you think of my products it should be to someone who's already consuming those products at some level not just some person that your friends with right that you're giving them free shit to tell you that yeah for sure and dude true you know pretty much the rule of thumb is the simpler the better the consumers um they like it simple they like easy they like the choice to almost be made for them because they get confused you know and they don't know what to pick so if you are going to give them a choice let's say uh between a certain product right you want to limit it to three okay that's it that's the the human brain can basically process three options if we're talking about competitive products like other brands it's going to be good better best what's what's the decent what'll get it done what's the in between and what's the absolute best and most consumers falling in one of those three categories and then when we talk about you know skew diversity not talking about diversity amongst one skew we're talking about many different skews as long as you present it in a way that's understandable I think you're going to be okay there's lots of companies out here that's offer hundreds of skews I own a couple companies that have hundreds of skews all right and we do just fine but we present that in a very simple easy to understand way and that's how you got to do it yeah let me actually this to uh going back because one first form started with 2009 how many skews did you have when you guys first started one that was it that was it yep yeah one and then we went to another and then we went to another and then we want listen you got to remember dude I've never we've never taken on investors like this is all grown off of our money so we didn't have you know and by the way that was a huge blessing because and a lot of people get really bitter about this I was bitter about this my entire business career I never got investors I never had anybody give me a loan I never had anybody like you know float me and I saw all these other people that owned similar businesses where they had rich parents or they got an inheritance or they got finance or they raised capital and the thing is I'm very thankful that I wasn't one of those persons because I had to get very creative and which caused me to learn all the skill sets at a very high level and now 10 years later 20 years later if those guys are still around which most of them aren't from back then the reason they aren't around is because they never had to use those skills and they ended up burning through their money and that was that so don't be upset because you're having to bootstrap your business look at it as an opportunity because in 10 years you're going to have skill sets around marketing product development how to manage how to lead you know all these things that make up a real business you're going to know very well where these people aren't because they always leaned on a new check another check another investment another raise another this those people are not great entrepreneurs dude they're actually terrible they don't know what the fuck they're doing there's companies out here who have raised billions of dollars that are run by literal morons because those people have never had to run something from the ground up so don't get upset I know this isn't the question but don't get upset because you have to bootstrap because in a long term you're going to know way more than everybody else and you're going to be way more effective than everybody else so yeah there's a lot to that but at the end of the day man you know you're here not the first company that offer 12 SKUs you know what I'm saying right just make sure you you make it simple you make it easy you make it clear remember if you offer more than three choices of the same skew people's decision might be to walk away it's likely to be like it guys Andy our third and final question question number three Andy I've played in the NFL for the past five seasons in this past camp I was fired for the fourth time and was not picked up by another team I had to try out with the Falcons after I got fired but they didn't end up signing me honestly I'm feeling like a bitch I know I have a lot to be thankful for but I'm pissed I want to be great at something and I'm not sure if I should continue my football journey or go all in on somewhere something else when is it time to call it quits and how would I figure out what to do next right now all I've been doing is training like a lunatic and listen to your podcast getting fired up and pissed off that I'm not making any progress things all right look first of all you are making progress dude you just feel like you aren't football is one of the greatest games in the world because it is literally parallel to the principles of being successful in life okay you're gonna have to work really hard it's you're gonna struggle you're gonna get hurt you're gonna get pushing the face metaphorically sometimes some literally yeah like it's competition yeah there's high competition you got to work with a team all the skills of football are so parallel to business and I'm so thankful that I come from that background and the fact that you do and you've worked your way to that high of a level in that game shows me that you have complete understanding of what it takes to actually be good or great with a team all right most people never have that perspective remember this you've worked your ass off since you were a little kid to get all the way to the top and by the way you have gotten to the top you were there for five years all right that's super commendable and I'm not here to make you know moral victories but like my dream was to play an NFL you know when he snaps I played NFL fucking none all right so be thankful and be grateful for where you're at now you have a decision to make are you yeah and this is this is important are you genuinely good enough are you really good enough okay and in business when you face yourself with that question am I really good enough you have a lot of time to get better because you can play the game for your whole life but in football as we know the career span is very short and regardless if your end is now or if it's three years from now you're going to have to start thinking about what you're going to do long term I would highly recommend business because you're a competitive individual you already know how to work and it's a game and it's a game it is a game okay once you get past the initial struggle of being able to eat and go out to a restaurant order some food you know take people out to dinner all the extra money above that is gravy money all right it's just make your life better but what you have to understand is that that's a game that you could play your whole life all right and because you're already playing this other game you know all the principles to play it forever but in sports bro you have a limited window we don't know how long that's going to be and we got to be honest with ourselves can I compete am I good enough and am I gonna oh am I gonna waste another three years trying to hang on because I wouldn't waste another three years in your 20s dude if you know you're not good enough and you this is not some fantasy shit you know this is not like you're so good you're you could do anything my fuck leaving you I can't do a I can't talk about basketball okay like I'm not playing in the NBA you know I'm saying like it ain't happening dude like I just see you're gonna say and listen to all the the Andy for Sella shit I want but that fucking ball it going in that fucking hoop dude so we got to be real with what we're capable of where we are and you know how things are so I would have a very honest conversation with yourself am I actually fast enough am I strong enough can I play do I have an understanding of the game or am I going to waste the next four years on the practice squad and never get a chance to play all right because I've seen a lot of my friends who have been you know very good athletes but not good enough to be like great or a starter at pro sports and they've spent 10 years in the on the B league race in that yeah dude and then and then they regret it because they're like fuck I fucking wasted 10 years you don't want to be that guy all right have an honest conversation with yourself tell yourself the truth and then make a decision about what you're gonna do the good news is is that you understand exactly how business works and to build an organization even if you think you don't dude my best people that I've ever had in business played high level football because they all get it we got to work as a team if we're gonna win guess what we got to do we got to execute on this fucking play this play that we're getting ready to run right now if we mess that up it's gonna mess up the game so what do we got to do we got to all execute in unison we got to all do our jobs and if we all do our jobs the ball moves down the field is that simple winning is very simple you guys think it's complicated because we got all these knuckleheads on the internet trying to tell you it's this it's that it's this it's very fucking simple what is this thing right in front of your face whatever it is you're working on whether it's a workout whether it's a book whether it's a project whether it's whatever whether it's fucking building a toothpick house whatever you're working on you try and french fries they need to be perfect french fries okay the toothpick house needs to look like the fucking toothpick mahal all right like it needs to be perfect everything we do that's right in front of us if we do that perfect it builds as a habit and this is why people really mess up their lives because let's take the example of the french fry guy the french fry guy he says all I'm doing is cook a french fries man like this doesn't matter but when I get the opportunity to cook the burgers I'm gonna cook some good burgers okay but you never get the opportunity to cook burgers because you don't make good fries all right so we have to understand whatever it is that we have in front of us we do that perfect and when we do that perfect we learn a new skill and more importantly we create a new habit of detail oriented execution and when you take that habit and you apply it to the next thing and the next thing it's not about the fries it's not about the burger it's not about managing the shift at McDonald's it's about the habit that you're creating of executing on the thing that's right in front of your face and when you do that over and over and you build that habit then it becomes unlimited where you can go with that skill because most people don't have it most people say like I said oh man I'm just cooking fries what do you what do you get upset about I'm just cooking burgers what do you get upset about I'm just packing boxes what do you see what I'm saying so most people do what do you get upset about their whole lives and then they can't figure out why they're upset right you have to be good at this thing right in front of you and then the next thing that comes at you be great at that and the next thing that comes at you be great at that and you're developing a habit of greatness and bro I know so many people that are I listen man and I don't mean this to be disrespectful I'm just telling you that I know dudes who who are literally on the spectrum of autism who are extremely successful because they can master what I'm talking about where the normal person cannot they overthink it they can't figure it out one of the most successful dudes I met in my whole life was autistic but the only reason he was great is because everything that came his way was fucking perfection dude and he could he built that habit and then people around him saw that he did it that way so they did it that way and he built a hell of a company by just being great at the thing that you're working on and that's what being great about dude it's about executing perfect at the details over and over and over till it becomes a habit and then everything that comes your way you're executing but getting back to this guy look dude you know what it takes to win you know what it takes to work with the team you know all this secret sauce that nobody understands dude and you should be very grateful to be where you're at with this because dude you just got a first class education on what it takes to win in business if we all execute the play the ball moves down the field if we all execute the next play the ball moves down the field if we keep executing the play the ball goes in the end zone points go on the board we keep doing that over and over and over again all of sudden we're winning championships dude it's that simple okay this is why Nick Sabin back in the day when he was coaching not back in the day last year all right when he was coaching he would start practice over or start a station over if the guys weren't executing perfectly okay so if that's the greatest coach that ever lived or definitely one of them you can't even argue with me on that all right in the books for sure yeah he's one of the greatest coaches of all time John wooden Nick Sabin billbell a check you know Lou Holtz these guys all have something in common and you know what it is you're doing the thing in front of you perfect every single time and that's what success was about bro so have it on this conversation with yourself decide what it is you want to do realize instead of being down and saying man I didn't make it the way I want that's another thing don't dwell after you make the decision just move and go close the book and move on a lot of pro athletes struggle with this they they close the book and then they can't find and then they're lost and they let and they get into alcohol or drugs or they ruin their lives because they can't find a new purpose so close the book bro be proud of what you learn understand this skill set and the equipment and the the the knowledge that you took to win from that experience and start applying it in another place and you know you're gonna get where you want to go you said you wanted to be great as something you have all the tools and experience to be great at anything I fucking love it man I love it that's a hell of a way to start a week yeah guys 80 that was three all right guys let's go have a good week we'll see you tomorrow on CTI don't be a hoe shut the show fuck a stoke counting millions in the coke bad bitch who did slow got a own bank row can't do something
