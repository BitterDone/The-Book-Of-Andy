It's good to be here. Yes. Yes, we went out to eat last night as you guys know Honey is the world's most successful One of the world's most successful bodybuilding coaches, but also mindset coaches and we went off dinner last night and I cheated right in front of him hard I had a bunch of chips and salsa. That was actually that was no to be like four nights ago now. Yeah, we're recording anyway It was nice. It was really good time actually because you know what you guys had a break getting ready for the next 75 hard Which we definitely need to talk about because we're here to game plan. Yeah a lot of people ask me even back back home You know at the headquarters my division headquarters are like what are you guys gonna talk about? I was like that's some top secret shit. Yeah, you know what I mean? so and just to give everybody a little bit of taste of what's going on for 2024 We just finished up the Olympia with my crew we got Derek who won this year Hathi who won to second who had won last year my top two guys at the Olympia who swept you know footflopped But we kept the top two guys that I coach and then see bum Took his fifth Olympia title in a row. Yeah, you know with another dominant fashion And super proud of everybody and now it's everybody thinks it's time to relax You know it's like towards the end of the year and they don't understand guys like us have to level up now Because now you just won, but it's what you do with it now What's the planning look like? What's everything going on with every part of your brand? And so I let everybody know back home. I go look I'm going out there dark. Well, we're all going on vacation or we're doing this. I said great I believe in that too. I want my team to also be able to have some downtime But that doesn't mean I don't Still grind. I still don't work and you and I talk almost every single day Whether it's on texture on the phone and that's what we do is we try to level each other up on everything that we're doing So the key for coming out here was to be able to start Creating the plan for the 2024 domination. Yeah for both of us. Right. Yeah Yeah, one of the cool things that you guys may or may not know and what I wanted to really bring Connie on the show for um You know you're known as a as I think unfairly As a bodybuilding performance coach and and I actually think that's very limited description of what your true expertise is which is total mental performance at a high level when I when I think of honey you guys probably think of all as the limpy titles with a 24 now 24 24 that you've helped coach and um You know, I think people think about that, but I don't think people think about you for what you really do Which is take the highest performing people and get them to think straight And get them their mind correct around winning and what it takes to win and so you know One of the reasons I wanted to have you on on q and a f especially going into new year because this is our last episode going into 2024 Was to really just have you come on to help us answer some questions so that people could like you know see see that party you as well You know i'm saying it's not just protein grams and lift and weights bro. It's it's up here winning is all here and Whether it's bodybuilding or whether it's business or whether it's some other sport or some other Mission winning all requires the same elements. So um I'm super super happy to have you here. Oh, thanks for having me bro. Yeah. No guys Andy honey That's the goal of the toy. Yeah. Yeah, let's talk them out guys. Andy questions Question one Hey Andy, this is a great opener with 2024 right around the corner What are the top three things that we should be focused on in business or personal development for this next year? Top three things we should be focused on well first of all I don't know why don't you answer that? I you know what it really comes down to with anything whether it's like you talked about just a minute ago Whether it's your diet or your training program or whether it's your business plan or how you want to treat your significant other It's about planning how to be able to change your mindset Everything is about habits Creating those proper habits. So for me what that's about is me get my ass out here to be able to work because we work Really really well off of one another because a lot of the things that I work on with you Is just a reflection of what I also need to work on for sure, right? Yeah, okay As we own both own supplement companies. We both all do coaching. We also do things like that are very very similar Even though they're in very different types of um, you know The size of what you do is much bigger than mine But what the intensity of what I do with having to win Olympia title is on a different realm So it balances one another out So for me what I respect about the people that win around me is being able to set goals So I love the fact that I bring people around me that have these amazing stories and being able to follow their journey and set down So I can be able to create my own blueprint for my future. So that next 24 months 12 months that I'm going to looking for 2024 For me is about sitting down and saying how do I set goals and be able to reverse engineer them when I set a diet program for an athlete I don't sit down and say okay, what are we going to do day one? What do we need to look like at the end of the year towards the mr. Olympia and work backwards 12 or 16 weeks out for that prep period That's a phase then how do we need to look in the mid series of that program and what do we got to do in the beginning of the year And how those phases go into phase one two and three So what do I got to do with my mindset? Do I got to wake up earlier? Do I got to be able to be physically stronger so that my mental sharpness will get better right you and I talk about that You do your plunges all of that stuff helps making sure to create mental clarity so Putting all of the ingredients together like a chef that goes into the store They have to be able to get all of those ingredients together to be able to prepare the ultimate meal That's what I do I'm sitting down and going okay, what are all the things that I need to do to put everybody in place? Do I have my sous chef in place? Do I have my front you know Everybody that's going to be on the front end of all of the people that are going to support me for these goals in place Make sure that all those are happening so for me it's about putting the blueprint together. Yeah I think well first of all I mean you have to I think I think that's a great point um I'm going to build on it for a second You know a lot of people try to approach the new year Every year and they say well, I'm going to change everything. I'm going to do it But they don't even really set a target they take more time to plan out their weekend or their vacation or what they're going to do over the summer Then they do their entire year of what they plan to accomplish and You know if we're talking about what are the three things? Obviously, you know Figure out where the fuck you want to be is a big part of it and a lot of people don't do that They just want to start off Doing what everybody else is doing thinking that somehow this is just going to make their situation better And while it might it's going to make the work very hard to do because you lack the direction on what you're actually trying to accomplish So when the work gets tough and you don't have the picture of what it is you're trying to become In your mind very clear you're you don't have that That Vision and that motivation to pull you through the hard times. You know, here's what I think man I think 2024 is probably going to be one of the most chaotic years ever In our lifetimes and how chaotic we don't know yet. I don't know you don't know and nobody knows But the one thing that I do know is that it's going to be tough and there's going to be people to win and there's going to be people that lose and There's going to be people who say man, you know Like all tough times. There's going to be people who kind of Roll back and go into their total shell and say I'm going to wait for times to get better I'm going to wait for things to get easier and then there's going to people that are going to know that other people are doing that And they're going to go extra hard knowing that they can widen the gap between themselves and everybody else And so if you're out there right now and you're thinking like well shit dude, you know 2024 is going to be so hard You know And you're thinking about all the chaos that's happening in the world. You have to see the opportunity in that And the opportunity in that is that most people will wait and they will wait and wait and wait and wait and especially during hard times They like to they like to stop and pause and so that's a trigger for anybody who's a high achiever anybody who has The drive and the ambition inside of them to go hard to go extra hard And so one of the top three things you should be doing well First of all you have to understand that your ultimate weapon in life is your mindset all right It's getting your mind right. It's getting your focus right It's understanding what it is you need to do and optimizing that as much as possible I talk about that in terms of becoming mentally tough Which is why the 75 hard program and a live hard program have become A central focus for so many people's lives because it continuously sharpens the weapon that we go to battle with every day Which starts in our mind flows to our body and then goes outward from there So my first piece of advice for anyone that's looking to make a change in 2024 is that simply dude start 75 hard with us on January 1st There's a huge group of people doing it If you don't do 75 hard make another commitment that you're going to see through to the end But get your mind right first a lot of people try to focus on their body and they say well I'm going to lose weight or I'm going to get in shape or I'm tired of living in this body and the surface level Motivation of just having a better body really doesn't Pull many people all the way through the journey. You have to look at it as I'm trying to create the best version of me And that starts on the inside with my brain and so if you can take on a mental Fitness program and work to recreate your mental toughness Now, you know the other things are going to come much more easily. So my first thing would be Understand that whatever you decide to do It's going to require this this machine this weapon your mind your body your soul And your job going into 2024 should be to Take the opportunity of the time that is very chaotic where a lot of people lose focus and become mega focused Into building yourself into the ultimate version of you that would be my first thing that you should do The second thing that you should do on top of that is like honey said figure out exactly what you're trying to do and start to curtail This machine in that direction, okay? Just sharpening your mind for the sake of sharpening your mind is not the goal Just getting your body in a great position or a healthy position is not the goal That's you do these things for other things. What is the other thing? What are you trying to do? Are you trying to build a business? Are you trying to You know build an organization? Are you trying to build a team? Are you trying to contribute to an organization? What are you trying to do? Use the thing your body your mind your soul the weapon develop that and apply it to the thing and I think the third thing That we all need to do in 2024 Besides you know just focus on ourselves is be selfless in the fact of understanding that We are in a situation in in culture where If we're divided they win if we're united we win and they're going to do everything they can over the next 12 months to make us Fight make things chaotic divide us make people argue over dumb shit like the pigment level of their skin All these identity politic issues and I think being a source of excellence personally Applying yourself forward to a goal and then also being a messenger of unity with your neighbor and your friends And people who you normally disagree with is of utmost importance Because the only way that these people could continue to do what they do in our country is to divide us and make us fight over shit That really doesn't matter and the stronger we are mentally the more focus we are in doing good the more focus We are in doing what it is that we need to do in our lives The better example we set and then if we follow that up with a strong message of hey man Look we're all on the same boat You might think we're on a different boat because you know the media tells you that or the government tells you that but the reality is is That's the trick they pull on us And so I think it's going to be very important in 2024 for everybody to rise above the chaos to rise above the frustration in the anger and the division And really work to Build bridges instead of burn them with people that we would typically disagree with so that we don't lose This amazing country that we are blessed to live in so that's that's kind of how I put it together for 2024 I think it's going to be politically tumultuous. I think it's going to be very very Difficult. I think there's massive opportunity through the chaos for people who look at it and say hey while everybody else is running around with the chicken Like a chicken with their head cut off. I'm going to get super focused massive personal opportunity, but That creates an opportunity to set an example for everybody else that feels like holy shit. What should I do? And if they look at you and they see you taking care of you taking care of your body taking care of your mind taking care of your business taking care of your community They realize that that's what ultimately matters and whatever these people do In our government whenever these people do with our media is really a relevant if we take the power back individually So I think that's the theme for 2024 at least for the people to listen to this show It's become personally excellent set a high standard set a good example for everybody else get engaged get involved Work to build bridges instead of burning them down and uh don't be a victim to the mental games that are being put down on us for the sake of them controlling us remember Us divided is their power us united is our power and that's going to be the that's going to be the way we win ultimately It's going to be by regular people like me and you and all of us out here being excellent and working together Uh to stick together and not be divided by stupid shit these people do So well guys question number two Um, I'm 18 years old and I realized that I was extremely sheltered for most of my life I was never encouraged to play sports or to compete and I've just been floating Trying to figure life out. I fear that I won't be able to compete at high levels in life since I wasn't able to build that when I was younger Can this killer mindset and desire to compete still be learned or is it too late and if so how Well, first of all Dude, you're still a kid like you're 18. You're I realized you're the oldest you've ever been but you still ain't shit yet, bro Okay, you're you're still like barely a sperm That's the reality you're you're a sperm with a fucking head and some fucking arms and legs A little dinosaur you haven't done shit yet. I know you think you're old and they say you're an adult But still you're still a kid dude and the fact that you're aware That you've been sheltered and you're aware that you need to develop this killer instinct and this competitive mentality Really honestly is a solution to the problem in the first place. So the answer is yes absolutely you can become that kind of person um And the way you become that kind of person is by surrounding yourself with those kind of inputs reading about those kind of people learning about those kind of people Getting involved with those kind of people getting on in competitive environments You know, I do think there's a little bit of an element of being a natural born competitor that gives certain people in advantage But I also think the fact that you know, people Like I think some of the biggest fucking killers. I've ever met Come from a background of like what this guy's talking about where they come from a place where they were just okay And they really weren't that competitive and they didn't really understand what it took to win And they became a fucking monster because they realized that space need to be filled in their life And then they dedicated themselves to that. I don't I don't know man Like you've coached a lot of high level competitors I mean do you think it's something that people are born with or do you think it's something people can develop or do you think it's both It's part of both and what I think is that everybody has a chip on their shoulder And what you got to do is you got to figure out what that chip is And some people Don't realize that until a little bit later in life Some people have that because they have a hardship when they were growing up They had lack of they got angry and they end up either getting into a mentality of victim Or they turn around and say I'm going to try to be able to break out of this so I can create freedom Whether it's financial freedom breaking away from a bad home Parent issues whatever it is financial issues What you got to do is you got to take that chip on your shoulder and lean into it I always say what you got to do is take that chip and be able to use it as a block to stand on so you could elevate yourself Make yourself hungry Every single one of my athletes every single one of the CEOs every single one of the people that I've ever coached I found what that chip was and whether they knew it or not I really exemplified to them what it is that made them great And we'll go from good to great great to legendary And what you do is you try to find that within you So if you're 18 years old or 15 years old and you have a you know chip on your shoulder we all did Every person in this room has that Some of us leaned into it more and that's why we've been able to create a little bit better Result, but you have to signify and be able to really Put that out there and say I'm fucked up because of this Some of your friends you guys can really will know some of your friends are either in jail Dead or still drinking trying to find that solution on the bottom of a bottle of tequila somewhere To try to be able to dead in that pain the key is to be able to utilize that pain for fuel to make you hungry When people talk shit about me when I was growing up I use that for fuel because they said hey look he's a one-off guy And he's you know only worked with this person one time or he's guys just he's got lucky You know a broken watch is right twice a day. Yeah, but ain't right 24 times a fucking row At the Olympia level especially yeah, that's how you got to look at it But when you're sitting there trying to do something and when I'll sell my first product for the solution of making A better version of my athlete because I thought there was a lot of shit out there and I didn't make me two products I started my my system with my Products with a $70 non-stim pre workout when the number one product out there was a DMA product that was $29 on bodybuilding.com It was never about that. It was never about being me too. It was about Yes, because you use passion to create a solution Right, but what you got to do to make the best version of yourself is you have to say I need to be able to find out what is going to fuel me what I'm passionate about and think about the profit After the passion the passion comes first and create that solution So I just feel like anytime you try to level up You got to be able to do that and you can never do that with negativity around you That's the number one thing is that at the end of this year or the beginning of 2024 If you're listening to this podcast get the fuck rid of negativity because I will tell you it's contagious And it's cancerous you need to get rid of it And if you don't you will never get to where you want to go period I think that's I think there's a good point there too a sub point When you're one of these people who who really hasn't done anything right like I think a lot of people on the internet Like this person asking this question They hear all these crazy stories of people who are successful now about how they were in the past or the like We hear all these like and ridiculously overhyped Rags to riches stories of people who started like I was eating dirt on the street like That's where I survived arm was mud You know what I mean like Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here bro. Okay, like let's be real most of these people are exaggerating their hardship story all right That's first thing first Most of these people when they become great there's very few humble great people there There's there's a lot of people actually I'm going to take that back There's very few humble good people and all great people generally are pretty humble when you get them around because they Humility is required to get that good um But what happens is as we look around and there's a lot of people that appear to be successful or appear to be winning And they talk about how they always have this competitive drive and they always have this fire and they always And it makes people like this who might come from let's say a decent background or You know a middle class good mom and dad they think that like they don't have the enough pain in their background That's bullshit, bro You have Enough juice to do the thing, but what you need to do and what honey honey said and and and clarify Is you have to remove the negativity? So you have to be prepared like when you start to decide to be something That's different than what everybody else your entire life has always known you as you're going to face a lot of negativity a lot of criticism A lot of questions. Who do you think you are? What are you trying to do? Do you really think you could do that? People like you don't accomplish those things and it's going to be discouraging. It's going to take you from a place of Drive and hunger ambition and dreaming to A place of doubt and questioning and saying man, I don't know. Maybe they're right. Maybe they're right. Maybe maybe this maybe I'm not cut out for this Maybe Maybe this isn't my thing. Maybe this isn't for people like me. Maybe I don't have a tough enough story Maybe maybe I don't have any skills and dude. I don't buy into that. I think I think it's very important for you To honor this is the reality dude If you're going to step out from what you have always been Into something new you have to be prepared to cut all of the old out Because all of the old will constantly be in your ear chirping making you doubt making you question making you slow down Making you hesitate and all of those qualities will keep you from becoming that thing that you're trying to become So it's very important for you to understand that when you decide to become that version of yourself that lives inside of your heart that nobody else even fucking knows about Okay, because you're too afraid to talk about it because you're afraid everybody's going to laugh at you First of all, that's the thing you're supposed to become whatever that is that's what you're supposed to become You need to listen to that But secondly when you start to become that all the people who knew you your entire life including your parents And if you're very lucky you'll have one or two of those people back you up on it and say I think you should go do that But most of the people are going to doubt you most of the people are going to question you Most of the people are going to think you're fucking crazy and they're never really going to believe in fact We were just talking about a Bible verse Uh that you you gave to me which was uh which one was it Matthew 15? I believe four seven or four eight that was forwarded to me this morning and it was something It's right along the lines of what we're talking about yes Yes, it was uh, I'm sorry Matthew 1357 and it said no pro in so many words no prophet has honor in his own town and that means that when someone comes in to try to preach within their own where they grew up It's very list it's very difficult for those type of people who saw you come up to actually listen to you Yeah, because they feel like they were part of your journey before that so they're like is he really they showed out Right happened to me as a bodybuilding trainer I One of the and I never knew I even did this. I just did it My own town of San Jose, California people just I just they're like hey this person's trying to compete against you This guy's kind of trying to talk shit about you all these local trainers I just kept my blinders on and all I did was kept my head down and I focused I got on the plane I went to the mr USA I went to the nationals. I went to overseas. I did whatever I did But I didn't look at all the people around me and I wasn't trying to get them to be able to compete against me or vice versa All I did was try to be able to go through and hit wins go for the w Bring in my people the best I possibly can and move on and then I started working some NFL athletes That I was walking with bodybuilders because I barbed I was bodybuilding at a young age And so bodybuilding was always my passion, but I was always interested in all the other sports to be able to try to perfect their physique or their performance to the best of my ability But I never went back and tried to focus on the people around me in my given town or area because there were always I mean to this day if I go back And my wife sells store sells evagen first form Axon select a billion different brand sea bum's brand all of our friendship. Yeah all of our friendship And we do all of that But what's funny is these people that are been friends with me for 20 30 years. I'll never see them use my product And and it's okay There's there's some people that and they come over and they'll congratulate me on the wins and whatnot But it's because it's hard for certain people to be able to actually Absorb what your successes were because it's a reflection of maybe what they weren't able to do and that's okay But you gotta understand that So sometimes you have to go outside of that inner circle because you'll just never as much as you want them to be the ones to believe in you The most because you grew up with them Maybe not the right time dude. It takes it takes a long time. It does like I'll be honest with this is just honest to God And I mean you never happen bro. Dude it never may never happen, but that's okay too. I'm from St. Louis, okay St. Louis is a very blue collar proud city You know if you're from St. Louis most of the people they're from St. Louis. They're proud to be from St. Louis And even though I am one of their people and I came from here and I've gone on and built all of these things it Like now when I mean now when I go out and see people everybody's Everybody's supporting us everybody's pushing us forward everybody uses first form everybody's proud But dude it took 20 years to get there like it took me 20 years to earn a respect of the people in our own city And dude, you know, and maybe that's the right way maybe that's what it should take I don't know but I could tell you this I was bitter about it for a long time it frustrated me you know when we first started with first form dude And I put that shit on our retail shelves and our stores here people would pick it up and they would say St. Louis What are they doing making this an Andy's bathtub? You know, and that would fucking piss me off bro This is our own people in our own city like shitting on my own attempt to try and Do something relevant this is for us. Yeah, yeah, and uh, and and it took a long time for people to really get behind us and dude I think You know, I think that's what it takes I think it takes an extra long time to make believers out of the people that are closest to you Because they knew you for so long before that. Well, I say like that. That's what I think it's like I mean And I would be getting at least like yeah, they don't do they have a reason to believe you at all Well, I think that's a valid argument Well, dude, we do live in the show me state Like motherfuckers here don't believe shit until it's like right in front of their face, which I love because I'm the same way So there's that too, right? Like what have you done to earn that belief? You're not entitled to people's support and people's belief and in fact if you've been around your friends and family your whole life And you've been a bump on the log and not done shit You know what they're gonna say when you say you're gonna done doing that they're gonna say bullshit Because that's all they've ever known so when you think about it like that It's it's a logical connection for them to observe and we have to be real dude if we step out and and do become a different completely different version of ourselves that is Foreign to everybody who's known as our whole lives. There's going to be doubt But the thing that you have to understand is first of all that's logical on their end and and second of all You have for you to be successful you have to separate yourself from that for a while You have to you have to push that away and go over here and keep your head down and do the fucking work and do a day in and day out And day in and day out and day in and day out and eventually you will build something or become something that those people will say Dan He actually did that or she actually did that You know and then when the support comes from that and you've made real believers out of people that were doubting Those people become your biggest supporters That's what we see here in St. Louis right now, right? Like dude, I can't go anywhere in St. Louis without seeing this energy drink or seeing a first form sure or having people come up and say Dude, what you guys are doing is fucking awesome like it's become this sense of civic pride Which dude makes me very proud right because I love this fucking city and Anyway, the point is You're going to have to understand that the people closest to you're going to be the least amount of believing in first And it feels awkward because you think in your head those should be the people that believe the most It's just not reality and you're gonna have to separate yourself from that negativity for a while You're gonna have to put your head down You're gonna have to do what's required and it could take it could take two decades for those people to come back around But the reality is as they will and when they do you're gonna feel extra proud about it not bitter about it You know, I'm very grateful I'm grateful that the people here doubted me at first that doubted us at first I'm grateful for that because you know what that gave me a whole lot of fucking fuel You know what I'm saying? I'm over here. I'm like dude these people. I'm what are you talking about? I'm here dude. I'm from here. You don't want us to win And then I went out and fucking did everything I had to do and I needed that fuel And so a lot of ways if you look at it Like I think if you look at it from the other side of the mountain right once you've climbed the you have a different perspective on it The perspective I have on it now is like dude I'm kind of thankful because that pushed me to to continue You know what I mean? So at the end of the day, dude We have to use these doubts and these criticisms and this negativity and this disbelief As fuel for productive action and just like we talked about on that real talk just recently um Where I went through the the the techniques on how to harness the dark side energy You know You need some of that dark side energy bro, and you have to accept it for what it is no matter where it comes from And every time you feel like quitting every time you feel like giving up every time you feel like it's not worth it You need to remember what these motherfuckers said and and then go do something that puts you closer to where you want to go and Well, let me add to that. Yeah, I don't I don't think you have to be born with it though. No, you don't I think you can I think there's a lot of people There's a lot of people who feel Because there's Influencers out here who are like I'm just built different or I'm just wired different And I'm one of those people like I do feel like I'm built different but Uh, I wasn't always but you know what it takes to build yeah, it wasn't always bro like dude I was kind of a shitty fucking I was kind of lazy actually I'm probably one of the laziest people in the world. I just use systems to not be You know what I mean? So yeah, but look look at this too a lot of you out here that are listening to this are going to say Well, that's great look you're already there for the people that are speaking on this podcast right It's easy for you to say no because we weren't Rome wasn't built in the day, right? I've been doing this for 30 fucking years I gave away a lot of free programs I trained anybody who had potential to be able to show my efforts and what I could do There were blank canvas out there I turned around and got burnt by people that were turned around that gonna tell me that were gonna pay me Oh, if you let me win, you know help me win you let me get to that point I helped them get contracts this and this help do all the different things And then I still got burnt because I said you know what it'll come back to me in spades in other ways You just got to believe The reason why it's going to take everybody longer than what you expect is because God is going to teach you humility And if you get that too soon you won't have the humility You won't have the maturity to understand that no even though you can turn around and tear that mother fuckers head off That pissed you off four years ago You won't because it took you eight or ten or fifteen years to get to where you were gonna be So that you don't do that because you will show mercy when it comes to that because now you're gonna be much better at being able to handle That power and wield that power That's why it's taking it you have to listen to his plan not yours How many people have you see like in your you know in your experience You know you and I have been in the industry for a long time um The same industry Not just in our industry, but in any industry How many people have you witnessed become a winner or become successful in business Fast and be able to maintain it Very very few I Everyone that I know that has become a winner In my eyes too quickly Without understanding and appreciating the fundamentals has all lost it I agree every single one I can't even tell you one and so the reason I ask you this is because this is one of the most successful coaches of all time For high performing individuals, okay? I'm also pretty respectable in that area I built the world's largest mental transformation program. It's ever fucking existed And I'm going to tell you for a fucking fact this struggle that you are all trying to avoid is actually the best part of your journey Because it's teaching you all the traits and all the skills and all the habits and all the shit that you need to keep Success once you get it you becoming successful is not the hard part. It is not It's maintaining that year after year after year after year after year And if you talk because dude once you went fuck dude you could talk about this Once you win at the highest level people Anything else besides that is a massive fucking loss. It's an embarrassment You're the worst ever you could win the fucking Super Bowl two years in a row But if you don't win it in third year your piece of shit So once you achieve this high level of success or this greatness It's about maintaining it and you can't maintain it without the fucking struggle that takes you Years and years and years to go through so for you Look at any fucking it's fucking skill. Okay. There is a reason that first form has been hot for 10 Mother fucking years in a row. That's never happened in the industry. It's never happened never Okay, but it's because for 15 years before that I got my fucking ass beat that we wasn't yeah And everybody laughed at me and everybody hated me and everybody talked shit And they still talk shit when I'm saying what I'm gonna do and I love it because I'm like, okay cool Good knock. I still haven't convinced you. I got a few more to prove you know what I'm saying So we got to become these people Who are willing to take in like bro. I love when people doubt me. I love when people fuck you know this about me dude I will do the worst thing you can do if you compete with me is to fucking talk some shit to me bro No, it's the best thing they can do because it actually gets you to actually get a best thing for me Yeah, it's the worst thing for them right is the worst thing for them I'm just gonna tell you if you got because I know a lot of my competitors listen to this. Yep. Leave me to fuck alone It's the best thing you could do for yourself. Don't please. Yeah But like bro what I'm saying is you have to become one of these people that can fucking take the dark shit the negative shit The disbelief the doubt the frustration the pain the criticism and Chew that shit up in your mouth and swallow it and let it drive you and if you can't develop that which Which anybody can if they think about it right? But if you can't there's so much of that that comes You cannot be effective and there's a lot of there's a lot of champions out here, bro That are very humble and they're very they're very cool and they're very nice people But I promise you if you get them alone And you and it's just me and them I promise you there's a fucking warrior on the inside of that That has the ability to chew that shit up and fucking put it into productive action They might not talk about it. They might not make it their identity They might be more disciplined at how they present themselves than I am because I'm just a fucking wild animal I can't help it. It is what it is I let people see my dark side. That's the difference a lot of people don't and and for better or worse It is what it is. Why do you think that is? Because I'm give a fuck no Yeah, I know it's not no, no, it's not you give a fuck But it's because you literally wear it on your face. Oh, well, I mean well That's what happens when somebody tries to stab you in the face and kill you. Yeah, I know shit You do wear it. Yeah, it's on your face Yeah, and I think a lot of people forget You know, that's what makes you you yeah I don't know I think it's more I think it's more valuable being authentic about that to other people I think there's enough people to hide it I think it's important for people like this young person to see Hey, dude, it's okay to be someone who takes people's negative shit and fucking uses it to win That's okay because we have a lot of positive patties out here that like try to shit on that and say oh That's not the way to do it really what you should be doing is trying to prove everybody that they're right that believe in you Motherfucker nobody believes in me. What the fuck do I do now? Oh, I take all the motherfuckers that don't and I chew the shit up and I go hard as fuck And that's that's what you got to do when you don't have anybody to believe in you. So You know, I just choose to I just choose to fucking show people that that's okay You know, and I'm I like that shit dude. I'm a warrior. I like fucking slit and throw it to stop it on fucking faces and all that shit, bro But I'll also be the first guy to pick you up dude after I stomp on a little bit You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I think I don't know bro. I'm a fucking weird, but you're not weird. You're not weird This is because this is what makes you you and being from some you know a background of not having shit to coming along and being able to build something as big as you have It's a lot of these people that are listening need to understand that They want these tools. They're coming back to this podcast or coming back to this YouTube page and they want To be able to take pieces of this away So that they can make a better version of themselves. So tell me this right now What can we share with the audience to start out this 2024 new year that we can be able to get them to be able to make the best version of themselves I think they need mentorship. I think they need to be able to follow a program whether it's 75 hard whether because for me And I'm gonna start this out. It's about Sacrificing right you have to sacrifice something to take something So what does that mean when you do 75 hard when you do a fast Okay, whether it's Ramadan whether it's people go through what it's intentional suffering. It's right Yeah, because you're cleansing your soul through the physical nature of your being And that's what builds things but buying shit at door dash at midnight and getting Taco Bell and doing this and that is not that And that's what turns around and clouds your mind waking up feeling like dog shit. Yeah That's so different than going out and drinking every fucking night I think if people understood bro. I think if people truly understood how great they could be like if you could take If you could take an average person right now who's suffering Who's overweight who's just sick and tired Like because dude, I know what this is like Okay, when you get fat enough and you get and you get pissed off enough You don't you stop looking at yourself in the mirror, okay? You won't look at I know what this is like because I did it for years I'll close I used to close my eyes when I brush my teeth so I didn't have to look at myself in the mirror Okay, that's how fucking disgusted I used to be with myself and if you're gonna take in that person and plugged a Snapshot of what my life would look like If I just learned to control my own discipline and got a little bit mentally tough to the point where I could adhere to the plans that I set out Because it's not that we don't know what to do. It's that we lack the ability to do it Every single person listening to this podcast knows what the fuck they need to do to become a better version of themselves You need to eat better you need to train you need to put good shit in your brain You need to make sure that you're you know have a good productive mission in your life a purpose in your life You got to have good relationships in your life like we all know these things these are these we we got to eat Less than what the fuck we burned you know what I'm saying like we we got to Everybody knows these are basic things the problem is never the plan the problem is you can't stick to the plan So if you can identify the problem which you have That needs to be solved which is your ability to adhere to anything that you set out to do Now you become an unstoppable weapon now you become someone who can achieve anything they set out to do And that's what the live-hard program is about it's about continuously fine-tuning your mind So that whatever plan you make outside of the realm of the program is achievable because you can follow it okay That's a fucking superpower and if if I could take that person Who's afraid to look in the mirror or doesn't go to the pool on the weekends at the and the summer because they don't want to take the shirt off Or won't go on a beach vacation and always goes to the mountains because they don't want to be in a swimming suit and I could just plug a Fucking one second snapshot of what their life would look like if they fixed this one problem Their ability to stick to things and see things through every single person that ever Listen to this show listen to my words right now would would do whatever the fuck it takes to become that person That can adhere to the plan and that's what the live-hard programs about bro It's about becoming someone Who is a slave to the external and and then making the external your slave it's about flipping that over and making it so that now Instead of the environment controlling you you are now in control of your environment as much as possible And when you become that person the upside Potential is unlimited and I think if we could take people and legitimately make them understand that this is not something people were born with This is not something people were gifted with this is something that people develop Everybody would do 75 hard on day one on the first you know We got Monday next Monday is fucking January 1st seven days from Like bro, you can drastically change your entire life and people fuck this program up thinking that it's a weight loss program Where a fitness challenge or some shit they do on tic-toc? That's all the fucking is guys This is a mental sharpening program and the repeat why do you have to if it works so well? Why do you do it over and over because bro the same reason you take a fucking shower every day Discipline and mental toughness is a perishable skill set Just like Chad Wright being on the show saying shooting a pistol is a perishable skill Lifting weights is a perishable skill anything that we consistently train and then stop training is going to Reduce our skill set in that area. You will regress. Yes That's that's reality and we have to think of our mentality and our discipline and our mental toughness the same way And so intentional suffering over the course of an extended period of time will help sharpen that and You know, it just so happens that we have a program for that um And any trainer any any diet coach anybody can plug their shit into that framework and it could train someone's brain But the point is Take care of that first bro because that's the source of your problems The reason you're fucking discussed it when you look in the mirror the reason you avoid social situations The reason your bank account is shitty the reason your car is shitty the reason your house is shitty The reason you're in a shitty relationship comes down to one thing You lack the discipline and the ability to follow through on the plans that you set out and if you fix that one problem Your entire life will fucking change and so if you're asking me what my number one thing is for anybody going in a new year Fix that because once you fix the ability To adhere to to any plan It doesn't matter what plan you set out if you stick to it long enough you're gonna get there You want to be a billionaire you figured to fuck out you'll take the steps. You'll do the thing You'll do all the hard shit that everybody else quits Which I think is the biggest key success people are like how the fuck did you get here? Well, I don't know guys been doing it 25 years this man's been doing it for 30 years. How'd you get here? I fucking got my ass b for 30 years and guess what Now I woke up and I've done some things and that's how the fucking goes man like I still I don't know how you feel But I still feel like that fucking dude 20 years ago 20 with 25 years ago now That does no shit and I'm learning new shit every day. I'm trying to get better every day You know, I have more gray hair. I probably know a little bit more, but You know the reality is is I still feel like I got a lot to prove dude like a lot because you're hungry and you want to stay constantly driving forward that's what you want to do So if you're doing that you you can't be just content content is just comfort kills, bro It does it kills every it destroys you because when that happens You're not going to stay level you're going backwards. Yeah, because everyone's going to come up and be able to eat you up from behind It's just the competition. Yeah, crush you. Yeah, if you own a business I don't care if you're a trainer if you have a store any of those things if you're not moving forward you're moving backwards You know I like that too, bro. We talk about it every this motherfucker has to talk me into like not killing people every fucking day I know he does it when I don't I see all these young guys coming up dude and like I see and by the way all of you listen Because you're all these guys are all guys. I like yeah, I'm proud of them, but at the same time I'm like I'm gonna fucking kill you like dude like it's it's it's like this Like dude and you know, I'll be honest with you man one thing I'm truly grateful for It in our industry is all the motherfuckers that just go with hardest fuck like it inspires the fucking shit out of me And dude if it wasn't for those guys if it wasn't for all these dudes doing incredible shit I'd go sit on the fucking bench and count my fucking my my little pennies, you know what I'm saying and drive cars and Probably have a lot of fun But I have more fun doing this and I like competing and I like being in the game and like dude I'm really it's really cool like this is a different topic, but since you're here. We'll talk about it it's really cool to like Be friends with so many people in our industry that are doing big shit like that that's it that that motivates me Like you know, and they hear they hear me talk like this and are like fuck dude This dude will probably try to crush me, but that's not true because actually the opposite is true because with my dude I will fucking try to help these guys to win because I understand if they win more than I will go harder I've seen you help people that turned around and try to fuck you that bro and that's most of the time Yeah, and that's and that's okay because it's more cool But the Middle Eastern portion of me fucking wants to turn around and fucking cut their heads out Because it does not it's not cool because there's a thing called loyalty and a lot of people need to understand When the people that are loyal to you you need to be loyal to them as you grow up together and you grow together And that's a whole different fucking episode, but it needs to happen you guys need to be able to understand Those few and far between you there might be just one motherfucker That's your fucking ride and die whether it's your woman whether it's your family member whether it's your fucking business partner There's gonna be that one person and you got to show loyalty too because if you don't what's gonna happen is It's gonna come back to you with fucking bad karma period. Well, I think I think I don't think a lot of people understand how I'm wired in that way. They don't get it They think they either think I will try to like destroy them if they get close to me, which I don't do or they think That I'm stupid because I help them exactly right You think the worst ride out of mouth only think you're fucking stupid. I'm stupid because I tell them all this shit Right, and they start to think that I'm so that I'm so naive that they're getting something for me. That's right when in reality I'm hyper intelligent bro, and I'm intentionally giving you the fucking keys to the fast car So I can get my car and race you Okay, so like no because you want to watch them wreck that car because they don't even know what to fuck to do with it If they act like an asshole for sure. Yeah, but if they're cool like one of my best friends dude is Alex Hermosi Alex Hermosi is winning at a high level bro another one of my best friends at my left Winning at a high level honey winning at a high level every one of my friends is winning at a high level And I fucking give them every bit of information I can to win better because dude it pushes me to go harder And I think that's something that's lost In business and competition, you know, there's like if you're a true competitor like I don't ever doubt my ability to compete Like I don't I don't I'm not afraid to compete Jade. You know what that's like That's like a fucking gladiator that walks up It knows that they're a bad motherfucker and sees the gladiator next to him And they're about to fucking fight in the same match Against each other and the guy that goes over to grab a sword and then the other guy the more mature Season gladiator says uh-uh don't use that one use the one that one's got a week of blade Yeah, but it's real That's what I'm saying, but see that it's not giving bad information because I want you to be able to fucking come They're best exactly right because bro. I'm not if I'm confident in my ability to compete And I know how I'm wired and I know that if somebody else gets better I'm gonna get better and like bro. I think if we have that mentality a little bit more healthy respecting competition, but also You know Loyalty right like if somebody's in trouble or they need real help you fucking help him And and I just see the guy I see the whole game of competition even different than I did 5 6 10 years ago, you know your tone is changing four or five years I can I can attest to that seven years ago, bro I really did want to fucking murder people like I'm like I'll I will burn your fucking house down bro Fuck with me. I'll burn your shit out legitimately And now it's I like that anymore because what I've realized is I need that push I need that shit bro. I need that competition. I need the other people to be the best they can so that I'll be the best And I think if we went into 24 With a more collaborative attitude around competition I think I think we don't have a lot more fun and be a lot better Guys any question number three Andy, what are some of the core elements you think an employee should have To be the best entrepreneur at a company. I understand the show is more entrepreneur based But I have learned a lot as an employee. I've been reading and researching on how to be a better leader I would just like to get some of your thoughts on what you are looking for in your employees To be the undeniable performer and leader that you always talk about Well, the skills of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship are very similar in fact. I think They're almost the exact same skills The risk tolerance is somewhat different Quite a bit different but outside of that um The skills are the same and you know Mission first people people who understand what the outcome that's working Uh, that everyone is working towards See I I I use the analogy of a boat all the time okay and if we're at a boat And we've got five guys on one side and they're rowing right and then we've got five guys on the other side And they're rowing at a different pace or you have four guys on the other side and they're rowing At the right pace, but the fifth guy's rowing at the wrong pace The boat will not go where you wanting to go will only go in circles That is the nature of of business and so Mission first people people who can understand what is trying to be achieved And then figure out how to contribute to that the best possible way Regardless of their skill set regardless of what they're good at If they could take the initiative to find their lane In their place of contribution and contribute as much as possible in that way while also being a positive influence Being example for everybody else being a positive cultural influence That's a big one that doesn't get talked about a lot a lot of people don't understand how hard They fuck themselves by being a gossiper or a Uh, drama person in the office or someone who's disruptive Because that fucks everybody like people don't understand that like when you are a gossiper or a drama person inside of an organization Whether it be a team or locker room or a company You're creating a situation where nobody can win Okay, and that's the most selfish thing you can do because what happens is the people at the leadership level And the people who are the most skilled level they are now Having to deal with whatever you're creating the ripples you're creating in the back of the boat The holes you're drilling in the back of the boat as opposed to rowing the boat faster And so the energy they're spinning on this bullshit drama could be yeah put into yeah And this is why as a leader dude when people gossip or they're drama and you just out of your company you have to fire them immediately because they're cancerous um But when it's when you when it comes to being a great entrepreneur everything I talk about here on this show Everything every single thing Can be equated to entrepreneurship from entrepreneurship. It's all the same skill set and ultimately in my opinion what it comes down to Is understanding the outcome? That is desired by the organization the team the company Whatever the collective outcome that we're trying to get to understanding that and then doing whatever they can to put that first and everything else second Great leaders do this great leaders do not come in and say I need to have all the ideas or I need to call all the shots or I need to call every single player I need to every idea that we do has to be mine that's that's what weak leaders do weak leaders will always talk about themselves in terms of what they did they will say I did this look what I did I signed this person I had developed this product. They will start naming shit after themselves and all this fucking ego-driven bullshit as opposed to Understanding what the outcome is and understanding that their role as a leader is not to have the ideas You're gonna have some of the ideas, okay? But your actual role is to develop the people behind you and then decide What the best idea is that aligns with the outcome desired for the collective and if you're an employee You should operate that same way. How are my actions contributing to the overall mission that we have at hand? Am I contributing? Am I taking away? Am I making it better? Am I making it worse? And it's a constant evaluation cycle and this is a side from Basic skill sets right like you should learn how to lead you should learn how to sell you should learn how to communicate You should learn how to take initiative for things and and and own things and put them on your back and and run them across the line without being told These are all things that you that you have to learn but culturally It's a mentality What are we trying to achieve as a team and how can I contribute to that the water boy At the University of Alabama is a very valuable water boy. I can promise you that. I can promise you that Okay, the people who cook the food for the athletes are extremely fucking valuable Okay, the people who come in after hours and fix all the equipment and set the locker up and get everybody shit right These people are all equally as valuable to the team and the outcome Certain people might get paid more because their skills are worthy of more pay because they're more rare And the more rare the skill the more pay you're gonna have okay The more accumulation of skill the more money you're gonna make in an organization. That's just reality All right, if you can do the things no one else can do. Guess what you're getting paid a lot more money But that doesn't mean that you can't contribute along the way while you develop these skills And just figure out ways to contribute and be valuable and put the team first and put the mission first is ultimately what will define Worth inside of an organization because you know, let's just say the equipment manager right There's plenty of equipment managers that have gone on and collegiate football or even professional football To be head coaches Right, but the reason that they got the shot to be the head coach was because they did such a great job with the equipment That they were someone say hey man, you know what you're not built for just equipment dude here Let me come over here. Let me start teaching you some shit Okay, and what happens is is you get yourself in a position Where the leadership and the people ahead of you and the people with true power to Progress your career start to identify certain things and the main certain thing that identify is that you give a fuck a whole lot and I love that analogy What the the the the Alabama analogy like you asked that water boy what what the mission is you're gonna say the one to fuck a super ball That's right. Yeah, you asked for I don't know how Alabama's winning Super Bowl, but National National National, you know, it's a fucking like no matter who that is or the fucking person watering the fucking field. Yeah, that's right The ground keepers when the fucking jam is that's right. That's right. Bro when you go when you see the St. Louis Cardinals on or opening day okay You know how like on opening day they line the players down the chalk lines Okay, you're gonna see St. Louis Cardinals watch them on opening day and then watch the team they play The team they play on opening day will come out half of them won't have hats on half of them will have hats on Half will be in their their warm-ups half will be in their uniforms watch how the Cardinals operate every single person Every single person is wearing the exact same thing the exact same way the exact same standard across the world Doesn't matter if they're the grounds keeper doesn't matter if they're the best player on the team Doesn't matter they're all in unison and the reason the St. Louis Cardinals have been such a winning team They've won more world titles than any other team besides the New York Yankees as one of the smallest market teams in majorly Baseball is because they have outstanding culture from the top all the way down to the bottom And they develop their own skill set and their own standard throughout the organization And I believe one of the reasons that I've been able Uh to to I think one of the biggest blessings I've had is the ability to witness how they do things Which has helped us do what we do here um But getting everybody in unison everybody understanding that the the person who You know packs the boxes as equally as important as the person who's In the border room making the decisions like these are all parts to a team And if you're on a team and you're an entrepreneur and you can understand that your role truly matters And if you do it excellent, it's going to open up more opportunities And then you're willing to take time to develop the skill sets that you need After those uh as you're doing those opportunities meaning like personal development on your personal time getting better learning things Investing in yourself These are the things that make up these success stories where I started at this place It's eight dollars an hour and now I'm making a million bucks a year these are the kind of people to do those things so um You know that's that's the gist of what I think What do you think? I think you hit it right on the head. I think a lot of people want to just they have the mentality of give it to me now then I'll work for it Give me the raise and then I'll go ahead and show you that I'm going to do it No, do the work of the person above you and then therefore it justifies to me to pay you more and give you that promotion It's not about just getting the promotion and then doing it actually do it show and really be able to show the team What you're able to do now we step back and we're going into me executive meetings going hey Jimmy and Bobby and Michelle Look at them. They're doing want you know a level above their pay grade here So when we're doing your review Fuck yeah, we're gonna give you a raise fuck yeah, you're gonna get a title change now you're going for you know into a management position Because you're already proving it too many people right now want you to give them that title and that shot without proving themselves They don't understand the dynamic. They don't they don't look at it from the other side of the spectrum As an operat as a decision-maker in a business or a team, okay They're looking at it from the employee perspective They first of all they all think that they can trick someone who's been doing something for 20 something years and the The fucking story that you've heard at 10,000 times, okay, I've heard this I've heard this Do you know how many times I've heard that if I give you this you'll do x and then the person never did it That was the first 15 years of my business yours too, okay What what you what people fail to understand? Is that Your job as an employee or a part of an organization is to make yourself invaluable To where then you can leverage your skill set against the ownership For money, all right. This is how this works. It's very simple Your job is to do the job of the person ahead of you and do it better than them and be so skilled That the people who are leading you who make the decisions are become scared that you're going to leave that's right, okay? And People get to that point really like a lot of people are like well, I'm gonna fucking leave Well fucking go ahead bro. You're not doing shit anyway, right? I'm gonna give a fuck Like you know how many times people have said I'm leaving. It's all downhill from here. Okay. Well fucking You're in it fucking jiffy Lou bro, and we're still here and we're we're crushing, okay? But the point is there is people who show That they understand and when those people show that they understand by taking on more and doing more and taking initiative and becoming better on their own What happens is is people who have been in business for a long fucking time They recognize the rarity in that person, okay? So then they look at that person and they say fuck Jimmy over here, bro. This guy's a fucking killer. Okay, if we don't fucking move this guy up He's gonna fucking go somewhere else and we're gonna miss an amazing asset to the team So we have to find a position for him for that next phase and that's how the conversation happens on the inside, but people aren't Preview to that they assume that it's a that what what they assume that what the real conversation goes like this Hey Jimmy's killing it dude. I think we can I think we can keep him on for like three more years that this extra workload and before he quits Bro listen dude when you're late when you're working on a winning team They don't think of it like that winning team are always sir dude. I'm always searching for that next fucking six star athlete, bro I'm always looking for that next fucking player. I'm always looking for that next fucking asset Because it's about the mission bro listen because it's rare It's those people and the other people that are working there are gonna start seeing those people that were threatening to leave because of whatever They left and then the company continues to grow so what's the common denominator? It's that those people didn't belong But if you want to be able to become an entrepreneur What you do is you create so much value that you turn around and create your own position That's right because the owners are not saying Maybe in a shitty company, okay? Maybe if you're in a shitty company Maybe there is a like if you got if you work for a company and the owners leave it on Thursday coming back on Tuesday And they don't give a fuck they probably are gonna try to take advantage of somebody like that Okay, but if you're in a company that's aggressively trying to grow and compete and trying to win and evolve and and be more That's not how it's looked at how it's looked at is all right Mitch over there is fucking crushing it dude and like dude He's been at that same position for two years and if we don't find a position for this guy He's not gonna develop we're gonna have losing them okay So we got to find a position where we can maximize his skill set and get him his talents utilized properly Which always comes with more responsibility and pay? Okay, so it's a misunderstanding of the dynamic of how the conversation Happens at the ownership and leadership level amongst employees and it usually is the misunderstanding because they they lack the perspective of a running an organization Or they listen to their fucking loser friends who are just saying shit to him like to oh all they're doing is using you up And they're gonna spit you out no one can yeah, that might be true for a shitty company doesn't give a fuck But when someone's trying to become the next mother fucking Nike I can assure you they're trying to collect like my biggest business Is collecting high-skill people that's my biggest fucking priority Okay, and if you're not in an organization like that You should try to get in one because that's where you're gonna be able to do the work ahead of time and have some faith Prove yourself and that's gonna move you up the ladder and if you keep doing that the progress never stops Yeah, and you're gonna level up faster than anybody around you that are working at other companies because You're in an organization that is aggressively trying to maintain or develop their talent. Yeah For sure, and I think it just comes from misunderstanding of the conversation of how it actually works It is it's a person just really well, dude. We live in a soft-ass culture Well, it's but it's also perspective Hopefully most people are listening to podcasts like this that they can create perspective because they don't always have access to these conversations Yeah, like literally it's not their fault. Yeah, some of them just don't say and they don't have perspective, right? So when you turn around and you say hey look this is what an owner or a Let's say an executive thinks and how they think on how to level their people up. They turn around and do it That's why what I try to do is also say hey look if you're gonna go out of your way I'll pay for added education if you want to learn tools whether it's something on software related all fucking pay for it Yeah, if you want to go get nasm certified if you want to get this I'll pay for it Yeah, I'll do all those things because I want to see you level up But you got to be able to take an initiative you can't say hey by the way. I want to be able to become The director of so and so well, what are you directing? Do you even know how to direct? Yeah, you know how to you know whatever it is and then what you got to do is But if they're proving that they're already doing that role It's much easier to put them in that way But they need to take the initiative and they need to understand perspective on both sides both ownership side as well as the employee side I also think too that it's important to recognize That if you are an entrepreneur and you are hungry to build a career and you are somebody that wants to to go out and and become a high value or even an executive or whatever it is you want to do There's more opportunity to do that now than ever because the work ethic of most people is Shit, yeah, right. The bar has been brought down so low You guys should all be level up It's a huge opportunity because there's a bunch. It's a lot of shitty people who don't have especially coming off of You know two or three years of people working from home. Yeah things, you know where they're people only want to go to the office So what it's done is it's brought the bar down so low that you have the ability to just hit gigantic strides right now Because so many other people are finding reasons to do shitty work not going to work and just doing a low level job Yep, totally agree man Love it, man.
