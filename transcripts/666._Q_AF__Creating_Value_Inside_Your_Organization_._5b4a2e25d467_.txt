You know so you know I got you know the the HVAC shit right yeah so I had to technician come out this morning but there was a little turn of the event so so some shit was definitely fucked up and it's interesting because last night on my way home a guy from the company called me and was just like what was your give you a refund because I had run off on a little bit and some legal action and stuff. Probably good idea probably a good idea try to write the wrong and that's what he says like you know I you know I'm like but then I'm like like I don't think I want the refund yeah you know I'm saying like no I think I'm gonna move forward because it's not just me like when you do some fucked up shit in business like that like you can't continue to do do shit like that yeah you know I'm saying and they these people are probably scamming old ladies and shit like for sure they are you know and so like I thought I just thought it was interesting like you try to do the right thing but like sometimes you can't write a wrong yeah you know but what's your thoughts on that like especially like in the in the business world like right as an entrepreneur how important is it to make sure you know like obviously nobody's perfect those are gonna be mistakes but when you get to point where you're making just some fucked up decisions it's like I think intent matters right yeah I think is the intent to get one over on the customer or is the company intending to get one over on you or was it a mistake or was it just bad judgment or was a guy just having a bad day right all of those things are forgivable but when the intent is to take advantage or scam I think that's different yeah so I think those things are two different things yeah so I can make these guys I mean look dude I think you make a valid point if they really were scamming you which I don't know I trust you yeah um but I wasn't there I didn't talk to him but it sounds like they were sounds like bullshit to me I think those people deserve to be known about yeah and I think you know if they were just having a bad day I mean the fact that he tried to give the refund was he just trying to give the refund because the refund came after the legal threat okay well you know I don't know I'm gonna be in this one is like yeah no some you know there's some stuff yeah it depends yeah I just think he imagined that I was gonna be like this 70 year old man or something that like you know living on retirement some shit and it's like oh yeah thousand dollars here you go you know nah so what'd you tell him fuck off he's like okay he was so we'll see yeah he'd be guys updated say two for CTI I don't use any H-Drama dude it's a wild shit man yeah cool well I got some going for you all right let's dive into these man we got these I like these we got some good questions here today um Andy guys question number one uh Andy I love the show and I love these Q&A they have helped me as an employee looking to be better which brings me to my question of this I'm a mom of two small kids my husband works full time which requires some travel for work I'll work a career that I love 25 or 30 hours a week because of my husband's schedule I need to be able to take my kids to school pick them up extra curriculars etc I want to approach my manager for a pay increase however with my limited hours that I am free to work I am not sure how to provide more value as you always share my work days are filled with back-to-back with the work that needs to get done um but we meet with me needing to take care of my children it does not leave me freedom in the evenings or ability to work late and create more value for myself within the company uh for context I work uh in a company that sells products online as well as in person uh thank you for advancing uh for any insights so how do you create more value when you feel like you're tapped out well the context of this is this is a this is a good question and I think it's very important for people to understand the reality of value value is not created with just more time value is created by the result that you produce and we hear this a lot from young parents young parents struggle very much so with a career because they feel like I cannot put in more time well in situations where you cannot put in more time that means you have to get better and more effective at what you do so you have to view the reality of value for what it is not what you've been taught to believe that it is and what you've been taught to believe it is is the narrative that we hear in society the guy who's retired I work for this company for 65 years and all they gave me was a gold watch no what'd you do for that company did you show up every day and not really do shit or did you show up every day and bust your ass and create real value a lot of times people think that in order to create more value they have to invest more time when in reality they have to become higher skilled with the time that they have so when you look at your situation and you say fuck I can't put in any more time I can't give anymore I got this and this and this that requires my time yeah no shit you're not the first person ever in the history of the world to have children you're not the first person ever in the history of the world to have outside obligations other than your career so you have to understand if you want to have balance you have to be great at what you do and produce value with high skill so low skill they produce value with hours invested high skill produce value with results and you have to convert your line of thinking from putting in more time to being more effective and more valuable in this person's situation that could look a number of different ways since time more time isn't something that you can do and you're clearly very stressed about not being able to put in that time you should shift your thinking into how can I provide a tremendous result for the company without having to work more hours and what that typically deduces to is you becoming more focused more skilled with the time that you have that produces a better result people live in a fairy tale world when it comes to what companies what they think companies want from them they believe that companies want them to get there at 4 a.m. and stay till fucking 3 a.m. the next day and go home and drink a little water and get back in the that is not what people want there's not nobody gives a fuck about that they really don't and if you work for leadership that thinks that that's where it is they're not getting it either because the reality is winning organizations give a fuck about the result you produce they don't really care about how much time it took you to produce it that's the truth that is the truth if you can wrap your mind around this you can find a place and a lot of different places that will pay you very well because they will say all right this guy's a winner this person's doing this they got this they're doing this for the company yeah they're out of here at 5 30 because they have two kids that they got to take care of but the fucking impact that they make between the working hours is so great that I don't give a fuck so like dude most of these problems that people have in these scenarios when it comes to quote unquote balancing their life or feeling frustrated in their career come down to them not being as effective as they need to be with the time that they have which means you have to increase your focus and increase your effectiveness which means you have to put time into developing a higher skill set that is what we're talking about the blue collar old school mentality of I'm going to put in 70 fucking hours every single you know by Wednesday and bro that's not real that's not real no one cares they care about the result you produce we have moved on from that time frame I don't give a fuck how many hours it takes for a piece of content to be crafted and edited what I care is is the shit fucking fire is it awesome shit right if it takes you 24 hours to make some awesome shit you might want to figure out how to fucking do it and too right okay and you can apply that to your sales position or your service position or whatever position it is you manage your position it's about being effective with the time that you have an understanding that that's how you really create balance if you want more free time be more effective with the time that you're there instead of sitting at your desk for 15 hours and pretending like you're trying to put in hours say hey I'm only here for six hours but those six hours I'm crushing that is the key and so you have to move that this is a societal problem this is a cultural problem we need to move from the mentality of more work to the mentality of better work and better work is what gets you fucking paid not more any knucklehead can do more they can do more more more more more and the problem with doing more is that you're always trading your time for money and if you're always trading your time for money there is a ceiling to how much money you have because there is a ceiling to how much time you can give and a lot of people burn themselves out or make themselves feel hopeless or get frustrated or jumped from career to career to career to career because they can't grasp the real game the real game is producing the result and whenever time that takes is irrelevant because if the result is great the value would be there you will be worth more money will make more money you will be happier you will have more time and you will have the quote unquote balance that you're looking for so stop thinking like your grandpa and start thinking about how you're going to contribute and be effective with the time that you do have and your whole entire life will get much better a lot of people go into the office and they go into these organizations not here by the way everybody comes here bussass but my I always got to say that because I don't want people to think I'm talking I love what we do here okay but what I'm saying is when you go into the office and you say you know I'm like this is the mentality of a lot of people they go into their job they go into their place of business they go to do whatever they do and they try to do the least amount possible without getting in trouble and then they're surprised when they don't progress you cannot progress that way you have to go in there with the attitude of I'm going to put in very effective work that's going to produce a result and that result is worth money you are trading the results you produce for money you're not trading the hours you put in for money unless you are lower skill lower skill people do that all the time and that's why there's beginning jobs and then there's middle jobs and then there's careers okay so yeah you get paid hourly at certain places that's because that's a low skill position and as you produce higher skill you move into positions where you're probably going to get some money and then some commission stuff right and then when you're a true professional you're going to get paid a whole bunch of money just because they know you're going to fucking knock it out of the park without being asked okay so this is the progression of the mentality that needs to happen if you grow from you know let's say early 20s person to early 30s person to early 40s person and try to progress your career with the hours invested only mindset you will always be one of those people so the the perspective has to shift inside of you to see how you're going to be and gain skills and be more effective for the position that you're in which will demand money the goal is that you should be so fucking great at what you do that you can walk into your superior's office and say fucking pay me and then they have to pay you that's where you want to be and if you're there you won't ever have a problem with money that's the reality of the game and like I just just like real like real shit man like I feel like even with that though like because you know I feel like I counted people was like oh well you know that's just not the place that I work it and it's like well I but like but if you're really that fucking good for me it's almost like it's in public how can you pull you're not see it bro they do see so you're lying to yourself about how fucking good you are or there's there's you know high levels of delusion yeah and culture and society right now about people's actual value okay if you are that great they are going to recognize that and they're like dude this this idea nobody recognizes me because you're not dude that's right no choice that's what becoming undeniable is about it's about producing such undeniable value that they have no choice they should be looking at you on their own and thinking fuck bro we better take care of that person because that person can go anywhere and that's where you want to put yourself and it's your job to put you there it's not your organization's job it's your job if you go play professional sports it's not the stateless carnels that are responsible for you doing your hitting practice and your fucking soft toss and your catches and your pitches that's that's you it's not their responsibility to get your fucking fat ass in shape that's on you if you show up the camp and you didn't do none of your practice it's going to show in your result and you're going to get cut that is how the world works and if we all started just accepting the reality okay it's not personal it's not personal nobody's holding you back you're telling yourself a bunch of fucking lies bro and you're not being honest with yourself about how good you really are and it's costing you shit and you're spending your whole life being bitter because you're blaming other people for shit that is actually your fault so if you want more and you want more time and you want to build a career you have to understand the game you are playing and the game you are playing is how much value does the result that I am responsible for that I am producing have to the mission at hand and if that value is high you will leverage that into high pay that's reality there's there that's it okay so like it's very hard for people to understand because they grow up around parents that talk about hours invested or years invested or parents that say that fucking place doesn't give a fuck about you blah blah blah blah blah yeah and look at their lives look at their bank account look at their fucking house look at their entire existence is that what you want because that's what you will get if you listen to motherfuckers like that the truth of the matter is is the world is very fair because when you accept reality people say it's not fair well you know what it is fair because it works on a very simple principle the result is X the result is worth X and you get the worth of that result that you produce and that's that's reality bro like if you're not in a company that fucking recognizes that and you have actual and I'm not talking about these delusions of how good you are you have actual data that you can walk in you can say look motherfucker this is what the fuck I'm doing this is what everybody else is doing pay me you you're not you're going to get fucking paid right okay and no one's going to care if you're there fucking seven o'clock at night or 4 a.m. in the fucking morning or whatever the fuck no one cares they can no one cares no professional sports team gives a fuck if you know fucking Lebron James shows up every single day they care if he scores 60 fucking points right how he does it they don't give a shit give it too fuck they don't care give us yes and that's why he gets fucking paid because you could say whatever to fuck you want about Lebron James I'm not the biggest fan of Lebron I've been openly critical of a lot of things he does I'm sure he's a cool guy to hang out with it's not personal however it's irrelevant what I say because he's so fucking good my fucking weird yeah like dude that's it that is the game that is reality there is no arguing about it there's no there's no skating around it there's no hiding from it and when you hide from this reality and you decide that it's something else because dude I already know a lot of people be like yeah that's nice if you're this yeah that's okay if you're that yeah bro fuck you then go be a fucking loser I'm telling you the game you can you listen to what I'm saying or you cannot listen to what I'm saying but if you don't listen to what I'm saying you're gonna be just like these other people that told you all this shit what's their shit what's their life say what's their scoreboard look like okay and then the worst part is is that we have a whole generation of people that then sell themselves that that's what they wanted the whole time and then when you sell yourselves on something that you wanted the whole time when it's not really what you want in your heart for yourself and it's less than what you could be do you know what happens when you're 70 years old and you're about to fucking die you look back and you say fuck dude I left everything on the fucking table I fucking wasted my whole life so understand the game play the game well and you will have no problem getting paid and also having the rest of your life to live I fucking this is the whole principle around the power list system go fucking listen to episode 16 there is five critical tasks if you do the five critical tasks for your life every single day by 10 a.m. you could fuck off the rest of the day and you know why the program is built that way because that's reality if you can understand where the value is and you drive the value and by the way driving the value depending on where you are may take some time maybe it's going to take you six seven hours a day maybe that's what it takes but it shouldn't take you fucking 15 or 16 it shouldn't take you 14 it shouldn't take you 12 it because it does it means you're fucking off after time so can we hit on this piece real quick because I want to come back to this real quick Andy because we talk about bettering yourself increasing those skills that's not supposed to be done on the clock no shit right like I like here because I feel like hold on this this man how is this missed this is obvious shit I I agree with you it is missed it's missed it's like how how do you know you where you go do the game okay look dude your job whatever your career is whatever you're working on that's your game that's your that's your regular season NFL game that's where you perform the rest of the time that's where you're supposed to train that's where you're supposed to read and learn and watch on YouTube and read books and gain skills and talk to people and get yourself better all that personal development now if you work in a great company they'll personally develop you inside of that we spend a lot of time here with personal development most of our meetings that we do are personal development driven if you work for a great company they're gonna give a fuck about your personal development but still the onus of actually making that reality is on you yeah and it's it's on you so it's a sports analogy if you show up to the game and you put up shitty results you're not gonna get paid bro more card in the office either and that your offseason might be some nights it might be some weekends and that's the other part of this little question in the beginning of anything your value is gonna be driven by time because your skills are low so your goal should be to increase your skills so that your time invested can go down you see what I'm saying so as your skill set goes up your effectiveness goes up the time invested and required for you to produce that result goes down which gives you the freedom that you're looking for yeah I fucking love it I love it guys Andy let's keep this move we got question number two he says Andy with an exclamation point so I'm so he's yelling all right Andy I'm 17 years old I want to win all right what would you recommend me do as a young man to get exposed to real winning and real success outside of social media land I can't buy a rent a Lambo honestly I think they're pretty mid if you ask me for hours or better but what are some ways I can go and touch these things in my real life to keep me hungry and inspired as those are the things I want to have seeing real success and touching it as you say really resonates with me I just don't have any examples close by bro so I didn't either okay like I didn't know anybody growing I knew one guy that had cars and I got close to him I learned I learned from him I talked to him I became friends with them and he taught me a lot but what I would say to you and anybody else is that here's what I did this is what I did I would go to car dealerships and walk around dude I was that kid I was you know the kids that that take pictures of the cars out back yeah that they're all cool as fuck yeah but they're all you know 13 14 15 16 17 year old kids right car spotter kids that run tick tock pages and shit yeah really good kids ambitious kids when I was there age I did the same shit they did I went to where the shit was I would I got like dude me and my friends we would drive through nice neighborhoods and we would say dude that's the fucking shit I'm talking about no that's me over there is my house you ever played that game with cars dude that's my car that's my car that's my house that was the shit we did bro and we would drive through like dude the first street that I when I met you I was living over on a over in sunset hills and I think I just moved to where I'm at now but yeah you adjust I had it for sale yeah right yeah that's right that house bro I used to drive by when I was fucking 16 years old when they were building that subdivision I said yeah I'm gonna live in this fucking street guess what I did for five years and you know the house I live in now you drive by that motherfucker when they were building that and I told myself I'm a fucking living that fucking house and guess what now I'd live in the exact house that is the exact house that I thought about with all those years when I was broke all those years when I wasn't making any money fucking 58,000 dollars my first 10 years combined all of those times you know how many dreams I had to have to pull me through that insane amounts that exact house that I live in now was the house I thought of during that whole entire time and now I fucking live there so there's a lot of power in being exposed to the things that you want so I would encourage any of you who are looking for a better existence to start what I call window shopping all right and window shopping is simply driving through the neighborhoods going to the car dealerships going to the car meets find out when the car meets are bro the car meets are an amazing place to meet people because dude you're meeting people who are somewhat successful at a very minimum because you have to be to afford the shit they're all cool they all want to talk to you they all have the same ideas of success that you have bro I've met so many great friends through cars you know we've been a title sponsor of Gold Rush rally for fucking since 2004 10 years now yeah do you know many friends I've met off of that rally that are like my lifelong friends some guys I do business with shit like dude cars are an amazing connector because it actually is it serves as a filter for all the negativity right like there's no fucking poor mouth boohoo mother fuckers that show up to a car meet bro those guys are all ambitious they all have businesses they all want to do good they all want to live a good life and go talk to them ask them their stories ask them what they got going on you know dude you'll find so many cool things just from from that so just constantly putting yourself in situations in real life where these things that you desire are right in front of your face and then following it up with you know online yeah you know I window shop online all the time I look at car sites I look at property I look and I'm not even like trying to buy anything but I still do it because like it helps me make the things real in my life yeah I love that any comment on the uh the lambo comment comment in there I saw that I like dude holy shit this is great so he said for all the cars are better than lambo that's his personal opinion I'm sure they are better it is what it is like it is what the fuck it is I got some buddies who are very fucking great they're big I was a huge lambo guy I fucking love Lamborghinis my whole life I still love the cars I had a horrible experience with the company and I sold all my shit in one day and I replaced it with Ferrari and by the way at the time I hated Ferrari I fucking hated them I thought they were all blue blood nose in the air douchebags real talk I found out that I was completely wrong the cars are superior the values are superior the people that fucking drive those cars are all in a different place in life than most of the guys that drive lambo's it's a better culture and you know if you guys at Lamborghinis hear this I'm sorry man like it is what it is you should have listened to me four years ago when I told you how to improve your fucking company you told me get fucked so will I ever own a Lamborghini again probably but I'm not gonna buy I'm new from the fucking dealership in the business I'm just not I'm not with it they fucking disrespect me hard and a lot of people talk about how Ferrari's hard to deal with Ferrari's not actually hard to deal with they have a very simple structure of how it works and they stick by it and I think if you really get in with those guys and you become friends with them you're gonna learn how they develop such an amazing culture around their brand the most profitable car company in the fucking world they've got the strongest car following in the world and there's a reason for it in it because they suck so that's my little that's my little so this young man has some good taste I think so but I'm not hating anybody like slammer yeanie their cars are fucking awesome yeah there's just things about it I don't like like how they don't renew they don't they they run their model years for 10 fucking years straight and expect you to buy a three or four of them along the way and you take a fucking bath in every single one of them you know like for our is coming out with new shit every two fucking years three years you know I'm sure she's exciting yeah but that's exciting they don't they don't develop the cars fast enough they don't change the tech fast enough they don't come up with new models they don't support their customers the same way like it's just a very different thing and it's and and I used to think and a lot of people are gonna get pissed about this but it's okay because I have experience with both I'm speaking from experience but I used to think Ferrari and Lamborghini was this or that like they're on the same level they're not on the same level Ferrari is a few steps above Lamborghini and pretty much every single fucking way there is so that's not to say that I hate the cars bro the v10 Lamborghini platform is one of the best fucking platforms available but you know what I'd rather drive an r8 because I don't want to be seen in the Lamborghini right that's the truth so that's that's my take on it I love it yeah they make amazing cars they they can improve their company tremendously if they would listen to customer feedback from people who actually fucking build brands they have much stronger brand but they're not they're not willing to listen so yeah that's where I'm at with it all right good shit man I'd love to own the I'm probably gonna own some more Lamborghini's I'm just not gonna buy them new yeah I love it well guys and let's get to our third and final question Andy question number three Andy I'm still new in young and business four years in and I'm struggling with turning the work mode off at home honestly it's not really me it's my employees first few years and I had no problem taking the late night calls and addressing the issues it came up late at night but since then I've promoted a few people into some leadership spots to address those issues that unless they absolutely need me to address them I'm with you 25 years in does it change am I looking at this the wrong way and if so what do I need to do um I don't think you're looking at the wrong way I think you probably just have the false perspective of what it's like you're not going to if you truly care and you're gonna continue to grow because remember we only have two options we go forward or we go backwards if we try to maintain we buy default go backwards because the the rest of the market is moving forward so you cannot maintain if you want to maintain you have to be moving forward at a slower pace but still moving forward and anytime as an operator of a business that you are moving forward and business doing things like what you're talking about is a requirement of the job I am on the phone to this day every single fucking day till 10 11 o'clock at night every single fucking day every single day I know you guys think I just sit there and smoke cigars and talk shit but the reason I don't post more on social media people you know you guys are like why don't you post why love when you post more shit well fuck bro it's hard to think of that when I'm on the fucking phone all fucking day okay so and and the times that I've tried to get away from that my business is lost and when I get back in it they win so you know there's there's now there's something to be said about developing competent leadership I have amazing leadership my leadership here that runs these companies they are fucking amazing bro my brother Jake Joe sounds the best fucking operator on the fucking planet bro that nobody knows about you know what I'm saying like this dude's fucking ridiculously good but dude we still have to talk on the phone yeah because the mission is so fucking big that it's just we don't have enough hours in the day so it's if you have big dreams and you have a big plan yes it's reasonable to expect your leadership to handle almost everything and then the shit that comes to you a shit that needs your input and if you find you should be working to cultivate leaders who understand the difference of bullshit and real shit okay and all the bullshit they should fucking keep from you because your time is valuable on the real shit and if you don't have those people in play it's gonna drive you crazy but they're still not gonna get to a point even when you have the best leadership at play where you're gonna get you know your nights and weekends and you're gonna get left alone I mean it's not reality dude you signed up the reason building a company and building a business is so fucking hard is because it requires everything you have and the idea of you know this is why I'm so critical about entrepreneurship culture as a whole on the internet this idea like I saw this guy that I know bro and he made this video I know this fucking guy and he made this video and he's like yeah man I don't know you know all these guys out there talking about how it's not that hard all you got to do is hire people and make them do all the work and I'm like oh that's it genius that's it fucking simple well where's your fucking company that's worth over a billion dollars where's your fucking companies where's your shit oh you don't have any because you're an idiot that's not reality reality is when you have big dreams you have big goals you're gonna sacrifice other things that other people aren't gonna have to sacrifice for me I'm willing to do whatever the fuck I have to do that's what I assume my role is my role is whatever the fuck I have to do that's my role and whoever calls me at night that has a problem I address it and I don't look at it like all you're cutting into my time because my mission is so important and and and so big that I understand that it requires that so it's a the answer to this to this person's questions a little above you're seeing a little bit wrong but you're also seeing a little bit right and so you want to find a good balance with your leadership where they know how to keep the bullshit away and handle all the stuff they can handle but also bring you the real shit and and and they can error on the wrong way of that they can sometimes leadership gets too fucking aggressive with handling shit I was about to actually what if there's like no no contact you never get brought well so here's what happens so when you teach people to start taking responsibility own in their shit like you know Jaco's book extreme ownership there's a there's a place where you can take that you can misinterpret that and take it too far I understand what that means but not everybody understands what that means and so what happens to a lot of young leaders is they get themselves in these situations where they don't really know the answer but they don't want to bring it to the next step up because they're afraid they're going to look stupid or they're going to be they're going to be looked at as less valuable and then what happens is the problem starts to metastasize and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and then by the time you have to bring you have to bring it to them because it's going to explode and that's a poor leader so what what'll happen is if you're a mid-level leader and you have to report to someone above you and you try to take so much responsibility and you let this problem you know just get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and then finally you dump that that the big leader is going to look at you like you're incompetent because they're going to want you to bring the real shit to them the things that are real problems before their problems and they're going to want you to keep all the rest of the shit over here and let you handle that shit and so that's that's just developing leaders that's just understanding what the standard is that's clear communication and it's also keeping a watch fly for what these people's natures are because every single leader and every single manager underneath you is going to have a different nature some are going to have the the propensity to bring you everything which that's not good right because you can't handle everything that's the worst problem of ever doing their job right so then they're invaluable because they're you're doing their job for them right some leaders won't bring you anything and then the problems get so big that you have to step in that's not valuable either a great mid-level leader someone who's working their way up the chain whether it be you know you're the first management level or you're the tenth management level whatever it is is someone who understands the difference between bullshit and real shit okay the real shit you get help with or you handle the real way the bullshit you let that be bullshit okay so that's that's where we're at I love this topic I got two more follow-ups on this real quick so so what about the situation of as let's say I'm a mid-level leader what is there something to say about situations that I technically I can handle this but doesn't mean that I should be the one to handle this what's your thoughts on that like well that's a great place for you to create extra value for yourself okay so so what I would do in that scenario is I would handle the problem effectively I would make sure I can handle the problem effectively then I would handle the problem effectively then I would make it known how I handled the problem effectively you see what I'm saying okay yep so that way you don't find yourself in a situation where you're not the value that you're providing is getting credited to someone else you know what I mean yep so you got to find a creative way to do that because nobody likes brown nose nobody likes the guy that runs in him be like oh I did I did my best job for him like nobody fucking likes that guy day 365 right the way the way you do you're gonna choke him out so so fucking hey bro I wouldn't listen madat handles this shit that's why I used him if he was a if he if he didn't I wouldn't he used him so uh but like dude that's that's the game man the game is the game is understanding the difference between real shit and bullshit and uh you know handling the real shit before it becomes real shit yeah and then last little question on this Andy because you know with this transition in this mindset right like you know yes he's kind of a little wrong in some ways you talk about improving that and I'm just oh I want to get back I lost my train of thought don't be that brown nose or guy that goes in and it's like oh I did like look dude figure out a creative way to say it walk in you walk in you say hey I want you know I saw this problem over there I already fucking handled it it's all good but this was a problem we just don't want it to happen again got it shit like that's easy yeah so and that drives value yeah right that's not tattle tally brown nosing bullshit that's not fuck this up yeah that's that don't ever do that because you lose credibility when you start throwing your teammates under the bus for the for praise your leadership is going to look at you and think you're a little worm they're gonna say that's a wormy motherfucker right there that's bad character that's right bad character he's gonna throw people under the bus and if I don't do something he's got throw me under the bus too okay so you don't want to present yourself as one of those people there's a way to present those things and there's a way not to the proper ways to walk in and say hey I didn't know if you guys knew this but there was a problem over here I fucking handled it this is what I did we probably got to make sure it doesn't happen again and you're talking terms of the team the mission right now all the sudden leadership's looking at this guy saying that guy fucking gets it right he's handling shit as it comes up he's taking initiative he's taking responsibility he's practicing good character he is team forward and he's saying the same thing he would have said if he said it the other way but a lot of you guys are so credit hungry and you think that like you need to get one up on the other guy that you end up making yourself look like a little wormy fuck by the way that you communicate yeah so real shit man yeah yeah one more follow yeah so so so one one follow less follow up because you know we talk about this transition of his mentality right like yes there's some things these looking at kind of wrong but there's an awesome some things yeah you know you're all on that yeah but changing this mentality or transition in it you know what what would you suggest like you know when looking at this he's getting these late night calls do you almost take like like I don't say like like you know are you almost proud like fuck man they're calling me to handle these problems is that something that can maybe help him transition over to that like I mean it's not an obligation to answer these I get to answer these and I'm the one that they think can solve these fucking problems well I mean yeah there's a level to that right like put the level to that the level of that is when you're later in business and you and you got the company running so well that like nobody really needs you anymore right and then when they call you're like fuck alright they still need me you know what I said but like when you do that too early in the game you know what ends up happening is you're building your own worth up but you're not building their skills up so part of the skill development for a leader that's beneath you in the chain is to have them figure it to fuck out so sometimes you know the answer but you don't fucking tell them the answer right or sometimes you pick up the phone and you'll say I mean my one of my favorite things is everybody in here fucking knows what I say they will call me on the fucking phone what will I say what do you think that's right there you go so that's how that's a great training tool for your management when they call you and they don't know what to do the flip it back on him and say hey what the fuck do you think bro this is what you're in the middle of it you're the fucking soldier if we're in a war and you're out there 30 miles over I don't know what the fuck that looks like right what the fuck do you think and then I'm gonna know the answer because I have experience it's been a slightly right yeah so he's gonna say either something that makes a lot of sense or something that's fucking ridiculous and if it's ridiculous I'll say well instead of saying hey you're a fucking moron which is what a lot of people do I'll say okay well what about this yeah what about that and I'll start to corral them back over to make them understand okay that's not the right call this would be the right call and I do that through asking strategic questions based upon what they are presenting as the information right yeah you don't want to take someone's wind out of their sales by saying bro that's a dumbest shit ever and by the way I did that for a long time okay I wasn't I didn't always understand what I'm telling you guys right now there's there's you know 10 years ago I was a different kind of leader a very way less skilled leader without people coming to me and I'd be like what the fuck do you fucking but and I get pissed right but what I started realizing is that I was missing opportunities to cultivate their skill set which is very simply what do you think and if they say the right thing say dude I think that's a great idea let's go fucking do that and then they own the solution which builds their skill builds their confidence it gives them the the approval to go out and handle things more right and then if they don't have the right answer you just corral them back in you say you say okay well what about this and if you thought about that and you've thought about this and these are all the things that you know why it's not going to work right and then they they they start there's like oh yeah I didn't think about that and now you're taking an opportunity where you would normally a low level leader who'd be like why the fuck you bringing me that and you're taking it and turning it into an actual skill development conversation every single time so when you answer the fucking phone you should be thinking of it is that this is an opportunity for me to make my team better by having a critical conversation with them and that's how I choose to look at it so it's not like the perspective of oh they need me right it is now for me because like my guys are so good I think in 25 years they're so good yeah like now I know like if that does make me feel good right because they don't need me that much right but the truth of the matter is is that you should look at every single along the way what no matter where you are in beginning of the journey the middle of journey you're you're established as an opportunity to develop and further the skill set of your leadership below you I love it man well guys Andy that was three yep go pay the fee
