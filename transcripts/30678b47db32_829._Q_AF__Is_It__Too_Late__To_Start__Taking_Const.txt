There's also a book called the book on mental toughness you get that at Andy for sell a calm when it's in stock. It outlines the entire live hard program top to bottom left to right in and out if you like the details it's a great book plus it has a whole bunch of chapters on mental toughness why it's important how to utilize it to change your life okay and then we'll have our 75 hard versus episodes people have completed the 75 hard program come on and talk about how they were before how they are now and how they use that program to transform their lives all right like I said huge group starting today I would start today now we are the biggest show in the world that does not run at because we make a little part of it with you a little deal deal is very simple share the show okay we put a lot of time and energy into the show the show makes you think if it makes you laugh you think it's good if you think it's good information if you learn something uh it brings a new perspective it's entertaining do us a favor and share the show okay we're constantly dealing with all kinds of censorship hopefully that will ensuing but it hasn't yet but we're still going to keep that deal with no ads and share the show so do a sassala don't be a hoe show the show all right what's up dude what's going on man then I feel like times moving quick we're already half way through the first month of the year bro I feel like the opposite I feel like January is like dragon on dude really yeah it's so weird I mean that the whole times relative thing man I don't know I feel like it's speeding past like we're already almost done with this month it's crazy I don't know man I feel the opposite hmm that went down the wrong pipe there yeah got it now my vocals yeah you have a crush with that I know yeah I don't got all that practice you got you know yeah all right I need you I need you to school me up a little bit you know how to do it I mean fuck dude you know can't be an expert everything listen you get with me after air and we can fix something out I'm sure you guys ever find that that new co-host application did you guys ever get on that said you wanted to learn I'll teach you not that was just think I mean because we have way through the first month January is always interesting time for a lot of people and so I got some really awesome questions for you but they're all kind of just focused on you know the more personal side you know because people are battling some issues going halfway through it's always right around this time I guess yeah I mean this is the time of year where everybody says the same shit bro I'm gonna this is going to be the year I'm gonna change my life I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do this and by the second week in the third weekend which is where we are now everybody gives the fuck up okay and then they wonder they spend the rest of the year miserable because they weren't able to get their shit together they live a life they don't want they they look the way they don't want they make the money they don't want and then they think they just got screwed by the world now bro you screwed yourself yeah that's the reality halfway through the first month they are we'll just try to make sure yeah yeah yeah it's like people who on their diet you know they they mess up on Tuesday and they're like oh I'm start again on Monday right and between Tuesday and Monday they stuffed themselves because they're like oh I'm gonna start Monday and then Monday comes and they mess up on the next Wednesday then they stuffed themselves and then they end up a hundred pounds overweight ask me how I know that because I live that for a long time dude and if we could just get people to understand that if we fix your ability to adhere to a program you could do anything you want that's the ultimate problem here the ultimate problem is you don't know how to do things when you don't feel like doing them and when you can fix that you can fix everything yeah man well let's do it then let's get into some some some some real real hard truths that need to be discussed a lot of people going through some different things so let's let's get into these questions guys any question number one Andy I've been working in hospitality for over a decade I'm burned out and ready for a change I've always been interested in graphic design and even took some courses online during the pandemic but I have no formal experience in the field at 38 I feel like it's too late to start over especially with financial pressures how do I pivot into a completely new career without starting from scratch or risking my stability well look dude that's that's a common thing that a lot of people have to deal with over a few different times in their life usually the first thing I would like to say to you is are you sure that's what you want to do because a lot of times you know things look good and shiny and new over here and we're bored with what it is that we're doing and then we jump from something that we're pretty good at to something we don't know anything about and we set ourselves back years okay so you don't want to do that so you want to make sure that is something that you want to do now if you're already doing it you're already taking classes and you're already practicing a good way to transition from where you are that has stability into a new field that does not have stability yet is to do it a little bit at a time okay keep your career where it is and then on your nights and your weekends and your free time you start doing little jobs and little projects and little bit work for hire for different people getting experience getting a resume getting good word of mouth recommendations okay and by the way getting practice of how to actually service a customer not just make the design but how to do so in a way that blows them away and makes them excited and makes them want to refer you to other people because let's face it if you can't get referrals from the business that you have you're probably not very good at what you do and if you can't get those referrals you're going to have a hard time getting to a place of stability you know from where you are now so pivot a little bit at a time nights weekends free time do these projects and as the income starts to grow over here you could start to reduce your amount over at your career and then eventually make the jump over another thing that you should do during this time is you should minimize expenses if you need to downsize your apartment or your house you know or your car or things that are quote unquote luxuries for you right now and I realize you probably aren't driving a Rolls Royce and you know you're probably like well I'm just driving the rig well you know what man maybe you got to get a shittier car maybe you got to get a shittier house how bad do you want this new life how bad do you want this new career and the reality of you know most people is they won't take a step back to take three or four or ten steps forward right they want to keep that big car payment they want to keep that apartment or that house that's their comfortable in and they want it all but you can't have it all so keep the career you have part time over here practice get good word of mouth get a good resume build a good portfolio slowly switch over and before you do any of that lower all the expenses that you have yeah people don't want to sleep on a piss day match yeah bro and that's part of the deal part of the deal is you got to go through that time you're not going to be the first person in history that's going to get where they want to go without facing the adversity of struggling financially struggling socially struggling with balance right we have this problem in society where everybody wants everything but they don't want to pay a price for anything okay and the great things in life they take steps back to make steps forward okay that's the reality so we have to understand dude if you really want what you say you want you're gonna have to make some sacrifices that are actually investments because there is a payoff on the backside and I think if people reframe that perspective from oh I'm making all these sacrifices to no I'm making investments because these are all gonna pay off long term that's a different game it's easier to get up and go to battle when you know that what you're struggling with right now is gonna have a payoff and that's the way the world works dude you know if you own a business you know you're gonna push for three or four years before you get real progress and then once you get real progress you're gonna have a ride for three or four years and then you know you're gonna have to repivot and you're gonna have to readjust and re re-acclimate and make a new plan and then push for another three years it's phases dude and it's phases in your life too just not in business it's in your life if you want to change you're gonna have to push and there's gonna be a delay gratification time frame where you're showing up you're working hard you're giving everything you have but nothing's happening and that time can be extremely frustrating and the reason that most people can't win is because they can't make it through that time of frustration to get to the other side there's a reason that there's the saying it's always darkest before the dawn okay because dude when you feel like you're gonna quit and you feel like things aren't gonna work if you just keep pushing that's when the things tend to work out another thing too I want to I want to bring up because and you hit on this about you know using the the spare time to develop yourself and I've actually seen this in play with you and how you run your company so you tell your employees at all the time like you're not gonna get better at the nine and five line nine to five right you know I'm saying because let's let's talk let's go a little bit more deeper into that like how what's the what's the hang up with that why do people not understand because that concept because people think that they're free time as they're free time they think that when I'm off work I don't have to work and when bro honestly it's such a amateur misunderstanding it almost fucking pisses me out actually does piss me off I mean ruins people no dude 100% you only have so much time bro you got 24 hours a day just like everybody else when you go to work you're expected to execute on a job you're not expected to increase your skill set or get a lot of practice reps or take your courses or you breeze your books that is the shit you do at home okay you do that in your free time quote unquote free time and you can spend your free time you know party and with your homies and doing all the shit but you can't expect your skills to grow if you're not actually actively trying to grow your skills and guess what skills pay the motherfucking bills and if you don't have them you're gonna be broke that's reality so you have to decide how important is it to you is it important enough for you to skip out on beers with the bros and fucking moving out with you know Susie rotten crotch you know I'm saying like some chick you don't even want to fucking be with you know spend time around is your future worth that I think it is you know what I'm saying I think you'll think it is too when you're making ten times the income that you're making now and your life's together and you're you live in a nice house you've got a nice partner that is actually someone that you know is on the level you want you got some nice cars you're doing well you're gonna say fuck dude I'm glad I did that but because you can't see it right now you see it as this big sacrifice oh man I gotta go hang out with the bros on guys night bro fuck that okay they're all gonna be broke in fucking ten years and you don't want to be so your time should be spent improving skillset like dude I disappeared for 15 years disappeared from social scene for 15 fucking years you know why because I had to get my skillset up I didn't know how to run a company so you know what I had to do I had to do everything I could to learn how right and that's not just me showing up every day and throwing fuck its spaghetti at the wall and hoping some of it sticks bro that's me going home reading books you know studying other entrepreneurs calling other people their own businesses having meetings learning things you know back when I was doing this there wasn't like this big quote unquote mentorship online which by the way is 99% useless anyway because all these motherfuckers haven't done anything but there wasn't guys like me read my let who have built big ass companies doing things like are they syndicate where you could get in there there wasn't people like me doing MFCO project which launches in two weeks again right that shit didn't exist there was books and then there was you know who you knew and how could you have a meeting with them how could you get close to them and like dude I had a bunch of small business owners that I happen to meet and know and I would do lunch with them or I would fucking try to you know be around them as much as possible instead of hanging out with a bunch of dudes who just want to get fucked up at the bar and by the way I like that that was fun but it's way more fun now when I could do whatever the fuck I want right so you have to understand dude that time that you think you know is people have this entitlementality bro that's my time that's my oh yeah okay it is are you working to get better are you are you gonna work to get better so you can provide for your family so you can provide for yourself or are you gonna fucking sit in your fat ass and fucking watch TV right it is your time and you get to choose what to do with it yeah so that's real yeah and you get you get what you put in dude it's just what it is and people don't think that they have this way of selling them selling themselves on a story that like oh well that you know I'm gonna put in all this work and I'm gonna do all these things and I'm gonna and it's still not gonna work out and that's what they sell themselves on so that they can go have the beers or go fuck off with the guys you know and it's just not true dude that's not gonna I want to I want to hit on with this question to this person's 38 years old there can we talk about this concept of starting too late is it too late is there like a deaf no it's not too late bro but it's too late if you're gonna be doing the way you've been doing it okay if you're gonna fucking you know fuck off and do half ass work and you know kind of float and hope that it's gonna work it shit and dude what you've done to get to 38 and be unhappy it yeah it's too late okay if you're gonna change your entire operating system and get disciplined and execute and take your time serious and win every mother fucking day and build your skill set no it's not too late but had you been doing this until you were 38 you'd already be a rich motherfucker so I know you're not doing it now so if you approach the new thing like you did the old thing yeah it's too late but it's not too late if you decide to change every way you go about it yeah I love it man yeah I love it guys Andy question number two Andy I recently got some feedback at work that I came across as defensive during a team meeting I didn't realize how much criticism bothers me until I started reflecting on it I want to learn to accept constructive feedback without taking it personally but it's hard to not feel attacked how can I shift my mindset and see criticism as an opportunity to grow you want to get better or not you want to make more money or not do you want to have a nice house or not you want to have a nice life or not if you don't get your little pussy heard about every time someone says something to you how cry don't listen think you're right think you know everything and then you know make it a big deal every time someone criticizes you if you actually want those things you should be open to critiques and you should be willing to take them and say okay that is true I need to work on this I need to improve here and that will improve and then be thankful for it okay it's a totally polar opposite attitude we have people who get their fucking feelings hurt and cry and moan and make excuses and say oh well you know they're not right I'm right those people end up broke okay people who end up not broke are people who take criticisms and take critiques even if they're directed at a personal level and say yeah dude all right I got that yeah okay so the more that you can take critique wise and accept and be happy that you have it the better you're gonna get the less you could take the worse you're gonna get and one of them pays well and one of them does not so do you want to be rich do you want to make money do you want to be successful or do you want to be a broke little fucking booger I think you know something is it true I think that the part where you said is it true though like is the criticism true yeah well a lot of time dude it just depends a lot of times people can't remove their ego out of the way to accept something is truth yeah right that's the point like people will be like oh that's not fucking true yeah right well it maybe it's not but is it right right like I don't think you take everybody's criticism like dude when these morons on the internet say shit about me I don't give a fuck like bro I don't want your life I don't want to look like you I don't want to make the money you're making I don't want you're fucking any I don't want to drive your car I don't want to live in your fucking house so why the fuck do I give a shit what you have to say about me right but if someone who is successful says hey you should work on this I'm gonna stop and I'm gonna say hmm and I'm gonna think back and I'm gonna audit all those situations moving up to this point in time and be like you know is that true and then kind of work through these different scenarios and say yeah I did that there I did this here that is something I could work on that is something I could get better at and then and then look at the person be like bro thank you for pointing that out when you become a mature you know man or woman and you're seriously driven to be better you're going to understand that criticism and coaching is part of the thing that you need to be thankful for but as you pointed out you got to be careful who you take it from and I wouldn't take it from anybody that doesn't have a life that you fucking want unless it's someone who used to have a life that you want that no longer has it because they can tell you how to avoid losing it it almost makes me think too because like on the other hand you know you have people that will not tell you what's wrong or not tell you the truth and tell you everything's okay you have people who will tell you shit that's not even it DJ you have people that will tell you shit that's not true to try fuck you up you don't even understand how fucking dirty people are but girls are like that girls will fuck you look fine oh yeah girls will do that to each other all the time we all know it right they'll tell they'll tell them but how's this look oh that looks great knowing that it doesn't look good yeah right now imagine in business when you're competing with a bunch of people you don't think that happens so you're gonna have a lot of people that are gonna tell you things that aren't true to get in your head try to fuck you up so you got to be real good about who you listen to and who you don't and you got to learn how to tune certain things out and if they aren't where you want to be they don't make the money you want to make they don't have the life you want to live you shouldn't fucking listen to them and and if they do give you a critique and you're not sure you should dig in and see hey what did this person do what if they built where is their headquarters where are their employees how what have they done to get to this point where they think they can give me advice I mean the reality is dude most people have no idea and they're so comfortable giving advice on fucking anything any of you guys who have ever had kids know how much people want to give advice on fucking kids and then you look at their kids and their kids are little fucking shit bags right yeah like their kids are running around like wild fucking animals and they're giving you advice right that's that's the same shit that happens in business bro people people are five dollars away from being broke but they're giving you financial advice they've never run an aid stand but they're telling you how to run your company right this is the shit that people do they want to fucking feel good they think they know shit that they don't and most people are you know they're they have an inflated ego they think they're they're more important than they actually are I was going to actually that's the same thing with not not taking criticism it sounds like it's boiling down to just being an ego issue oh yeah yeah both sides yeah yeah I mean bro your ego your ego can be too big to where you ignore good criticism it can be to beat down to where you take all the criticism and then you have no direction on where you're going so you got to find a balance in there you got to know what you know you got to know what you don't know you got to know who you should listen to and you got to know who you should listen to and these are things that you have to figure out and if you don't figure them out you're going to be confused and when you're confused it makes it hard to effectively operate your life and your project of income or business or job or whatever you got going on yeah I love it man well guys we got we got question number three we got one more for you this is it's an interesting question let's check this one out guys any question number three and I'm 27 years old and my question is very simple does it get easier I understand that it's life right you get the crap made out of you a few times but does it get easier and if it does then win and if it does it how do so many people make it look easy I appreciate everything you do no it doesn't get easier in fact it gets harder okay and I know that's hard for people to understand but when you start in the beginning the decisions you make while they have perceived large consequences what's the worst that could happen you fuck up your shit and you're back to zero where you were last week okay when you actually are at a higher level you're making decisions that don't just benefit you or affect you but you're making decisions that affect everybody right now in my life if I make a decision in business there's thousands of people that have to deal with that decision 20 years ago when I made that same decision it was six people right okay so it's totally different it does not get quote unquote easier it just gets different all right you don't have the same struggles that you had when you have some money as when you didn't have money but you got different ones all right and like people say oh more money more problems no it's more money different problems okay because I don't have to worry about me going out to dinner and paying the bill right or like sweating that like fuck dude I hope she doesn't order that right like but no I don't think too 100% bro fuck yeah bro you think I don't remember that a fucking remember being on dates and sweating my balls off hoping that she didn't order the fucking steak I'll just take a water yeah bro like bro we've all been there so so we have to get to an understanding that it's not going to get easier you have to get stronger and that is why the live hard program is so successful it's why 75 hard is so successful because it takes people who are mentally soft and it shows them that if they can control their internal dialogue which they can and they can execute when they don't feel like it you become in control of almost all the outcomes in your life most people can only execute when they feel good if you could be someone who can execute whether you feel good or whether you feel like shit and you can execute at a high level that means that the 30% of the time where they feel good and the 66.66% of the time where they feel like shit and they're not executing you have a 66% advantage over the time that you're executing that they don't which means you're doing two thirds more work than what they're doing okay it's fucking math so you have to train yourself to become someone who is resilient who has fortitude who has grit who can persevere who can pay attention to their boss voice not their bitch voice and can execute against the things that they know are going to move them where they want to go even when they don't feel like it and if you can do that it will become quote unquote easier you will perceive it to be easier it will not be easier you will be stronger okay but that's the only thing you can do because you can't go right a letter to God and say man pretty fucking hard down here take it easy yeah I'd appreciate if you made it easier for me that doesn't work okay but what does work is learning how to control the decisions that you make a hundred percent of the time which give you control of most of the outcomes in your life that is what makes it feel easier all right but no dude if you continue to operate the same way you're operating and you continue to you know just hope that it's going to get easier if fucking doesn't it does not get easier I remember having a conversation with a guy who was sort of a mentor to me one time and I met him for lunch dude and this guy was at the time he was a big fucking deal and I remember sitting we we had lunch we were sitting at a bar and we were just talking and I I looked at him and I said hey dude um you know because at that time in business every day that the end of day numbers and the performance came in I let it affect me in a big way so like I would get my numbers at 10 o'clock at night and if they were bad I couldn't fucking sleep if they were good I couldn't sleep because they were good right like so so every day I was looking at this performance and it was driving me fucking crazy and I was about 10 years in the business here and I fucking looked at him and I said hey bro when does that stop and he goes dude it doesn't stop he's like it he laughed he laughed at me he goes it never stops and he's right and never does stop and it's never stopped that was I don't know 15 years ago 16 years ago it's never stopped I still I'm still the same way um but I don't have the emotional ups and downs anymore because I've learned to be confident in my actions and I know that I'm executing on a daily let daily basis so if I'm executing on a daily basis and I've been doing it long enough to know that that's what produces the results then I have confidence in my actions that they're going to bear fruit in the direction that I want to go right and that takes away the uncertainty that takes away the fear that takes away the you know the perception of hardness and it just becomes what you do every day so it's all about controlling your own ability to make decisions the decisions that you know you need to make and then allowing yourself to build confidence in the fact that your inputs are going to equal outputs and then putting all the inputs in consistently and then understanding that it really doesn't matter what happened today because what I did today isn't going to bear fruit for 30 60 90 days down the road does that make sense so so now I know that I'm planting the seeds I know there's going to be a harvest so I'm not fucking freaking the fuck out it doesn't feel as hard does that make sense all you can do is what the fuck you can do bro and if you can do the things you know you need to do and you can do them every day eventually you will be in a place where you understand that those seeds are going to bear fruit okay you ever heard of the Chinese bamboo tree Chinese bamboo tree you plant the fucker in the ground okay and for five years it stays in the ground for five years doesn't show any sprouting doesn't show any signs of life now if the farmer goes out and fucking digs up the seed in three days because it didn't grow what's going to happen nothing they ever going to grow right so you have to have it has to have water it has to have care it can't be disturbed and then five years later it grows to a height of 80 feet in like six weeks okay so that is how your career will work that is how projects work when you plant the seed you have to water it you can't disturb it you have to keep doing it making sure you're taking care of it and eventually it goes real fast that's that's how your life is going to work that's how your business is going to work it's like it's just a masterclass in delay gratification and most people can't push through the delay part to ever get to the gratification they've never they've never been able to learn how it actually works so if they don't know how it works you know when the time feels like it's too long or it's taken too long they quit and they start over dude and this is why most people you know they do something for two three four years and then they switch their careers completely and they're like oh that wasn't for me I didn't like it when dude real talk they were probably on the verge of having a major breakthrough you two weeks away from it correct and so dude you have this two to four year cycle where people work and then they get frustrated and then they and then they quit and they change right and now they're starting over from zero again so now you've got another two to four years to learn the craft put in the work put in the time become disciplined become a hot and then you get there and then they start over again you do that three times that's 12 fucking years you see what I'm saying they do fucking bamboo tree by now three of them right you know I'm saying like dude it is a it is a the instant gratification that we deal with in society is super damaging right people get on the internet especially with young people they get on the internet they can talk to their friends across the world with the click of a button they can order food it's there in 10 minutes they can throw shit in a microwave and it's it's cooked in three minutes that everything they want to do movies on demand fucking call it it hasn't always been that way it's not always been that way in culture and life like you were you know dude I grew up in a time where you couldn't talk to your friends across the world with the click of a fucking button bro I mean it wasn't that long ago okay you weren't connected when you left the house all right there was a bunch of cultural differences that you know there was no grub hub there was no instant food bro I remember when they started listen dude I can remember when pizza delivery started and became that started yes because bro it wasn't a big thing and then all the sudden dude you could get a pizza at your house like do people that are young have no idea how much the world's changed in such a short amount of time and because the world has changed to all these instant things people have lost their ability to persevere they have lost their ability to be patient they've lost their ability to push through and because the natural environment that we live in doesn't lend itself to learning patience or learning how to persevere we have to put ourselves in intentionally hard situations that force us to experience delay gratification which is another thing that live hard does and 75 hard does it's a fucking necessary boot camp for people to understand how to develop the qualities that end up making them successful and anything that they do okay but you can't expect young kids who have never had to exercise patience of any sort to understand patience right and that's a big problem because to become successful it's going to take patience that's the one thing that hasn't changed so everything else has changed everything's more convenient everything's faster everything's instant but your career in your business didn't change that way you've still got to show up way past the time where you're you know excited about it and you've got to execute for the results to happen and that's reality dude and unfortunately you know most people that are listening to this are between the ages of 18 and 35 and most of those people haven't had a life that made them uh learn these skills naturally okay and that's why you have to intentionally do them that's why we have the book on mental toughness that's why the live hard program exists I built it for you guys so that you guys could train yourselves to have these skills and these qualities that are going to make you successful long term that's the thing I'm going to hit on here maybe this might be for another episode um you know but this is last piece of the question too I was just sitting at the thing is like why do so many people make it look easy that's the other part too with the social media shit man is that you gotta keep in mind people you're seeing what people want you to see correct and there's really when you deal with influencers on social media bro like you gotta understand when you tell someone man this is easy they're more likely to buy it okay um when you tell someone hey listen dude there is no fucking easy way this is gonna take everything you fucking have do you think they want to buy that yeah I go somewhere else it's hard to fucking sell that yeah okay and then on top of it social media in general is an ego-tistical platform all right now I I understand we all have to do it we all have to put ourselves out there we all have to to our own horn because if we don't to our own horn nobody's going to to for us so I understand we've got to step out we've got to be a you know a little bold but at its heart it's a narcissistic ego-tistical platform it's a look at me look at me look at me right it is what it is it's necessary for business at this point in time for most people all right so I'm not knocking it I mean if you're gonna have them look at you might as well be a fucking rock star I'm just saying right but there's a problem with that especially when it comes to entrepreneurs entrepreneurs are competitive people entrepreneurs like to tell other entrepreneurs how good they are and they like to pretend like the hardest things are actually easy for them and the problem with that is is that you put this out there because you want to seem like you've got it all figured out and it's so easy for you and you have all these natural skills and you're better than all the other entrepreneurs but here's the problem bro that young kid who's 19-20-21-22-25 that guy is looking at you and it's hardest fuck for him and he's like fuck it must be me it must be me this messed up because this is easy and it's and so like dude I've never I've never bought into that I've always tried to tell people like look dude this is the hardest thing you're gonna ever do it's gonna take everything you got it's gonna cost you your own life 100% all your old friends all your old relationships but it's gonna be worth it over time because everything else that comes in your life is gonna serve the vision and the goal of what you're trying to become so it's a good thing it's just hard to go through and because we have so many even real entrepreneurs we have some good real entrepreneurs that make it seem like they're better than they are and I know these motherfuckers in real life like these guys will call me and they'll be like fuck dude what do you think they're stressing out right but but you go on the internet and I'm talking about the biggest names out there dude and you go on the internet and they're like oh yeah just do this and that this this is easy blah blah blah bro it's it's not easy it's hard as fuck and we don't do anybody any favors by making it seem easy just to a p's are ego so that we can look like we're better than the next guy you know what makes this look better than the next guy win and bigger than the next guy you know what also makes this look better than the next guy creating as much success as we possibly can and the way that we create as much success as we possibly can for other people is by telling them the truth about how fucking hard it actually is and then preparing them to go down that road okay instead of just saying oh man what's wrong with you you can't make you can't make 50 grand of fucking day you know like you know I'm saying like you can't you can't do that so uh it's not a real it's not a real it I don't know it's I don't know how to say what I'm trying to say we have a culturally fucked up society because of the environment and the technology that we have available to us to where they have a hard time understanding that things that matter are still very hard and take a lot of time and that's the biggest handicap that we have with young people and so I've always tried and you can go back and check my receipts I've always try to tell people man like I'm pretty good at what I do I'm I'm real good at what I do okay I'm not gonna sit here and fucking play it down I'm fucking one of the best in the world at what the fuck I do and it's hard as fuck for me it's hard as fuck for me so I know it's hard for you okay so here's my advice get better get stronger build more skills build discipline once you have the ability to have discipline and you can adhere to any plan that is laid out before you there's nothing you can't do okay so that's my advice on that I love it man yeah I love it guys and that's three hell of a way to start them under yeah guys let's go out there big week this week uh culture's gonna change wind is coming back let's get out there and kick some ass
