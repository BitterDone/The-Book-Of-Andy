Oh, and The rich man The rich man Oh That's awesome. That's bad ass first of all let's be real like he looks like he's from Missouri Okay, I think I've seen this guy. I have to like I saw this morning gas station for them But here's the thing This is the greatest thing about it That's real America. Yeah, that's the majority of people in this country feel the way that that man feels And it doesn't matter if you're black it doesn't matter if you're white Doesn't matter if you're American Indian or whatever else you want to identify as He's talking about Americans, you know, and what I thought was interesting Is all the communist dumb fucks and the socialist dumb fucks On his comments on that page thinking that he's talking about anti-capitalism No, he's talking about the rich men north of rich men Which if you go on a map and you look at the city directly north of rich men virginia What city is that? Oh, that's washing in DC and where do all these tyrants live and who's trying to control everything And who's making these rules about the dollar being shit and us being taxed to death and all the things he's saying No, he's talking about the government Not your local entrepreneur dumbasses Holy shit Like these people are so dumb you can't even like talk to them. Yeah, like they're so fucking dumb. You can't even talk to them Anyway, this guy's awesome. Here's what I thought was cool, too. Beautiful. Did you see yesterday? Um Who sang with him? Yes Jimmy Johnson. I saw that Amy Johnson bro and a lot of people are like a lot a lot of you guys when I talk about Jamie Johnson you guys like who? Yeah He's like the best vocalist and probably best songwriter to come out of Nashville in the last 50 fucking years Yeah, okay, he's amazing and the dude shows up at this guy's little concert and starts singing in color Which is his most famous song which I thought was amazing. Yeah Yeah, I just fucking dope as of right now. I think he has a total of three songs that are in the top 10 for iTunes which I don't think there's any other musicians that have ever done that which I mean like if if this is not one of the most Accurate I think temperature checks That we've had in them in a long time like this is this is it bro. Yeah, is it though because like We've seen this since 2020 Remember when they were running fake polls on Yahoo and they were saying Would you patronize a restaurant That forced people to show a vaccine card and 85% of the people said no Like the data has always been there. We've always It's if you look and you don't listen to MSM and you don't listen to the internet and you don't listen to these talking head dumbasses If you look at the data and you know how to read in between alliance to look at the indicators of culture The numbers have always been right where where they are They've convinced us through propaganda over the course of time that it's not this way They've used bots. They've used influencer deals They've used Hollywood leverage and I say leverage because I don't think they're paying these people I think they're blackmailing these people But they've used every single Tool in their tool belt to make us think that we were alone All right, and this man singing this song about these issues that most of America feels right now This is just another indicator of how people are responding. I don't think it's the first one I don't think it's the best one I think his music's amazing. I think he's got a tremendous voice dude. I mean, even those guitar skills, bro I mean this guy's tremendously Talented and he's clearly putting a lot of work into this. I wouldn't I'm not gonna sit here and say oh, he's god gift talent I guarantee you he's worked his ass off to be that guy. Yeah, and he's good And I'm glad I'm glad it's happening for him because he deserves it. Yeah I think the like what I like the most is like the lyrics man Just like the what he does with those lyrics like Even the miners part like a second verse. I'm a bro. Like that's some deep shit, man. Yeah, what was the line? I wish politicians would care about miners like coal miners Not just miners on the island somewhere exactly. Yeah, meaning jet Epstein's I mean Epstein bro That's some deep shit, man, and I just like the way he called it out, man I think music between music and comedy, bro Like those two things Tell the truth they tell the truth. Yeah, but dude also we got to remember that like a lot of these people You know blue collar America is first of all I know there's a lot of 20-year-old kids think they're too good for blue collar shit Which is a big problem, but also presents a massive opportunity and blue collar America is is the backbone of our country And it still is it will be forever Unless we allow these people to you know, encroach on it with AI and robotics mixing together Which is a real thing that could happen if we don't regulate it or resist or stand up Listen, we're we're at a key point in human history Like if humans don't stand up for human beings at this point in time The entire civilization of humanity will crumble and we're fucking crumble Okay, that's what we're dealing with and people do not get it and I hope I hope that people start to get it, but You know this situation with You know how What exactly what he's talking about how these people in government are behaving in a way That is completely contradictory to all of Real America and their livelihoods, you know, it's it's insanity and and it's cool to see people noticing But like dude you guys that are noticing just now you're so far behind the curve that like They might still get their way because y'all been sleeping. Yeah, you know It's real shit man, guys tell us what you guys think But let's get into our headlines man. Let's start this cruise remember guys If you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for sale.com you can find them there You can also drop down in the youtube description below and find them linked there as well. So that being said Let's get into the nitty gritty. We got a lot of other things to cover But this is the biggest story of the day. We got to talk about it. Let's get to it This is headline number one headline number one reads Maui wildfires leave trail of death and destruction. This is CNN this is their version of live updates Um and they're talking about what they're covering. So the official death toll has reached 96 in the wildfires of Maui Uh, and there are warnings it could rise further the blaze that devastated the historic town of Lahana is now the deadliest US wildfire In over a hundred years official set Um as Maui residents sift through the ashes of what used to be homes and beloved landmarks some say the island is struggling to provide housing for those displaced Uh by the fires now There's a lot of Interesting developments will call them all right that are all circling this thing. So I just thought to be good that we cover them and and let's see what we get out of this So one of the first things that that that came up Um, this is also a CNN headline That's surprisingly, but it reads Hawaii has a robust emergency siren warning system It set silent during the deadly wildfires So this was kind of one of the first things uh, they're kind of developed out like why we're not like where were the alarms Where were the alerts? Where was the notification that something was wrong, right? Um, and the scene in article reads uh, representative jill takuta a democrat said the state quote under estimated the lethality The quickness of fire and that the redundancies in the emergency alert system failed Hawaii residents have long been accustomed to the monthly test of the outdoor siren warning system So all of this was underestimated Okay Um now there's been a lot of people that has been jumping on to to help you know Obviously, this is a real situation, right? There's definitely been people that are affected by this um, and so there's been a lot of uh, you know Different organizations that are coming out trying to put resources together to help Arget buddy actually my blubber he he chimed it on this conversational instagram um and twitter uh he uh tweeted this out and says quote Maui is 100 miles from the biggest US bases in the country The death toll is above 50 plus and many more missing Where is the surge of support for americans where are the military helos and planes If we can search for Ukraine, why can't we search for our own country You know he went further on to say on instagram he says quote most deadly natural disaster in american history and where is our gov How about we flex that 24 billion just proposed for Ukraine to assist our own citizens in Maui We should be mobilizing the might of our active military support in the biggest conist development uh deployment in modern history Got you'd have to be awake to do that. I'll be posting resources where you can help fellow citizens this week on prepped life If you have vetted means of support leave them down below in the comments. So he's been um, you know There's been a lot of like I guess grassroots activity around this uh natural disaster or disaster. We should just call it for now Um, but one thing that has been um kind of on a lot of people's mind is where's Joe Where's Joe Biden sharply criticized after saying no comment and response to death toll and Hawaii Absolutely terrible. Here's the video um, so they're trying to get Joe Biden to make some type of comment mind you this man's Vacationing right now, okay. It's not been to Maui's not been to Hawaii Um, and this is the first time they were able to get him on camera and ask for a comment. This was his response Uh nothing there Yeah, so critics responded to Sinks post and hammered the president's response saying it was embarrassing Uh MSNBC host Medi Hassan who frequently defends the White House said Biden's reported response would quote unquote hurt him And called it unforced at uh errors Here's the picture that was shared that that started the whole thing. He's just been been on the beach chilling now It's been growing on five days when you guys have heard this podcast before days as up today when we're recording Um, and it wasn't until about four hours ago that anything coming from Biden or the White House came out And this was the first week that came out from president's Biden Twitter page is it reads quote As residents of Hawaii mourn the loss of life and devastation taking place across their beautiful home We mourn with them like I've said not only our prayers are with those impacted, but every asset we have will be available to them Um, anybody got on this Well I mean look There there's a lot of different stories coming out of Hawaii Um that don't really go along with the narrative that it was just a random fire. Yeah um You know, there's people talking about direct energy weapons. Yeah, there's people talking about it being set intentionally Um, because that particular area of Hawaii Is occupied by natives to Hawaii Who have refused to sell their property for generations Um, it's worth a lot of money Yeah, but they haven't sold it like other places in the country like black rock cannot buy their property and You know, it's just interesting that of all the places that this takes place You know, it takes place In a place where the the citizen the citizenry is resisting Uh, the buyout of of the area the government hand yeah, right and you know, this aid that they're talking about That that you know the government Uh Supposedly gives them like you know what they're doing That people don't realize this they're basically offering people interest-free loans To uh to rebuild their property. So like let's say you own the house there at Barton down, right? Um, they're saying well, okay, well, that's okay We'll give you a new mortgage that you can rebuild on and it's interest-free. Just got to pay us back later While those sending literally at the exact same time 24 more billion dollars to Ukraine. There's no payback on that Right, this is how we get treated citizens and we're not treated fairly and these people aren't representative of us and This is just becoming another show of exactly how Much they do not give a shit about the concerns of the American people in fact Like I've been saying for many years now their goal is to make it everything worse their goal is to make us Feel pain Beyond what you could probably comprehend Because I don't believe this is ever going to stop. I don't I don't believe that there's a basement to this I believe that they're main they're I believe they're they're going to eventually put us into the Stone Age no internet no power no nothing for a period of time To try and restart under their new system to force the reset correct and you know We've been talking about these cyber attacks from apparently, you know quote unquote China and all these issues that Klaus Schwab has been warning about And who's to say that they're not planning on attacking the infrastructure shutting down the power Directly after the fact that they report ever they force everybody to change over to digital currency Imagine the chaos that could be created if they forced everybody to go to digital currency and after they went to digital currency They shut the power off Imagine what would happen? All right now that's that's in my opinion their end goal I think that's the last thing that they're going to do to totally put us in a position where you know they can come in later and say Oh, you know, we have this great solution to this and the solution is their global assistant right because when when when it's literally the wild wild west And people are killing each other in the streets over bottles of water Any sort of order is going to be accepted and that's the only way you're going to get American citizens to accept some sort of communism is by making it so painful to be anything else and This is why American citizens should be standing up should be speaking up should be getting involved should be uniting with their neighbor Should be realizing that this isn't a left versus right Democrat versus Republican black versus white issue. This is a American people versus a out of control tyrannical government issue that will only be solved if the citizens of this country come together and realize what's actually happening, you know and You know, I there's a lot of theories about what's going on at this situation Hawaii You know some of the things I read from people that are actually supposedly from there and I didn't verify Um, but that the death toll is much much much higher than what they are Predicting now. Yeah, I've heard in the thousands. Well, yeah, some people are saying that like well the the the first respond to search officials Incident command they're saying that they haven't even searched. They're not 3% yeah, they're not letting people in and out From what I heard and I also heard the reason they're not letting people in and out is because A lot of the parents were actually at work and this particular area There was a lot of children at home and because allegedly school was supposedly canceled on this day So we have a whole bunch of we have a higher percentage of child deaths than normal and the reason they're keeping it so tight From what I've been reading from multiple sources, which could be bullshit Okay, because I don't know these people But the reason that they're keeping things so tight is because they don't want people to riot and like literally kill the government down there We see what they're also alluding to two bro right like what what's the narrative that there are like and of course they're coming with it because it's a new agenda Climate change they're trying to blame this on climate change Yeah, of course they do they're going to take any pain or suffering that is created Um, whether it's man-made or natural and they're going to use it to push their agenda You know, that's what they're going to do that's what they've been doing for years and years and years We have videos and pictures and a number of arrests and prison sentences to show that a lot of these wildfires that have been set in California and Canada We're actually set by climate activists. They were set by people pushing for climate change and Then ran with by the media and by the quote unquote thought leaders of the world which they're not thought leaders they're monetizing a fake movement that isn't real in order to get funding all right so and we have we have number of people who have come out over the course of You know this whole climate change Initiative that have shown the light on what's actually going on and the the two films that we like to talk about here Because I think they're the best films on the subject are called agenda and agenda to and you You I think you could see those still on Amazon Prime But uh those films discuss exactly what the climate agenda is all about So who's pushing the climate agenda? It's the same people that are pushing for Digital IDs. It's the same people that are pushing for digital currency It's the same people who are pushing for like Oliver said in his song total control And that's what we're dealing with and these people are not going to let up They're not going to give up and they're not going to stop even if that means killing their own people and setting their own fires to Provide the evidence for their argument, right? And so like dude. This is we're getting into like mass criminal activity that Cannot be tolerated. Yeah citizens cannot tolerate this. No, well then you couple that with like the immense lack of transparency Or honesty and not knowing what's true and not true, bro. It's it's gonna create that Intentionally. Yeah, that's all part of the demoralization process I want to bring up something to the that I've been seeing too. I'm not sure if you're People are confused like that, bro. They don't know what to fight for because they don't know what's true Yeah, it's very difficult. Half I would say more than half of what we fight for Down here in real world, right? Is is our differences On our perception of the information. Okay, that's a huge problem. Yeah, this wasn't like this like like 20 years ago You got a lot of you young guys listen to show you don't know that this was wasn't always like this Like the media wasn't always a propaganda machine to the extent of what it is now. Yeah You know, they're intentionally creating a scenario Where we have to argue with each other about what information is true and what information is not true Because they understand that if we argue about the data that we're given and we question the information that we're given That it's impossible for us to unite When in reality what we should be doing is we should be uniting around the core values of what it means to be an actual American And looking for the similarities not the differences amongst our fellow man and realizing that like look dude You come from this walk of life this guy over here. He comes from a different walk. I come from a different walk of life You know what we're all getting taken advantage of by these people that are supposed to have our interests in mind and we're gonna have to put Whatever differences aside for a minute and work on solving that or none of us are gonna even have anything to argue about Yeah, it's it's fucking crazy, man. I think it's like Yeah, it is fun to think about but like I mean even me when I'm putting together these these outlines right and I'm reading through these headlines You go to one place and they say it's fucking red You go over to this place. It's fucking blue. Yeah, it's like complete opposite. That's intentional. You know people can't understand the idea of of media outlets Being compromised right But also putting out different information like a lot of people have a problem understanding that Fox news for the most part Is part of the media matrix now that they've gotten rid of Tucker Carlson these people for the most part Are just there to provide the alternative to what the liberal media says Okay, and the reason that they do this and the reason that both of them give Various accounts of the same information is to stir the division amongst the population Because if we're arguing over what's true what's not true or what may be true Then how can we find what it's supposed to be that we have in common so that we can work together to stop the stuff from happening exactly They understand that they were playing that game. We the people haven't gotten smart enough yet We're still arguing over you know dumb ass shit that they tell us to argue about like like how much melon and we got in our skin You know what I'm saying? Yeah, that's what shit. I was bringing up this last little point on the story man that that that I've been seeing I'm sure you probably seen it also But this guy right here, okay So this guy police chief is the Maui police chief John pelletier, okay And I've been able to confirm that some of my own like it's this guy Was the incident commander at the Las Vegas mass shooting which is number 2017 which has never been satisfactorily solved No, okay, we're investigating they gave us a bullshit story three days after the event and it was closed Like this dude just randomly carried up a fucking arsenal to this room and nobody noticed nobody knows you know I'm saying like bro you and I travel quite a bit. How many times a day or is the service in the room They're in there at least once a day even if you have do not disturb on yeah, all right So this guy have to be yes, so this guy Carried up all these guns all these weapons had all these resources. He's he's a borderline elderly man And he put like do you think of the physical exertion it would take to fire that many rounds into that crowd uninterrupted Like you're talking about like people who have never shot guns before that they don't think about these things You and I have spent extensive amounts of time with firearms You guys who served in the military have been trained in the police you guys know what I'm talking about like this isn't This is not something somebody who was in physical good shape could even accomplish they couldn't even do it Like my dad like if you put my dad up there with all that shit he couldn't even physically do it You know what I mean? And this is there's so many holes and I'm missing a lot and forgive me for you guys who are more well-rounded on the situation I might be but We all know that there's some a lot of shit there that hasn't come out or hasn't been told and all the sudden this guy's in the middle of this of this new one Bro, good makes sense man. No, it doesn't doesn't make sense because We're looking at it through the perspective that these people care about us if if we look at it through the perspective of the reality Which is they don't care about us and they want to hurt us and they're willing to do anything they can to get their way Then it actually makes perfect sense. Yeah, that's real shit man. That's real shit. I just thought man dude. Yeah Yeah guys jump in on this conversation. I'll tell you this Hawaiians don't fuck around bro. No, they don't want these Hawaiian people are going to get to the bottom of this and there will be like I wouldn't be surprised if If an uprising happens there It's not a kick go for out listen, oh listen, dude. There's there's more There's There's a bigger picture here that it could be as well, okay? And you know normally this is where I put my tinful ahead on but I'm not gunna because I don't want to disrespect the people who've been affected by this because it's fucking a whore or shit, okay? but You know who's to say that They wanted this land they figured out a way to create this this tragedy And they wanted to test the response because I can tell you this if they had done this in like the 48 states here There would be massive riots at at this location. So who's to say that they aren't testing out the response Because this is an island that moat the rest of us can't get to yeah, you see what I'm saying like I don't trust these people dude at all like I my my perspective is and I understand that it's not palatable for a lot of people But my perspective is very simply these people hate us And they're willing to do anything they can to push us down and raise them up and create distance between the peasant class Which is us all right and then and that's what they're willing to do and if that means killing us if that means making us take a You know an injection that wasn't tested if that makes us ignore effective therapeutics if that makes if that means that we have to look the other way is Millions of undocumented military age males come across the border or crime burns our cities down And we point these things out and we're a bigot by these people standards And I'm a fucking bigot bro because I'm not letting these people point do this shit without saying anything Like these people are destroying your country my country and our livelihoods and they're doing it rapidly And the only reason they're able to do it is because we can't get along and we can't realize that we have a common enemy That common enemy is not your local entrepreneur or your your the white guy that lives down the street or the black guy that lives down the street Or the random troll on the internet that fucking hates your guts you guys are all in the same boat You don't get it. You're in the same boat And until people can realize and they've set this up so perfectly dude because the way the internet is now It's created the scenario where people are willing to do Anything for attention, okay?

No, man people in California you get you're getting what the fuck you deserve Real talk and those of you who say oh, I vote conservative. I voted for this. I voted for that Well, you didn't do a good enough job talking about it I got on to one of my other buddies the other just yesterday same day because he said something about Voting Against Biden or something and he started getting attacked saying oh you're a 2024 Trump supporter and then he makes this like long apology inside of this thing like saying you know that's Like bit not apologizing but more so justifying that he you know just be like he was like just because I don't agree with What's going on doesn't mean I'm supporting Trump in 2020 listen? That's the problem going on right now All of you people keep apologizing for pointing out things that are clearly and obviously true All right stop apologizing for what the fuck you believe okay. I don't care if it's Trump I don't care if it's bozo the clown. I don't give a shit We need someone who's gonna clean this shit up Okay, and those of you are apologizing and justifying your positions on things you're just enabling them to attack you They're get you bro. They won when they attack you say yeah, I'm sure right you're fucking right you like what dude You didn't listen we were at your wedding we were at your wedding and I was in I was an elevator and it was me And a couple dudes from the photography team and like six other people I didn't know all right And one of your cousins was like bro. I listened to your show all the time. It's fucking amazing and somebody else I told you it was yeah says Well, we'll see if you guys are talking that same shit when Trump's back in office and I'm like Listen bro. This had nothing to do with with left right black white whatever like I gave him a fucking talk right there You know like dude we have to stop this shit. We have to stop thinking that Like because other people tell us it's shameful to vote a certain way tell them to eat a fucking dick. Yep a big one Yeah, like big black dude Really for real dude like you guys out here like all you guys at California You know why you're doing you know like all the conservative mind of people or the people who just stand for common sense Do you know why your state is a shit hole because you're a pussy And you won't have the conversations needed to have and you won't state the truth that you observe And you continue on with your little Instagram life talking about things like it's perfect And now you're in a shitty spot and you're in a shitty spot because of your own cowardice. Yeah real talk I mean do look at this real quick. So this is from Daily Mail they put out this this this article headline read San Francisco is dying Before an after video shows the mass exodus of huge brands like Crater Barrel CVS and office depot from the crime written city cop and a doom loop And I just want to show the pictures. I mean I don't go through the article But just look at these before that so that Gavin Newsom is the guy that the establishment is gonna try to put it in his present substitute for Biden Because you don't such a great job bro like look at this shit. Well like these dumbasses will still vote for him These people dude these people know The they will say oh, but they will they will say well, it's not Biden. It's Newsom Like dude these people are the listen their IQ is so low Or they're so attached to their own identity as a Democrat that they refuse to acknowledge What their policies are actually creating and that's very dangerous We cannot wait around anymore for these people to understand. Yeah, we cannot wait around for them to cross over We have to assume that they're never coming and we've got to go build the country our own fucking way The majority of America which is common sense good-hearted good people and we have to say hey, you know what Shut the fuck up. That's what needs to happen. Yeah, and because you guys are all Christians and you know you like to turn the other cheek And give people 17 chances listen. This is what this is creating We have to stop with this shit. We have to go back to an eye for an eye for a minute to set a standard of accountability True shit man, like I do I see these pictures man and it's just like I'm gonna tell you something else dude and this is gonna spread listen dude I'm gonna tell you something else and this is some real shit and you guys can say whatever you want about me or whatever you want I don't care but a white person can't even point out that all those people are black without being attacked as a racist You see what I'm saying? Yeah, do you think that creates more racism or do you think that squashes racist? Creates more racist We can't even point out actual facts of the matter. We do not see Big mobs of white people doing this shit. We do not see it. Probably this shit, man I saw this fucking really the other day. This is funny So I saw this really the other day and this is black dude. I think he was in like Costco or something. Yeah, right? And he's at the liquor section, okay And he's like man look at this stuff. You can't believe this and he starts he starts Pans the camera on the liquor right and the Hennessey the crown Cosmigos Patron it's all behind these like blocked Windows right like these locked little cabinets, right? And he pans over on this side is like but look at this side and it's like you know Johnny Walker makers mark, you know You know other stuff, right? He's like why is this stuff not locked? It's not common on there. I said what the fuck do you think is locked for it's fucking black people still in the shit You be like Let's call space. Hey, listen, this isn't highly embarrassing the most black people Listen, I understand that. I'm not trying to generalize. Yeah But what I am generalizing on and pointing out is that Until we can point at the actual problem at hand and where the problem exists And what part of the community is doing the problem without being called racist or bigot or having their career destroyed It's impossible to solve the problem All right, so like in no way am I generalizing that this is a black problem But it does so happen that there is a segment of the black population doing almost all of the shit that we see on TV every day And I'm also not so dumb to realize that that's intentionally propagated to make us have racism What I'm pointing out is is that we have a legitimate problem amongst the segment of society and the solution is The men who are black and who part of that society to stand up and denounce this shit and become leaders within the black community Bro, that's the only way this shit will be true. That's right. We the accountability from it cannot come from other cultures come from inside We have to like like we we as a black community. We have to say hey listen We're not with them. No, that's bullshit handle that. Yes, you know, and I think I honestly I think that's gonna start I think it's already starting to happen dude Listen, you know how many people at your wedding? I had great conversations with about the state of the world because they listen to the show You know who happen to be black and they were yes, and they were telling me like hey dude You know what you're saying is true and and I understand that and for us that they were just agreeing with everything that we're saying And until we can start pointing out the problems in society and saying okay, here's the pro like bro if you have A area of your body that's fucked up. You don't just pretend that it's not fucked up. No, it's not there Like you don't just act like you know, well, I've got this problem with my dick And I don't want to talk about it because it's embarrassing the problem just gets worse right okay? So we understand this is just my pinky toe Like no, we got an area of the country that's been completely neglected by the people that these people Continued to vote for have been intentionally oppressed have been intentionally misguided have been intentionally propagated through culture to think that all this Shit is cool shit, okay, and by the way who propagates that. Oh, that's how they would. Oh, that's that's the music industry Okay, people are owning the presence. Well, why would those people propagate that information and that culture to a group of people To create an uncivilized society if they didn't have a way to profit off of me And so dude we have to black culture has to truly the leaders within black culture have to truly step up and say dude This is unacceptable shit dude real quick on that too. I want to say like and if you listen to this and you're black Like we're not up and I know you're not talking about this, but let's just be clear the leaders we're talking about these are not Al Shartin no not open win free nice fucking Lebron These are even though they even know their names yet. We're talking about regular grassroots every day Black men and women who are embarrassed by this behavior, which I dude I had that said I had that comment said to me 30 times I'm fucking on a Saturday. No like do this shit's embarrassing. So like we all agree and we all know it's a problem So why can't we just talk about these problems so that they can correct it? It's real shit, man, and we got to man because if we don't It's only gonna do a thousand times worse man because that's the worst You had one of the major black rappers Why something why It wasn't it wasn't ye Joe no it was it was some dude who They posted that clip and he commented he tweeted underneath it We're just getting started. No bro. We're done with that energy that energy in 2020 We're fucking done with that. No. We're not just getting started And in fact if you try that shit all over the place there's gonna start to be real consequences for it Because people are tired of having their businesses fucked up. They're tired of having their communities fucked up They're tired of having their young Nises and nephews shot by random stray bullets and young men and women dying well before they were supposed to even before they even got a chance to live We as Americans not black Americans not white Americans. We're all done with it. You're not just getting started Ain't happening It's a shit man. I'm fucking tired. I'm tired of it seeing it propagated. Yeah, like this ain't cool man. None of it's cool Oh, and I saw a comment on the on the north from video You know none of that affects you. So why do you care actually it does affect everybody? What you don't understand is is that the more of that shit that happens You have insurance costs that go up when insurance costs go up Your company makes less margin and this is if you have a job you would you would understand this But your company makes less margin which means they can grow less or they can pay their people less And it creates a situation where you and everybody else has to pay more to cover these kind of things happening And there's all kinds of other Down the line issues that this shit creates that nobody ever thinks about and talks about You know one of the comments that I heard recently was I asked a guy he was arguing with me in person about what was going on in the world And I said and I said some shit about do you think like Like do you not want to pay less taxes and he looks at me and he goes Well, somebody's got to pay for it and then later in the conversation it comes out. He hasn't have a job So no shit someone has to pay for it You you get what I'm saying like bro, we have a we have this and that's a segment of society shouldn't be allowed to fucking They shouldn't be allowed to comment on anything like on social media. No, get your shit together And then you're about five steps away from reality of what actually needs to happen No, no That segment of society that doesn't contribute anything they don't belong in society Because society's only work when the fucking people contribute to it society works Okay, so when you have a job and you pay your taxes and you're an upstanding citizen Then you could have the right to vote outside of that you should have no right to vote And that doesn't matter if you're a man or woman that doesn't matter if you're Maybe that sounds dictatorship is no it doesn't it that sounds like the people who contribute Or actually do ones guiding the direction of the country I was supposed to be that is how it's supposed to be and we've gotten super founding fathers didn't think that fucking 6% of the country wouldn't be working that could work that wouldn't be working like that was never a part of the like they They were not prepared for that. I don't think so. No, you know, there's a lot of bullshit going on for sure man And major reform needs to take place and major actions need to be implemented that are gonna be hard for like a lot of people to stomach Yeah That's real shit man guys, let's get on to our third and final headline a headline number three man. This is Who's gay Just diving to it because it is picking up a lot of steam around Uh-huh, and I just want to see what you take is on this a headline reads Obama's letter to ex-girlfriend unredacted I make love to men daily, but in the imagination All right, let's be real before you get into this. Yeah I make love daily, but only in the imagination And you become the most powerful human being on the planet And we're expected to believe that you don't indulge in your own sexual fantasies That you have at your fingertips at any point in time ever Okay But bottom must have lived that live heart program and he's got discipline and check I Don't give a fuck if who's gay or who's not makes no difference to me, but bro come on. He's got all the options mentality come on You know, I'm saying yeah No, yes, so this is a daily wire headline a daily wild article reading the news comes after historian David Garrow who wrote Obama's 2017 biography rising star the making of Barack Obama By doing a recent interview with journalist david sammules talked about various aspects of the president's life both politically and personally Garrow said the letter was the most surprising thing he learned about Obama New York Post reported that the redacted portion of the 1982 letter which is owned by emery university And no one is allowed to photograph Was transcribed by Garrow's friend Harvey Claire Who sent to Garrow? quote In regard to homosexuality I must say that I believe this is an attempt to remove oneself from the present a refusal perhaps to perpetuate the endless Farce of earthly life Obama wrote in 1982 quote you see I make love to men daily, but in the imagination Obama 21 years old at the time said in the letter to Alex Near that his mind was part male and part female quote my mind is and drachanus to a great extent And I hope to make it more so until I can think in terms of people not women as opposed to men Uh, he said quote, but in returning to the body. I see that I have made I shit man It's cuz that great fun. It's fucked me up Are you sure that's what it is? Right Is always on daily why like articles broke. Yeah, we made your heart on your purpose. Yeah, fuck man Um quote all that it's all that deep sea to races. That is yeah, fuck man. How did it put DJ up with the word but bro Quote but in returning to the body I see that I've been made a man and physically in life I chose to accept that contingency Now what's more about this whole development is Barack Obama's brother Maliko bomber. He's been very very vocal on this exact same thing. Let's tell him reads Barack Obama's brother claims He's definitely gay The former US president sibling has responded to his defensive LGBTQ theme books and children libraries Barack Obama's half brother in Kenya Has reportedly responded to the former US president's effort to promote the inclusion of LGBTQ theme books and school libraries by suggesting that his half brother His half sibling is homosexual Poked this man is definitely gay What why Why are you gay? Maliko bomber purportedly said on Monday and they sensed deleted Twitter message the post which has uh, well say it say it the way you say it Why are you gay? Why are you gay? Who is gay? Who is gay? You okay The post was was reported by multiple media outlets came in response to a letter in which Barack Obama denounced the banning of controversial books and children's libraries Including at least one that features graphic illustrations of gay sexual acts now um, he also a Maliko bomber Barack Obama's brother also just came out saying yes, I'm all in and backing uh Trump in 2024 There's a lot of stuff developing here. This is his brother here We yeah dude everybody's back in Trump that Listen everybody's back in who isn't on the Democrat side Hoping that it saves the world. Yeah, that's where we're at yeah like people don't give a fuck anymore Like you throwing a million indictments on Trump is just gonna make them stronger the dudes like Thanos at this point Yeah, throw more shit at him. He's gonna get stronger stronger more money like this crazy Yeah, bro, this crazy indictment shit. They're doing now like bro They're using laws that are like literally a hundred plus years old that haven't been used in 80 years Like they're doing all like whatever. That's not the point. I don't give a fuck if he's gay. I really don't But I think he is It's true. Yeah man. I listen. I don't know man, you know What do you what do you think I'm like genuine? What's it's all I don't care either I don't know now now listen now if it comes down. I don't think him backing LG I'm just gonna be real. I don't think him backing LG BTQ books has anything to do with him being gay I think that has to do with him being a part of the communist agenda question that there yeah to demoralize society I don't think that that those two things have anything do with each other I also happen to think that yes, he's probably also gay. Yeah He I get the gay vibe off of him I mean I never been around him, but I mean he fucking appears gay vibe Obama no, no, no, like what does that mean? I don't know. I could just tell You can't tell no, I mean, but like like walk me through that process Like what's the vibe like if a dude gives you the vibe that he likes to fuck dudes. That's the gay vibe So it's just like this like six you can't tell I can tell yeah, I mean like listen like does can you not tell can you guys am I am I talking She dear I could tell like I could tell you when it do's not gay if he's gay What Bro, there's a lot of dudes that are gay that don't know their gay or they're afraid to be gay. Yeah, sure Yeah, you could I don't know. I feel like I could just tell God, yeah, they look at you different shit Uh, I'm listen You gotta say whatever you want. I'm just saying they look they look at you different. They look at you like you would look at a girl Okay, you know, then you've been looked at like that a few times More than a few I'm very popular with the gay community. Okay real talk They think I'm the big bear bro. I get a lot. I got a lot of gay fans. Yeah, yeah I don't care like I don't care. I'm just not gay. Yeah, you know, I like the old you know the way the other way Oh, dick twist. Yeah, I like that too But just all myself. Yeah, I did it man. That's fine like dude look man All right, let's let's go let's go there. Let's go there What about The old theory that you believe what's that about who he's married to oh, yeah, no, no, listen There's no doubt that that Joan Rivers Joan Rivers said that Michelle Obama was a dude and then she died like right after that in a surgery. Why has nobody ever been sued for defamation or slander or you know I mean, can you you can sue for that right? I don't I think you can sue for whatever you want like if I say the truth They'd have to sue the whole world because that's how many people are talking about this true Yeah, I don't know man. I just I just know this like I've seen the bulge You don't know how do you know that's not Photoshop? I don't know man because I mean I don't believe anything on the internet dude like these these truth or pages and like all this shit like I saw pictures of the Hawaii thing with like a beam of light coming down and people saying oh this is direct energy We caught it on camera That's no, it's not because it was direct energy. It would probably be microwave being visible anyway Like you're not gonna see the shit okay like there's so many there's this is the whole point we're talking It's the overflowing not knowing what is true and that's intentional because if we're always arguing over what's true and what's not We can't unite. No, you know, but like you know, there's some pictures of Michelle Obama when she was younger Where she it looks like to the same man to gay men they look stronger shit look Ha ha ha ha she does look like she could do some deadless. I'm just saying she gonna keep up on show today. That's how I'm saying Yeah, like I mean, I think we could hit a back workout, dude, you know, like she could keep up I'm but maybe maybe that's the argument for for women and men sports. I don't know, but like all I'm saying is It's possible. Yeah, it's 2023. What do you think like really? What do you think I think she's a dude really? I think the chick has a big really I do I do like listen. That's your speculation. That's just allegedly man like, you know, I don't I don't know man Listen, I'm back and forth. I'm back and forth. I can't tell like so like I Prove it. I can't tell and he does feel like a gay dude to me. He does man. So like I wouldn't here's what I'll say I wouldn't be surprised to find out that that was actually true. Yeah, and that's no disrespect anyway By the way, nor do I care. No, it doesn't matter, but we're just talking about what is the truth Yeah, these are like if it came out if it came out that Michelle Obama was actually Michael Obama like a lot of people say wouldn't that push the trans narrative? Yeah, I would But I don't I wouldn't fucking care like I don't care like as long as you're not fucking with kids I don't care. You know what I'm saying like live how you want to live dude This is America and this is where the conservatives get mad at me. Oh Concert America's a Christian nation. No, it isn't. It's a secular nation. It was founded for freedom of religion That's the point not just one that's correct And so like dude like some of these people on the right are no less crazy than these people on the left And I understand why moderate people cannot stand the right like I get it like I get why Joe Rogan Sort of is always sat on the left of center side because dude when I look at these people I think they're fucking insane too But here's the reality we've drifted so far left that we have to have a correction back towards that culture or dude We're gonna our our society's going to crumble lose it all. Yeah, we'll lose it all man That's real shit man guys. That was a third of final headline if you want to jump in on this conversation hop down to the comment hashtag secretly serviced Let us know you like that. Like that has secretly service to get it.

This is what should be happening everywhere and the fact that we have Parents who can't afford to pay for their schools lunches to the point where they were creating a basically a debt Program for lunches that they have to pay in a public school when we pay the amount of tax that we do they goes Fucking bullshit. Oh, man. This is bullshit. Okay. I want you guys. I'm talking to you guys in this room To find out what the fucking balances are for all the public school districts here in this fucking city We're gonna do something about this. This is fucking bullshit. There's no there's no reason That any parent should feel a financial burden when there are already being taxed to pay for this shit at the school in the first place See, this is what I'm talking about restructuring how things work We have a collection of criminals in wash and DC just like mr. Oliver's be pointing out in the beginning of the show Who do not give a shit about you Your kids their future our future as a country our future as citizens They do not care and in fact They do not care so much that they make intentional decisions that harm our communities They they fuck with people non-stop every decision that you think they make is actually the opposite of what they're actually making They you think they're up there making decisions to benefit and make our life better They are up there making decisions to Suppress the lowest class which by the way that's the middle class and the lower class Okay, they just call you the middle class because they don't want you to revolt You're not the middle class you're in poverty because you can barely pay your bills In this country with the amount of fruits and the amount of opportunity and the amount of success available For everybody there should be nobody that is taxed to the point of 50 plus percent and these people who are in poverty or who are quote-unquote middle class They think because they're not in the highest tax bracket that they're somehow getting some sort of tax break You pay tax to buy things you pay tax to own things you pay property tax you pay tax to fucking Bygassling you pay tax on every single thing that you do throughout the day And when you add all of that tax up You actually spend more time working to pay those taxes than you do working to pay for your own shit And we're paying those taxes and they're now putting debt on the parents who are struggling to even survive While they're paying those taxes and dude, this is fucking absurd This is absurd shit and with small corrections in our system all right By people who think outside the rails which is someone like me. There's other people too. Yeah About creative solutions this all could be fixed so easily and every single human being Republican and Democrat could have so much more money in their pockets They can't fathom it like broke if you only paid 10% tax on your paycheck right now How much different would your life look it would look a lot different And we look a lot fucking different that's real shit that could be done If we didn't have criminals that we've elected stealing the money for their own causes and their own benefits and their own riches Like that's what we're dealing with here dude and this people have to wake up I mean this kid is a fucking hero. This is real life American hero shit He's looking out for his fellow citizens. He's looking out for his fellow people in the community because he once had that same situation This is what America's about Okay, America is not about a bunch of old crusty politicians who don't give two shits about me or you or anybody else Ruining us financially because they know if they ruin us financially. We can't revolt if people truly understood The amount of fuckery that is happening in our financial system if they truly understood now keep in mind Most people don't understand simple interests Most people don't understand how to balance their own checkbook Most people don't understand how to do their own counting And why don't they understand that? It was intentional. It was intentionally not taught to them instead they teach him 1700 geo political Social movements in school instead of teach him basic shit like how to survive manage your money 2000 different gender okay, right exactly. Yeah They do this on purpose because an indebted society is a society that cannot Revolt because they're starving. They're too worried about getting meals on their fucking plate To worry about what the government is doing and they let us have just enough Just enough money to survive and have a little bit of good Once a while, you know that little treat that you get once a while like you could go the ice cream store Maybe you get to go on a little vacation somewhere That's their little nugget. They're throwing you and they're throwing you these nuggets Because if you truly understood What this was all about and how we were actually fuck that citizens of this country There would have been a revolt 20 years ago Kudos to this young dude and I want you guys to find out what the deal is on this Because it doesn't seem like a whole lot of money would fix this whole problem for a lot of people at least in the interim Yeah, it's the fact that these people have debt on their fucking school lunches and buriates me dude Sam it's unnecessary and it's intentional and then we have and then we have a young man who's 14 Solve in the problem when these other people who are worth hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in Washington DC just continue to take from us doing shit about it It's fucking bullshit comes up to this guy man.
