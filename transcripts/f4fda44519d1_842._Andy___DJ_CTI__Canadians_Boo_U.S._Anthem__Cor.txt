Oh, not much. What? You're definitely like unxtatus. No. No, that's a good thing. Unxtatus is a good thing. No, no. What's your status? Big bro. Big bro. Yeah. I wasn't saying to me. I was saying like in general, like unxtatus and general too. Yeah. Unxt sounds old. Now, everybody got that one like cool ass uncle. You know, yeah, yeah, you know, whatever man. What's going on in the world? We got some shit going on. Do we got some stuff with you? Got nothing much, man. You know, just, you know, doing the thing. nephew. Alright, we got I got something new for you guys. Got a brand new segment. Yeah, got a brand new segment sponsored by peasant water. Okay, Pazante. Pazante right here got the best shit brand new segment coming to you guys right now. The segment's called inspired by Kamala. Oh, man. Alright, well, I brought up the thing about uncle because Kamala was described as a drunk auntie this past weekend. Come a Harris mocked as drunk auntie for non-sensical word solid speech to cast of a wonderful world, the Louis Armstrong musical inspired by Kamala to check us out for those rights to be maintained, which means we have to be vigilant and it's just the nature of it. I mean, it's beautiful play and everything that we know, he was surprising, he had to surprise so much. But we know, you know, we took those risks, but we have to clear our right. And it doesn't mean we don't see the beauty and everything. These things all coexist. But I believe we fight for something not against. And that's our optimism. Oh, man, I'm so inspired me too. Fighting for the rights, what rights are you fighting for that you do not have? I would like to hear those were fighting for the wrongs of the rights and indeed. I'd also like to hear what it was that you did or drink before you started speaking, because I potentially made want some. What do you think is like her go to because I listen, I think everybody thinks that she's drinking like some high shelf top dollar stuff. She's given some she's from the streets bro. Yeah. She's drinking street shit. MD 2012. That's exactly what I was thinking. Mad dog. Mad dog. She got the mag dog. Yeah. So it's cocaine too. That's a cocaine person you could tell from looking at her that she's on coke right now. It's a jaw. Yeah. And on top of this, you really couldn't understand a word she fucking said, like at all. And I love how they continue to say these things like we're fighting for our rights. What rights? The right for you and all your friends to steal all our money and funnel it to yourself. Is that the rights that you're fighting for? Because those are the only rights that you seem to be upset about that anybody, you know, you lose it. Yeah. Like you let all these people in on the border intentionally, you screwed up our economics intentionally, you propagated us intentionally with our own money. Okay. There's nothing that you have done or want to do that isn't the interest of us at all. And it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. Or if you voted for her or didn't vote for her, these people, her group, they, they exist for themselves. And if that's not a parent at this point in time, you need to go down to the fucking bicycle store and get the best helmet that they have. And you need to wear that 24 hours a day because you are that fucking stupid. Okay, real talk. How can anyone buy this any more, bro? Who's buying this? The only way people could buy this is if they just hate Trump, right? It's, it's the same thing we talked about last week, bro. You're either making money, you're getting paid, you're on, you're on the titty. Yeah. Or you're not. And this is a battle between people who feel that it is their right to steal our money and oppress our citizens and create financial hardship and division for our country in order for them to benefit. And everybody else. And I hate to say it Camila, but everybody else has figured it out for the most part. And you guys ain't coming back. We're not going to let you. It's not going to happen, dude. You know, there's, there's talks about her going for governor. Yeah, bro, I mean, you know, if they're able to cheat the election like they have in California, what I believe for the last 20 years, you know, should probably get it. But I think Californians are waking up to what's been going on. I mean, isn't it a fair assumption to assume that states like New York and states like California and states like Washington and Oregon who haven't had Republicans in their office for years and years and years. And they happen to be the most progressive and most communist style states of government. Isn't it fair to assume that the fraud and the cheating when it comes to election is further progressed in those states than it is in other states? I mean, that's, that's how I see it. I don't know how y'all see it. But and they're also the same places that like nothing has like nothing's better. Bro, nothing, listen, the streets, the schools, the fucking, I will say this, my friends in California are a little slow in terms of adapting to what reality in common sense has been. And not because they're slow because they're stupid, but they have a different world view, you know, a lot of these people are worried about other things. More than they are that and they have this, this idea, ideological view of the world, which is like, yeah, look, man, I don't care what anybody else does, you know, and bro, that's how I feel too. I don't care what anybody else does. But when they start stealing our shit and they start making our neighborhoods look like shit and are are your guys of streets got syringes and shit and piss and litter everywhere. Eventually, even those people who are like dude, I don't care. Now they're looking around being like, this is bullshit, right? And so I don't even hear from people in California, New York, they're even with this anymore. I don't, I don't think they're with it. And so, you know, this and it's what's interesting, you mean the ones that didn't leave yet? And they're still there. Because most, most people that listen, most of the people who, okay, I'll put it to you this way. In 2017, these people were telling me that I was a fucking red neck, Hick dumbass for being behind Trump. Okay. Now, these same people are saying, fuck dude, I don't know, I don't know how I feel for that. I'm glad common sense is coming back. I actually like this dude. I'm tired of this shit. Okay, that's people I know personally. And if that's the tide that is changing, you know, politics has to adjust. And we're not seeing these political figures adjust their tactics at all, they still think they're going to beat this race drum and they're going to beat this socio economic inequality drum. The reason they're socio economic inequality is because these people have created it intentionally. All right, over the course of the last 50, 60 years, especially with the black communities. Okay, so let's be real. They create the problem, just like we've said a million times, they come in and promise the solution, they get funding for the solution, and then they steal the money and they make your problem worse intentionally. So they can come back in and say, Hey, both for me, the white guy fucked it up for us, the Republicans fucked it up for us. They hate you. I'm fighting for you. And then they go back and they get the funding and they put it in their own pocket. And they say, fuck you to the people that they promised these solutions to. So it's the same problems they've been trying to solve for those. So they're they're bro, their tactics aren't working anymore. You know, and you know, now they're saying, oh, he lives a threat to democracy. And these people are fascists. Well, dude, I don't know if you understand what fascism really means, but shrinking the size of the government and calling for transparency and removal of financial waste and theft and embezzlement from its citizens. That is the opposite of fascism. It's a sleet opposite. Yes. So dude, we just have a bunch of mindless fucks who, you know, don't know any different. They repeat talking points. They probably don't pay into the kitty at all. They don't pay tax. So, you know, of course, they want these people to win. Because it promises them free stuff that they never actually get. And the funny thing is is these people who vote and cry and are in feel entitled to the free shit. These people's lives get exponentially worse under these situations because the people who actually do take care of the communities which is typically capitalist, small to medium to large business owners who are in your city taking care of special causes, doing all these things, giving their own money. These people don't have the money to give under their people. Under the rule, it's a full. Yeah. So it makes them. Bro, it just look, man, here's the deal. You want to fix this shit forever? People who pay tax get to vote, people who don't pay tax don't get to vote. How is that unreasonable? How is it unreasonable to say, if you pay in, then you get a vote to say what what direction we get to go? If you don't pay in tough shit, pay start paying in. Yeah, it's like it's like bro, it would be like if you and me were roommates, all of us were roommates, the set the six of us in here. Okay, we're roommates. And we take two dudes off the street, okay, because we're nice guys, there are two buddies, but they don't have a job and they don't pay rent, but we look out for them because there are buddies. And then those people come in and start throwing a fit about what we do with the house, they don't like the furniture we have, they want they want new furniture and they demand new furniture, even though they're not going to pay for it, right? They want to stay up all night and do drugs while we all got to sleep and get ready for the next day, but they demand that they're like, we're taking orders and listening to people who do not contribute at all to anything in this country. So why do we allow those people to vote? I don't care if you're 15, I don't care if you're a hundred years old. If you have a job and you pay taxes, you can vote. If you are retired and you pay taxes, let's say at minimum, you know, let's say for the older people that, you know, what about the old people that pay tax or hold out? Okay, well, if you paid tax for 30 years, then you get to vote. So I can even push it back on that one though, because I'm not thinking is like, I mean, listen, I love my old people, they're cool, but like, let's be real, the decisions that you're voting on will not affect you. You won't be here much longer. Well, there's a discussion to be had. Okay, but my point is, just saying is look, I don't, I'm not going to say you're wrong. I just think that if someone has worked their whole lives and contributed their entire lives into the system, then there has to be some sort of, you know, reward for that. I have a council of the old people. But these people who who don't pay in at all, regardless, on the low side of, you know, under 50 years old, they should have no fucking say at all. I'm with it, bro. Yeah, I'm with it, man, inspired by Kamala guys. I just don't know what you guys think down in the Chattarrerie. Chattarrerie. Bro, think of this like, think of that being the best you had. Kamala? Yeah, best you have. What's that say about your ideologies? If that's the best representation of what they are, the best you got, man, man, that'd be sad. But what do let's get into some cruising? All right, let's start some cruising guys. If you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You guys can find them all link there. And so with that being said, let's get into our first, you hit mine. That's headline number one. This was a big, big deal. We actually alluded to this on yesterday's Q and A. Oh, yeah, yeah. Watch Canadians, Boo, US Anthem, then Team USA wins the game and the fights. Bro, this was great. It really was great. That was great. Let's dive into this a little bit. Have you ever watched a fight and had a hockey game break out? Well, if you watch Team USA's three to one defeat of Canada last night of the four nations face off, you just saw that. The highly anticipated game between North American neighbors and hockey rivals began with three fights in the first nine seconds of regulation time. But first, before a single glove was dropped, the Canadian crowd at the Bell Center in Montreal did what they have done multiple times at NHL games in recent weeks. They booed the star Spangled Banner. Let's check this out. Love came off, baby. What's that better? There's like three up. What a touch. What a minute. Now, those phrases. And break the way speed cycle into the zone. Flip the crew. Three on answer. As Team USA has answered, there goes Larkin into two at one, Larkin, Sturridge, Dylan Larkin and Team USA. The daddy is slurping with the open net. The past against all scores. Just let it off. Hey, winners win, man. We're back. We win in them all fronts. Yeah, they're, you know, we might have to play them again, though. I think at the chemistry. I think if they win tonight, there's some circumstances where we could have a rematch again. I actually hope we do. And I hope we win so that all this shit talking doesn't have to eat it. Put the state on the line. Fiddley first state on the line. If we win this, if we win that championship, and we have to play them, yeah, we get Canada. Listen, free and clear. All I'm saying is why wouldn't they want to be a part of this anyway? Like the only reason the Canada isn't already China is because they're next to us. You know what I'm saying? It's like bro. That's a bad real. Yeah, I mean, even the White House, you know, obviously, brother, there's some. It's nice that like the social media accounts for the White House. They're lit. Yeah, they're lit. They're all on it. They posted this with the highlight real saying, won't you fly high free bird? Yeah, American flag emoji, Eagle emoji, four nations. They've been rolling, man. It's been, it's due to feels good. It does feel good. It feels good. Look, these these kind of things can unite Americans. You know what I mean? This is this is the kind of shit. And you know, if someone booze the anthem, they should get their ass beat. Just like if someone burns the flag or stomps on the flag or does any of this shit that's been happening for the last hit since Obama got elected the first time. Any of the shit that's been allowed needs to stop being allowed. Like bro, you see people burning the flag. You should beat the fucking face in. That's the reality of it, dude. And you know, people say, well, you know, that's freedom of speech. Okay, well, I'm expressing my freedom of speech and I disapprove. I'm with it, man. I'm with it. But on the same train, we went from beaten Canada. It's all been Canada and Vin Hockey. I get that there's sport. I mean, probably. Yeah. I mean, I mean, clearly, you know, they're not that good at it. Yeah. Bro, all my Canadian buddies are gonna be like, fuck you, man. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, it's fine. You know, listen, I love maple syrup. It's fine. It's all right. You know, some good stuff. But from the icy hot ice rink to the beautiful paved track at Daytona, Trump took their next Trump's adorable granddaughter Carolina catches a ride with grandpa and presidential limo at Daytona 500. That was pretty fucking sick. The current wild there as well. They took a lap in the beast checked itself. I mean, all the songs that's, you know, movie that's song. Song. No top gun. No. Days of thunder. Days of thunder. Huh. Would you still have a seat? I haven't seen that. No, no. Well, you haven't invited me over for a movie party. Days of thunder is a requirement to like be a man. You can even be a grown man if you haven't seen days of thunder. Let's pull the room. Say it. Have you seen it? Okay, Joe. All right. I know Joe has seen it because he's over 40. Madat. Oh, you guys are a bunch of fucking pussy bitches. See, this is Joe. This is our fucking problem over here, dude. You know what I'm saying? This is our problem. Joe, have you seen it? You seen it? Yeah. Joe, you've seen it, Joe? Okay, you've seen it. Everybody who's a man has seen it. Okay. Yeah. All right. You guys are a bunch of little boys with no hair on your balls. Alex likes it that way. Yeah. I'll be honest. Yeah, but you never had it. I tried to save it there. Sorry, baby. But yeah, let's get down to some real business because a lot of other stuff has been coming out. Daytona was fucking awesome. That's cool. I'm not fucking you not seeing days of thunder. Like how? How? How over the night? Well, watch it tonight. How? I'm gonna watch nothing. Any of you. Any of you listening, well, come over. If you haven't seen days of thunder, you're a fucking bitch. And you need to fix that. Is it like a, that should be like in the, like that should be taught in school. Right? Like it'd be better than what they're teaching them now. That's what I'm saying. I mean, be badass race car driver. Cut off your own dick. Oh, is that what it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, wait, it's a, it's about NASCAR. It's one of the coolest fucking movies. Okay, well, you're telling, you're telling a black dude that like, he's not a man if he hasn't seen a NASCAR movie. Like, come on, that, Andy, that's a little low. That's a low low. I mean, that's a reach for me. Why? That NASCAR racist? No, I mean, but like listen, they got bubble wall. Listen, nobody fucking likes him. Like we're not in that. Like, yeah, right? Like I'm. Whoa. Y'all don't have dads teach you how to race cars. We can still. We can still. All right. We need to tell ourselves that, right? Throw apparently you fuckers like NASCAR because bro, y'all like the fucking track hawks and, you know, like, the fucking hell cats. Like that's pretty close to a NASCAR. The Scab Packs. Yeah, I think we're missing the target market here. I think we need to make black days at the under. You know what I'm saying? For real, dude, we can feel my hearing saying, but it could be like a, it could be like a fucking combination of fast and the furious and NASCAR. Oh, it'd be like hell cat on the street. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I'm what do we call it? Stolen. Stolen. Instead of got it 60 seconds. Instead of got it 60 seconds. It was, was never here. Oh, man. All right. If you're still watching, yeah, hey, looks at Liz, is it dude? Dude, dude. All right. Dude, black people have a preference for hell cats. Yes. Yeah, actually the day the Dodge Charger was announced, that's actually, it's in, it's like in the black history book of like teachings. It was in a very important day for the black people. The day the Dodge Charger was invented. You know, they just announced that they're going back to the gas chargers. So like they have one or two years of the stupid ass electric shit nobody wanted. And they're going back to the V8s and all the big shit. That's good. Yeah. It's good. Yeah. Another important day in historic. It is black history month. It is. Yeah. It is. Yeah. Let's get to some business. Like NASCAR, bro. NASCAR, not so car. That's what we call college. All right, man, let's get to some business, man. We got to talk about what's happening out here. Elon Musk's Doge team uncovers $21 million in taxpayer money if funded grant allocated to voter turnout in India. With India's ruling party responding, India enters the chat again, Megas. What's up, Megas? Let's dive into this a little bit. So the Doge, the Department of government of fish, you see that spearhead about entrepreneur and billionaire Elon Musk has actually axed. Okay. Here we go. Has axed. Yeah. Has axed a controversial. See the gateway pun that's looking out for me. Now, a controversial $20 million, $21 million taxpayer funded grant. What did they ask them? No, they axed it. Wait, did they actually ask? Has asked a controversial. Has axed a controversial $21. What they asked the controversial. They cut it out. They cut it out. Got it. They cut it out. I was just confused. Yeah. It's the year it's the same thing. I thought they were asking the question to the grant itself. You know, that's what I thought. But I know they, uh, it was a grant that we paid for that was, that went to India, quote unquote, um, for voter turnout in India. Um, allocation was merely a fragment of a staggering $486 million budget under the consortium for elections and political process strengthening initiative, which was approved during the Biden regime. So half a million dollars. That's it. And that's it. Half a billion. Half a billion dollars went to this initiative. Um, and, and yeah, Trump call it out. Now, now why would we be funding the outcomes of elections in any other country when anytime we would mention, you know, strengthening the election process here. No, I want to hear it. Voter turnout here. Yeah. It was racist. It was racist to do that here in this country. Oh, yeah. That's a strength in our election system. Right. I mean, that was just a small list like I mean, those have been putting out this a bunch of 10 million dollars, uh, for most of them, big voluntary medical male circumcision. Okay. 9.7 million dollars for UC Berkeley to develop a cohort of Cambodian youth with enterprise driven skills, whatever the fuck that means. We got 40 million dollars for gender equality and women empowerment hub. 14 million for improving public procurement and Serbia. A lot of stuff there. A lot of stuff there. Now, like I said, India enters the chat. This is a meat. How much do you think of any of that stuff? Okay. Let's just, you know, 29 million of strengthening political landscape in Bangladesh. 20 million for fiscal federalism in Nepal. Another 20 million for biodiversity conversation in Nepal. How many of you actually believe that any of these things exist at all? These are just labels that these people came up with to fund, quote unquote, causes that don't even exist so they could steal the money. And that list is, this is 15, 20 items. This list is thousands of items long. Oh, yeah. Okay. When it all is said and done and you look at the NGOs, right, that are, you know, pushing these things and overseeing that process and you look at who owns those NGOs. You know, I'm saying like, just trace it, but it's a very simple thing. It's not even like a very complex system here. It's not. It's very simple. But India is, none of this shit is public. That's the problem. One of these, these all get buried in a 4,000 page bill that they expect people to read in 12 hours. And then they call it like, you know, infresurability consortium for elections and political process strengthening. Well, you know, whatever they call it, it's likely the opposite anyway. Right. You know, no shit. But fuck, dude. Treeson. It's crazy, man. But interest in chat is is India. We got a meat, Malaviyaya. That's all right. Oh, not that bad. Okay. Now he is in charge of meat and charge of BJP's national information and technology department. So that's, that's India's correct. And if I'm wrong, that's like their leading party right now. And they're pretty conservative. Okay. Am I right? Okay. I did my research here. This computer is hard to learn. But interest the chat to meat. He says, he responds to it. He says, you know, pouring back to that $486 million to this consortium for elections and political process strengthening, including the 22 million for inclusive and participatory political process in Moldova and 21 million for voter turnout in India. He says 21 million for voter turnout question. This definitely is external interference in India's electoral process. Who gains from this? Not the ruling party for sure. Now again, BJP, that's like their leading party. It's the Bariatia Yadnita party, BJP. I'm sure I destroyed that. Sorry. Sorry. But, you know, and he also went on. Now this is where it gets real spicy Andy. He went on and he started naming some names. I'm going to follow up tweet. A meat says, once again, it is George Soros, a known associate of the Congress party and the Gandys, whose shadow looms over our electoral process in 2012 under the leadership of S.Y. Quirriachi, the election commission signed a MOU with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, an organization linked to George Soros' Open Society Foundation, which is primarily funded by USAID. Ironically, those questioning the transparent and inclusive process of appointing India's election commissioner first in our democracy, which previously the Prime Minister alone made the decision, had no hesitation in handing over the entire election commission of India to foreign operators. It is becoming increasingly evident that the Congress-led UPA systematically enabled the infiltration of India's institutions by forces opposed to the nation's interests, those who seek to weaken India at every opportunity. Now, Andy, to your point, we talked about this. It's not just the United States that they're trying to weaken and trying to demoralize and bring down. They have to equal everybody. And every time we trace it back, it's the same exact people. Yeah, look, it's very clear that there are certain parties inside of our government that have decided that it is okay to steal our tax dollars, not disclose where they go, send them to NGOs and topple and destroy other cultures around the world for the sake of globalism. Okay, that's what this is. That's why the mass migration is funded. And it's communist shit. They call it globalism, but it's communist shit. And they're looking to take every country that is not aligned with their values and what they're trying to do. TAPLE that regime and bring in a new regime that aligns with globalism 100%. That's what they've been doing for the last 20 years. Okay, and you and I and all of our friends and the people you know that just lost their house or got evicted, we all paid for the shit. Okay, so think about that. Yeah. Well, it gets better. Or worse, every one of the... Dude, I should piss people off beyond measure. The amount of fury and anger that people should feel for what's been happening in this country pretty much their entire adult lives in regards to their hard work being the foundation of all of this nefarious shit, you know, and then our tax dollars being stolen and then used to propagate us with social engineering like this is insane shit. This is insane shit. Well, we're struggling to put groceries in our carts and gas in our cars. Yeah, let's quote unquote since I need to mose and beat for fucking circumcision. Makes sense. Makes perfect sense, man. And if it couldn't get any worse, there's more from Doge. Elon Musk's Doge team uncovers over 25 million people ages 100 plus in Social Security Database. Some older than the Constitution. So this was a drawder-opping thing that came out. Elon Musk tweeted this out. He says, according to the Social Security Database, these are the numbers of people in each age bracket with the death field set to false, meaning these are all the people that are in the database that are supposed to be alive right now that are receiving more eligible to receive Social Security benefits. Maybe twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires like Social Security. Okay, you got the data. So what they're saying here is these are people who are deceased in those age range, getting deceased or duplicate numbers. Correct. Getting paid out Social Security. So how does this person who's zero to nine get paid out of Social Security? How's that work? I mean, I couldn't tell you. So I don't know who the fuck this is. Who the fuck is 369 years old? Yeah. There's a better question. There's a better question. The Social Security Administration, there's thousands of employees that work there. They see these data every single day. How is it possible that you don't, you know, you look at these numbers, you look at spreadsheets all the fuck all the time. How do you not see something like 360 and you see a one in that category? Well, I, yeah, I'm not saying, huh, that's interesting. Yeah. Well, in every organization, there's certain data that is kept from other areas of the organization for reasons of, you know, lots of reasons. So I'm assuming that what has probably happened here is that, you know, the data has been spread around so much. And I'm sure that all of this money, what you're going to find is the money that comes from this sheet here. First of all, there's going to be way more of it that this is, this is probably just the beginning of what they found. But I think what you're going to find is, you know, all of these people and all of this money, while this may be the true data that they know right now, on the books of Social Security, they have this like labeled as other things that don't raise alarms. You know what I mean? Like there's all kinds of ways that people steal money inside an organization, you know, and duplicate vendors is an easy way, right? That's what a lot of people that get arrested for fraud or embezzlement from a company, the way they do it is, you know, you have Steve Smith, who is a, you know, like Steve signs, right? Steve's signs and you pay them a million bucks a year, right? But then in a big organization that may not notice a million dollars missing, they have a million dollars going to Steve sign. Okay. So there's one letter difference. Right. It's your, you're fucking whoever's doing it, went up and set a bank account and they've embezzled them, you know what I mean? Yeah, bro. So like there's all these different ways and I'm sure the government had, first of all, there's zero accountability even if they get caught. So what difference does it make? But I'm sure the people that have been doing this have their ways of hiding it. And I would bet that when it's all said and done, we're going to find out that this $40 trillion or whatever it is, the United States owes is almost all due to these people embezzlement selling the money over years and years and years. And that needs to be wiped off of our plate. That's not our responsibility. It is. No, it's not. Right. And our tax system, we need to never pay tax ever again. The people who have been paying tax since, you know, this has been going on, which is pretty much everybody. And we need to get a fucking refund for what it is that we pay because dude, it was just straight up stolen and nobody said anything. Nobody did anything. Nobody, you know, knew about it to your point. That's bullshit. People did know somebody had to know. Yeah, but they were too cowardly to come say anything because they were afraid to get killed on it. No. So, you know, there's a lot here, dude. Well, here's the other big anomaly, the two that came up with this that was also pointed out. You know, Elon's been, you know, you talk about transparency, right? Like this is Doge and I found this out. Doge is not like this new thing that President Trump did. He's actually using the President that Obama set up back in 2008 that is giving them the same exact rights and powers and oversight that the Obama panel had. Okay. It's the same exact thing. He just renamed it called it Doge. Yeah. But you talk about transparency, right? Which is something that I've always, we've always been big advocates of like we need to see this shit. Like I don't care if it makes me mad, happy pissed off, show the truth, right? And that's what Elon's been doing. And you know, a lot of this has been done on Twitter. Very publicly, there's websites now that Doge has actually creating accounts for every single department and agency that they're going into and auditing. They're creating an actual thread just for like an account, just for that department. And with that allows the scrutiny of the public, right? And now the public are able to see these numbers and ask questions and kind of engage with them back and forth. And one of the anomalies that came up with this is that when you add up all of these numbers, these like we are on this list, right? And we're included in these numbers. Everybody in this room, listening to the shows, including in this numbers. And when you add all these up, that totals, 394 million people, 394 million people. What's the population of America though? They tell us it's 334 million. So what's the discrepancy here? Well, Elon Musk responded. He says, yes, there are far more quote unquote, eligible social security numbers than there are citizens in the United States. This might be the biggest fraud in history. Yeah, 100% it is. It's it dude, they barely dug into it. They barely have dug into it. They've been in there for a couple of days. Yeah, I mean, it's just getting going. Just getting going. Now, Elon's been getting attacked. Trump's been getting attacked over this, you know, doge stuff and everybody's into it and like, you know, because now he's going into the IRS and, you know, they're starting to go through that. And what we're going to find in there, right? It's like, returning over all these fucking stones, you got cockroaches running that rear, but we need to see it, right? And he's getting all of this attack. And now with the IRS stuff, you know, because he's going to have access to databases and, you know, his names and bank accounts. And I mean, the real, where's the money going? It's going to be shown through the IRS audit. And they've been talking about it. So he's had to clap back. And this was one of his latest tweets he put out quote, bra. If I wanted to rummage through random personal shit, I could have done that at PayPal. Hello, having tens of millions of people marked in social security as alive when they are definitely dead is a huge problem. Obviously, some of these people would have been alive before America existed as a country. Think about that for a second. And he's right. I mean, shit, PayPal has a lot of fucking users. I mean, a lot. I'm sure it's close to a billion that's not over. If he really wanted to do some do be a shitty could have been did that, right? Of course, like, it's a terrible fucking argument. But again, they don't want to be caught. And why don't they want to be caught and exposed? Well, it's stuff like this. This judge, Jack McConnell, who tried to halt the president's temporary spending freeze. Yeah, well, guess what? He received over $100 million in government funding for his NGO that he's been the board in chair of for a very, very long time. And this was exposed by America first legal. Yeah, the federal judge McConnell must recuse himself immediately. AFL has uncovered a major potential conflict of interest for judge John McConnell, chief judge of the federal district court of Rhode Island, who halted President Trump's temporary spending freeze. He sits on an NGO as the board of director. And that organization has raked in literally over $100 million from USAID. And that's what he was trying to stop. But again, I wonder how much that NGO pays him in salary. Well, that's what the IRS is important to find out and see what's going on there. They won't look at people like that. They look at people who sent their fucking grandma $750 instead of $600 on their fucking PayPal. It's crazy. Now, bro, think of like, think of people. I heard, God, dude, it's so frustrating. People are trying to survive. They are struggling to get food. Okay, there are single miles with two or three kids that can't pay their fucking shit. And these people are fleecing us for billions and probably trillions of dollars. And saying, fuck, and figure it out. We're the land of opportunity. Opportunity. And by the way, whatever opportunity you go out and see is we're going to take half of that because we deserve it. Bro, fuck all these people. Yeah. We need a true, a true revival of what America is supposed to be. This ain't it. We're fucking slaves. And people that argue that don't get it because they probably don't work or pay tax. You know, you got you can't send people a thousand bucks. You know, like, and then they'll come back and say, well, where did this come from? Well, you got it. You always that part of it. Guess what? We're going to fucking put a lean on your shit. Yep. Straight to jail. Dude, that is insane. That is insane. The amount of bullying and terrorizing the American government has done to the tax paying citizens. The people who fund this country is insane. It's literal emotional terrorism. Bro, I know multiple people who have killed themselves in business. Because they made a mistake or they miscalculated and they ended up owing the IRS millions of dollars they didn't have to pay and they fucking blew their brains out. And these people don't have any accountability for stealing trillions of dollars from the American people while everybody else out here is struggling to put gas in their fucking car. It's insane, dude. I mean, not to be morbid here, but like, you know, yeah, when like, you know, guess what, when that, when your buddy dies, they're going to tax him for dying. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, they're going to get 60%. Bro, it's crazy, man. It's fucking crazy. Dude, people don't understand this. Okay. So you work your whole life. You get taxed at a minimum, 50% all in. All right. You're in cup tax plus all the other tax property tax, tax to buy shit tax, to sell shit, gas tax, everything. At least 50% for most Americans that work and pay taxes for people that make more money, it's actually a lot more than that. All right. That's reality. That's what it is. Now, you work your whole life and how hard is it? All of us know to accumulate cash in this system because of how much we have to give them. All right. Now, at the end of your life, after 60 fucking years of working your balls off, okay. You've accumulated some shit. You have a house that maybe you paid off. Maybe you have some property and you have some things that you would like to leave to your family. Now, let's say it's worth a million bucks. Let's say it's worth $10 million. You've accumulated $10 million worth of net worth, which is because of the oppressive system, that's impossible. It's almost impossible for people and it should be very possible. It should be very, very possible. It would be if they weren't having to pay all that money to them. But let's just say for arguments, let's say it's a million bucks, okay. You got to a million dollars and you have two kids and you're thinking, all right, I got a million bucks and I can leave the two kids each $500,000 worth of stuff. I did pretty good. That's a good start for them. That's not accurate because the government comes in and takes $600,000 of that million dollars and now you have $200,000 each for the children that is left. When you worked your whole life for that, okay. So whatever you accumulate under the oppressive system, at the end of your life, they end up taking 60% anyway. That's insane, dude. We are not free. That is not freedom. It is not freedom to own your house and still have to pay property tax to keep it. That's not free. Okay, it's not free to work most of your time for the fucking government. That's not free. That's called slavery. It just looks a little different than what you think of slavery when you think of it, which is probably why they propagate the slavery so hard because they don't want us to realize that nothing has fucking changed. That's real, man. And they just, some of us know more. It's all of us. Dude, real shit, real shit, man. Real shit. Anybody who is saying, like, dude, what must and Trump are doing is the greatest fucking thing that's ever happened in this country since it was founded fucking 250 years ago. And anybody that argues against it does not understand what's actually happening. Okay, you can hate Trump all you want. You can hate Elon all you want. But at the end of the day, the result of this should be if they follow through, which is yet to be determined because we're still paying taxes. Okay. We're still, all of the shit is still happening. So I'm not counting on any of it going away. But if it does, it's going to benefit everybody. See, my thing is, Super, I feel like there's enough, because I mean, I understand that there's a process of this, right? And it is moving fast, but there's a process. You got to uncover the bullshit, now what do we do about it? But I think that there is enough. I mean, Trump's been in literally less than a month, almost a month. Yeah. I think there's enough proof here that if I were president, hey, you know what? There's a lot of bullshit going here. We're going to take a temporary pause on all taxes until we figure out where the fuck the shit's going because obviously it's not going to where it's supposed to be going. Well, you want to see people really freak out these people who steal it. You do that. You cut that shit off. Oh, fuck. It's that you everybody will tell on themselves instantly. Cut it off. Cut it off. People that people that that have been doing the right thing will be happy and people that haven't been will be pissed. But imagine what that would do instantly for the American American citizen. Yeah. I mean, what if you had at a minimum 30 to 40 percent more money right now? I know. That's what I'm like, I'm with. I'm with, you know, obviously, the needs to be a complete saying this forever, dude. 100 percent. I'm just saying like, we need to get to that point. But I think with all the shit that's come out so far, that's more than enough to say, okay, we're going to pause the shit. Okay. You said me a house last night that you want to buy. Yeah. The house was not cheap. Not cheap house. Very nice house. And I said, what I say, said you can't afford it yet. Can't get you there yet. Yeah, there yet. If you were able to keep your money that's taxed, you would easily be able to go buy that house easy. Easy. It's crazy. Yeah. It's fucking crazy. It's crazy. Now with all of this going on, bro, I got one little more piece for you here. You see what I'm saying, dude? 100 percent. Like it will change everybody's life. And yeah, instantly. And people will argue that will say, well, you know, if you spend money, you know, if they have poor financial habits, then they will still. Yes, of course, but that's still going to be product sold. That's still going to be driving capitalism. That's still going to be creating jobs. Okay. Like you can't think stupid. Nobody's cool. But like, yeah. Think, what about all the people that will move forward and will make the right decision? Dude, it will fucking, you know, change their fucking lives and trajectory. Yeah. It's high IQ versus low IQ. High IQ people will take the break and they will create more and more and more wealth. High IQ people will consume it, spend it and it'll be gone tomorrow. Yeah. Those people are paying tax anyway. Exactly. Now with all of this going on, I got one little last piece here. I want to bring up not sure if you saw this, but I think this is also going to be a massive fucking deal. Listen, before we get on to this, people, you people that listen to this show and you people who believe in this, that we, you have to demand this verbally. Like you have to be out verbally saying, hey, we need no fucking tax ever again. And we need to get some sort of tax reparation for this. Like this is bullshit. If the people demand it and more and more people talk about it, they're going to have to do it. So you can't sit there and just like, yeah, this is the same thing with COVID. Like you got everybody agreed during COVID, but nobody wanted to say anything. Well now you see how that would have worked. Had you said shit, it would have been different. This is the same. If you don't want to fucking pay tax ever again, if you want to get repaired for the money, they've stolen, you got to demand it as a citizen. I just want to say that 100% man. But yeah, I got one last little thing for you. I think this will be a really, really big deal. I want to get your take on it. Because we've talked about it before, here and there about the importance of this specific thing. And we'll see if it happens. I'm not sure if you've seen this. Senator Rand Paul calls for first Fort Knox gold audit in 50 years. Taps Elon Musk's doge for verification for your request show seven out of the 13 previous audits reportedly missing. Don't even exist. Did you see this? No, I didn't see it, but I mean, the gold's not there. There's no way. It's not there. First of all, they sold most of it. That's what people don't know. If you go and gig in the rabbit holes, we're all conspiracy theory. Theory guys live. You know, they sold it already. I think it is going to shake some shit. And also I was with the tweet. They talk about that in a number of fucking documentaries. But yeah, zero hitch. This guy on Twitter, he says it would be great if Elon Musk could take a look inside for it. No, it's just to make sure the 4,500 tons of US gold is there last time anyone looked was 50 years ago in 1974 to which Elon Musk replied, surely it's reviewed at least every year. Question mark. Rand Paul, he tweeted that he said, nope, let's do it. Yeah, well, it's looking to me that strategically the shit is crumbling in the right way how it's supposed to be crumbling for there to be the revival that's needed. That's how it appears to be man. Yeah, I listen, I don't disagree because it is step by step by step. You know, now there's steps. Well, you know, like why was USAID first? Well, USAID was first because that funded a lot of the what we want to call head of the snake activities, right? Like if it was funding soros and it was funding these NGOs for the migration and it's funding these media stations all over the world that are pumping out this far left progressive fucking bullshit communist narrative. Still, yes, yes, still there. That's where they were trying to cut off of, okay? And if they can cut that, then they got to move on to other things. You know, deeper audits and everything and then, you know, eventually they need to prove that the financial system is completely fake. Well, because it made Americans at least pose a question that, okay, well, like, oh, but that's only 1% okay. If that's 1% and it's happening there, where else is it happening? Yeah, right. You know, and so you needed that they needed that justification to keep this shit moving. Dude, it looks good, man. Stuff looks good. Stuff looks good, but we got to keep, keep up on this stuff to see where it goes. Man, guys, I mean, bro, like, look, dude, if they weren't stealing all this tax dollars, we would absolutely no doubt have black NASCAR. We would have it. We would have it. We'd have it. All the time. We need cars. That's the next thing we need to fucking attack. All this fucking divisive shit, you know, like... I think that shit's done though. I know. I'm saying like, like, dude, like, you know, like black people like to say black excellence. How about American excellence? You guys are Americans. We're Americans, you know, like, fuck, dude. How about, you know, instead of BET, like, you know, like, those are divisive things. You know what I'm saying? Like, people, I guess, you know, people don't realize that, that are part of those. But if you flip the script and did the same thing the other way around, the world will lose their mother fucking mind, right? And I'm of the opinion, you know, there's people with a multiple opinions. There's people who believe, well, it's okay to be proud of your race and, you know, say, you know, those things. And that's fine. But that's only fine for everybody, but white people, right? Okay. Like, Latino people get to be proud. That people get to be proud. Everybody gets to be proud. Gay people get to be proud. I'm proud to be white. I'm a fucking racist, you know, saying it like that's fucking bullshit. Okay. Let's be real about that. And secondly, if we're going to be fucking like that, then we should all be under the label of one people, Americans. We should all be American citizens. Okay. And these divisive titles that we give everything, those things shouldn't even be legal. Or they should be considered racist for what they are. And low level IQ. Yeah. Which I mean, dude. I mean, like, and it's interesting because, you know, oh, well, I get passed. I mean, it's just like the NBA, bro, like I didn't know for a long time. NBA, like that Negro basketball association, like, come on. You know, I was shocked by that. 2025. You know, shut the fuck up. Well, we guys do have the WNBA. You know, there we go. That was funny. That's the, that was a good one. Bro, did you see the fucking dude who won the duck contest? That's why, dude. Yeah, bro. He got hops. Mac McClellan. Now, that's statistically, I know it's like a, it's a three in a row. He's only one of, he's only one. It's everyone three in a row. Nate Robinson won three, but they weren't in a row. Yeah. I mean, listen, it's, there's outliers everywhere. You know how data works. You know what I'm saying? Guys, jump in on this conversation, man. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. With that being said, Andy, let's go cruise some of these comments. Okay. You seem thrilled, man. It's good. It's a good day. This first comment comes from at the A479. The A479. He says, I'm 29 years old. Recently went on a vacation and tell you ride Colorado recently. Said recently twice there. He said, Randall, we sat down at a table and made friends with about seven different people. I went undercover as liberal for the day. We had a blast all day until the end of the night when I told them I voted Trump. They immediately left me. That's so funny. Dude, you know, it only works like way one way. That's it. Yeah. Like, like, like Trump people don't fucking kick the liberal guy in the balls because he, they make fun of them. Just make fun of you. You leave on your own. Yeah. Yeah. But like, dude, it's just so weird. It's weird. It's really right. Nice. You're going to tell me right? It's nice because I've got some friends that have houses there and stuff and there's nice. Yeah. Super nice. I feel what I hear. But what's interesting about that for real is like, those people have failed to realize that the only reason that they believe the things that they believe is because the own government that they voted for has stolen their tax dollars and then turned around and used it to propagate them to believe these things that aren't even true. Like, that's insane to think about. And they're so sure of it because they heard it in grade school and they heard it in high school and then they heard it in college and they got this nice piece of paper from college that says, you are really smart. And they believe that they're smarter than everybody and they don't even realize the scam that's been pulled on them, which is your money got stolen and then used to sell you shit in your brain, messaging, propaganda ideas, untruths. Okay, misinformation, what you guys like to say on your own dollar. And now you're misinformed, you're having problems coming to reality and it's just crazy to think about it. It's crazy. It's also crazy to think about too. Like the only fact, like the fact that we're arguing with, like we're paying, we're also paying, I mean, you are paying to argue with those same fucking people too. Yeah. Now, now listen, you know me, I like to get in, I like to get in those comment wars, you know, I have no problem with it. But I mean, it's crazy to think that like this country is so divided and we all pay for it. Yeah. Yeah, we paid for the racial division. We paid for the economic division. We paid for the fucking riots. Like dude, it's insane. All the bad shit. We pay for the crime. We pay for it. We pay for it. How do we, how do we pay for the crime? Well, they fund NGOs that are owned by people like Soros who then turn around and donate to packs of candidates that get supported on easy on crime bills or do not prosecute crime, prosecuting attorneys like we had here in St. Louis. And then what happens? Oh, there's more crime. There's people getting killed. There's a California, in California, you know, there's a $999, you know, you know, theft limit where it's not a crime. That's, that's why because you paid for it and then they turn the money around on you to create a shitty city. Yeah. See, it's much deeper than you voted for you. I know, we all pay for it. I know. That's, that's crazy. That, that should be a unifying factor amongst the people in the United States is that we all paid for a lesser quality of life, a lesser standard of living, bad infrastructure, high crime. Like we paid for that. That's insane, dude. That's crazy, man. Guys, we got one more, another comment. This comes from at Jambro 1776. What up, Mika? What up? Bro, that shit was hot. Yeah, like that. I mean, oh, they did. Yeah, they liked it. They liked the, I mean, listen to India and I think India and America can come together. I know we've had our past differences. Well, I mean, everybody likes Slurpees, right? We know Indians like women. They like the bobs. Right. They like the Vajeeen. They do, do you? I mean, see, there's a lot of things in common here. Mika's and Magas get together. Bob's and Vajeeen. We can make, we can make Megas. Megabobs. Megabobs. Megabobs. The last comment comes from at Mikey Omeela Man. I want to twerk by the woodchipper. Is that going to be loud? I'm pretty sure this is a dude. So I don't just kick him in. Yeah, sure go do it, man. Get real close. Two steps in the left. Yeah. Yeah, all right. Yeah, all right. Mikey. Cool. Guys, we're doing appreciate you. Nice knowing you. Yeah. We don't put up with that shit around here no more. All right. You're a dance like a motherfucking man. I'm gonna let Ash shake and twerkin from you dudes. No more. It's over. Yeah. That's we appreciate you for being real ass fans, man. Let's keep this cruise moving. Got headline. Number two, let's talk about, let's go to New York, update on the New York situation with Eric Adams. Adams case and other Trump moves threatened to open corruption floodgates experts say. Now, I love hypocrisy. I love pointing it out the ironical nature of all of this beautiful stuff. Let's dive into this because it's a radical. A radical. Yeah. Is that word trademark today? Yep. Okay. So that's it. That's in the DJ book of words. It's it. I wrote my own book, a radical, a radical. Yeah. Right next to Nicolations. I. Adams case and other Trump moves threatened to open corruption floodgates experts experts. Who are these experts experts on corruption experts? Yeah. That's right. That's right. Let's do talk. Um, this is a MSNBC article. Uh, says in a series of unprecedented actions, unprecedented actions. Right. President Donald Trump and his debuts have scaled back or eliminated the government's tools to fair it out. Prosecuting corruption, including efforts by foreign actors to interfere with American politics, experts and former officials say the administration's actions, which come after years of mostly bipartisan support for an anti corruption agenda, have shocked former prosecutors and anti corruption advocacy groups. They say the administration's approach threatens to open the floodgates to a surge in corruption in the United States and beyond. Quote. And his first weeks in office, Donald Trump has taken unprecedented action to invite corruption in the federal government and to undermine the guardrails meant to protect against it. Um, set a formal federal corruption prosecutor Noah Brook, book binder. That's a weird last name. Uh, but yeah, Nate Noah book binder, the president of citizens for responsibility and ethics and watching to the nonprofit organization that says it works to expose corruption. My government officials quote, this is beyond troubling. It is an emergency. He added. Uh, now, of course, I'm talking about this quid pro quo bullshit that, you know, allegedly, they're trying to say happen, which did not happen. There's no evidence to suggest that at all. Um, Eric Adams has actually, you know, he started to blow the whistle a little bit on the immigration bullshit and how his hand was being forced in New York to take in these illegal migrants and, and use taxpayer dollars to house them and keep them and shelter them. Um, you know, that's been coming out, but they're trying to go on this. But I just think it's interesting. Noah book binder. I had a question for you, buddy. You know, where were you? Uh, you know, when, when, you know, the president pardoned his own son, Hunter Biden, um, even though he said he wouldn't do it, for all the charges and illegal activities that, you know, we're proving that Hunter did. But what about, where were you at mentioning that corruption or, or, you know, the hours before his, you know, term was a Biden pardoned his entire fucking family minutes before he left office. Where were you at on the corruption with that with all the proof that we have, we have literal pictures. There's tax evidence. There's plenty of evidence. Where were, I, you know, I looked through you know, a book binder. I didn't, I didn't see any commentary on any of this at all. Well, I mean, he's an expert on corruption. Clearly, there was no corruption, clearly no corruption. Yeah, clearly. No, there's an interesting thing that's happened in New York City. How do you become an expert on corruption without being corrupt? Thanks for the no more. That's right. You know, shit, man. And by the way, if you guys are all such experts on corruption, how come nothing's ever changed? It sounds like you're the, maybe you're the motherfuckers that have the secret formulas on how this shit actually happened. It's interesting. This is all about, I mean, let's be real, bro. You fuck. Dude, it's a big room of a bunch of fucking elite fuck faces who all know what's happening, but they're all benefiting. So no one says shit. Right. Well, bro, here's, here's a, here's a conversation. I saw, I'm seeing this starting to go up on social too. Um, and it's a tough comment because you know, we're at a point now, okay, all the suspects being exposed. And it's been going on for a long time, right? Why have it more Republicans come out to say it? Because a lot of those dudes are on the same fucking deal. Listen, that is a conversation that I think more people do this. I gotta stop thinking about this. It's right. We have to stop thinking left, right? Black, white, gay, straight. All of this shit is designed to create frustration, confusion, and division so that these people can steal, okay? These people want to steal. They, they, they, they know that if we're fighting or we believe in these things that don't matter and aren't true, like, I'm on this team or I'm on this team. We won't notice who's what and will blame the other side. Like dude, look, man, these people are all friends. They act like they're not friends on television. They act like they hate each other. Now there is a few that really hate each other. But these, my fuckers play golf together, bro. They play softball together. They, these are galas. Yes. Yes. And like real talk, like if I'm up there and I'm in the Senate or I'm in the Congress and I know that a dude stealing trillions of dollars and my fucking grandma died in poverty because of, probably beaten ass on the floor. I hate these, I do hate these people. And we should all hate these people. Real talk, we don't hate the galas. They hate us. They hate us. We, and we, we only hate half of them. Right, right. Because they're the other side. They're the team. Bro, listen, there's half a dozen people up there that are not in the house. They're the legit people. There might be, there might be 50. Yeah. Okay. True Patriots. 10%. True Patriots. Yeah. The, the rest, bro, they're on the, they're on a team with each other until it's very clear that they didn't take any money or they didn't know about it or they weren't in on the deal. But like dude, all these dudes on the trading list, they, listen, they're all criminals, man. And they, and they, and they, and they will legit arrest us for even saying that they're criminals. It's crazy. Now, let me investigate this guy with the podcast because he said that they're fucking criminal. No, they are criminals. Proo me wrong. Proo me wrong. Now there's an interesting thing that's happened in New York too that, that kind of goes with this, with this point here, Eddie, is that in the days since this stuff has been coming out, there are now mass resignations from Eric Adams administration. They spark chaos in New York City government. A bunch of people have all, I mean, for deputy mayors, they've all signed and signaled their intent to resign. This all just coming out Monday morning when the show was being recorded. Deputy mayor Maria Torres, springer, she's out. She effectively runs the government mayor for health and human services and Williams isons. She's out. Deputy mayor for operations. Mira Jashi. She's out. A lot of people are jumping shit. Now it makes me wonder why? Why are they all leaving now? Wait, so you're trying to escape the corruption that you're alleging or are you trying to escape the, they, they, they, here's my guess. Obviously, I don't know, but my guess is they probably think that Eric Adams, they're like Adams is in deep shit. It's one of two things. They everything Eric Adams is a deep shit and they want to diss themselves so they don't get caught up in the fucking accountability that may, that could be one or Eric Adams, it could be the opposite. They think Eric sold them out. And so they're scared that they're going to get caught up in the shit and he's going to get free. I think it's that. Yeah, I don't know. It's one of those two. I think it's that man. Eric Adams, Eric Adams seems as much as I haven't liked a lot of the stuff that he's done. He does not seem like he's in on the bullshit. You didn't seem unreasonable. No, he seems like he cares about New York. Maybe he has some Democrat ideals or liberal logic that doesn't add up. I don't know. But from what I've seen of him and this goes back to when he got elected, dude, do you remember him? Like those people, he basically, you know, they were demanding him to do shit and he was like, I'm not fucking doing anything. Yeah. I don't know. He seems to think for himself and that's more than we can say for most of these people. That's true. That's true. I have a belief that that is that and he's about to fucking get him off. Blow the whistle. He's about to get them all. Yeah. You know, he's about to get them all because you know, what we've seen and what we know to be a common denominator along the situations is like they're going to, you know, accuse you of doing exactly what they've been doing, accuse you of being exactly what they are. And I think the sheds can wrap up now. Yeah. You know, yeah, you can run. But we see you. Well, there's too many people in on this, on the discovery of the corruption now. Like remember, last term, the Trump was in. It was very much so Trump and only Trump, you know, and the people around him sort of handled him like, you know, Mike Pence and what's his face? Bill Barn. You know, Pompeo and all these guys around him, you know, they get rid of Bannon, who's the only real guy there. You know what I mean? Right. And they fucking surround him with all these corrupt fucker, you know, company men, so to speak. And, you know, and you know, when Donald is probably sitting there saying, you know, hey, man, I think they're doing this. They're probably like, no, we already looked into that. This is actually what it is. And I'm sure they have good stories, you know? And I'm sure he's smart enough to recognize in that first term that, you know, what he was up against and what it appears to me is, you know, I actually think the last four years needed to happen for people to really understand how bad shit could be and where it was going. Because if he had got elected in 2020, people would have just kept hammering him hand over hand. We wouldn't be here to where this stuff's being exposed. So by having these two dumbasses the last four years, which, you know, has caused a lot of damage and people who have had their livelihoods literally, literally ruined probably feel differently than what I feel. Because, you know, business has been different the last four years and a lot of people have suffered. And, but if we had not had that, the exposure that's happening now wouldn't have happened. And I believe that Trump and his team have strategically for the last few years figured out a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven of what needed to be done to get this shit exposed this time for real. And the order needs to be. Yeah. And it seems like it's happening a very fast rate. There's no way they're just shooting from the hip here. Now it's calculated. It's fine. The one thing that I do think, you know, that we haven't heard yet, but, you know, why are we sending, you know, what about this money that we're sending to Israel? Why are we doing that at all? Why are we sending money? And by the way, it doesn't have to just be Israel. It could be any country. Why are we sending money to any other country besides our own people? Why are we the American citizens, the only people in the world that are required to work and then take a percentage, a large percentage of our income and have it spent around the world on other countries and their governments and their people, which doesn't make any sense, bro. No. Unless, unless they called their friends over in these other countries. And they said, hey, baby, I'm going to send you this. For this, but you only buy two of these when you're supposed to buy a thousand of them and you keep the rest send us half back, right? That's the shit that's going on. It's all fucking scam on how these, these kings and queens, that's what they are. Princess and princess. Yeah. Can get their shit, their hands on our shit. And bro, we have the power. They don't have the fucking power. They don't have it. Never have, man. Never have guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think. With that being said, let's get to our third and final headline. We got headline number three. All right, mainstream media time, CBS, man, they are in the line light, enters the show, CBS. Let's check this out. 60 minutes caught in another major lie. Distraught victim is actually Samantha Powers, former speech writer, entire segment, a complete scam. Now what are they talking about here? So 60 minutes was caught in another completely fabricated report on Sunday night. Their lies are becoming sloppy. So the first big lie we were talking about a few episodes ago. This had to deal with Kamala Harris's interview and how it was edited and they tried to proper up a maker sound better, taking sound bites and answers from this question, moving it to this question. Now they're just putting complete actors in, complete actors. 60 minutes is aired a segment about a sad young mother, Christina dryer, who was allegedly quote unquote fired from USAID in Washington DC this month. But this was a complete lie. Christina dry does not work for USID. She works for XLA and Jefferson partners, a company that provides speech writing services for USID. She's a contractor, not even an actual employee. Let's check this out. People are really scared. I think that 12 days ago people knew where their next paycheck was coming from. They knew how they were going to pay for their kids' daycare, their medical bills, and then all gone overnight. All gone overnight for Christina dry and Adam Dubard fired this month in the chaotic shutdown of foreign aid, distributed by the US agency for international development, USAID. More than 8,000 USAID employees were sent home by the administration. They're not looking for a cup of tea, they're not looking for a good at your job, they're looking for pure loyalty tests, and if you don't give it, you will be punished. And they had to leave the building. And these are folks who had decades and decades of public service serving USAID across administrations from George Bush to Obama to the first Trump administration. They were never able to walk back in the building again. There was no process, no one explained to them why they were being relieved. To my knowledge, they received an email, and then if they didn't leave the building, they were escorted out of the building. It sounded almost like he was complaining that meritocracy wasn't involved in the process. That was interesting. But let's dive into this a little bit more. She was Samantha power, Samantha power speech, what Samantha power was the former head of USAID. And again, she was hired in as a contractor on contract, not an actual federal government employee, but 60 minutes, try to pass her off as somebody who actually wasn't actual federal employee and she was not. Not only that, they tried to pass her office like a regular employee. This lady was writing the propaganda for the justification of this organization. I want to tie this together. She was writing the messaging that justified the existence of the USAID, which we have now found out is a complete front for massive fraud and money laundering and kickbacks and theft from you and I. Maybe you should be in jail. That's right. So then they 60 minutes pulls her on the show and says she is an employee of USAID, which she is not. Okay. And then she pretends to be an employee of USAID, which she isn't and then takes her quote unquote speech writing and sells you a sob story on how she's getting screwed. That's insane. It gets worse than that because there wasn't just CBS. ABC caught her the day she was fired. Quartan quote right outside the building actually. So just before the interview with CBS news in 60 minutes, Christina dry the same woman. She was interviewed by ABC and listen to what she confessed to happen to do the day she was quote unquote fired. Check this out. People are really scared and they had to leave the building and they were never able to walk back in the building again. Doge was in the building. We started. We took down our pride flags. We took down. I took out any books. I felt would be incriminating. No one was talking. We heard they started taking transcripts automatically of all of our Google beats. We they unplugged the news in the little kitchen galley. It didn't feel good and then Saturday all of the websites went down and then I lost complete access to my computer. What kind of incriminating books do you think she had in there? Probably all of them. Yeah. Probably all of them. Probably all of them. That's why she's offering herself to try and solve this problem thinking that no one's going to catch the fact that she's trying so hard to volunteer herself to be a how can I help this as much as possible type person. Only a moron would get interviewed twice by two different agencies within a week and tell two different stories like she you would at least think like fuck I don't know I gave that interview and I said this and this and I was a contractor here. Yeah. Right. No, I'm a full fuck. Yeah. Fuck out here. Now 60 minutes ain't done yet. We still got some more from 60 minutes here. And JD Vance had to tear into them on this one out. This video this interview is wild. I'm sure you've seen it. For those of you guys who haven't checked this out. So JD Vance, the head line with JD Vance tears into or well in free speech criminalization of 60 minutes aers absurd hate speech segment. Did you catch this? No. Okay. So we got vice president JD Vance. He continued his defense of free speech on Monday criticizing German prosecutors explaining their efforts to crack down on free speech in Germany CBS again. They featured a sympathetic look at the German government efforts to crack down on hate speech in an episode of 60 minutes at air on Sunday. German prosecutors explained to the reporter how surprised German citizens were when they are arrested for posting offensive content online but said it was necessary. Of course JD Vance disagreed. Let's check this clip out. It's illegal to display Nazi symbolism. A swastika or deny the Holocaust. That's clear. Is it a crime to insult somebody in public? Yes. Yes. The crime to insult them online as well. Yes. The fine could be even higher if you insult someone in the internet. Why? Because in internet it stays there. If we are talking here face to face you insult me and insult you okay finish. But if you in the internet if I insult you or a politician. That sticks around forever. Yeah. The prosecutors explained German law also prohibits the spread of malicious gossip, violent threats and fake quotes. If somebody posts something that's not true and then somebody else reposts it or likes it are they committing a crime? In the case of reposting it is a crime as well because the reader can't distinguish whether you just invented this or just reposted it. That's the same for us. The punishment for breaking hate speech laws can include jail time for repeat offenders. But in most cases a judge levies a stiff fine and sometimes keeps their devices. How do people react when you take their phones from them? They are shocked. It's a kind of punishment if you lose your smartphone. It's even worse than the fine you have to pay. Because your whole life is typically on your phone now. I love how they all laughed about taking someone's phone. We lost this though it's good. Do we take your phone in it? Wow. Yeah man. Wow. Well JD Vance clapped in on this. He said, quote, insulting someone is not a crime and criminalizing speech is going to put real real strain on European US relationships. This is Orwellian and everyone in Europe and the United States must reject this lunacy. Because he just we just covered his speech. He just told him like I told him right to their face. You're a bunch of commy ship bags. And then CBS wants to do this. Yeah. Well that's because they are commy ship bags. Well, not just that dude. Like here is my issue with all of this. The German government is focused on people insulting people online and reposting lies is what they call it. Okay. Well, I would like I'm under the belief that the country of Germany, just like United States, like we got other shit we should be focused on and be more concerned with. Let's dive in on Germany a little bit. Violent crime in 2023 over 214,000 violent crimes. They're recorded at an 8.6% increase from the last year. Specific violent crime. You got dangerous and serious bodily harm. That's up almost 7%. Intentional simple body harms up 7%. Homicides are up 2%. Sexual crimes are up 2.5%. With foreigners making up about 37% of the suspects. Homicides increased by 2.1% with foreigners comprising 41.6% of the suspects. Gang rapes. So people that shouldn't even be there are committing half of the murders. Gang rapes. Okay. They're up. There's almost two per day. Two gang rapes per day in Germany. Okay. With 50% being foreigners. Knife crimes. They're up almost 10%. Tripleing since 2020. You got theft related home burglaries are up almost 20% car thefts are up almost. Yeah. I bet you if the German men stand up and stop this shit they put them in jail. Oh yeah. You can't even talk about it online. Yeah. To say that hey, that's racist. 41% of the people committing these gang rapes are from from African or Afghan Afghans. You go have prosecutors and police doing search warrants and taking a smartphone for a lot of people. So they're arresting people for reporting data. Actual factual data. Yeah. Because truth is insulting Andy. Truth is insulting. Any fucking revolution over there bro. Like you motherfuckers need to rise the fuck up bro. Find your weedle snitches. Yeah. You can get the fuck going bro. Good lord. I mean it's bad. What the fuck? It's bad. Yeah. It's bad man. I don't know. What else you got on this Andy? A single politician, every single government official, every single non-government official that is complicit in stealing our tax dollars is committing treason against the American people and should be punished to the maximum extent of our ability to punish people. And if they were up to me, that would be impaling them on the White House lawn and leaving their riding corpses for the next year so that everybody remembers what happens to people that fuck with the American people. That's what I think. That's what I got. Yes we want to got. That's what I got. I get. Guys you tell us what you got down in the comments. I'll tell you what I don't got. What don't you got? It's continuing to go on exactly like we have been and pretending that this isn't happening and let them ruin our lives and financially oppress us and divide us and hurt us and create a lesser standard of living and opportunity that we deserve in this country. The amount of damage that has been done by these people culturally is insane. All of this division, all of this frustration, all of these marches and protests and all of this shit. Most people do that are out here. They just want to fucking get along, dude. They want to make some money. They don't want to be fucked with. They want to live free. They want to have a safe street. They want the police to show up when they fucking call them. They don't want the government to harass them and take half of their shit. We all want the same thing, bro. This idea that we all hate each other and all of this. We talk about this all the time. It's not reality in the real world. In the real world, people are good. All of these boogeymen, these people create with our own money and use against us, bro. And when I say boogeymen, I don't mean like, I mean, all of these fears, all of these things that they tell us are under the business. Like it's all bullshit. Most people want the same thing. Most people are good. And we have the fact that these people have taken our money and used it to make us believe that that's not the case. Dude, that's like, it's unforgivable, man. I'm sorry, it just is. It's unfucking forgivable. Yeah, man. Guys, jump down to the comments and let us know what you guys think, man, with that being said, let's get your final segment of the show. Yeah. We got thumbs up or dumb as fuck, let's worry about headline it. We talk about it and get one of those two options. So let's go to Florida. It's been a minute. Yeah. Been a minute since we've been to Florida. Our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads, Florida woman accused of attacking man with gardening tool after he canceled plans with her police. He's reasonable. Pope County Joe, I can show Melanie Davis, who's 47 has been charged with battery multiple times over the past 28 years. No. A Florida woman is behind bars after she allegedly attacked a man with a garden hoe for canceling plans with her. The Pope County Sheriff's Office said Melanie Davis, 47, that's this lady right here. She's a beauty. Someone said that she had plans to hang out. Bro, that looks like a fucking man. Well, you'd be surprised. You'd be surprised because Liz, I got a picture of her younger. Not the bad. Well, I mean, that's what alcohol and fucking cigarettes and fucking math and hard living does to you, dude. No, no, for real, bro. Yeah, man. Like, dude, if you live hot, dude, you know how many people I know that I knew when I was young that were like very attractive people that are now they look 60. They don't look 60. Yeah, she looks 60. She's 47. Yeah, she looks 65. Yeah. Yeah, not a day over 68 for sure. Yeah, she said that she had plans to hang out with a man last week when he canceled on her. Upset by his decision, Davis allegedly went to his home in Frostproof, Florida around 3 a.m. Tuesday and began yelling at him outside. And then the altercation escalated when Davis climbed a fence to his property, pushed through a door and began punching him. Investigators said, at some point, she grabbed a gardening tool and hit him with it, which causing serious cut on his arm. The man was taken to the hospital while Davis was taken to jail. She charged with on burglary with battery, aggravated battery with the deadly weapon, simple battery and criminal mischief. Now, she has a long history dating back to 1997 when she was charged with battery at just 19 years old. Turn 19. Yeah. I mean, that doesn't even look like the same person. Not bad. Well, I mean, bro, that is what not eating right, not working out alcohol and drugs does to people. Yeah, apparently Florida. Yeah. Oh, sorry. I mean, bro. Yeah. That doesn't even resemble the same person. No, bro, not at all. She doesn't look the same. Yeah. That's sad, dude. That's, I mean, don't do fucking drugs. Don't drink four nights a week, five nights a week, seven nights a week for 30 years. You know what I mean? Yeah. Was the guy right to cancel his plans? I would say honestly, like real talk, I was thinking this while you were showing it. It's like, you know, he's kind of lucky. This happened to him, bro, because think of the damage someone like this could do if you let him into your life. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? Yeah, dude. Yeah. Well, shit, but like, dude, you know what I'm saying, bro, like sometimes, you know, these bad things are kind of like a blessing. It's a blessing. It could have been way worse, dude. You could have like, she could have been un, you know, not able to control her fucking crazy and like, fooled you. And then, I mean, some of you fellas know where I'm going with this, right? Like, you know, she fooled you for about six, seven months and all of a sudden, some, you know, some other things started happening and then some other things started happening all of a sudden, you're like, where does crazy bitch come from? Right. Right. Yeah. Like, bro, that's, you swipe right at least at least she's authentic. Yeah. That's true. She's true to self. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, she looked fucked up back then, too, bro. She looked mean. Well, she, I mean, she looked, but it was there. I think it was there. Oh, yeah. I was there. Yeah. You could see it. It's got crazy eyes. Yeah. Dude. That's what I'm saying. That's what it is. Yeah. You know, I, I mean, dude, look, how many violent crimes are we going to tolerate in New America? Like if you've committed violence, how many times until you go into whichever? Hmm. Oh, I mean, it depends, right? Like if you murder a rape, it's instant instant, get in there. Okay. But like the next two, it get in there. Yeah, but what if you've done like, what if you're one of these repeat offenders that beats people with shit that, you know, has done that five, six times in their life? Get in there. Yeah. What's the limit? Twice? Yeah. I think. Twice, two times for sure. Yeah. You, you fool me once, shame on. Yeah. You go jail both times, but like, dude, you do a third time here in the woodshipper. Yeah. I'm with it. I don't know, man. Yeah, I'm with it. Listen. And, and we're talking with violence with weapons. Like, I don't think this fight violence like, like, that should, that should be allowed. Yeah. That's fine. It's allowed in hockey, bro. Like, we just shared it. Like, dude, the whole, the whole hierarchy of men would be completely different right now. If, you know, somewhere along the line, it wasn't made to be illegal, illegal to fucking check people and a fist fight. Fist fighting amongst men has been a way of solving problems at earning respect and male bonding for thousands of years. And honestly, the people I'm the closest with in my life are people that I've had multiple fist fights with. I've fought my brother. I fought Chris, right? Like, and then afterwards, we don't hurt each other. But then afterwards, there's more respect, right? And that's missing in the world. And so I'm of the opinion that fist fighting amongst men without weapons should be allowed. Period. Yeah. This has that mutual combat law bringing it everywhere. Should be allowed. Should be allowed. You should be, you should be unafraid as a man to stand up for what is right with your fists versus another man without the fear of going to jail for assault. That, that one law really fucks culture. It really does. Man, I think that shit was going on. No, hold on, bro. It really fucks culture because now you got these little fucking kids that are 17, 18, 19. That's how it was all the time. They do all this fuck, they do whatever the fuck they want. They walk up and print people and like, bro, I saw one the other day where dude went up and like hit on this dude's wife right in front of him. It's like, bro, like, that guy, you just, that guy should be able to beat your ass without any repercussions whatsoever, because now, now, now knowing that there's consequences of you getting your ass beat and that dude ain't going to jail for doing it. Yeah. It's going to make you think about it. It's going to make you think about it. like, like, like, look, man, like, and, you know, I don't want to sound like the old dude, like, walked up hill and the snow both ways, but like, dude, when I was in high school and even college, man, like, if you had a fucking issue with someone, you fucking duked it out, bro, and, and that was that. Like, you didn't go talking shit. Like, I didn't go up to a bunch of dudes and talk mad shit because I'm like, well, fuck, there's four of them. There's one of me. Like, in my ass beat. So I might as well just be nice. You know, like, it's, it's just a comma sense. Yeah, it was nice. It was a drink in there. Yeah. And, you know, I don't know, man, the world was a better place and a safer place and a more respectable place with a better culture when men fought without the fear of being arrested as a truth. I like it. Not, not weapons. Yeah, no, I'm fucking fists. Use your fist, man. That's only a weapon you need. And I know that there's people and like, you know, like, for example, there's people that go to jail because they got in a fist fight and the guy accidentally died because you fell down and hit his head. I don't, to me, that's if they were mutually fighting, I don't think that guy should go to jail for now. That's an accident of the situation. Now if he picked up a rock and hit the dude in the fucking head and he died, that's different. It's different. I'm gonna keep going when the dude's knocked out. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's, I just think there's, that's my robot. Are you knocking me out? Leave me the fuck alone. I think that, because if I get back up, I'm killing you. Look dude. When I was younger and someone got knocked out, the fight was over and not only was the fight over, you tried to help the dude. You check him out, right? Yeah, for sure. Yeah. It's too much fucking pussy shit these days, man. Yeah. Well, what we got on this hoe, I mean, Melanie, not the garden. Yeah, I say toss her in the wood shipper. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. She's a repeat offender. She got anger problems. It doesn't look like she's doing any good in the world, you know, and she's out here trying to like, I mean, do what? What are you doing? What are you bringing? You're not funny. You're not attractive. You're not contributing. You're a fucking drag on society. That's just the truth. They're climbing fences at three in the morning. That's what I'm saying. You're, you know, you're probably been on cops a couple times. Oh, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Guests. Guests Florida. Right. Like dude, and here's the other thing. Like that we got all these fucking cops out here that end up getting killed or fucking stabbed or fucking hurt because of people like this. I gotta do her like bro, fuck these people. You know what I'm saying? Like fuck all this shit. I'm with it man. Like dude, these dudes making 60 grand a year to go out and fucking deal with this fucking beast. Like bro, get rid of her. You know. Oh shit. Oh damn. We got to deal with Melanie. Yeah. It's like fuck. Yeah. Like, I mean, look dude, if you get the cops call on you 110 times and it was never your fucking fault, you're probably the fucking problem and should be removed from the situation. I'm just saying. You know what I'm saying? I know what you're saying. Yeah. Like, we shouldn't tolerate things like that. What? No, that's 80. That's all I got. You know what? Look, if you get caught, the cops call on you 111 times. What's the right number man? What's the right number? We're learning less and after 109 like I mean, fuck dude. All right. Guys 80, that's all I got. Don't be a hoe. She'll have a show.
