Yeah, we let's get into it man guys We got a lot to cover like I said, so let's let's get into these headlines Headline number one, let's get right into it. I want to let's let's go to the congressional address That happened we'll start there And you a lot of people were calling us the state of the union wasn't a state of the union It was just a joint session between our senators and our congressmen and women And in which president Trump was invited as the guest to deliver some remarks So Trump's congressional address he detailed this laid out the plans to enact the renewal of American dream Is what he called it that was the theme of the talk and there was some you know like to there was plenty of highs and lows during this the Backel I watched the entire thing I did too you know and I Will I want to start with this just saying that I believe I genuinely believe this that The commonest the the communists That run that have been running our government for so long I truly believe They have no shot of every winning in an elected office ever again I believe that now I mean there might be one pocket but like a majority I don't think it will ever happen again, bro. They're exposing themselves way too much Well, I'm gonna be honest like that doesn't matter because that's not how communism works Okay, communism is a three steps forward one step back Ideology they understand that they can push and push and push and then when they push too far they back up And they're very patient They've been playing a long game for a hundred years. This isn't five years. This isn't 20 years This has been going on for over a hundred years and to say That we think that they never have a chance again is is I think a very dangerous statement because That's how they get a chance again and it's too complacency. Yeah, and we're seeing it right like we're seeing people start to sort of Calm down and you know turn their focus into other things which is which is okay But we have to make sure that we finish the job in terms of eradicating that ideology out of our government system so you know That's gonna take Could take a few different things right like some like a lot of these people are guilty of Major fraud most of them are guilty of major fraud Most of them are guilty of some sort of treasonous activity that isn't being prosecuted for whatever reason I don't know but they have sold out the American people for money and Legitimately for money. Yeah, and Some of them more than others, you know, I'm saying like some of these people you buy off a 10 grand in a book deal Yeah, dude, it's look dude. It's a it's something that needs to be dealt with completely You know, it's like pulling a weed bro. If you don't get the root out it's gonna come back and We we are a long way away from getting the root out and Unless Trump decides to like legitimately arrest these people They will be back. Yeah, so well, I mean, I think it's not even up to Trump really. It's to your point It's the people calling for the shit to be held accountable Yeah, I yeah, I mean, that's a big part of it, dude We got Trump for four years you know, I'm saying yeah, I got to live the rest of my life here You got to live the rest of your life here. You know, I'm saying like I'm gonna take a little bit more than Trump Listen, I'll tell you this. I'm not fucking putting up with this shit anymore like these people I Don't care what it takes. I don't care what it means. I don't care what I got to do I don't care what everybody's got to do. I have no sympathy for them. They have no sympathy for us They have no they show that they have no intention for us to live peacefully in a prosperous manner in the country That is based upon a Republic and capitalism and free enterprise and equal opportunity for all they they don't align with any of that they don't belong in the country and They've on top of that they've stolen Trillions of dollars over the last 20 years from us as taxpayers So there is a lot that and by the way not all of them are Democrat right these people are smart They run people in Republican Runs to gain power in both sides of the house as soon as in congressman none of us know don't recognize the name Yes, they're in there though, right they're in there for sure It's a it's you know, it's clearly the ones who say they're Republican and then align with all of the Democrat bullshit Yeah But yeah, man, I mean it's it's a it's an ideology that has to be eradicated from America and that eradication is gonna stop with You know people not tolerating it at all deaf for sure Like so we got lots of diving in in the speech overall I'd give Trump's delivery and execution of it I give it a nine out of ten You know he played the classic Trump you know, I'm saying but that was definitely I feel like it was more towards the end of the speech He got on the run there and that was probably the most I would say presidential you know Speech I've ever heard from him right like it was it was the flow the delivery it was great But you know, he also is gonna throw some low jobs here in there. I thought I love that piece as well But let's I'm gonna first bring in dude. Did you see him call Elizabeth wine poke honest? Oh, yeah, I got it Okay, so oh you do all right. I thought we'll talk about when we get there I want to I want to first bring this up because I think this is important. So this is an AP news article Okay, and of course like they always try to do let's bring in some fact focus and I call it a fact check no more fact focus A look at false and misleading claims made by Trump during his address to Congress I'm proud of it Have we're doing a show, bro. That's gonna disappear. Let me along He going you're your fucking job So miss living let's look at some of these misleading claims quickly shall we? The first thing that they're trying to say that we're bringing into a fact focus is They're saying that he overstayed it the numbers on his immigration crackdown So Trump quote a legal boarding crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded ever The facts they're saying is that Trump wrote in the truth social post on Saturday the Border Patrol apprehended 83 100 people in the US Mexico border last month, but US government data shows the Border Patrol routinely averaged below that number in the 1960s. Oh, we got to go back all the way to the 1960s to get the data got it with the lowest being in 1961 of 1700 address. Oh, so we can go back to the 60s for that, but we can't go back to the death what the Democrats were saying about Black people in the 60s. Yeah, right Right, we don't talk about that part interesting. Yeah, well, I'm also assuming too that the rate of the influx of people costing our borders Where's nowhere near the rates in 1961 either? So I mean proportionately looking at through the rate Trump still right I mean, we got 21 million fucking people in this country. This shouldn't be here. So There's that They also try to say that he overstayed I like this one. He overstayed at hotel costs for non-citizens in New York Right, so you remember when you know anything over zero is unacceptable 100% 100% but he he he actually Understated in Andy because he was referencing $59 million for that hotel, right? Well, I mean actually it was 58.6 and Actually if you total up from The total payments from November of 23 to October of 24 was actually 80.5. Yeah, and that's just one city Here's my favorite one. This is probably my favorite favorite one on the social security stuff So AP in this article, I shit you not they say there's no evidence social security money is being paid to many people over age 100 so Trump quote believe it or not government databases lists 4.7 million social security members from people aged 100 and 100 to 109 3.6 you know, he laid out the facts about it's familiar with this This is what they're claiming is the fact check on this quote from AP news The databases may list those people, but that doesn't mean they're getting paid benefits Now you know the best part about all of this though Andy What's the failsafe they they have the card they still try to play anytime we go in a question fraud and waste and abuse and Misspending and any of that Where they try to pull on to you know as a final divide between the country they have to call it races of course because it's racist Let's check this out. There are people who are charged with trying to find savings So yes, it's an attack on government, but it's also an attack on this government what I mean by that is it's an attack on this Government that used to be headed by a black man It's an attack on this government that almost elected a black woman to the highest office in the land It's an attack on a government that has been more welcoming and more supportive of people who have come to this country and search for a better life Okay, so because we had a black president and because we almost elected a woman who pretends to be black and there's an argument that Barack Obama pretends to be black too We can't look at nothing. Well, I mean what is that? I mean, I don't understand what he's saying. I don't understand what he's saying He's saying that you know We want to look into savings in the misuse and the fraud and abuse of our tax dollars, but But only because it was run by Barack Obama after eight years, so we can't look at it. Yeah Because well, this is this is the same mentality of the crime statistics in America Nobody wants to look or talk about a mergnaulogy and because we don't talk about them look at a mergnaulogy We can't get to the issues that are causing them which just causes more and more and more Black people to be murdered in their own fucking neighborhoods. Yeah, okay? So how do you address something you can't talk about? How do you address fraud and abuse? You can't we can't talk about it Well, how do you address low education scores and inner-city communities if we can't talk about yeah and But dude listen we We all know the game now the game is shame you and into into being Quiet because we'll call you a racist. Well, that doesn't work anymore I don't know if you fucking figure this out. You know it that doesn't work nobody cares people understand That it's a technique of manipulation at this point, which is sad because there is actual racism that exists in certain parts in certain circumstances and By the way that racism extends outside of just black people the white people the Indian people to fucking There's always gonna be shitty people that don't like other people because they have a different race or culture Yeah, or culture. There's always gonna be that it's called good and bad and These guys take good and bad and turn it into all these little subcategories so that we will feel guilty and Let them have their way and then when they show and not I'm not talking about Democrats and and progressives Communist that's how communist getting power, bro They fucking guilt and shame and call you names and then get you to stand down because you're gonna say well You know like what's it? What's it gonna? It's okay. Well look at what's happened now look at what's going on Look at we have in our school systems We have teachers allowing their kids to transition encouraging their kids to transition Outside of the knowledge of their parents. We have men and women's locker rooms totally naked with their dicks hanging out We haven't taken titles from girls. We have an injuring girls. Okay, we have grown men Who dress up as women because they're they want to be in the women's bathroom or legitimate pedophiles They've infiltrated the LGBTQIA plus community and And inside that community we have people who sympathize with them now we have an effective name for them Minor attracted people no those are called fucking pedophiles, bro that we're not gonna tolerate that and We have all these backwards things happening in the world, dude. It's not just that it could go on and on and on and on and on and on But that's what we get when we are shamed into silence For things that just aren't true, bro. You all know if you're racist and you're hard or not Everybody knows you know like don't let someone call you shit just because you're Pointing out some actual fucking data. No, it's crazy. Well, you know what's racist? You know what the most racist shit is is that We can't talk about the things and the in the situation to get worse in these communities Well, you're racist if you point out the crime data No, you're racist for not allowing me to point out the crime data because then we can't fix it Which only causes more crime and more death in that community? So who really cares? Right the people who want to say hey, this is a fucking problem, right? But like the people who say oh your race is reporting that out those people are the actual racists It's insane because if they weren't they would actually care about solving that problem and this political party The the Democrats which is now a large part of them Communist not all of them but a lot of them These people don't give a fuck about solving that problem and you have to ask yourself why that is Why do these people so blatantly not give a shit about About Solving these problems that exist in these communities. Well because they maintain their power and make more money by the problems that they create That's right. They create more problems and they promise false promises and we have a culture that says you know Because I'm this race I vote this way and it's just not you know It's it's not effective or right or true and they're taking advantage of those communities and it really drives me fucking insane Discuss them. Let's discuss it Other things that was going on during this address in this joint session Trump did call Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas. Yeah, then they called her they called him racist for it So what's more racist lying calling him Pocahontas or pretending to be an American Indian to benefit you on applications? There you go. What's more racist? You know, I mean dude. Well first of all Pocahontas wasn't even a real fucking person I don't know if she was or wasn't how do you know that she didn't fucking exist? How do you know? I mean like was there maybe a lady net. Yeah sure maybe like this actual story. It's a fucking fictional story That's who isn't it no bro Pocahontas help lead fucking Lewis and Clark through the fucking Oh this year. Yeah through the mountains of the West exploring she was a Native American who helped Lewis she's a she's a fucking actual person. Oh, yeah See this is my point. They this is my point. This is what you don't get in your public schools. I didn't get this. Yeah, that's my Yeah, I thought it was Disney bro. Yeah Wait, so she so you said Lewis and Clark. Oh, no, she was a Missouri She's a Missouri. I don't know, but I don't know where she came from but she was a Native American and well She ain't fucking Elizabeth Warren. That's no shit Yeah, and and she's the racist for pretending to be that so she could get ahead in her own life Bro these people screaming the loudest about USAID or the one stealing the most. Why do you think they're screaming? They're stealing it and Elizabeth Warren has screamed the most Well, she's worth almost 70 million dollars You know what I'm saying like I mean she's completely benefit of it. I just I mean, I like that he called it out. Let's check the clip Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah, you would say book a hunt to say yes Which like even that though right like it's a joke He is trying to bring peace He's trying to bring fucking peace to an endless pointless proxy war And he had like oh you guys want this for another five years. She said yes Yeah, well of course. He's getting paid bro if I said to you would you like to get paid millions of dollars a year? Yeah, and otherwise I take would you like to get that for the next five years or no She's not thinking about anything other than what it means to her. Yeah, it's disgusting, bro You know, but it wasn't just Elizabeth. I mean one. Yeah, she just she doesn't look shit like polka-honus Okay, if polka-honus looks like what she did on Disney that ain't it Because that polka-honus was not cute.

He's like dude when they didn't clap for that little boy He's like everybody I talk to you know Thought it was the most disgusting thing ever and like dude how out of touch strategically like even if you are a shitbag Like you're not gonna pretend that you're not like that's what I'm saying. Yeah, like dude imagine how fucking stupid are you like you? No, I did this with Alex we were watching this imagine Because like you know all them fucking them but they all talked to you. All right, we're not clapping for anything right And they fucking call out DJ Daniel Fuck it's Like what to do it's a black boy. Oh yeah, well you know what happened here's what happened. This is what actually happened they made their Protest Known before the event which is stupid. Yeah, they showed okay. Yeah, so they put out that they weren't gonna clap and that they were gonna yell and scream and throw shit at Trump and Trump found that out ahead of time and so I'm fairly certain that he did everything he could to make them look ridiculous, which he accomplished definitely accomplished Not about that but like the sickity like you would think it ended there right no claps no applause no standing ovation's For this kid had nothing by these motherfuckers will stand when Zelensky comes in right and gets 50 billion dollars We are cuz they're getting something or or when Netanyahu comes in they'll stand for five minutes straight Because we all know they suck that big. Yeah, my partisanship. Yeah, right? But you you would think we'll stand up and cheer For our hardworking Americans Tax dollars to be sent overseas to other countries for any reason We'll cheer for that because we know that we're getting a piece of that back in our own pockets But we're not gonna cheer for Lincoln Riley's mother and sister Okay, who were in attendance. We're not gonna cheer for This this young man DJ who's had to go through 13 fucking brain surgeries bro at 13 bro the Abbey gate bomber The fucking Afghanistan with draw not not one Democrat Clapters stood for that when they we just brought the fucking Terry's masterman bat that day And Trump announced on the floor nobody clap for that none of them clap for it It's fucking it's sickening bro It's fucking sickening now like the worst part about that DJ Daniel thing You know like said nobody clapped about okay, whatever It's it's what happened after okay. I got a clip here. Um, this is Maxine Waters Okay, Maxine Waters says the Trump misused angel families and the child with brain cancer in his speech Just check this clip pretty awful and I really did not like the way he used the tragic incidents and the families that were there who of course appreciated You know what they think is their president caring about what happened You know to the 12-year-old and to other people were victims and we all feel sad and bad for them But he misused them He misused them and what he did was he focused on them instead of focusing on the real issues Of that we're dealing with now Yeah, he misused him Yeah, you got a OC posing at the border to nobody Yeah, he used them. Yeah, or pretending to be arrested with no cuffs on Andy He used them. Oh, or like when they all kneeled for BLM with their fucking traditional Consul Kintake law scarves on Holy shit. Yeah, the Trump misused him for sure for sure Definitely not political I they have those people died from taking a knee for half for fucking nine minutes Haha, bro you dude listen This is how fucking stupid they are. This is how fucking stupid they're used them bro. Listen. They're taken in knee With a like a traditional African cloth. I don't know what you call it to Kintake. No, that's not what it's called I don't know what the fuck it's called, but these these these got George Floyd is a fucking American, right? You know what I'm saying? Right like What What That's what I'm saying like what the fuck is going on here bro Like are you gonna like a something happens to me y'all gonna fucking put an Italy flag around you now Like I'm fucking American man. You know saying like Like these people are so fucking ridiculous dude You know they do's not even fucking African. He's fucking America. He's born here brother's great It's true. Oh, that's so good. Well, dude. They can't see it like that. But what the fuck hold on this is actually a great point they do not see Black Americans as American. Oh, they don't Democrats don't they don't That's fucking insane. They don't or I mean It's insane like they look like this is like dude. I just kind of like Connected this but like to even do that like if okay if we're all here, right? And it's just our guys in the room here. Yeah, and let's say you know something happens and we're like fuck That was super racist. We're gonna fucking take a knee for this At no nowhere in my mind am I like let's go find some African guards and sestry Let's put some kielt's home for Andy Like bro Like what the fuck is he shine? What will we have to wear for you? Just throw some curry on your head. No I'm fucking Throw some teavis on in the winter time We have to get some fucking sandals and wear them at the coldest day of the year to honor Z-Shine Do for Bosnians. Huh? What do we do for Bosnians? You don't say you don't talk shit about Bosnians bro. No, no, no, we put the Puma tracksuits on Yeah, that's right That's right That's right Here's what I learned about Bosnians bro most of them are real quiet and you don't fuck with it You don't fuck about and by the way if you're if you're good with them they're fucking loyal mother fuckers Well, you know and their hard workers. Oh, they're great people. Yeah, great people But they prefer knives the guns. Hmm. That's not good. Yeah, I don't like that. Yeah, fuck no You know what they say well if you see if you see a knife run if you see a gun charge you fight them Yeah, fight fight fight the gun. Yeah, that's what's the name. I did it backwards Yeah How'd you like that lesson? Yeah, oh shit man, but it cost me my fucking face You know, and if you thought Maxine water was bad we got to go one more step. Okay, let's go to MSNBC Um, bro, that blows my mind like they don't even see They didn't even see George Floyd as an American Hmm Now I wonder like how like you know true to culture they were with those those scarves like did they act like they still them to really get into and with the Well the worst part is the whole lot shut the fuck up The worst part is is that you know like they were all gathering there and somebody's like handing them out You know out of box make sure you put this around your neck. Yeah, right. Make sure you do this. It's not like they were wearing like Whatever Yeah, but yeah, look at fat jaring nadler not even able to kneel like mother fadler the risler hey Fucking fat ass. Where's he been you can't kneel probably fucking in the wood shipper. Yeah, you can't kneel Because you're so fucking fat. Maybe you should do something about it. Yeah You'd be the same height either way. I mean there's a little these little dude For a whole he's a little guy anyway, but um, you know Okay, Maxine you're right Trump Trump used to cool But let's let's go a step lower on the fucking you know pole to hell Uh that these people are gonna be going to MSNBC's Wallace concerned young cancer survivor might kill himself Have you seen this shit? I have holy shit. It's it's one of the most Observed statements That I've seen made in public and that includes like the internet and that's saying so much. Yeah, like like bro I look around at all the conspiracy pages and like all the guys who are on the far left and the guys on the far right and I see some crazy as shit be said But this is up there man, bro. It's might be at the top. It's gonna be hot down there, bro Yeah, it's gonna be fucking hot down there. Let's check this clip out But I think this was a lesson in finding one thing that that you let yourself feel and I let myself feel Joy about DJ and I hope he's alive for another you know 95 years, right? And I hope he lives Um and the life he wants to live he wants to be a cop he knows what he wants to do And maybe when you have childhood cancer that crystallizes for you And I hope he has a long life as as a law enforcement officer But I hope he never has to defend the United States capital against Donald Trump supporters And if he does I hope he isn't one of the six who loses his life to suicide And I hope he isn't one who has to testify against the people who carried out acts of seditious conspiracy and then live to see Donald Trump pardon those people Well, that's pretty absurd There's a special place bro. These people they're still talking about J6. Nobody gives a fuck. Mm-hmm. Okay everybody most regular people who are reasonable and have common sense Understand that J6 was a side up. Yes. No, they understand that they understand that the guys that were held and the girls that were held for four years without any trial or process. Yeah, like they understand that's very wrong and so like these people what what they're doing obviously their job is not to Give their opinions. That's not an opinion their job is to push a narrative for you Yeah, and so they try to work their narrative in with their commentary and uh, that's how it turns out when it's not authentic. She doesn't actually believe that She fucking knows that's not true. Look at the way she says it Like at the end she starts tying it in it doesn't even make sense. No, how'd you get from a Yeah, because it be dude the fact that it was even mentioned there shows It really exposes how they have to work the narrative into these stories. Mm-hmm. And like dude. Let's discuss what Yeah, it's discussed discuss them, but DJ had a message to them Did you see this? Hope you fucking arrest them. Yeah DJ's uh 13-year-old honorary secret service agent DJ Daniel has a message for Democrats after meeting with President Trump This is what he had to say Such an honor to match you What he has one more thing to say I won't interrupt you if you're a Democrat And you're being mean to President Trump. I'm on your bumper Bro, he had played that's a polite way to say I'm on your ass. Yeah Well, fuck a DJ's on it bro. I think we're gonna be good. I think we're gonna be good. Oh man DJ's on it dude. We're gonna be good. It'll be all right. He knows right from wrong You know what's funny that little guy knows right from wrong better than those people do no doubt No doubt man. I Couldn't imagine a world like I really couldn't imagine a world like even And by the way, I don't identify with either of these groups. I try to like critically think In every scenario, you know, like I don't say oh, I'm on this team so that I can and agree with it I don't do that. No, it's not how I look at the world. I don't look at the world like that If I looked at the world like that, I couldn't be successful in business. Okay. I have to evaluate each person each decision Unemotion individual. Yes, so But here's the things I've noticed like when you know Biden was in power and fucking you know, he they would come in and say things even if you know necessarily and this used to make us mad we've covered this on the show We're like why the fuck are they clapping right and they were clapping to certain things out of courtesy because it's the decorum of This chamber and what we've done for hundreds of years. It's supposed to be Civil discourse, but it is not civil anymore. It's very uncivil. It's very mean. It's very nasty It's immoral and uh, you know, it's caused primarily by one group of people in American knows it because They just got their asses beat they can't help it Yeah, and dude you would think like you would really think I can tell you this if we We're on a team. Let's say we were them. We were the Democrats us here. Okay, and us listening Yes, okay, so so We're all on that team right and I'm in the group and let's say I'm not even the leader of the group I'm not even the leader dude like you're the leader, okay, and We come in and we're like holy shit dude We just got our asses kicked like What the fuck yeah? And you said well here, you know, we need to do we need to do more of that We just didn't do it enough. Yeah, right. That's what it was. You know, you know, we just didn't harass them enough We just didn't have enough propaganda. We just didn't Steel enough. We just didn't call them enough names or shame them enough Like that's the level of intelligence that these people have And they've shown it with their actions over the last 60 days or six weeks. They're not coming back from where they went they're not moving off of that line and They are not smart enough to understand that if they continue to press they're just gonna lose more and more and more and more and more and more and double and down All right, yeah, so if I'm in that group, I'm going to say Guys listen, I know I'm new here. I know I'm the lowest rank and dude But I'm gonna tell you what I think and what I think is is that if we don't change our messaging and we don't pivot towards Where the culture is because culture is upstream from politics and we answer the culture not culture created by us We're gonna have to make some changes or we're never gonna win again And everybody's gonna be like oh And I'm gonna say well. Do you want to win or do you want to lose? What do I know? I'm new here, but that's my observation, right? And you know, that's it's amazing. It's amazing to me which I'm thankful for that nobody's doing that with them Like it's great. It's like it's really weird.

Oh really? Yeah, that's good. Okay. That's good Mrs. From Ethan Peterson 84 63 Okay, so aint indijay came in clutch today. I live in a small town in northwest Arkansas called p-rich I was definitely speeding at least 15 over. I got stopped by an officer I'm sitting in my truck thinking this dude is going to hang me to dry on top of my speed My tags are way past due. I was listening to today's episode and the officer gets to the window asked for my ID and all that information I proceed to hand them that I'm along with inform him of what was in my armrest pp Um, the officer looks at my screen and seeing the show was playing. He looks at me straight face to nest. Are you a hoe? I I'm thinking what the fuck is this guy talking about Then it hits me. He's a fan like myself after shooting the shit for a minute He asked again if I'm a hoe I said hill no, I share the show He then asked me to prove it so I sent sent it to the first five contacts on my phone He tosses me my shit walk to his car yell and don't be a hoe share the show and slow your ass down Thanks fellas you shave save me a pretty penny keep it up and ps. Wendy's fries are the best get the fuck out if you say different Hey, that's what I'm talking about. It's good story remember saving pennies That's like a third or fourth story. We heard about that from the police happened quite a bit man That cops definitely not a hoe no Nope dude. That's awesome. That's funny. Yeah He's a popo. Yeah, well popo's a house. No, I mean I love it guys. We appreciate you guys for being real ass fans Keep liking keep commenting make sure you guys are subscribed and hit that bell notification on the youtube to stay up to date with the latest episodes from real af With that being said, let's keep this cruise cruising. It's still surreal to me that people actually listen to us Like Like hearing a story like that or like dude like Like seeing the hat places, you know what I'm saying like on the internet randomly fucking Mount Kilimanjaro. Yeah Like that was fucking badass shit like that like The Elon guy the guy who got the guy with the Elon. Yeah, that's me who got it. Who won the million bucks. Yeah, I just see like dude. It's cool. Yeah You know what's real cool about it though too is like when people see it They automatically know like they're cool. That's a good dude. Yeah, that's a good girl. That's a good woman. Yeah, for sure We're gonna take the world over man I don't want to hoat at a time. That's right That's Elon slugging Alright guys, we got headline number two now. Let's check in on on migrant situation. Hello number two reads There is no america without migrants says democrat attorney general Well, there's no america without immigrants. Yeah immigrants and migrants are not the same two different things That's right two different things america without exists without migrants Connecticut democrat attorney general William Tongue told his political allies this week Speaking on Tuesday to the immigration community meeting sponsored by Latinos for educational advocacy and diversity That sounds like some USAID shit This was held in Connecticut Tongue renewed his pledge that Connecticut governor Ned Lamont's administration will continue to quote protect honor and respect our immigrants and immigrants families The north which Bolton reported He also insisted that so-called quote-unquote birthright citizenship must be protected Birthright citizenship has increasingly come under fire for Lending automatic citizenship to birth tourist One who become pregnant from other countries just to bear their child on us soil in order to be eligible for the United States welfare and other benefits So I thought that was interesting um It is migrants, but here's an interesting thing like this hit me today when I was putting the show together, bro Is that like I'm starting to see Like the democrats have always been democrats, okay, but I feel like I'm starting to see some really alarming correlations with like this migration thing and slavery Like these people are fighting for their slaves right The you know you had the south fighting to to keep slavery going and then you got you know our modern day democrats fighting to keep their migrants Which they're trying to use to replace the vote and then like they're fighting for the people that they're oppressing Well, I mean bro you you listen to what they say when you start asking about the importance of migrants And one of the first things they say is like who's gonna cut your grass right or who's gonna pick your fruit or who's gonna do like That in itself shows you the world view they have of these people and see them as they see them as a sub-servient class which is absurd because No job and no working people are Sub-servient of any class in my opinion if you work hard and you do the best that you can That's respectable it doesn't matter if you're sweeping the floor. It doesn't matter if you're Taking the garbage. It doesn't it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you run in a country like dude Do the best you can know and I would matter that it doesn't matter I think that's respectable and deserves respect at any level Um, but it's interesting because these people Who say these things don't work for anything that they have? They get elected in the office and then they funnel the money into their own pockets and then you know At the same time think of themselves as a higher class of people than these people who are coming across the border like that's Pretty fucking ironic in my opinion and then on top of that You know I don't think That any of this has anything else to do with these people the quote-unquote migrant class serving the The left elite Very wealthy because like dude the only people that vote Democrat it's it's one of two kinds of people It's either very privileged Upper middle class or upper class people who really haven't had to work or build or create anything on their own and They You Pray I mean, I guess that's the best word to use and manipulate the poorest class into aligning with them to maintain their power play So the other demographic they vote bro. It's an off. It's an inauthentic position It's a it's a position of manipulation. They don't the reason they do all this crazy shit isn't because They're stupid. It's because they believe themselves to be of a higher class of people And then they look at people who are too busy trying to survive and say oh there's an opportunity for me And then they go talk to those people and they say we're gonna fix this we're gonna fix that And then they're smart enough to realize That if they keep these people in that position they will continue to get the votes So when they say things like you know, we want these migrants and the migrants are you know America would exist without migrants the motivation behind that Isn't anything other than to serve themselves 100% and it's not about making a life for these migrants They don't give a fuck about this birthright citizenship or taking care of these people or giving them health care or anything like that Fuck dude. They promote the murder of American babies like it's fucking the biggest thing in the world, okay? And You know it's so It's weird to me that people can't let all people can't see this Or more people can't see it like what I'm yeah, but like it's so blatant. Yeah, it's very obvious It's very obvious and I mean that but that's the point of the show right we draw these conclusions. We connect these dots Because you know The thing is like it's not it's not pocket to anymore. It's not just this one little like They're overexposing themselves To the point where I think more people will get it because it's too obvious right like so let's go um That was uh All a lot of not a lot there's four major democratic mayors right blue city mayors um sanctuary city mayors as they're called they got something to to DC um To uh to to speak with a congr- it was a congressional hearing is what it was On the immigration crisis and how they were handling it um and I got to check a little bit of this out But I knew I knew Andy that this was not gonna go well because of how it started Um, do you remember Michelle Wu? So she's the mayor of Boston. We just had her own on the last show This is how she decided to kick it off Um, let's hear what she had to say The jai this is our city We are the safest major city in the nation because we are safe for everyone You mean like like like the dude that went into fucking chick filet and tried to stab fucking people you know like say like that I don't I don't I mean this lady's insane. I don't I think that was a mix of like Spanish and something else too Yeah, I mean Who knows she she's so corrupt she could be just making noises and pretending like it's different language You know what I'm saying like we don't fucking know Uh, but you know again these congressional hearings are kind of led they're led by you know I would say true patriots um james james comers on there um you had uh uh Paul Luna Representative Paul I mean she's she's awesome polina Byron uh Donalds is on there. He was the first person who's kind of chime in on this and get this shit kicked off So let's check out what he had to say. Did your city spend on illegal immigration? Do you have a round number? Over the last couple years on all newcomers whatever their status was it's around 79 million since 2022 79 million mayor janssen Chicago how much is the city of Chicago spent on illegal immigration? If you refer into the 2022 up to 2024 of the buses coming from Texas Roughly the same percentage of the state of Texas about one percent of our overall budget What is that because we don't have the city's budget in front of me numbers It's 1% and if you want the actual calculation we can make sure someone you're the mayor You don't have the math in front of you it's 1% of the overall budget over the last four years That's why you're failing mayor mayor at number that's the same number I'm a city of New York actually state of legal immigration mayor janssen um I already asked you you don't have a hard number And if you don't have a hard number you're not running your city well mayor atoms How much of the city in New York actually spend on illegal immigration? That's 6.9 billion of taxpayers 6.9 billion dollars of taxpayer money on a problem that was fostered on the American people Mayor Wu in the city of Boston. How much did you spend? We don't ask about immigration status in delivering cities. You don't ask about how much money the city of Boston has spent on illegal immigration Are you out of your mind? Between immigration status. Do you manage your budget or not mayor? That is how we keep mayor Will you manage your budget or numbers to prove it? I manage my budget I have a triple a bond rating dating back 10 years so to the city of Boston just understand that your mayor does not care How much of your resources she has spent on people who are not citizens of the city of Boston is thick of having people outside Boston I miss the bear I miss the bear of a question for you because I understand Kato's perspective when it comes to illegal immigration Almost 7 billion dollars in New York City alone Kato's and I want to say they're in definitely hundreds of millions of dollars just trying to low ball is saying 1% That 1% is shit time. We saw what 1% look like with USAID right? Yeah, it's a shit time right? It's a shit time But these people like to play games and they kept the heat on them Democratic mayors didn't refuse to answer if they would turn over illegal aliens to ice Um, so this is from James Komer. Let's check this clip out Mayor Woo under Boston law would you turn this criminal over to ice on a detainer? Whenever there is a criminal warrant Boston police enforce that and hold people accountable So would you turn that criminal over to ice? This happened outside the city of Boston, but I can tell you in the city Whenever someone commits a crime whenever there's a criminal warrant we hold them accountable If ice deems that they are dangerous enough to hold Obtain a criminal warrant and the Boston police will enforce it Will you turn that criminal over to ice? We follow the laws and we make sure I mean they all did it and which is interesting like they all try to do this worry play turn around because he's literally asking Because they're they're talking for sound bites and they understand that that if they say You know, yeah, we'll turn them over to ice that that clip will be made into an ad which will then be used to destroy their Quote-unquote position right It's sick man like the truth of the matter is they're not turning them over they're like oh when I say oh We follow federal laws or yeah, they're not doing that and we have a you know, it couldn't have came out at a better time Sanctuary city scandal you remember the migrate who set that woman on fire and the fucking subway Uh, he's avoiding deportation because Under the current policies enacted in New York City the city's corrections department have refused to honor An immigration and customs enforcement detainer for is a pedicolo He I'm reading the line above this He fan the flames with a shirt before sitting on the platform bench and watching as quam burned We follow off federal state laws though, right right um And you know There's a special place in hell for these people. Yeah, I believe it Um, and uh, we got to go to Anna Paulina Luna listen winter we gonna we know we're gonna facilitate them finding that place a little bit fucking sooner okay, because this is criminal shit And a lot of this shit they're doing is treasonous and Destructed into this country and everybody knows it So when are we going to start seeing some accountability because I'll be real dude. I'm tired of hearing How great things are going how awesome things are going how we're taking this shit back and nobody's been held accountable fucking at all Okay, so I think At this point in time It would be reasonable for some of these people who have violated the law Who have done treasonous activities? We've had four years to watch them do it You mean to tell me that the Trump side of the table hasn't been planning How to hold these people accountable the whole time. I know they have so when is that gonna happen? And I say that with an asterisk There's information. I don't know. There's things. I don't know. I don't know a lot of things I don't know if there's a retaliatory attack plan to something happens or like the Epstein list comes out I don't I don't know but I think it's reasonable For people to be held accountable at this point in time and I sometimes I feel like the Trump administration is Is out of step with where people are with everything Like we're we're able to meaning it's palatable for listen. Yeah, dude listen The more money like when they're saying oh, we're cutting all this funding to Ukraine And then they give money to Israel bro. You're losing your base It's it's only a matter of time the word is out and by the way Did you notice that I talked about that on Tuesday show? And did you notice on yesterday's Wednesday that every single other fucking show was talking about it? Yeah, right Interesting it's a Papa John's effect, bro. Well whatever dude But the point is is that and then you know people are like oh, I see them talking about it here here here here here here here And then you know, I never get mentioned in it. We never get mentioned in it's weird It's weird. Yeah anyway Yeah, this guy belongs this guy should not not only not be deported. He should be executed Yeah, you lit us an American citizen on fucking fire and then you're on video doing it And you fan the flames like What does it take what does it take here like how are we going to allow this how is that allowed? How is that allowed How could we have a civilized country where people can commit crimes of this nature and not be held accountable in a very Quick fashion like how He's getting more right this dude's getting more rights in that woman at 100% and how I don't Upside down. I don't understand how we could call ourselves a civilized society and all this shit, dude When this is allowed that's not civilized a civilized society is Made civilized by The understanding that if you act uncivilized there will be accountability to those actions And because the law hasn't been enforced which by the way we all paid for Because USAID sent the Soros foundation and his charities plus million dollars Okay, to then be turned around and fund the election campaigns of district attorneys that will not press charges Against minorities or violent crimes. Why do they do that because they want these neighborhoods to be destabilized? All right, so we paid for these people like this this immigrant with migrant illegal migrant to come across the border and kill American citizens we pay for that and then there is no Punishment for them whatsoever. How can we call that a civilized society because people get away with murdering each other? How is that civilized? A civilized society is one that has very harsh punishment for crimes like this and Becausely because the punishment is swift and harsh We end up in a situation where there is no crime Okay, so people like this and people think I'm crazy when I say this this man was caught on camera Undeniably setting another woman on fire who then died That with that kind of evidence there should be no fucking defense There should be no due process and all the attorneys that are my friends are cringing right now, but sorry dude There shouldn't be Okay, there should be an agreement that if you do heinous things and the evidence is overwhelmed Overwhelmingly true and there was witnesses and everything Then it should be like 60 days before this dude's getting beheaded in public, you know And then if we did that and people knew that we wouldn't have these things happening We just wouldn't we wouldn't have our women having to you know look over their shoulder everywhere they go or be in fear We wouldn't have downtown urban areas where you know, you can't even go even though you pay fucking talks for it You know, we wouldn't have that shit. We'd have a civilized society So if we want a civilized society to exist We have to understand that the punishments for not being civilized have to be quick and harsh and intimidating To keep order in society. That's the truth. Oh, where it works nobody wants to fucking talk about it But that is the truth it would be nice if we could you know All get along and and and sing ring around the rosy and fucking Hold hands in shit, but dude. That's not reality man. I would love it to be that way too I would I would love for everybody to get along. I would love for there not to be criminals I would love for everybody to have a big heart and care about people But there are people that that are evil fucks And we should handle those people appropriately so that we can minimize the damage they do in society 100% man 100% now. I mean to your point about accountability That's why I want to check in with congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna Because in that same hearing with those same mayors She's she's she's turning them over to the DOJ. Let's check this clip out So you don't believe that banning the transfer of individuals into ice custody for the purpose of civil immigration enforcement encourages illegal immigration into Chicago Or how about agencies sorry one second or agents stopping able to stop arrest or detain individuals based solely on their immigration status or administrative warrant So we comply with all laws local state and federal To me after this line of questioning it's very clear that these policies that you have all implicated are active in alive and well in your cities are in direct violation with US title eight code subsection 1324 and is a federal offense But you all speak about a broken immigration system and yet here you guys are Aiding and abetting in that entire process. I want to be very clear about something Open border policies, which is something that you guys are talking about hurts people on both sides Meaning the people that are coming here illegally and then American citizens as well I do not think you guys are bad people, but I think that you are ideologically misled Which is why unfortunately based on your responses I'm all going to be criminally referring you to the Department of Justice for investigation And as soon as I leave here these will be going over to Pambondi I'm not doing that to an effort to bully you guys, but I do believe that your policies are hurting the American people and you can make that known With the evidence that you could present the Department of Justice But if you guys continue doing what you're doing you're not going to help anyone You're going to hurt more people and that's exactly why I'm tired of it the American people are tired of it and chairman I you'll let them would you yield your last minute? Yes, sir Yeah, I mean that's great. No, but what's gonna have from there? I mean I'm getting kind of tired of the strongly worded letters And you know, we're gonna turn it over for investigation And then when we bring the people in for investigation They say things like I can't recall or I'm not sure or I can't remember or I don't know what one percent of the budget actually equals Right, they they are allowed to dodge all of the questions anyway. So What differences in make and I commend You know misluna for doing that That should have been done. I should have been done years and years ago but What really is going to happen What's really going to happen? How long is it going to take? How many more Americans are gonna die for any fruit to come off that tree? Bro Doesn't it piss people off that these people side with the criminals? Doesn't it piss these criminals have more rights than the American victims that they heard? Well, pro that is a communist that's in the communist manifesto that's fucking in Saladin skis book that's in 1984. This has been written about for a hundred years And people dude, I don't know I'm starting to think it might be worse than what we think. Yeah You guys let us know down in the comments with that being said let's get to our final headline of the show your headline number three Um exclusive Senator Bernie marano introduces bill to ban fond flags on capital grounds Um, have you seen this? No, so this just came out today um senator Bernie marano out of Ohio has introduced legislation to ban the display of fond flags on US capital grounds Uh, bright bar news has learned exclusively marano. He's illegal He's a legal immigrant from Columbia um Who came here to the United States as a child and then built an impressive auto dealer chain business before his election last year to the US Senate He told bribes bar news That flying foreign flags like ukrain's in congress is offensive to Americans quote When I came to this country as a child, I swore allegiance to America and America alone Which is why it's so deeply offensive to me to see elected officials flying the flags of foreign nations Like ukrain in the halls of congress marano to bribed bar news quote We sworn oath to the american people we would always put them first Let's start acting like it and stop sending billions overseas on endless wars when average americans are struggling So um, we just introduced this new bill is called the allegiance act Um, which will make it illegal for members of congress to use official funds to purchase any nations flag other than the american flag would also prohibit The display on capital grounds of a nation's flag if it's not the united states flag Um, and like this was you know one of the biggest things this is a picture. This is when zalinsky you know We had the privilege to address our um Our congressman and women and senators and you got Pelosi and the vice president then vice president Kamala Harris holding a signed Uh ukrainian flag You know and it's signed by all of the people look at come all his face bro getting the money look at her fucking face How she's ecstatic that's disgusting She's got this smug ass look on her face like looking at her people and the chamber look what we did So strong And brave we're gonna get paid so much that's right. That's what she's saying with her fucking face Yeah, fuck the american people with her face right there. That's what she's saying Thoughts on i mean dude yeah All flex Yeah All flex brought More than flex you know those stupid fucking pins. They get them the lapels. Yeah, bro that's fine. Listen dude listen There's too much foreign influence in our government. There's too much federal aid to goes to anyone All right The fact that we're sending a single dollar to any government is insane the fact that we're sending a dollar to Ukraine after what's happened is insane the fact that we're sending money to israel who is Bach their leadership or some of the richest individuals in the fucking planet Okay, that's insane. Well israel can lobby directly to our politicians. It's gonna probably it goes further than that Then we have a number of the United States government who are dual citizens with israel How is that okay? How is that okay? How do we allow dual citizens of any country to make the decisions about our country? That makes no fucking sense. There's no sense. Okay, and We all know why we all know why it's allowed It's because of the Jeffrey Epstein type shit that all of these people know about and you know the leverage and the blackmail and all the dirty shit behind Close doors that we don't you know ever get to see um It's insane dude and and dude like it's not america first It's not america first to send to our tax dollars anywhere else But to the benefit of our american citizens on american soil especially when we are in the state that we are currently in It's it's it's bullshit. It makes no sense and dude. It's this isn't an attack on fucking anybody. This isn't an attack on What's actually happening in our country? So where we have people of dual citizenship making decisions to finance the agendas of other countries that they happen to be a citizen of like that's Not something that Is very american and and people are waking up to it for sure You know i'm very glad that it was talked about on all these channels because now we're starting to get somewhere Yeah, and i love the way that it was addressed to because it wasn't like how some of these people do which is like Oh, it's fucking Jews. No, it's not It is the fucking leadership. It is the government. Do you agree with what our government does? No, most of you don't okay, so does that mean it's all americans and time america bro It's it's a it's a lazy argument. Yeah, it's a lazy argument. It's a low IQ argument bro. Here's what it is It is this It's evil people at the top and evil people rise to the top because they're willing to do whatever the fuck they have to do to get to the top and You know of government is what i mean And dude these people make these decisions and uh, you know, and then and then they hide behind all the good People that happen to be citizens of their country or members of their faith or lineage and they say oh you're criticizing me because um jewish no We're criticizing you because you're blackmailing our government and making us as american taxpayers Have our fucking backs broke so that we could send money to you like that's that's what the problem is It's not about the citizens. It's not about the jewish people. It's not about that. It's about What their actual names are who are the people that made these decisions? What are their names What are their actual names? Let's stop Generalizing these groups and start identifying the actual individuals who are responsible for the perception That of all of these things that aren't true. Who's engineering all of these social movements? Who's Who's who writes the strip that's right. Yeah, who's writing the script like we like we put i post on my instagram the other day like I think we had it in the show too, but the point is guys is that we have if we want to solve these problems We have to be articulate with our arguments And I know that sounds comical because I'm not the most articulate person all the time I can be what I need to be if I'm sitting in a meeting or whatever I got to do I can do it But we're talking as friends here, okay? This is this is backyard bullshit talk. That's how we do it here and uh the truth of the matter is is We shouldn't be sending any money anywhere And there should be no influence outside of America in our government We shouldn't be generalizing entire races of people or ideologies of people We should be looking at the people who are responsible for the illegal actions Uh both in the past and present and who's compromised by that and we should identify all of those people by name instead of making generalizations about entire And that's how they did it when when when Ian Carroll was on Rogan he did it that way, you know The ova did it that way like these guys are starting to talk about it in like the right way of how it can be addressed How it can be productive yeah because dude the truth of the matter is is like You know and and a lot of Jewish people are starting to speak up because dude what they're doing is creating a dangerous environment for regular Jewish people Creating real hatred. That's right. Yeah, and and dude that's a big problem dangerous and Uh It's almost to the point where they're like and it seems like I don't know bro. I think I think this shit is so deep and I think it's so dirty and I think that people don't comprehend What the leaders of some of these countries are willing to do to their own people in order to create a certain perception so they can get what they want And if I'm looking strategically at what's going on with the Israel situation and with the Uh, you know relentless bombing of Gaza um I know israel people of Israel feel very strongly and and people have strong opinions on both sides I understand that but when we look at it from a geopolitical place Most every country besides the United States America is fucking pissed and what Israel is doing Okay, and they continue to do more and more and more net and Yahoo is completely like fuck you. We're gonna do it We want fuck you. We're gonna do it. We want fuck you. We're gonna do it. We want And we have to ask Why that is and I think there's two reasons why I think there's three reasons why I think one they've got nuclear weapons so he knows that so there's always that a feel safe right to The American government is literally their fucking slaves, okay? So Anytime that they truly need money or military assistance or whatever they've got shit on everybody in the government So they get it, okay And third of all you know, and this is the darkest one that I that I come up with and this is not This is this is just an option of you know my job as what I do for a living is to evaluate where the options are going and what's happened What the outcomes potentially are and uh, you know when I see I Leader intentionally doing more and more damage to their own people's reputation That makes me seem makes me think that there's potentially It's potentially being done on purpose and so then I have to ask okay. Why would that be why would they do that on purpose? And then I start looking around and I see okay. We've got three something billion Muslims and we have 14 million Jews right And you're pissing off all of these three billion Muslims Right mm-hmm, and so it wouldn't be very hard for the entire Muslim sect of the world to caused real damage to Israel very quick and then we look at you know That entire three generations two generations of men have been removed from Ukraine and Ukraine is one of the most Natural resource rich countries in the world It just it's it's it's in case you're not following what I'm saying when I'm saying is they could be potentially creating a situation where They are making Israel unsafe for the Jewish people and then potentially relocating them there and then holding it as the holy lamb but not where they occupy right so And then using it for you know the the trade channel and everything that they're trying to create over there So like looking and that lens it also makes sense why they're continuing to try to drag out this Ukraine Yeah, dude. Yeah, and they haven't finished killing all the men and dude. It's just I think these people at the at the very top of the chain Are doing some very nefarious shit and I think people are waking up to it in mass And I think people are also realizing that doesn't make you anti-Semitic to judge the actions of another government It's it's when you say things that are collective like white people are inherently racist Like we've had to hear for the last fucking 20 years right or you know black people are all criminals That's not fucking true Right this this ideology and this identity politics has seeped so far into our culture That we can't even make friends with people and tell jokes and do the things that we've always done to connect and bond and and Be united right like what unites people, bro? Humor that's unites people common interests unite people So if they made it illegal for us to tell jokes to each other Didn't they just eliminate a bonding mechanism that we have as men So we've had all this identity politics Jammed down our throat and now we've trained the public to uh collectivize People into races instead of just good or bad right and like dude that's that's what we're dealing with here And now you can see why they've done it because it's something they're trying to engineer a manufacturer and I wouldn't put it past Netanyahu and all these dudes at the top of Israel Uh, and the world economic forum to kill as many people That they have to no matter who they are To get what they want to choose to go yeah, and and so dude. I think it's very important I actually think it's very important for regular Jewish people To call out the corruption that's happening and say hey, we don't have to agree with this because dude That's what's going to squash the anti-semitism and actually get people focused on solving the real problem Which makes everybody's life better? Does that make sense makes perfect sense like like dude You know, they're into I feel like their government is intentionally creating anti-semitism for a Political reason 100% and I feel like the the Jewish people could squash that Because dude every Jewish person I know personally which is quite a few They're all like yeah, fuck that dude. Yeah, they don't like this shit either It's a strategic play that they've done many times right like is we had this conversation with the about the Lgt QIA plus community right with the pedophiles, but at the same point it's the same play and like you know if people that you know are in that group They need to come out and speak and say hey, I'm not with these fucking pedophile Yeah, because you're you know the hate that you guys are complaining of you're getting more of it because You're not separating yourselves from the real evil and every and so dude when everybody starts when it becomes mainstream like it's starting to now Yeah, that Israel's mason was very fucking evil and how they blackmailed pretty much the entire fucking world right using children and and and rapes and like so When when regular people don't stand up against that and say hey, we don't fucking agree with that And they stay silent what happens is is people start to think will fuck Maybe it maybe it is all of them and that's where the dangerous shit starts to fucking happen So it's it you know, it's unfortunate and it's frustrating to watch because People are good or bad, bro. It doesn't matter where they come from. It doesn't matter what their race is it doesn't matter There are good people in every group and there are bad people in every group and sometimes good people find themselves in the bad group and vice versa And the way that we get around all of this is that we stop generalizing The actions of a few onto an entire race or group of people and we start to actually hold the individuals personally accountable the people who are pulling the strings the people who are making the decisions um the people who are coordinating the outcomes Until we identify who that is by name and hold them accountable this play Meaning this Generalization play that is being forced on us to identity politics is gonna continue. Yep. 100% my guys Jump on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments That big set. Let's get to our final segment of the show is always We have thumbs up or dumb as fuck. This is what bring a headline here. We talk about it. It'll get one of those two options. So um You did baseball cards growing up. I did trade in baseball.
