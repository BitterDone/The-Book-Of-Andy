Ian Smith one of America one of America's most wanted formally one of America's most one yeah oh man what's up bro not too much man good to be back yeah feels like it's been a while since I've been at eight has been a while has been a bit of it yeah what's going on you hiding from us yeah yeah stay and busy enjoying enjoying the Florida heat during the summer you know how is Florida Florida is it Florida is it good you liking it yeah yeah except I may have to start being active in politics again because they're demolishing all the beautiful Florida and making golf courses out of it so oh that's nice looks like I'm gonna be a thorn in somebody's side again well you know as much we do hopefully won't be the governor this time maybe somebody a little less powerful yeah well I mean I think Florida's a little bit more in line with what we all believe here so maybe I'd be a little more receptive to it very yeah no very sounds like you went to the left man you joined the green party yeah yeah if I criticize anything that the right does it automatically means that I'm a purple haired Democrat it's actually I'm aware I shaved my head and died at purple yeah but I just can't see it right now I say glitter in the beard I see it because I lipstick I also go by I also go by he him now so just a case everybody wants to address my third person oh man yeah people well dude you know we got enough golf courses yes be real Florida does have some amazing golf courses but I was just talking to my buddy who owns the beard distributor for anizer bush down in in Tallahassee trip and we were talking about how beautiful it is over there man just all north Florida especially it's so just beautiful we'd like to keep it that way yeah it's the only complaint I have yeah other that in homeowners insurance but you know if it was Jersey it would be property taxes yeah it's one of the other man they're gonna get it until we until we decided change that yeah I feel like that's coming down the pipe man like we're gonna see something just I don't know enough people get sick and tired you know I you know I think if I think if people really sat down and analyzed like you know for years they just get screwed oh that's what I'm saying like for years I'd have put a dollar figure on how much you get screwed on a yearly basis I think it for me it woke me up when I started realizing that like how much time it takes to pay the government what they take from us and when you add it all up dude we work more months out of the year than we do for ourselves essentially if you add in all of the taxes along the way with purchasing and this and that yeah transfer of goods and everything like that and business taxes yeah yeah man and when you think about it like that you know everybody's like man I paid too much taxes but like dude it's not too much like you work for them yeah you know and that's not the point of government the point to keep too little I think is the is the better way of looking at yeah well I mean look man you know how can you say we live in a free country if that's the case you know like why are we all working as much as we do as hard as we do and trying to create the American dream which is what we're promised well to just support the government man like it just you know if I if I went into any major city and it was you know spotless and there was no crime and I could leave my car you know more palatable yeah I maybe I wouldn't mind it as much or if if the children in this country were getting good educations and there was no homelessness and we had flying cars and and bullet trains and all that sort of stuff I don't think I'd mind nearly as much as just watching it all get shipped in pallets overseas yeah while everything else falls apart and they just continue to the tax to make things worse it's fucking absurd bro it's absurd it's something that really needs to get corrected man like people don't talk enough about it you know we're too busy arguing about all these other things when it's yeah bro when and I think that's the point I think the point is to stir up shit so we argue about all these other things and we don't realize that thing as a whole you know one big thing that affects all of us no matter where you fall ideologically it's the most it's screwed by the government it's the most damaging part of society bro it's financial oppression yeah well well you know people look at it as like oh I can't get ahead but you know look at the the idea of getting ahead generationally you know like there's very little wealth that gets transferred from generation to generation and that's the product of being financially strangled so that people reach the end of their lives and they have very little if anything left and whatever is left the government takes six months and then they get a cut of whatever is left anyway crazy bro even if it's property or something like that and to be able the average person has no idea how to even navigate that situation so they just wind up looking at it like oh it's free money yeah I might as well just take what I can get but yeah I mean that's why people can't get ahead yeah so let's get let's get into some cruising cool before we get to our headlines or did you guys see Theo Vine got into a little little altercation in Nashville I did see that you saw it yeah yeah you saw okay well let's talk about got a little throat push yeah a little never hurt nobody that's simple you know I'm saying just a little reminder sometimes you got to establish boundaries man dude you have to bro what is that with people man yeah what is that people don't know boundaries anymore at all yeah I think that's like a a a result of like the internet you know what I mean like social media and just feeling like you have access to somebody 24-7 so you see them and like they serve you people are getting man like you have you know and it's it I guess you understand it from from somebody's perspective like you're a fan you support this person they wouldn't be who they were if they didn't have the fans but you know it's like I don't work for you 24-7 for your entertainment yeah man you know yeah yeah well I'm like and they also forget too if I tell you to go away go away they they forget too like that's still a person and I'm saying it's still a human being man like you know since not the other thing people do bro is they feel entitled to all the details of your life like if there's shit that people aren't sharing on the internet there's probably a really good reason for it and it's it's probably because they don't really want to share that with you yeah personal yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah podcast with Theo Von Grabs fan everybody's a podcast I mean I think it's a I think it's a it's a universal term yeah but I think it's like I think it's like a term of endearment now I think it's like above comedian or above our podcast yeah business owner yeah it's a it's a billionaire entrepreneurs yeah it's only New York post super they call everybody a podcast yeah well they must think highly of podcast they call Oprah Winfrey a podcaster before yeah big mic one too right yeah big mic podcast yeah big mics a podcaster now not former second male you know second gentleman yeah yeah comedian popular podcast with Theo Von wasn't joking when he grabbed a man by the throat who was reportedly harassing him at a Nashville bar in a wild confrontation called on video in the footage obtained by TMZ a man holding a bouquet of golden balloons approaches Vaan who's 40 damn Vaan's 45 what's wrong with that no nothing's more I didn't think he was I didn't think he was of at that age well you have to be if that age should be that funny that's why you ain't no to this yeah yeah cutoff is like 38 yeah really yeah you don't have enough life perspective that's why your jokes don't land yeah that's what it is yeah damn no I mean he just look he looks younger I thought it was like fucking 33 maybe you know I didn't know it's 45 yeah I guess that's that's up there looking good good he's aging well that's right I am good old yeah nevermind um yeah but yeah so he was uh the man can be seen grabbing the comic shoulder as he standing with a group of friends by the bar the two men then exchange words which are an audible in the video before the past weekend podcast host loses as cool and lunges at the man let's check the clip out real quick I could tell by the start of this that dude's a douchebag from the shirt he's wearing yeah he just looks annoying that that listen I've worked bar security that guy is like I know is put that dude is in every fucking bar everywhere yeah and he's a douchebag yeah I'm sorry it's the shirt he wants to hug everybody that he doesn't know and tell you know that and hang on your shoulder I can smell the fucking vachatonic right now that's what he drinks you I can smell it that's fucking shirt god man all right here we go you you gave him two warnings man you're you saw it you know and there's probably more of course in that video you're not going to see the the 12 other times he tapped his shoulder and tried to walk in bro gave the guy two warnings give him a throats of end of story he did nothing wrong yeah I agree I think she'd or more yeah he should have pushed him harder yeah yeah that's a dude that's a dude who watched one of his comedy specials or went to one of his things and he thinks because of that he's a fucking entitled the 24 hour act yeah yeah we probably said the golden phrase to you know I don't know what a sucker dick like everybody does yeah I don't know shit bro we started off yeah and then he plays the victim after he gets fucking handled the proper way well it's funny you say that because he absolutely did Nashville police confirmed that they received a misdemeanor assault complaint at the bar on May 4th but investigators decided to take no further action well that's good what a bitch for real dude what a fucking bitch sad man yeah let's say it yeah all right man good for the old man yeah good I like it stand your ground did bro listen it's like I said a little last show like we need to go back to punch people in the face absolutely there's no boundaries anymore we get all these little dudes and weirdos and people who you know are way out of fucking lying society and because they've never been punched in the mouth like I have plenty of times and by the way every time guess what I deserve it how many times you've been punched in the mouth plenty did you deserve it every single one of them what about you yep did you deserve it yep I'll see you're lying you you think it's racism right but the point is no I've punched a lot of people in the face yeah well they deserved it they just that and dude that's real shit every dude I ever had a punch in the face they deserve it too they deserve it and you know what happens after a dude punches another dude in the face usually they end up respecting each other yeah they're like you know what bro yeah I was fucking out of line yeah sorry about that that is boundaries I shouldn't about this shirt yeah yeah like dude we don't have boundaries and it's because people have no fear and I grew up in a different era where I have a natural understanding that if I say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing and it really doesn't matter if the dudes bigger or smaller than me if the guy's around my age and I say the wrong thing I might get punched in the fucking mouth you know I'm saying and that keeps everybody in line because nobody likes to get punched in the mouth one of my good friends the author jack donovan I gave you that book the way of man yeah in in in there one of the chapters you he writes is called violence is golden and the chapter goes on to explain that violence is the universal language and that if you know you can only ask somebody so many times to stop bothering you stop doing something to you but everybody understands a punch in the face or in this case a little throat shove you know it's the true he lit right after that he didn't it didn't didn't appear like he was going back you know what I mean like no please get away thanks for your support I'm with friends right now all of these things didn't work but he understood violence and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that dude I also think there is you know people got to learn their manners right like when you see someone like that that you recognize and they're out kind of with their family or their friends or whatever dude it's it's okay it's usually okay to go up this to hey man love your shit hey dude thanks for what you're doing hey this at the other but when you hijack him for fucking 5 10 20 minutes that's that's wrong that's not something that people should be doing and there's no there's no rest that that comes off as very disrespectful you know what I'm saying be cool man yeah like dude like that wouldn't solve a lot of it like just chill out man yeah maybe you'll get a fist bump later yeah I mean like yeah yeah you know if he if he sees you give him give him a what's up man bro and give him give him a dat man he'll respect you so much more for that he know how many times he would have probably called you over dude you know I was just gonna say you know how many times I've had people come up to me in public for real and and you know I'm I'm doing I'm with people or whatever and you know they're cool and I'll buy their fucking dinner bro and I'll go over afterwards and say hey man it's sorry to get to talk to you that much but I was doing it and they're always it's always they're always cool like dude be in cool get you a long way yeah you know I'm saying but not cool gives you a thirthow yeah and yeah my opinion yeah but then anybody with notoriety will will appreciate the fact that that you wanted to acknowledge them yeah but that you respected their time very quick yes hey I love your stuff man keep rocking boom fist bump out of the way bro sometimes I buy you a drink later that's right or sometimes they might say the guy run up like hey man come here yeah come here what's your name right exactly because you at least give somebody the option you know during all the covid stuff I you know I got a little bit of experience with that where you know I sometimes I'd be 20 minutes late yeah I'd be in the airport missing a flight because somebody means well but they don't understand that hey I have personal time too and I'm I'm allowed to have it and I have a flight that works in 15 minutes and I can't hear every detail of your life about some strip search me and shit so I got I really did I've already been violated enough you know when I was when I was younger dude I used to think people were douchebags when they when they would brush you off or take they're like do that stuff and then I got to experience a little bit of it on the other side and I'm like holy fuck dude I did it yeah like it made me respect like I just think it's a lack of perspective what that's what it is because it's not like like with Theo Vaughn as famous as he is that happens to him 30 fucking times of that anywhere he goes yeah he's extremely recognizable yeah and yeah I mean he can't even go to the grocery store in piece no you know yeah there probably hasn't been a moment where he's done something simple like that by himself because it's yeah and you can tell that's what he's trying to do bro he's just trying to chill at a bar man like and I guess that's the trade you make you know for for the fame and whatever but man like it's still that's people are still human man yeah bro yeah you could just want to enjoy some time it could be somebody's birthday party who he hasn't seen in a long time and you know you got some guy gammon in your ear for 30 minutes when you haven't seen your buddy you know in five years and you're you just got some time because you've been working and he's been working and it's been so long and now you got this guy just yapping where there's fucking ridiculous shirt yeah bro I've seen that shirt well I mean who's that dude he's with which one the one in the back here I think she plays for the NFL or yeah plays for the NFL fucking this guy no that other dude that's your fucking time in it come on man don't bite me like that don't like that I'm just conversation before this you know man DJ DJs about that snow bunny oh man all right yeah enough enough uh physical violence is a good thing yep necessary yes yeah hashtag if I deserve to be punched in a face please punch me I will I will probably stop and wonder if I deserved it and if I didn't I'll probably punch you back yeah there is what it is well be cool afterwards yeah bro there's something good about being punched in a face like it kind of makes you remember like oh makes you feel alive yeah yeah I mean I would rather not do it on a regular basis yeah yeah sweet man well guys let's get into our crews for real guys if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy forseller.com you guys can find that all there more come check us out on the YouTube you guys can come follow along these headlines as we progress in the show that being said ladies and gentlemen headline number one um Trump's doing the middle east doing the little tour um there is a lot now that is coming out in these past couple of days that he's been over there man a lot a lot of good things for the country to be real um so let's talk about that Trump makes historic UAE visit as first president in nearly 20 years so he's over there this is his final stop on the middle east tour so he arrived at the United Arab Emirates for his final stop in middle east this week that in the visit that marked the first time a US president has traveled to the nation in nearly 20 years following president George W. Bush's trip in 20 in 2008 so he's over there a lot of stuff is happening um back in March UAE pledged $1.4 trillion to the United States economy over the next decade through AI infrastructure semi-conduct or energy in America of manufacturing initiatives um including a plan to nearly double uh US aluminum production by investing in a new smelter uh for the first time in 35 years um they also spent $1.4 billion on the CH-47 Chinook helicopters and F-16 fighter jet parts um so Abidabi um there's a lot man like a lot of good stuff this is i got a clip here so as Air Force one is flying into the UAE uh this was uh this was the scene he's been escorted by UAE fighter jets those are F-16s it's pretty cool I mean that's pretty sweet pretty bad actually pretty bad ass that's their F-16s that we sold them yeah yeah right i mean there are F-16s cooler yeah still are they're flying pretty good though yeah i mean that's pretty decent formation yeah um then as uh his trump arrived right off the tarmac uh again you're just seeing these royal welcomes man like never like i've never seen it for any other like you know significant world leader global front leader uh to be received like this but this is trump coming off the airplane let's check this one out yeah he's got him laughing yeah already yeah already um and then uh the parade processional into their meeting place was also captured on clip i mean they're coming out with with the full Shabang man camels horses you name it i guess that's what they patrol Matt Campbell burgers that's what they patrol with let's check one try one of them camel burgers bro you've had a camel burger no i've tried one though yeah i would do yeah i heard that show make i had a horse sandwich one time oh Andy yeah when in Europe dude that's a thing like horse me to see over there i don't know if it's delicacy but i mean they serve it yeah i know me me this is the the processional video check this out real quick we're looking at clean it looks over there yes that's why i'm moving there we're a podcast each of you to be by let's do it nobody can steal our share of the heads cut off i just like the way that that the Arabs deal with shit bro they hand us i like it really real i like it man don't fuck around you want to worry about it so so what are we thinking here as far as what well what else do you got yeah i mean i mean just other stuff i mean yeah i mean just that the reception other deals real quick i wanted to bring up one of your favorite people who decided to hop in on the the news cycle um Hillary Clinton decided to jump in and she's getting fucking destroyed yeah because people hate her she's getting destroyed yeah she's getting slammed for accusing Trump of pay for play over guitars luxury jet yeah have you seen this yeah uh like that's ironic that's just like you know when like you're wrong on something and sometimes you just like you you've got a skeleton in your closet so you choose not to like comment on something because it's like just don't comment too close to home yeah yeah i'm not gonna add my two cents on this because there's there's plenty of bullets in the chamber for me and that's that's this for her at this point i feel like who like because i okay it's not her it's whoever's handling ourselves with media right and like at this point i feel like it's almost like intentional like they're intentionally trying to destroy her her credibility because like why would you post this shit you know i'm just like you just don't post that what she post so so she got on twitter because guitar is is donating a a jet to replace Air Force one because Boeing's taking their sweet time and producing a new Air Force one they're giving them a brand new Boeing 747 free of charge okay until the new Air Force one yeah it's like a loner yeah i mean we paid for i mean it's fine if you think about it Jesus i'm sure in some way we paid for so if she decided to tweet this out oh shit dude yeah she decided to tweet this out from from a personal account Hillary Clinton's personal account knowing if someone a four hundred million dollar jet for free without expecting anything in return yeah just like nobody gives a billion dollars do you crane without accepting anything return or uh or or you know funnels out for the last 100 days of their presidential term a hundred billion dollars that doesn't ever get reported into uh NGOs for uh you know their causes so let's shut the fuck up Hillary you little fucking turd well it's it's also interesting because i mean bro why is she at home than that bro like um and this is what she's been getting destroyed for uh guitar gave the Clinton foundation a million dollar gift while Hillary Clinton was US Secretary of State without informing the State Department even though she had promised to let the agency review new or significantly increased support from foreign governance well i mean so that was fine it's okay she just mentioned she only got a million dollars that's clearly what the thing is here you know it's it's not about principles it's about the fact that she didn't get a 747 bro how are these people not in jail like all how are all these people not arrested in jay like how is Hillary Clinton even allowed a tweet the system is designed to protect them that's and they're they're very comfortable in that position because they they haven't like what's the last politician that was held accountable i can't tell you that's the point yeah right yeah that's the thing the only ones that get held accountable are the ones that you know refuse to go with uh you know play the game yeah that's true that the min des guy you know they caught the gold bars in his closet and shit like that you know i'm saying but like yeah he was he was playing the game yeah and then he got out of line so now you're in jail you know i'm saying yeah now he's in jail yeah he's going to jail that's it but like nobody that's actually doing the bad shit bro like they're still playing the game the plan the game so they're fine they're fine it's uh it's crazy this dude looks pretty cool though he looks like ollie g who is that so i'm assuming i mean if you sit next and walk a ruby i would assume that that's their equivalent so like the uh the the Department of State Secretary why do we think now in your you got a pretty good take on this i think are you will but why why do these countries that are very strongly in opposition of israel and trump has supported israel why are they treating him this way like what are the is this like i'm trying to win you over thing were the good guys are like what the fuck is actually going on here because you know i don't know it seems like the netanyahu trump is starting to get some friction and these dudes are pouring in the you know the the the sugar you know the car mules yeah so like what give him a McDonald's what do you see what do you think here is going on here you know if i if i had an interest in the area and i was a representative of one of these countries or if i was leader one of these countries i would take any opportunity i got to get closer to america and to get closer to america between israel and america you know middle eastern policy as far as the united states has gone for decades now has been dominated essentially by what israel wants and we you know we we pretty much do everything we want what that they want you know what netanyahu was in front of congress when we went for the weapons of mass destruction that weren't there you know and he urged us that we had to do that and that was a very big piece of of the equation when we went in so and that comes with that uh which cat alive yes was a bowl a bold fix lie that that wasn't mistaken intelligence that was no intelligence they said that knowing that america would would react to that um and there's plenty of other examples you know so i think that maybe you know at least if i was in that position and i saw that uh the things that have been happening between trump and netanyahu that there is some friction i would jump in on that yeah you know because it's it's your only chance of some breathing room because no matter what these countries do if america backs what israel wants that's what happens in the region yeah you know whether whether at b peacefully or not so peacefully we've we've stormed in at at israel's request every step of the way so much so that it's only our troops who do it yeah and uh and you know if i was if i was one of these guys in the area i don't i don't know the you know the dynamics of of all of these countries involved but that would be my play you know i would try to get some breathing room so that you know because it's an area with a lot of money it's an area with a lot of interest and uh you know if you're trying to run a country and you're being sort of bullied by the uh by the next door neighbor who's got the big brother you know with the f-16s and i see them fighting you know i would do that you know um i think that would be yeah it does seem like the timing is right for them to do that yeah yeah play into his ego they're playing the trump's ego for sure i mean i think part of it yeah oh he absolutely loves the absolute he absolutely does any any man that that wields power is going to have an ego that that can be decolored that's you know it's required to even be in the position yeah for sure it's and that's not and i don't think that's inherently a bad characteristic that just comes with the terror twire yeah yeah but not only do they potentially see that there's some wiggle room in the israel relation but you know this this area has been a just a hotbed for disaster and you know like trump hate trump indifferent on trump he does have the ability to kind of bring people to the table you know so maybe not even just to drive a wedge but just saying hey we're we're here and we want to be friends yeah to show that the warm welcomes all that stuff you know that shows a certain amount of respect um you know and help remember stuff like that yeah he remembers people who slight him you know he's you know from everything that i've heard i've only met him you know once or twice but he uh he remembers those things and he'll he'll play nice in public but you know any any powerful man is going to make sure that anybody who steps on his toes is going to to feel the weight of the wrath so yeah i think it's a i mean i would do it yeah and it just seems like a a pretty straightforward play what do you think the you know on the on monday or twosday show i was talking about you know how i feel like our media here because it is so heavily influenced by israel which is just a fucking fact okay you can't argue it some people will well they can i mean they can't argue it but they can try they're fucking wrong they won't make it right yeah you cannot you cannot like look it's just it's just a fact and and and trying to argue it makes you look like you're trying to hide something like it's a fact okay so i personally feel like a lot of the Arab countries and the Arab people have been misrepresented in our media for a very long time greatly so you feel that way this is this is like what we're watching right now over the past year or so is the exact same play of the islamophobia that spread after nine eleven and that was essentially weaponized against the american public it's another fear tactic are there radical muslims in the world sure absolutely there are radical everybody in the world right you know but that's not representative of most muslim people you know what we see is we see all of the hoodlums who come as refugees but these aren't real refugees these are just young military aged men you know you look at the refugees that just came over from south africa that's what real refugees look like families families men who want to work not just young military aged men from other countries who are who are funneled in by nioh so they purposely misrepresent that aspect of muslim culture in america and that is a horrible what what we're dealing with in some of these places where there's huge muslim populations of refugees are hugely problematic and you see it all throughout europe and in england you know england's been dealing with it for 20 years longer than we have um but that's not the bulk of islam in any way shape or form and the media use that in 2001 in going into afghanistan going into iraq going into all the rest of the middle east it was all based on the fear of radical islam yeah this it's it's no different than than covid it's this faceless shapeless enemy that can never be defeated or pointed out the definition can always change it's like this specter well they were creating it as they went to well how are you going to communities and fucking destroy those communities that creates the fucking hate that you're saying exists and they'll come back and write the the angry kid whose father you blew up a check for weapons that's what like not only are they creating the hatred but they're dumping the fuel on the fire too you know it's very similar to what they do just here in the united states between black and white people it's only it's on a global scale yeah it's the same play and you know what you know why because they understand that if muslims and and americans or christians ever actually fucking got along that and identified who's creating the divide in the problems there'd be a big fucking problem yeah you know I've always had I grew up you know around muslim families and you know I learned very early on that they had a tremendous amount of respect for Jesus Christ you know when they mentioned Jesus Christ they say peace be upon him which is one of the highest honors that you can give you know so there there's a tremendous amount of respect built into that religion for Christianity it's not necessarily it odds it's the extremist things but you look at who funds these extremists and it's it's no different than the bricks being dropped off during the summer of love for BLM right right you know very very little of it is truly organic you know instead of just bricks it's you know it's it's palettes of cash you know and and gold bars like they recovered in Iraq right you know those are the better the bricks I mean the ones that I see you got yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that is a good movie that's a good movie it's a good movie man yeah what's name that movie in the triple X no that's not triple X oh I don't remember the name but triple X is like I superhero I just could've got like 50 movies now yeah he really went he he became the the funny dad guy yeah yeah yeah he's like to do it as the fucking as Friday yeah yeah right exactly good in 21 jump street look he's I think he's a good I like ice cube I'm a fan yeah I'll always fuck with ice cube because he said no to the covid shot not only that bro nine million dollars for it or something he's real yeah like dude he may not he doesn't say everything everything he says I don't agree with but at least he says what he thinks I respect that yeah actually thinks yeah 100% yeah man we got jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that being said let's keep the cruise cruising we got a got some comments to check out you had some interest in commentary from our rankings from potatoes oh really mm-hmm okay it's first one from a Brock 83 96 Andy sounds like he's watching potato porn so so what I like potatoes called the cooking channel what the fuck I'm into what's wrong with that I just like a good spud that's right man shit I don't understand I'm getting you guys hating on me because I like potatoes shit huh what do you say oh man yeah well you know what I'm a fan yeah it is what it is man you also dropped a real talk yesterday I did what today yeah yesterday it came yes right um today people loved it man today is tomorrow and now yesterday that sounds like a Joe Biden quote actually does some people do but people loved it bro we got a we got a comment here from uh durks back back yep uh he says I needed this my days are always much better when Andy tells me I'm a bitch and can do better I didn't tell anybody there a bitch I just said a lot of you guys think something that isn't true like you think that meeting the standards is gonna create wealth and greatness and I'm just trying to save you like 20 years bro like just doing what you're supposed to do isn't gonna get you where you want to go you got to understand that you know championship people which make a lot of money and win and create all the things that y'all say you want they operated a different standard is is it's in the excess of what any standard around them is gonna hold them to and so we we deal with this uh with a lot of people not just young people that are young and don't get it's a lot of people believe this they think that if they show up and they do their job and you know they do what they're supposed to do and like that they're gonna end up where they want to go and bro that's that's the fucking bare minimum like that's that's called being an adult you know saying like it's just it's just is the way it is man I see a lot of people getting it wrong so I'm not saying you're a bitch if you want to be like everybody else by all means man you could do that but like don't expect all the rewards meeting a base level standard that you're expected to meet like that's not ever gonna work out well you're gonna be pissed off later so I'm just trying to save you from spending 20 years doing it the wrong way and then being like what the world fucked me over no you just didn't understand the game so it's real man I'll let go one more comment for you uh this one's from Dallas Finster maker I said uh I'm from Utah and we have a potato dish called funeral potatoes it is so damn good we got a picture of that yeah I'm about to look that up is that what it is that's funeral potato it looks like mac and cheese it looks like the mac and we do that with like cornflakes on the top bro cornflakes is a real thing yeah that's one thing you guys get one time good cornflakes you serve that up funerals or is that like a dish that you can get just I think it's if you eat too much you're gonna have a fun funeral it's great that we next shit go next shit go straight to the arteries bro yeah it looks like all gratin potatoes just cubed yeah it's like yeah it's like cheesy potatoes with cornflakes like that's like something yeah that's that's see that's why people shit I saw no no listen I could shit listen I you ever had you ever had cornflake chicken yeah yeah bro that's good it's good shit yeah it is it's macro friendly who who came up with that white people yeah yeah for sure I don't hear no more shit no it's good you know I'm saying it it was good it had nice crunch to it listen you guys get to hold back I'm just tired of hearing this we don't season our food bullshit that's a fucking lie there might be people that don't I think most no bro I don't even know where you guys get that from that is not true and you see I feel like here's the thing like all biases are based in the little reality okay you know what I'm saying it's like there has to be a little truth to it bro otherwise it wouldn't be so common to say okay I mean that's kind of true but I'm still trying to think you're like what white people don't season their food I don't know like Italian food great Spanish food great yeah Polish foods good white people playing and British food kind of sucks British food maybe that's what the food sucks they season it they just salt it into you know until it's like bro British we hydrated the those dudes over there got a lot of shit wrong they can see why we left I see why they lost yeah yeah yeah fucking people were starving fuck they probably actually have like though actually no the Irish I was got bad food too they actually have unseason food you ever get like a shepherd's pie yeah and it's just like whipped potatoes yeah yeah there you go yeah that might be where it comes from yeah because they are like the original white people yeah okay all right I yeah yeah yeah funeral potatoes though I'm I might make some yeah look good I can't argue with that comment they look great they look they do look really yeah I mean they're gonna have good food out there bro they got like seven wives you know I'm saying like somebody better make one you got a season of food oh shit man good lord guys keep cruise cruise have on suit you know so there's there's I don't I don't there's a trend happening right now I'm curious to see if you guys have been seeing it where you know I think we caught it I mean because we saw it starting maybe a few months ago where some rats were kind of jumping off the ship you know kind of telling on themselves but now it's like it's moved and progressed to a whole different level um and now you're starting to see some of these articles coming out from you know traditional left-leaning sources and they sound like Republican like I mean it's weird so I don't know if you guys been seeing it let's dive into this a little bit I have a number two reads the rampant federal fraud that doge is largely ignoring international criminal groups are stealing as much as a trillion dollars a year from US government programs according to a new report my anti-fraud firm and doges and doing anything about it so this is an NBC article which I thought it's what kind of triggered it for me and then I started looking there's a lot more stuff coming out but yet now they're you know now they want more doge you know now now there is fraud in wasting our government now we should be doing something about it it's just interesting man so this this this article came out um saying an international criminal organize uh criminal groups are stealing as much as a trillion dollars a year from US government programs but the Department of Government Efficiency has done little to address the problem according to a new report by private anti-fraud firm quote it's the government's dirty little secret this has been going uh been an ongoing effort by nation states and other criminal organizations for years said Jordan Burris vice president of source uh and I didn't uh identities management firm who's a former White House official we've been able to confirm that these coordinated attacks are pilfering government programs and doing so at a velocity that is relentless uh sources new report found that US government programs are being attacked by international criminal groups in China Russia Egypt Poland and several other nations and that international fraudsters were responsible for up to 12% of all applications for government services and loans the core problem is a failure of properly identified recipients um so that comes out but then the big one uh big big talk of the day there's a new book out um and uh everybody's addressing Biden now and how bad he was and I think this is setting up a whole different move we can talk about it here in a minute but um this is uh a New York Times article again like you're see the like they're just saying fuck it they're killing their own right now yeah I'm pretty sure they wrote a couple articles defending him they did along with Jake Tapper like they're now they're all singing you know I'm saying like they're all singing so a book points to Biden's decline and Democrats cowardice listen this is the rats jumping off the ship way too late you guys are already there already you guys are already a thousand feet under the fucking sea with people yeah anyway no I mean yeah dude uh so there's the book uh called original sin describes how mr Biden's aids quashed concerns about his age but the anonymous accounts show that many Democrats are still afraid to discuss the issue publicly um so this book's coming out um it was it's written by Jake Tapper um of CNN he's very trustworthy the individual very trustworthy but again he was one of the main fucking you know defenders of Biden the entire fucking time yeah he's trying to cover his tracks dude it's like these guys forget that everything they've said is recorded yeah he was part of this and now now you know I'm gonna write a book and that's gonna make me absolve of everything I said and did right the fuck out of here now it's crazy um but they're going into it they're covering how basically Joe Biden was running the entire white house the entire time sort of like we were all saying the whole time like everybody was saying and now they're all like like Joe was yeah oh that makes sense yeah let's uh let's let's let's give some old lady school teacher dumbass control over the whole country yeah and like you know but so you have this you have people singing but then at the same exact time you also have people trying to like completely I don't even believe that what the Jill was running yeah it was fucking Obama bro and now they're gonna try to bury Joe Biden like it was her listen these are was that was Biden all the way along Biden Biden was the runaway train so that eventually they could they could go like this and wash their hands and say he was just a confused old man that's not really what our policies were meant to do and pick it back up yeah and then right exactly because it it absolves them of of any malicious intent because they can just go oh well we just didn't know that the president was old and decrepit and senile where were the clues you know it's that plausible deniability which is like typical of any intelligence type of operation yeah you know that's that that's the cornerstone of any intelligence operation is plausible deniability you have to have something that separates you from the crime and the Joe Biden family is that because at the end of the day they got their pardons Joe's probably watching jeopardy somewhere by now jills who knows jeopardy's watching Joe yeah but that's I mean that was that was so obviously the case because the Joe Biden years we were on a runaway train everything was so obviously bad that there's no other explanation you don't make that many mistakes over and over and over again and then continue to make them as the country goes down the gutter no it was a speed ahead right it was intentional the dude they got you want to talk about pay for play yeah I mean right come on man hunter's artwork was great though yeah 500,000 piece you know like listen dude the motherfucker these people are this is a communist insurgency these people are getting paid by arch enemies that gain a lot from seeing us crumble they're intentionally making decisions the week in the country it was very obvious the entire time and now they're blaming it on he was seen out so that they can like you just said flush him down the toilet and then pick up the next chance they get and continue to go down the path yep they shake off the dust and they'll they'll try to go with all of the similar agendas that they had but they'll wrap it in something new in shiny which I just saw a poll and a OC is a OC is the front runner as the leader of the Democrat party you know so they'll bring in like 28% that's the highest yeah she had them she had an overwhelming so we're gonna put some fucking stupid socialist dumbass who's never had a job of them bartending that's the deal with Obama yeah but they they take a leader they wrap they wrap the ideas up in a new shiny wrapper and then they pull the emotional heartstrings they'll they'll do it with abortion whatever happens under Trump under abortion will give them plenty of ammunition to come back and energize that that voter base that does unfortunately turn out to vote well if he fixes the elections like he says he's gonna do it won't matter it won't matter but I mean has that happened yet no no why not why hasn't that happened you would think if you believe that the election was stolen as much as he believes it and as much as the law fair was targeted him you would believe that someone who who was in that position would make those changes immediately I got I got I got executive orders day one I have a theory on this all right because we got what about a year and a half before the next round of big elections come through yeah right I have a theory on this I may be wrong okay but that's how I see it you can't announce the play too early if he announces the play and how exactly everything's gonna be structured that gives them a year and a half to figure out how to fucking circumvent it I mean that's a that's a fair point now if he waits you know I'm saying a year and a half five months out six months out from the main elections okay this is the play of the time to try to fucking cheat it okay that that's a fair point but let me ask you this why haven't these people literally been arrested mm-hmm why not that I don't know that that that I can tell you this dude like an E and you and I have talked about this so many times because you give him less grace than I do a lot less yeah yeah for real no listen listen we've talked about this how many times hundreds hundreds of times it's pretty every single day that goes by that I don't see these things happening I'm I'm and I'm gracious dude like I understand like I I've run big companies I built big companies I understand that you know turning something around when it's very big it's like turning around a cruise ship okay it's like turning around a fucking cargo ship it takes a minute it's not like turning around a jet ski right so I have a little tolerance and understand that things take time but there has been no indication other than those two judges being arrested that there is going to be any repercussions or anybody held accountable for anything anything that has happened January 6th non holding these people for four years with no due process and then you got people arguing for due process for these these migrants who aren't even American citizens right and none of these people have been arrested none of the little lies have been exposed none of the information that was promised to be declassified has been declassified fucking nothing okay and I understand that a lot of you guys you you you you're going to support Trump no matter what and I don't disagree that he has a far better option than the other thing yeah but if we want the country to change permanently there has to be drastic action and Trump is a very smart man and so I have to say there's probably a lot that I'm not aware of you know there's things that have happened allegedly and in his first presidency where there was tremendous amounts of bloodshed that he caused that were never reported in public to hold certain people accountable for certain things in the middle east okay specifically the Las Vegas shooting all right Alex Jones did a whole fucking report on this just a day or two ago and you know you say whatever you want about Alex usually right um so but my my whole point here guys is that we can't just sit here and rally around someone who's made promises about certain things and then because we've bought into this movement ignore that those things are not being fulfilled and other things are in its place correct yeah dude and it's it's like you know I don't remember anybody voting for a mega AI database and AI healthcare and MR more and mRNA vaccines I don't know a single Trump voter who that was even a concern you know everybody voted for Trump because they wanted radical change they wanted mass deportations which were not getting we're getting they don't even report the numbers anymore they had to stop reporting the numbers because they're lower than the Obama years and in a lot of cases yeah and it's always those are facts that's not arguable yeah they report they were reporting them daily until people on Twitter started going these numbers are dog shit how are we gonna fucking how are we gonna deport a million people at 250 a day yeah right you know and that was a major cornerstone of the campaign promise election integrity was a major can't a cornerstone of the campaign promise these were the these were the nuts and bolts of why people wanted him back we watched in an election get stolen right in front of our eyes we watched for four years the consequences of that and we watched Trump for a year after the election not shut up about it and then when he started campaigning not shut shut up about it and where's that energy now well where's this that's a huge red flag that dude me too and talked about it the whole time it's hard for me to say that because like I want to be unified behind a fucking leader like I want to be able to say yeah dude fuck yeah let's go but I can't sit here and pretend I can't sit here and ignore data that's not my nature if that was in my nature I wouldn't be successful in business I have to accept the reality of what the data says and the data doesn't say anything but more of the same and it might not be as bad but it certainly isn't getting fixed that's the that's the path to a slow painful blowing out of the candle yeah or a dying of the candle the American dream is like well you know he's better than you know just like you were talking about on the real AF episode like okay congratulations the border is now you know it's not even closed we still have a border wall there's not a whole lot of mention of that but yes apprehensions at the border are lower congratulations that's your fucking job job that is your job as president is to make sure that we have a border oh there's no more men and women's sports good fucking job that is literal common sense that's like me showing up to here at work clocking in and walking up to Andy's room and say yo can I get a raise I use the minutes bathroom today yeah hey listen I really wanted to go in the women's bathroom but I know that you you know you told my not to I showed up on time yeah and I showed up on time yeah yeah so that's that's what I see a lot of on both sides of the aisle it's not just you know the Democrats have become like oh look like that's the ultimate enemy as if as if the Democrats acted alone in any of this that there there was no foreign or or even the Democrats bro it's not it's not even the Democrats it's the it's the fucking communist man like it's a whole difference like that's not even being people yeah people don't understand that communism is by it's by his nature insidious so it it it gets into things and it corrupts it very very quietly and if you're not paying attention to the details you know because people all hyped up oh yeah you know no more men and women's sports but like they're totally not talking about the fact that Palantir which is which has its origins as a CIA front company is now building a mega AI database to be able to and you look at Peter Teal I mean do the research on this guy this guy is not a good dude and he's very close to the president they're building AI networks to be able to in Peter Teal's own words paraphrasing to be able to correct behavior that's that's like minority report kind of stuff like hey you had a wrongly say correct behavior how just being able to predict what people are doing based on just collections of huge amounts of data in carol has a really good deep dive into Palantir that would give much better answers but it's it's AI database the and they're using it for medical they they want to involve AI in medical which is a fundamental how are they going to affect behavior with AI easy I mean brothers how they did it with with fucking MK ultra essentially like it's what you're seeing on the phone like it's been proven like they they fucking can trigger manic episodes they can trigger all these different things to be able to shoot up schools or fucking whatever what else can they get you what do you mean so so you're thinking like they're gonna have AI talk to people talk of minutes shit no no just the collection of information but knowing how you think yes yeah knowing everything how you think and and what you like and and well it's easy to fucking you can you don't they already have all that yeah but now it's going to be in a one I'm just saying giant database why me isn't it already I mean I can't really they were closely connected people understand they record everything you say within ear shot of your fucking yeah just when you're on your phone all the time what AI would do is make that data more usable because it organizes it in a way that they can access it very easily and and and you know social media can can influence behavior for sure so the more information and data they have about what you're looking at what you're reading what you're thinking what you're saying who you're associating with you know uh where you're showing up where you're going your your location all that stuff they can start to influence you using kind of what they already have yeah social media is a is a public influence tool at this point yeah for sure it's say it's it's kind of like progressing from oh well dude they're it's not there's no doubt about that I mean they use social proof to influence behavior you know nothing attracts crowd like a crowd right so when they when they appear when they use bot networks and fake traffic and all these things to make people appear like their opinions are popular more people are tend to join those opinions on it right I mean that's how they built all of these movements that didn't make sense over the last decade yeah right and that's the thing so it's like they know they already know what you like but now you throw a AI and they know why you like it you know I'm saying I think that's going to be the fucking pivotal piece there like that it's going to change everything yeah it is interesting and you brought up you know that Peter Till guy I think that's also another mistake that that that Trump's making I thought he was going to miss it when he when he like skipped out on using opm to like pick his cabinet members and shit like that he was hand selecting people but they he still got some like a few bad apples in that fucking circle I would have been to you know he has more bad apples than good ones for sure for sure and like I've been seeing a lot of stuff about like Pambonda even that like she she's compromise on there and like that was a close pick like that he personally chose and it's like she's controlling the Epstein release you know what I'm saying like I've been see I've been I've been I did what's his face come out and say that all the Epstein data was a Komi about to say that all that was corrupt it was was gone the lead it destroyed is what he said you know I'm saying but like so then why the fuck would she say oh I've got to know my desk that's what I'm saying dude why would you say that again none of it makes any sense we can't get a straight answer and the promise was right away yeah that we would get the Epstein files that we would understand the truth behind JFK 911 all of these things have been major events shaping well okay let's say there's things happening that we don't know about that are preventing these things from happening there should be transparency as to why they call themselves the most transparent administration ever when they handed out those little cute binders to the social media conservative influencers yeah what were those binders so nothing more redirected more redacted information that was already available so the the information that was already available like via wiki leaks and stuff like that it was that but with more redactions and then silence and the only time they they talk about it is because there is a large number of people who will not let it go who keep asking who keep bringing it up even when it's not being talked about you know but that's that's a major red flag that was a huge campaign promise we know for a fact that that was a large political and entertainment and powerful black male network that touched almost every aspect of American society from politics to entertainment to sports to everything in between and that was a promise that said we're going to release it everything and now it's well well the victims okay with nobody's asking for the victims we're asking for the names and they're like oh well what do you want us to do just publish the child porn no no I don't want you to do that at all I want you to take every single perpetrator every single person who was involved in any way shape or form put them in the deepest darkest dungeon that you can find until there are enough woodchippers for everybody all that's correct and not only that it should be broadcast live live no we don't do that kind of stuff live on YouTube I tell you what dude that brings up a whole nother topic that I could get this off track but like it seems like this child porn shit and pedophilia shit is getting worse and worse and worse and worse and it's because there's no public rep rep recussions for this like what the fuck is going on my good friend Alex Rosen he goes by I fight for kids online he has been chasing down child predators for a long time doing confrontation stuff like that the amount of places that he will turn over a binder full of evidence video recording of the confrontation of the individual with an admission and the police won't touch it why I think there's actually something going on in Missouri right now there's there's a case that he brought and the police won't touch it because of some sort of rule and regulation somewhere well I guarantee you that's not Andrew Bailey I know that tweeted it out the other day Bailey did no Alex I'll pull it up but that it is getting worse because you're right there's not I mean he's literally handing over an open and shut case in a lot of cases with an admission on camera meeting of a person trying to meet up with a young child and surprise prize Alex is a big dude he's like six something huge um handing that over to the police and not getting convictions I I would like someone to explain why that is happening it's very that's a very that's a very hard thing to reconcile outside of the conclusion that that people are in on it and it's much bigger than what we think because most states most states like you know because I can see people trying to make the argument well I mean like in those cases like the catch a predator there was no actual child victim but most states have laws that loophole that anyway it's the intent that matters you know I'm saying like that guy intended to go do this well I mean like dude look you can't tell me that there's all these guys online like this dude you're talking about Ian or like goob or like uh you know those uh jish moody or whatever's name is these dudes that go around and find these people and our our fucking government can't find them right like we're just gonna let this happen like at what point do the managers get together and start killing these motherfuckers like real talk if they did that they'd all be arrested that's I know that's the and if that doesn't tell you that there's something horribly wrong with the system in and of itself that you have clear cut crime the worst of all crimes going ignored and if citizens decide to take up arms to protect themselves that is a bigger concern for the state and the governing body then why do you think that is I think there's only one conclusion and that there's there are people protecting and allowing this to happen destabilization yeah demoralization makes it makes it allowed that is completely unacceptable by moral standards and then punish the people who stop it there's yeah and there's nothing more disruptive for an individual and thus society than sexual violence that's the if you want to create a generation of traumatized not okay individuals sexual violence has been used for years and years and years and years and years and years I mean it's it's one of the the worst weapons of war and they're doing it now right in front of your face kids being sexualized left and right on on things like Netflix and the end I know why are the parents not doing anything I mean I like dude like like like like bog goes my mind yeah I mean I'm just telling you dude like if that was your kid I know I would have to do it but like if that was if it was or no I asked a lot of tank of course his kids whatever bro like you're going in the fucking dirt dude and that's that yeah like it doesn't really matter what what happens to me I don't really care no it's it is weird man it is it is weird I don't get it to your point though because you brought this up about you know what you know you know you know I see a couple interviews of these predators too and they all say the same thing same exact thing they say you know what they say they say that they they they watch the parents they say that they have particularly the father if they think that the father is a pussy and won't do anything those are the kids they target yeah or if they don't see one yeah that's right and that's they will not fuck with some of those two things 80% of kids are yeah likely to be yeah victim well I mean that's what happens when you remove the testosterone for men intentionally for the last 25 fucking years yeah that's really you know like we got all these bitch tit fat ass mother fuckers that act like women running around you know like taking orders from everybody you know like bro it's it's I mean you could see the propaganda promoting it like look at the commercials look at the men they put in commercials they're all pear shaped they're not fit they they they they suffocate to their wives they you know yes honey I'll do this in this and this and this and then the women will openly say on the internet like hey we're tired of these fucking people and it's still to still like and then when you criticize it they're like what you you you sound like an alpha male fucking fake testosterone filled yes that's in that's correct yeah lots of testosterone reference lunch you're 500 yeah that's right yeah give or take yes you sound like a neanderthal yes like you sound like all you do is eat meat and that is that that attitude like it's an insult yeah you know like yes I do it's take it look we walk around with some fucking bitch titties my fucking shirt tucked in my belly hanging down to cover my micro pp you know what I'm saying and not be able to get a boner like that type of behavior is I mean look at going back to women and men sports I mean if you had a daughter and she was at a swim meet and she had worked her ass off for however many years to be at the top of her field and you're standing in in the stands not say shit not saying shit as a dude in a bathing suit or in a one-piece jumps into the pool and whoops your daughter not only that and you're just you're just standing there not only that I mean the fucking mother fuckers dudes in the fucking locker room with his dick hanging yeah like Riley gains on the show she's like dude that guy he's changed your locker with this fucking dick hanging out like bro what the fuck is going on how could you not protect your daughter from that how could you not protect any women from that yeah yeah it doesn't even have to be your daughter yeah but your daughter you know she's she's in there what's funny to see some dude Johnson hanging what's funny too is like they propagate this like weak man in the commercials and on television and you know you gotta be overly sensitive and and and and tune with your inner child and if you're not you're fucked up no that's called being a fucking man dude it's stoicism it's what all menly manly qualities embody this is the history of time and you could argue about it all you want but the reality is is the attraction from women to men is fucking primal it's they cannot help that okay you know it's it's vice versa it's why men are attracted to feminine women that is programmed in your DNA okay so like y'all are fucking it all up and you think it's gonna work and all you know all these women out here that are married to these shrubs like they're all unhappy they all cry they all they all complain and it's like well yeah you married a bitch you know what's like what the fuck did you think was gonna happen like it's it's the truth like it's but it's a plainly obvious truth if you state that then somehow you're the bad guy well I'll be bad guy yeah I don't care I don't care I'm always a bad guy I don't give a fuck you too DJ gets away with it because he's black man I've been getting my heat man yeah I've been well you know when you say that kind of when you say Kanye song as a banger you're probably gonna get some fucking heat dude what else because I want to bring this up to you about Trump while we're on it we uh you know like I remember when COVID was going on we were like man like why the hell would he go along with it I gotta do not recognize it and I think one of the theories that came up was like you know well there has to be something we're just not aware of right like is there a big fucking red button that the deep states willing to push if he doesn't go along with this is he you know I'm saying so like I mean that's a fair concern it's a fair argument but if he got his head blown off over it right right right right I mean this I mean they tried to assassinate this guy you know I'm saying so it's like what I think I think what we're running into man I think I believe the deep states a lot deeper and bigger than than we realize or I think that the normal person relies realizes and I think that brother has like for me looking at it objectively I feel like there has to be something else there obviously like yes it could be he's also bought and paid for he's part of it you know I'm a side out whatever you want to call him but like what's the other argument I brother has to be that to me man like it's just so big that's a fair I mean that's that's totally a fair argument you know and unfortunately you won't know we don't know but you know just following that line of logic like if you were one of these individuals doing all of this bad stuff would you be prepared to just be like you caught me yeah right like oh you've put on the shiny bracelet like no you'd be ready to burn everything down so yeah that does that does make sense you know and I think that's I think that's fair to give Trump some grace on that yeah um you know but at some point you know rubber's got to rubber's got to meet the road because my problem with that on the other side is like you know during the covid years it was like you know there's a super steep grit you know q operation and the militaries in charge and you know he scratched his butt during this picture and you know he was yeah and it was like and everybody thought that like things were under control and then 2020 comes and it's like oh wow they just stole the election and then after that it was like oh well you know Trump's still in control so it's like yeah you've got to give him a little grace but I think putting everybody's feet to the fire will reveal you know real will show itself I think the light of the flames a little bit I think that's the other piece dude is like you know Trump is still trying to to to give the constitution meaning right because when you got like these actual legal problems going on the pardons that Biden put out right like in the these activist judges that are stopping shit left and right like that's a whole different fight and he's still trying to you know respect the integrity of the office and the constitution yeah because once you step on it everybody who follows you will do the same thing you know that you said a precedent and then all of a sudden I mean that's how we wind up with things like the federal reserve right and but like and I think we're in a situation as a country but like we need it I'm cool with the dictator coming in for a minute because that's what's really going to be needed to fix this shit you're gonna have to say okay like cool that's a real constitution I respect it these people don't we gotta get these people out it's not gonna look constitutional but it's gonna be what's necessary well you know that was one of the cornerstones of western society is constitution that is our constitution yeah like but part of you know part of part of the founding principles of western society for most of western society was that there was a singular ruler those rulers though were held to a very high standard they ruled you know they our history so subverted and and you know just totally whitewashed at this point but you know we hear about like the kings and queens and and you know they they overthrew during the French revolution and and and all of this stuff and it's when you read some of the literature from back then the same forces that are in our media now and who are staring the pot and being very subversive now we're also very instrumental in igniting the flames of the French revolution and it started with you know heavy criticisms on the king and the queen um misrepresenting their wealth you know spreading lies about them you know so it's it's the same sort of stuff but western civilization was built off of the fact that there was a singular ruler and that everything they said went with the understanding that they ruled from a virtuous position and if they weren't they were held to a standard and that didn't change until the French revolution and you know they eventually came into the zars in russia again like he was when they when they killed the the last zar of russia he was beloved by the russian people that wasn't an organic revolution that wasn't because people were upset that's because there was a certain subset of people who weren't doing well because user he was outlawed all these other things were outlawed that are in city as in nature and they didn't like it so they shot him and his family in cold brood and then they brought in communism and they also brought in democracy alongside of that and democracy works with an educated population with an uneducated population it becomes a tool of oppression no different than communism yeah you know stupid people are very easily to emotionally manipulate and you can get them to vote on stupid issues while they ignore big ones it's playing what usery is most people don't know what that means usery is the loaning of money at an interest and it's a fundamentally malicious thing to do because it's economically it doesn't make sense you are not adding anything of value to the marketplace with your skill set with your work you are essentially extracting value from the marketplace and it comes with high interest loans you know obviously if you're going to barter and loan money it's not it's not necessarily the loaning of money it's the loaning of money at exorbitant interest rates by the way what communities are affected by that the most the lower incomes by far okay and what race is usually affected the most right where do we find all the payday loans and all the all right in the hood right next to the store 24.9999 percent you know 30 you know what I'm saying yeah like bro people it's interesting how people like most of history that was not allowed no there's a lot of countries throughout the entire world not just the western world that made it illegal to do so and you know and it's for good reason because it's a breeding ground for devious people because you start accumulating so much money so quickly that now you've got the ability to suppress what you don't want with money which is in most cases the truth yeah Jesus flipped over tables he was unhappy because there was money loaning going on and you know it's it's a fun we've gotten so used to it that we don't even think twice about that was my point that was my point you know that brought up in this oppressive system like you okay and and and sometimes people get upset when I say this but like if you were a slave in the south and you were born into slavery and that was all you ever knew how would you ever be able to recognize that it was right or wrong it would be very difficult yeah okay it would be like life that's right and it would be very difficult for you to imagine another way of life and when we think about the taxation system and the interest rate and the finance laws and how things are done here in this country it's it's really not that different in principle it's just a different way of presenting it and we tell it would be like saying I mean dude it just is what it is they tell you you're free but you're not fucking free and then once you see it you're an extremist you know you're a problem you're you're you're an anti-Semite you're a you know a political radical you're you're an extremist yeah and dude that's not true just because you see something and you understand that it's wrong that is wrong and it and it it causes most of the problems in our society could be traced back to this financial leverage yes money money was never currency was never meant to be a means of power it was it was it's a median of exchange it's so that if I want a first form energy drink I don't have to go cut your grass for it I can just give you something that has inherent value because we've all decided that this is a one dollar bill that I can give this to you as a store of value for the work that you put in to create this energy drink it's a bridge and it's a bridge of value yeah you could use that at your discretion at any point in the future you know you didn't have to say hey sorry I don't need my grass cut today come back tomorrow yeah you know maybe then it's not meant and usury turns money into a instrument of control well and then that you limit it you you start to hoard so much of it that people have to they fall into the cycle where everything's borrowed right I mean there's there's barely anybody in this country who isn't leveraged even if you're in a good position me just having a mortgage well it's not even just that dude it's yes you're correct very few people are in a position where they are unleveraged however even if you are unleveraged and you talk about that too much or too loud they will find a way to punish you because they feel threatened by it so so how debanking everything yeah how is that look what happened to Fuentes look how is that in um see like I name Gavin Gavin beginners they were all cut off from the from the the system of money itself they weren't allowed to spend or or utilize their own money as a way to shut them up right you know they did that to Fuentes he was an 18 year old boy it's weird too there's a there's a there's one group that I know of that uh just because they're in the group they can get 0% or interest-free loans like they don't participate yeah that's actually illegal it's weird very strange uh that is weird you got to think you'll change your my last name I'll do I mean next time I need to buy a house I just need some curls I'll be alright but um it's weird that is weird dude it's it's it's what's weird to me is how nobody nobody notices it's like and and then like to see a point that we're brought up into it like even to get point of slavery but there were people that were brought up in slavery they realized oh the shit this is wrong but it was just like what do you do about it right yeah and then you're being held back like you know the runaway slaves but you have people on the plant where are you going yeah why would you want to run you know I'm saying yeah what do you mean you know I'm saying yeah like so I mean it's like to your point man like it's it's a very corrupt way of life man it's just like there's too many people comfortable because they've accepted that this is just the way it is yeah you know I'm saying like I defer along but I was that I was that why didn't play the game I don't like credit cards I'm like remember that shit but then you realize oh you gotta play that if you don't play the game we won't help you with anything else you can get anything right you know I'm saying it's like it's a terrible thing man terrible thing guys jump in on this conversation though let us know down in the comments what you guys think let's get to our final headline man headline number three hello on three you're each breaking south Carolina trans activist arrested for threatening to assassinate representative Nancy Mace boy girl what you what you think uh wait boy girl original or or what did the what the fucking man dressed up as a woman 100% sorry okay what are their pronouns though it's man in jail that's their pronouns now we talk about accountability though I mean it's starting you know ever fucking see you don't listen whatever man you don't see women dressing up as men they're trying to do I was about to say that but that was the trans shooter in Nashville okay so that was what what 99% is this other way around causing all the fucking problems yeah weak men crazy dudes yeah weak men yeah but uh trans activists in greenville south Carolina has been arrested by state authorities after threatening to assassinate representative Nancy Mace Samuel T. Cain who went by the alias roxy was arrested by the south Carolina Samuel Roxy you know yeah you gotta work like Samantha you know I'm saying I guess more believable you know I'm saying go that's okay they don't do that's because it's not real yeah okay you just went to the trash the stripper name he could think that's what it's a fuck listen man it's a fucking fetish yeah okay that's just why you see all these these men dressed up as women dressed like little girls or having stripper names or you know like over sexualizing themselves at when they're dressed in their costumes like real women don't go out and do that like they don't run around in these outfits or dressed like you don't see grown women dressed as little fucking girls running around fucking town you don't see it dude it's it's a fucking fetish bro and I'm sorry if that hurts you fucking feelings but it's the truth it just is the truth that's okay it's exactly what it is and and people need to stop pretending like it's anything but a sick and twisted sexual fetish which hey if you got sexual fetishes that's cool just don't do that out public and don't keep it away from my kids you want to dress up like a little girl in your house and dance around the mirror and you know play poly pocket that's fine I still think that you're weird and you probably need some help but just don't do it out in public don't do it on the internet and don't bring that anywhere near my kids fetish is used to be like a very private thing yeah you know I'm saying like that's like we're kind of made them because we can like worth doing like you know people had like their little weird things that they now it's just out in the open for everybody to sit and if you know anything legal with like legal drugs yeah like they want to legalize everything like go go smoke your crack in the alley with the rest of the crap and don't do it on the sidewalk good times man how it used to be yeah it's so it's that it baffles me man and now like it's like if you don't have a fetish something's wrong with you yeah I'm saying like it is weird it's fucking weird man but yeah so this guy Samuel Theodore Roxy Kane and then they get mad they look like that and you don't fucking see him as a woman you know like you're a fucking problem like bro listen man at some point in time you got to look in the fucking mirror and be like fuck I think I'm fucked up 100 percent this is a young man that watched far too much pornography on the internet growing up 100 percent chance well that's what happens with porn's available to fucking 10 year old kids instantly yeah you know like bro how many of these fucking young men have problems even getting an erection with a woman because they've been watching porn for 15 fucking years by the time we actually meet one you know and they've they've gone so far down into the category section that they're into like we're French it yeah I mean like when I was younger we used to have to go dumpster diving and the recycling bin so that's a little man throughout his path you know we get a playboy and that was pretty good and if we got like a penthouse or a hustler it was a damn good job we were we were we were set good and that's all you saw for the next two months until he threw out some more magazines you know what I mean these kids at seven eight years old they're watching hardcore pornography right available on there on anywhere and by the time they get to whatever this thing is and then you got fucking parents that are like oh just let them be what they want to be fuck out you always knew that's your job your job is to protect them from the shit this kid's life is fucking ruined because whoever raised them just was a total fucking pussy was too bit probably too busy doing something else distracted by meaning a lot of it is a lot a lot of it's that and a lot of it is this like progressive attitude of well that's virtuous yet right well you know we got to let them discover themselves and find out who they are no dude you're not allowing that by not protecting them from that shit you know you allow them to be propagated and influenced by the media and by pornography and by all of these negative things that are designed to do exactly this they're designed to do this so you're telling me as a parent that you think that by letting them go down this road you're allowing them to discover themselves when there is an entire trillion dollar propaganda machine forcing them to become this like you're supposed to counterbalance that yeah that's why that's what literally what parenting is is making sure that the world doesn't swallow your kid whole so they arrested them yeah they are right this was his tweet that he put out I'm going to unalive representative Nancy Mace with the gun and I'm being 100% dead ass no cap one for real for real like how do you even take that seriously though like I mean I understand you have to take any of these things seriously you know what I mean but like dude looks like he's in the 80s fucking metal band yeah I was about to say it looks like he's playing like it used to be a supplement it used to be like mother fuckers just put that shit on place of fucking metal looks like a discreet head off of a bat and then went back to be a normal yeah my day that was called rock and roll yeah now he went to fucking gay fuck Ozzy Osborne's trans daughter yeah song man but you know the part that also fresh was me to though like is when these people do this shit that's a big bitch bro 632 20 okay sure if you play a fucking linebacker for the Titans bro you should just show them to practice man yeah damn man I got my boy Sam man that is a large that's a big dude I mean 632 20 I mean yeah that's good frame Roxy Samuel but the other thing that catches me like it throws me off with love your commentary on this is just like when these people do get caught you know making these threats whatever it is they always play victim or they didn't say it didn't happen because like AOC we got to bring her back in the combo she just she just got caught on this too so she the other day you know you saw that shit that happened in your old state they tried to storm the yeah yeah yeah yeah so AOC made a comment saying that there would be hell to pay if those members of congress started getting arrested for trespassing and assault things like that well AOC got confronted and completely did not say in it even though literally she's just fucking said it and she's the victim right she's a victim let's check this clip out congressman you promised hell to pay if reps Monica McIver above me does and Coleman or prosecute or charge from the crime that's right to Tom Homing Christiane I think people have been watching me drag Republicans for filming the Titans of Hut 98 across this country I think people have seen how I can be an effective advocate and how there are political consequences whether it's elections whether it's public opinion so I mean in terms of a personal threat of violence no that's crazy okay and you know you you say you say that Coleman was doing her constitutional oversight duties but she assaulted a police officer why do you think that they're above the law congresswoman why do you think that Democrats are above the law congresswoman are you afraid that they're gonna be prosecuted and found guilty of assaulting up subblock my phone then they run bro listen I'm so sick of this fucking shit with these people this uh you know I'm gonna say some wild ass shit and then pretend politically of course and then you know and then when violence does happen they celebrate it and encourage it and clap for it but then they say oh I didn't instigate it I don't know why people are doing that like and then you know they do this shit where they put their hands in front of the phone and they like mother fucker stand on what you said just stand on business yeah yeah stand on business yeah yeah it's funny how these how these things work you know it's always like oh well you know well we didn't instigate the violence but you've seen it hundreds and hundreds of times meanwhile uh myself I experienced it when the FBI called me for January 6th they had all my tweets they wanted to know what I meant by every single word of it even though that all of them were much more mild than there will be hell to pay right you know I think I you know because I was supposed to speak I spoke on January 5th and I was supposed to speak at the Capitol and I remember tweeting something out about the event saying that you know hey president trump the cavalry is coming and they wanted to know what I meant by that yeah they were gonna go support president yeah yeah right you know like right right right but it's so funny and and I'm you know I got off relatively easy I you know I got just got investigated but there's people who were locked up and part of the justification for locking them up were things that they said online yeah for four years with no four years with no job for four years with no job for those people I've been released yet so from my understanding all except a few stragglers um but I actually have a buddy and I I don't know anybody else who's experienced this or if it's long but he was um he was fighting his January 6th case forever um and his pardon is like the weirdest thing ever uh there's no signature on it it came via email you would you would think that these people would get like a piece of paper with maybe like a presidential seal on it and I don't know if that's everybody maybe because he didn't go away but he had formal charges pressed against them he was fighting them at the time of the pardon you know so weird um I don't know if they're all still locked up I know that there were some people that they weren't gonna let out because there was some violence some actual violence involved who you know but all of these people should have been let out day one no questions asked because even the violence was instigated that's been fucking proven you called me that day I know I called all my friends that were I called I called I think I called you I was watching it on TV and I'm like hey you say get the fuck out of there yeah that those are your exact words get out of there right now and I remember being like party's over because I couldn't see all I could see was on the ground no I could see what they were fucking doing right away you said that I was watching the fucking television and you were watching with me we were in jacuzzi we were on the phone we were on the we were texting with Jaco and bro they we could see on television they were opening doors letting people in like we could see it and it's because we were watching I think we're watching OAN so it's like it wasn't CNN's cover yeah it wasn't Fox cover like it was like because OAN at the point that I get the time they're for fairly new very unbiased like and they're showing like raw fucking footage different angles at the main stream as it's going on yeah I saw it I mean it was it was as soon as I got off phone with you I went from being like whoa this is awesome to being like whoa yeah whoa like it was like somebody just like turn the light switch on and I could see all of the strings and all the puppets very very easily but going back to the point you know they hammered regular citizens for this kind of stuff and these people just do it openly just yeah knowing full well that there are complete psychos who listen to them take them seriously that take them very seriously and those cycles are they you know these are like again these are like MK ultra prime candidates Sam yeah Sam I'm so good to you I mean like he's like the poster boy for an MK ultra operation you can you can play with this guy's head so easily and all he needs to do is see his favorite politician talk about you know whatever that there's going to be hell to pay and then crazy crazy roxy over here is going to 100% dead ass assassinate somebody how come we haven't heard any more about the Trump assassination in Butler I mean I think it's a fair question to ask I think there were too many questions that they couldn't answer you know well you would think Trump would want to make that known yeah you would which makes me question it more I mean you know well you and I have talked about this a million times yeah it's something like that it was like a huge news story for like two weeks and then they put out a photograph and sold a bunch of t-shirts about it and then nobody ever really talked about it again unless it's like used as a a way to absolve Trump of any wrongdoing like I hear that a lot when I criticize you know hey Trump said he's gonna do this is not that and they try to shoot him it's like okay you know so what's he not gonna do anything yeah like yeah I don't know what that's supposed to well I mean like what point that's supposed to they fucking shot me in the ear I think I would be much more I just know myself I would I would these motherfuckers be strung up dude real talk I they be their heads would be on stakes every single one of motherfuckin was that was that was that every single one of them that was involved would have their head on a fucking stake in the front of the White House right now and it would be a rotting skull and yeah and it would say for four years that's right it would leave and it would say this is what happens when you fuck around yeah that's what it would be yeah it's interesting that that was such a it was a it was such a new story that's kind of a big deal so I'm gonna take a shot at a living president it's only happened it's only happened to hand full of times you know a couple unsuccessful like Reagan yeah Reagan there was you know McKinley I think they killed McKinley um but you know JFK was shot at Teddy Roosevelt shot at these were huge things that did not go away that they're part of the part of they're part of the legend yes and part of the press now we don't even we don't even figure out how this how this guy got there how he got his guns who he is worries from what what who was he meeting bro how why why why why does this GPS go right next to an FBI building like dozens and dozens of times leading up to the like why are all of these things not talked about what happened with the stock dumps like how did that yeah what yeah do we we're gonna talk about all the stocks that were dumped that you know the the day before that you know like do nobody's talking about it weird you know one of the things I'm most surprised about is how short the collective memory is oh it's incredibly sure yeah like you know it almost makes me feel like well fuck I guess these people just don't care that's that's the beauty of a 24 hour seven day a week 365 day a year all access news news cycle entertainment cycle that it's also the product of dramatic financial hardship intentionally imposed on society because when people are too worried about how they're going to eat it's hard to pay attention to anything else yeah I mean I think the number one response I posted on Twitter a couple weeks ago I said whatever happened to that trip to Fort Knox yeah and the number one response was oh I forgot about that yeah like oh you mean all of the treasury gold you forgot about yeah how they said they were gonna go check and then they didn't and then they literally have never mentioned it again yeah you know that's just one example where things just get memory hold you know let me ask you this dude um you know you've been accused quite often and this is a little bit off the topic you got any more in this topic okay a little bit off the topic see you Rocky yeah yeah sorry about it man like I tried to fix this and they fucking got you you know you know um you know I know you very well you're one of my very best friends and I know you're not a hateful person you're fucking not you're a good dude who who has a lot of the same character traits I have which is I cannot stand to I would say we're very similar but in almost every way uh you got a nice or beard I'll give you that you know I'm saying but it is nice but uh look winner in there but yeah well you know they're getting to him a little bit you know I'm saying but you know you you you you have been accused very heavily even by the ADL of being an anti-Semite and I don't I know that's not true like that's not you don't hate entire races of people or religions of people no and you know what what do you say about that like because this is a bigger platform to talk about that and you know it bothers me as your friend that people say that shit and I know it's not fucking true you know and and I understand and I think most of our audience understands that criticizing a country is not the same as criticizing you know an entire group of people it's no different than criticizing your own country I know you know nobody has a problem when you talk shit about the Republicans or the Democrats all of a sudden you criticize Israel's you know call it what it is blowing up women and children yeah as a as a method of warfare and say hey you know because my whole thing when I first started it was you know we always hear about how America we have the moral high ground you know we're the we're the peace keepers of the world you know so so why are we killing women and children that's not it's not traditional warfare that came from that came from World War one and World War two that was essentially unheard of in most Western wars civilians were and now it's just oh well you know we flattened entire areas entire cities and the whole time we did it we were saying we weren't doing it yeah and then and then finally when the rubble pile is too big to ignore we'll say the terrorists were hiding there yeah you know and and I just you know for me a big thing is ideological consistency right you know I've always been anti war I was turned on to the issues with government during 9-11 you know I was pretty young I think I was a sophomore junior in high school at that time but I I wanted to understand how does something like this happen you know and I started to learn you know and and learned little by little and you know I saw the horrors of the Iraq war and at the at the Afghanistan war and a lot of kids I grew up with either never came home or they never came home the same physically mentally spiritually or otherwise you know so I've always been very anti war you know I I I didn't support the Ukraine war nobody called me anti-Ukrainian you know so I just learned to accept it for what it is really you know like I was also called a grandma killer yeah you know doing covid all of us were you know I was called racist during BLM you know and now it's you know now it's just the next thing um you know but the people who know me know best you know some might some of my best friends are Jewish you yeah bro do you feel like the the whole reason I was able to buy the gym you know I came up about ten thousand dollars short and one of my best friends who Jewish handed me the money and said pay me back whenever you get a chance so it's it's never about Judaism but I refuse to sit by idly and have my name attached to something as an American because that is something that I'm very proud of I am very proud of being an American I believe in the ideas and the values of America I'm all in on it in fact and the fact that my tax dollars play a part in blowing up women and children I'm just not okay with and if that comes with losing friends if that comes with losing contracts because I lost two yeah being called names then that is what it is because I'm I'm ideologically consistent into me the only thing that matters above all is the truth yeah bro the truth can't change according to to what you want it to be that day of the week truth is universal it's not it's not a subjective thing it doesn't change it doesn't ebb and flow war is bad killing women and children is bad you can't be pro this war and anti this war because your cast of characters lines up appropriately on one side and the evil you know radical terrorists that you don't know jack shit about the average American has no idea about anything in the Middle East how even any of these countries came to exist but all they know is we're American we're conservative israel's our greatest ally and I'm just not willing to go along with that why do they say that because that's very clearly not the truth it's the result of decades worth of money and propaganda you know when you ask somebody who's because they have to well no it's not just that bro they really believe it and when you ask when you say to someone okay well what have they actually done or what's the definition they can't give you they'll give you vague they'll give you the bench pure answer which is they share military intel they share military technology they share medical technology and the closest thing to a democracy in the Middle East and their their America's closest ally that's that's the best answer you'll get that's not a real answer no it's not because first of all all the technology comes from us to them back to us the money and the technology yeah like and you said this to me allies fight alongside each other they've ever fought in one single war with us going back to Vietnam and Korea I know they're bribing ships I know we've got we've got allies that barely have any troops that in all of these conflicts have sent some people boots on the ground as a show that hey we are with you we might not have much but if you're my ally I expect you to bang out with me yeah if if well and then you know also it's interesting too and you know I don't even think most Jewish people really consider this but it's also interesting how it's okay to intentionally import all different kinds of people and call call diversity the best thing ever but but they don't believe that because if they did they would be bringing in diversity in their own country I would be practicing it so I'd be practicing ethnic cleansing next door that's what I'm saying so like at some point people have to wake up and say well what they're saying is good for us they're not practicing so why are they not practicing what they say is good for us it's because it's not fucking good for us yeah okay it's it's not a good thing to import criminals from third-world countries this is not a race thing either and even just different cultures in mass well I mean do the cultures that yeah just work better okay next door neighbors let me ask you this like blended all bro let me ask oh well that's white supremacy no because there's black Americans too and there's fucking Latino Americans and and and all those are Americans so so there's a people say well you know you guys are against diversity no or not because we're all for the legal immigration process and the legal immigration process makes you do what madat doesn't it make you learn all about America and America culture and history and all those things isn't that the fucking point now z-shon didn't you have to learn all those things like when you came from India didn't you have to learn all about America and cultures and what we do here and what our history is to even become a citizen so why if if we're if we're white supremacists or whatever why is it white people black people and Latino people Asian Americans and all these other races that agree with that statement but only white people are told they're fucking white supremacists about it right and then on top of it we all support legal immigration which is the integration of people of different shades and cultures and as long as they come here and they're going to buy into our culture so the only logical conclusion that can come from that is that they're trying to intentionally ruin the kind of culture which clearly we all know they are but it's interesting to me how many people don't see that and don't understand why that's so damaging and then realize that the people that are propagating it are from a tiny little speck of a country on the other side of the fucking world that do not practice that same thing yeah and by the way I don't think most Jewish Americans are even fucking aware of that like I don't think that they're that plugged into what's going on most most people are are are horribly unaware of most things yeah even when it when it when it does kind of hit home you know what I mean um you know but that's one of the most interesting things is like you know um imagine if you went to India and you know got there whether legally or illegally and all you did when you got there was talk shit about India yeah and how much it sucks yeah and you didn't assimilate at all and and and demand that they pay for all my shit yeah and demand that they that they bow to your culture that otherwise you're a pig it yeah yeah white people are the only people who are not allowed to say whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa you're here you got to follow our rules and and guidelines and our values and our traditions because this is our this is America we made this you know and granted it's a lot more colorful and diverse than it was at one point and I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing but whites aren't allowed to say hey stop coming here and demanding that we respect your culture that's right no no but if you go anywhere else that's the way that self-author hold on hold on you know we are allowed to say that we are absolutely allowed to say that we we don't understand that the reason that we are attacked until we are big it is because they're actually trying to take our culture it's a fucking weaponization of language yes we are absolutely and we should absolutely we so many people feel like they can't because they'll be labeled a big it they'll be labeled racist it's not true that's not true and even if you are we talked about this when Billy was on the show I'm gonna say that but this is the other piece of that too though it's not it's not even just that isolation of that piece of the conversation the other thing that they did strategically very smartly on their piece but they also got all the other different cultures within America to hate America first yeah so then you're really isolated you know I'm saying like yeah go to majority majority black people I mean again we saw it with Billy bro like there's a lot of people in this country born in this country that hate this country yeah you know I'm saying so then you isolate the idea of the trait uh Patriots that Patriots has them to one group yeah you've made loving America like white exactly it's not it's not a lately a white thing at all it shouldn't be western society is the only culture that has to bet that that that is being forced and you see it all through Europe Eastern and Western Europe and you see it all through North America you see it in Canada as well that people feel and are told that they are not allowed to have a problem with with immigrants coming legal or otherwise and demanding that they don't have to assembly right that they don't have to at least follow the values and guidelines well that's because that's in their interest in against ours yeah that's that's that's I mean it's very simple like like if you go up to someone and you say hey I'm going to punch you in the fucking balls and they say well if you say that you're racist and and and then they learned to fucking just not say anything you're gonna punch when the balls as much you can yeah you know like like dude it's it's we have to understand that this is a this is weaponization and you know we have to call it for what it is I mean it is fucking racism it is racism it's not reverse racism it's fucking racism yeah and uh you know it's I've never you know my whole life I said this when Billy was on you know as a as a as a quote unquote white dude I've never been able to say hey I'm proud to be a white dude it's never it's and because of that I've never based my identity in being a white guy like I've always based my identity on who the fuck I am on the inside which personally I believe is how it should be true I think that that's how everybody should have both you can be proud of your genetics yeah there's absolutely nothing wrong being proud yeah but we're being forced to like take a position on it yes yes yeah yeah you know what I'm saying to like even exist and you know it's sad bro because I've I've I can very clearly see the anti-white bias and I struggle with like talking about it because I don't think that that's not how I see the world but I also observed it and I'm like fuck man like it's in it's an it's an interesting position yeah it's because you're right because what they what they want they don't want healthy tribalism because there's nothing wrong with healthy tribalism your white I'm white your black m India there's absolutely nothing wrong with being proud of your ancestral heritage with thinking that you like your culture the best there's absolutely nothing wrong with that there's nothing hate pull about that everybody should be proud of where they've come from and everybody should respect their ancestral heritage and want to propel that line forward in the world that's how you leave your mark on the world you leave the you leave your mark by pushing the culture and standard forward you know and that can be related to your genetics it doesn't have to just be that that's good and healthy tribalism that's how cultures flourish that's why you have diversity what makes this country well bro that's why you have so many different nobody nobody says nobody says that Japan can't be Japanese no one says that you know China shouldn't be China but and no one says Africa shouldn't be Africa no one said but when it comes to white people everybody says that that's fucking wrong yeah so like white you know like at some point we we have to say what the problem is if we want to fix it and like dude it just sucks because like yeah they're they're forcing that bad tribalist where it's I don't like it where it's I'm white I hate anybody dude's not what I'm seeing I'm seeing so much of that come around now I get I see more of that shit than I've ever seen in my entire life the algorithm is pushing it your way and it's pushing it everybody else's yeah I just don't like it man and I don't think it's right I get a lot of flack for that all the time because I'm I'm popular among from the the the farther right we'll call it and a lot of those people are white nationalists and my son is half Filipino yeah so like if if you guys don't accept that you know you're you're not saying you're not the same as me because I am still a proud white man yeah but I'm also proud to have a half white half Filipino beautiful little boy yeah and there's absolutely nothing you can do to make me feel any different yeah and that would go if he was Filipino or anything else yeah and that's again that's that good tribalism I'm proud of I'm proud that he's got what you know white ancestry I'm proud of where my grandparents came from and my parents and my great-grandparents and I'm also proud that he has a whole another aspect of his history of really cool they got great food yeah yeah yeah cool stuff great culture bro and so it's good tribalism versus bad tribalism they don't want the good they want the bad because they want the clash that comes with that yeah I I hate anything that's not exactly me yeah I really think it's important for everybody to understand that we're being highly manipulated intentionally and I I just feel like I don't want to pour into that you know the conservative movement is ripe with it even the NPC normie conservatives I mean look at how many videos that they will show and it does happen and and the statistics are there black on white crime you know that's undeniable but that doesn't really paint the whole picture but you will have a conservative accounts like I said even the normie conservative accounts will harp on race relations between black and white people because a black kid beat up a white kid yeah and instead of just looking at it for what it is like I would appreciate it that's right bro yeah and then but you have the left which will cover for it because they won't say the individual black you know because they don't want to do that but then the right will go look look look you didn't say he's black and they're missing the both sides are completely missing the the point yeah is that something playing into it yeah both sides are completely guilty of it it's frustrating dude because like you know I don't know man I've just never seen the world that way and I don't think it's right to I think it's a very low IQ thing to you know we're here in America bro like I don't know I think it's a very low IQ thing to judge some one based upon the color of their skin I think it's fucking literally ridiculous but you know when we get to a point where entire cultures are told they have no culture they don't deserve to have culture they don't you know everything about their their history is bad yeah that's not true and and dude like quite honestly I'm a very tolerant human and I'm getting the point where I'm fucking tired of hearing it yeah yeah people are very much along with that one of my most popular tweets in the past two years was I love being white yeah well I think we need all and that was just me just literally just joking around yeah but I also do love being white yeah and but the the response from from both sides got it horribly wrong there was the the right wing right you know nationalist yeah brother yeah I don't like all the way just made you know I don't post pictures with my my son for other reasons but you guys would not be happy yeah and then there's people in the left and then his eyes are a little little slanted um what's sunny down there in Florida bro the people on the left I think that's like the worst statement I could have ever said yeah when me just saying hey I like being a like I yeah which I do yeah listen dude I well you don't know any different yeah you know I'm saying like what you can't be proud of who the fuck you are you know I'm saying when you know like it is what it is uh you know we all can be proud of of of simple simply simply said that's a simple said that's what I'm trying to say nobody's gonna be fucking president yeah I think we should all I think we should honestly dude like real talk I think we should hold the people accountable who are creating the fucking intentional division we should understand that we are being intentionally propagated against each other on on a very low IQ argument which is race and I think that we all have to be disciplined and not let our emotions be manipulated to become part of the problem and instead be part of the solution and part of the solution is hey man I don't really give a fuck what color your skin is if you're cool you're cool if you're with me you're with me if you're fucking an asshole fuck you like that's how we should be looking at the world but the world is not allowing people to do that and it's it's at it's to our detriment and so I think like as emotional as it is I think it's still very important for everybody remember like we can't play into this shit bro because only bad things happen from it you know it's the manipulation of energy think about how much time and energy people spend on on that instead of focusing on or educating themselves about the bigger the overarching issues you know all the time and energy that's spent on race wars you know made up you know fabricated race wars I keep trying like I saw this shit I'm not to cut you off my other shit about the about Derek Chauvin being being oh that'll be a hot topic yeah but like it came up and it's like but old Trump's you know they're having meetings with the national guard all that it's like people are so stupid to even like if you look like bro the vast majority of the charges Derek Chauvin have were state level charges Trump can't do anything about it yeah done nothing and so like you've got people on the internet that are like intentionally pushing that narrative which is absolutely not fucking true even if Trump pardon the federal crimes Derek Chauvin's still gonna be fucking crazy for life bro like he ain't coming out you know I'm saying is but like you got people that push that narrative to stir up this fucking ratio and like there like it is it's so frustrating to see that bro because it's like it never fails like that like for whatever reason bro like it never fails it like people like that's what we resort to it all times you know I'm saying it's like and it's always at a point two where like I feel like we're moving as a as a country where we start to get that stride and come together in unity and be like yeah we're realizing who the real enemies are and they shake that fucking jar Derek Chauvin's getting part and it's like shut the fuck up man always not like he's died well I mean if we're being honest he should yeah yeah ask me if you should I say absolutely but yeah there's not a fucking chance because tampon Tim's not gonna let him out it's that's tampon Tim's decision it's not you know I'm saying like it's just so stupid man mush mouth yeah man I'll do that Roxy there's no chance that guy's not a closet homosexual oh bro come on yeah come on he's not even closet bro he's in the living room you know I'm saying like he's answering the front door I'm just saying I actually I don't need to get homosexual it's not homosexual it's it's I get pito vibes I do get pito vibes yeah and then like you watch him grab his kid and shake his kid and shit it's like bro what the fuck he's doing hand for me bro well because like I mean it's statistically like anytime the wrist form make the 90 degree bend yeah like flag that's a clue you know I'm saying I mean look I don't have a problem with people being gay or the same same but like don't pretend you're not don't say it anyway all right let's give it an end here man shit here is the bottom line be fucking cool yeah remember that you're being manipulated be proud of who you are that's right and and stick up for yourself don't let people fucking stop on your face fuck them and you know good people won't do that to you bad people will because they're trying to get something from you we're trying to take something from you so you know if you start to hear that shit stop fucking bending for it and just say hey man I ain't about that fuck off you know like that doesn't make you a fucking racist give me that makes you somebody with boundaries that you're not gonna take shit for something that someone else is trying to guilt you on a gaslight you on to get something from you like fuck off bullshit man yeah bullshit guys jumping on the conversation let's know what you guys think with that being said let's get to our final second of the show is always guys we got thumbs up or dumb as fuck and I have to bring out my nerdy side a little bit today so I apologize in advance that is what it is but this is what we bring a headline in we talk about it to get one of those two options so let's go to Purdue University okay Purdue University Purdue ECE students shatter Guinness World record for fastest puzzle cube solving robot all right now stick with me fellas all right I get it it's a little nerdy Rubik's cube oh yeah I can solve one I said is this for you Rubik's cube oh yeah why they call him a puzzle cube I think copyright or something like that you know they're not right still you talk about another problem the world man fuck you can't do anything without this another fucking lawyer is getting involved dude it's too many lawyers fucks wrong with you guys that's a rassles yeah it's too many to me lawyers but yeah so solving a Rubik's cube is a challenge for most people for a team of students from Purdue University's Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering it became an opportunity to redefine the limits of speed precision and automation and officially make history meet Purdue Bix cube a high speed robotic system that now holds the Guinness World record for fastest robot to solve a puzzle cube clocking in and a jaw-dropping 0.103 seconds that's faster than the blink of an eye nearly three times faster than the previous official records of 0.305 seconds set by Mr. B.C. Electric oh it's not possible dude I don't know I got the video yeah that's yeah let's do I'm telling you it's a picture of 0.1 second video it is wild is it like one turn off bro check this shit out so here's a clip now look they're gonna play in a slow-mo yeah I was gonna say can we slow that down a little bit watch this shit bro you should be gonna press the button solve that's bullshit bro no it's a different video huh no way bro the Rubik's cube can't even move that fast so blow the fuck apart that's what I was gonna say because there's so many turns in that point one second I mean that's probably 20 some rotations not bro that's real and no way bro if that's real that's one of the most impressive things ever yeah that's yeah that's pretty cool that's pretty cool because like it has to not only make the terms but it has to make all the turns in a almost infinitely short amount of time like you can't make a wrong one yeah well yeah if one of those turns is off it's going to extend the time bro I had to do I had to point zero zero I had to do last night on on on the call arguing with me about some shit or not on the call we were on DMs arguing with me about I asked he said uh oh bro there's no way like fucking the trades are protected from AI and robots and dude you're crazy and this really go watch that fucking video yeah you ever see the the robots that paint the rooms you ever seen the ones that do the roofs and the fucking tile yeah yes or most of your delays tile three times as fast ten times better and this is today not fucking three years from now yeah it's impressive no that's that's cool that's all right you guys hold on go back that's super impressive yeah let me I missed it I want to see the picture the guys oh this is the guys who's on you know him you know that dude so this second shift is 7-11 well those guys are too smart but the problem is they get zero poutine guaranteed I don't know guaranteed that we get in some when they're billionaires yeah yeah yeah Jeff Bezos didn't either for most of his life that's true you know you want to have a new issue that's true yeah that's pretty cool that's yeah it's also very disturbing that dude I seriously had to do to argue like passionately arguing with me he's like you really think it's coming for the trades I'm like dude it's yeah it's coming for everything brother not paying attention bro that's crazy I try to tell people this fucking you're not even going to be able to get a pizza delivery job bro I tried to tell people this years ago and they were like dude you're crazy but I'm not now it's here man yeah in the form of a Rubik's cube well we got on this I you know I mean it's pretty fucking that is bad ass just don't turn it into a weapon please you know that you know they will listen enjoy the time we got you know it's real man all right well guys you and me sir all right gonna pleasure yeah good to see you bro all right don't be a hoe shabby get a shell
