I'm so excited to get this call in my birthday too. Hey DJ's gonna give you the happy ending too. You know, all right We birthday He just volunteered. Thank you. There's a sign language it to you. Yeah, I got you bro. I got you All right, where's what's going on man? What's your question? How can how can we how can you get helped today? I'll see so I give you a little bit of background I recently became a team leader last November I worked for a well-known grocery retail store We've been doing great, you know, we've been hitting KPIs you guys carry four energy Yeah And An opportunity I've really had is But accountability with team members, you know um It's just been it's been kind of a struggle With certain team members some team members do really great Um, I feel like we have a really good team. It's just opportunities as a team leader definitely in a new team leader Having those conversations um, I tried tried some positive reinforcement um But some some team members are just really hard headed Um me being 28 a lot of my team members are older and they're 40s and 50s um I've had one team team member tell me like you know what I have a personal problem with Take-in direction from younger guys and I'm like dude honestly, that's a personal problem I'm doing my best I can as a team leader to For the others the team and get us to this common goal But that's just a big opportunity. I've had is just How to hold team members accountable and um Guide the team and in the direction that I want us to go cool. Yeah, bro. Uh first of all Leadership of people is the hardest job on the planet management leadership these things are difficult And to become effective at these things is a lifelong journey So you shouldn't be down on yourself that it's a struggle your first time doing it Um, it's it's very hard, okay? um Let's see. We're gonna want to start this Because I got a lot to say here I can very much so relate to the Older people not wanting to take you seriously and not wanting to listen You know, I started my business when I was 19 And by the time you know, I was 25 I was leading people that were in their 30s mid late 30s Uh, that didn't you know want to take me seriously because they were 10 years older than me um and unfortunately that is the mentality of Lower skill people sometimes they believe that there's some sort of seniority based around other things besides skill set They think that if they've been there a long time That they get some sort of preference or they think that because they're older they know more and these things just simply aren't The ways of the world Uh So I wouldn't pay any mind to that bro And if you have the ability to start to work people like that out You will do better and move faster with younger people For a couple reasons one they'll listen to you better Two, they're probably hungry Three they haven't grown to accept the reality of their life Meaning a lot of these guys that you're probably dealing with are in a situation where they think Man, this is as good as it's going to be so I don't really give a fuck I'm not going to listen to west tell me what I can and can't do I'm just going to do my shit and be left alone And so getting rid of those people over the course of time is important If you want to develop an effective team because those people create cancer in the in the group Um, they will undermine you They will talk shit about you when you walk away Uh, they will tell the other team members not to listen to you and that you don't know what you're talking about And that stuff will kill your ability to create a An effective offensive front with your team and so I would start making a list Of the people that you think can be saved and the people you know cannot be saved and start Working to replace those people Uh, moving forward now with all that being said um Let's focus on How do I get the team to execute with a positive attitude Um, maybe an inexperienced leader having these conversations We'll start with the group and then I'll get to the conversations Okay, with the group this is going to require you to Sit down with the group paint a detail vision of Not just what you're trying to accomplish but What will happen if you accomplishment and what that means to them in their career path So at the end of the day most people are pretty selfish which is fine but You have to understand as a leader how to utilize their selfishness and I only want to say it's selfishness I just think it's human nature right we have to look after ourselves so you have to be effective at leveraging that one and need for them to The team's benefit and the way that you do that is by understanding that they are only going to work At their best when they are inspired to be their best not motivated to be their best not commanded to be their best Inspired to be their best and the difference being is that when they are inspired to be their best That is coming from themselves. That is their own idea. That is their own conclusion I want to do great because it will lead to this And your job as a leader is to create the path and make the path understood Not just once but consistently Okay, and that would sound something like this Hey guys look I know that you think this is just another grocery job, but here's the thing It's not here's what we're trying to do long-term Here's what we have to do now and if we do this now Here's where it will lead to you Potentially upgrading your life if we win together as a team And so that needs to be a Fundamental foundation of the communication that you have between you and your team on a consistent basis when you meet with them Every single time that should be communicated in one way or another all right And then you know you mix in the other issues that need to be addressed Into that talk but everything should be Always connected back to What we're trying to accomplish as a team and what that's going to mean for them And if you do that you'll have enough of the team like you already said I've got some great people those people will get super excited and when those people get super excited Just like the negative people are a cancer the positive people will spread goodwill and inspiration throughout your team And then you know, it's important that you do the first part. I said by cutting out the bad people eventually um so that Is the gist of how you can lead a team? um Attitude wise now dude this could be a whole day I could sit with you for a whole week and go through the nuances of this But I'm giving you what I think is the cliff notes that we can answer within the time frame of this show now having those conversations and by the way you're welcome to ask any follow-up questions after this having the conversations is usually difficult Because we frame it as difficult Okay, we as a leader will say man. I got to go you know Get on to DJ because DJ is not doing his job and you need to reframe that in your mind I'm not going to get on to DJ because DJ is not doing his job I'm going to point out to DJ that DJ is not doing his job and then I'm going to make him understand What that's going to do to his vision long term? Okay, so it's it's not by force. It's by clarity That's correct so And then that way just like with the inspiration The ability to correct the path comes from inside Because it's on them. Yeah bro because people respond best to their own ideas. Okay, so our job as leadership is to say Hey, if you do a great job Here's how you do a great job If you do a great job This is what the team will do and if the team does this this is what it'll mean to you And then when they're fucking off you reverse engineer that back to hey This is what this is going to mean for you It's going to mean that you don't have a fucking place here, bro And you're going to go from thing to thing to thing and you're going to end up bitter like Tony over there Who's 55 years old and fucking hates it here, right? so The conversation That that that's the gist of the framework of the conversation, but the conversation To make it easy You have to remember that you're doing them a favor you are doing them a favor by showing them where they're messing up and How they're going to a improve and a lot of people that lead assume That people don't want to get better So when they talk to them they're very abrasive about it when in reality most people do want to get better They just don't know how to get better and they're not aware so reframing the hard talk Into a talk of I actually really care about DJ and his family dude. I don't want him to fucking lose so DJ lemon come here man. I need to talk to you Here's the deal This sucks This sucks and this sucks. I appreciate all you do here. Okay, this is fucking amazing You do great here. You do great here. You do great here But if you can't clean up these things dude We're not going to be able to win as a team and if we can't win as a team all the things that you're trying to do and within this organization will not happen they're not going to happen And look at Tony over there. He's 55 years old. It didn't just happen for him. You have to make it happen so Having a conversation that's framed You know, you've probably heard of like the positivity sandwich You know where you tell them what they did good then you tell them what they suck at and how to fix it And then you close the meeting with what they did good again and that generally works pretty good Um, forgetting people to hear the information, you know, everybody likes to be reminded and valued for the things that they do good um But You know, you have to be able to critique them and coach them And I think a lot of people that struggle with leadership and management The reason they struggle with it's so hard is because they're not realizing That our job as leaders is to develop the people and serve our people Not just to get our goal like Our team won, you know, 15 games That's that's okay You know, but if your motivation is just for yourself to win the 15 games and you're not pouring into players players aren't gonna want to work for you They're not gonna want to sweat for you. They're not gonna want to fight for you And so it's this it's this very synergistic Reality, you know, if you care about them and you help them and you're honest with them They will reciprocate that with giving their best and that's how great teams work, you know, the hardest coaches that I've ever had in my life Were actually the ones I'm most thankful for I fucking hated them at the time But when I look back at my life, I'm like fuck. I'm glad that guy was straight with me because it helped me straight now a lot faster You know, so when you learn to they care the most that's right And and dude as a leader even if it's if it's of a team sports team a charity organization Whatever and business. It's all the same. It's all the same So yeah, bro look just start reframing these conversations as you're actually helping them and you're helping their family And that will help you want to have them more But that whole I mean I just unloaded a lot of shit but this whole thing that we're talking about here Is an art and it's something that you're not going to master at 28 years old. It's you will never master it I will never master it Okay, we what we will be 70 years old and we will say fuck I still have so much to learn about being a leader and that's that's the reality of leading people But the framework is usually the same so big mission What their role is in the mission what it means for them if you win the mission of the team and then You know having the conversations with the the mindset that you're improving their skill set improving their future Improving their family which takes away the edge of confrontation and replaces it with an obligation to tell them the truth And then when you execute the conversation positive critique positive And uh, you know if it's a hard critique you might have to come back an hour later or the next day and say hey You know, you know why I fucking tell you this bro. I'm telling you this because I want you to fucking win and dude You know That's that's it that's about as quickly as I can explain something that will help you immediately So that was absolutely great Something I'm definitely going to be doing um, I'm starting I've been starting to implement more huddles with my team Um, just make sure we're on the same page have the same goal. Yeah, um, you definitely Definitely, it's definitely something I'm be doing more going how how often do you meet with them So I do a lot more one-on-ones, okay with my team members. Okay um I think a lot gets missed when I don't do huddles as well too We have a lot of small things here and then what we have walks going on Safety briefings we need to do A lot of it's kind of one-on-one and I'll do those check-ins before I want to do that. Hey, how you doing today This is what this is what our plan is gonna be for today But that's good that's good. That's good But here's when you got you have to collectively get them together if you want them to function as a team Yeah, okay, right like you got to paint the pick look dude People will execute at like a level fucking six for themselves But they'll execute a level 50 for the person next to him Okay, so if you build a cohesive team where everybody cares about the person to the left and the person to the right Like they should The execution level and the standard level arrives. So I would definitely encourage you to do more full team Breakdowns you call them huddles. That's that's yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would definitely be doing that Okay, also will do Anything else No, that'll be that's kind of really it Now yeah, it was a stressful week for sure. I had Too big back-to-back walks. Well, you know what they went they went super super good So I'm super proud of that. I think my team's doing a great job That's kind of the only real opportunity I see for myself at the moment It's just the accountability part and having those tough conversations and like you said I'm not gonna learn it definitely being a new team leader right away, but I'm a line. I'll definitely get it Yeah, bro. You listen If you keep their interests at the top of your mind If you read if you always operate as a servant leader Meaning I'm going to help improve my team's Career path. I'm going to help develop my people to be more successful It's really kind of hard to fuck up leadership. It really is. Yeah, if you're living the standard and you're doing your job And then they know that you're working to help them get better It kind of works itself out, bro, but it's got to be real. They'll know if you're fucking full. You see it Yeah, you can't just hear it. Yeah, that's real man. Yeah So yeah, don't get down on yourself, dude. This is brand new shit And it's really fucking hard. I would say out of all the aspects of things that you could do as a human being The most mentally tax taxing and hardest job that you will do. It's not you know, it's not physically demanding But it is very mentally stressful is leading other people and it's really fucking hard when you care about them, bro It's really hard. Yeah, so Yeah Sick man, we appreciate you bro. Thanks for calling in West. Yeah, hey bro. Happy birthday man. Yeah, happy birthday I think Awesome. Thank you guys. All right. Thanks brother. I hit you up a little later for that The happy ending All right, see you bro Thank you guys. Thanks bro Yeah, dude now that's a tough thing like I had to get over that too Just in my mental like you know with me leading my group that I lead right it's like Probably working at that for fucking six years. I still like heavily criticize myself if I'm doing a good job as a quote You should you know, the best leaders do that, but it takes it takes a long time The best leaders are at themselves after every mother fucking conversation they have with the team after every meeting After every fuck bro every time I give a talk I walk off the stage. What do I say? How do I do? Yeah, what do you think? What do you think? Yeah, yeah, oh you fucking crushed it. What do I say? I said I could done this. Yeah, I could have done this I already know where I fucked up when I walked off when I when I walk out of a meeting You know, so the best leaders the ones that continue to develop or ones that are at themselves and understand That when it comes to leadership, there is no finish line. You're not going to like There's always room to grow. Yeah, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, that's real man It's a balance like you have you can't be a pussy bro. You can't just sit there and be like Like you have to have that ability to say this is what the fuck we're doing Okay, like I don't want this to sound very Soft this isn't soft This is this is what the fuck we're doing This is what the team's going to do and this is what you need to do to be a part of the team and to progress here but This is happening. Yeah, right like this is the line. Yes, and it can't be like a convincing thing like Oh, well, you know, can you guys just do this for me that won't work if you guys want to do it It has to be fucking confident leadership and coaching that happens and the standard of where you're going is non-negotiable Oh, I love that man. I love it Guys, Andy, let's get question number two going and we got to write in on this one Um, guys, Andy question number two. Hi, Andy Uh, Andy, I lost my dog one month ago Uh, I know where your thoughts may have gone time to move on and stop being a fucking pussy No one more than I Want that more but I'm stuck. I have no kids. My dogs were a big part of my life This last dog had a stroke and it's just gone. We had no warning not that life always gives you that But anyway, I'm lost every morning I get up saying that I'm gonna get out and get my workout in every morning I sit like a sad sack of shit and my sadness and grief. I know grief is a mother fucking we all process it differently I just don't feel like I am as a day moves on from the morning. I get better and by the end of the day I have at least gotten into five mile walk Um, all day I get pissed at myself for wasting my morning routine with this grief I carry the anger and the sadness like a ruck sack on my back then I listen to your podcast and your tetalk post and social media And I feel like I'm really I really am that sad sack of shit That I'm that dumb fuck that you talk about who wishes for shit Not knowing you can't wish you must achieve. How do I move on from this? Didn't look tough shit man grief specifically. Well, I mean look dude It's a part of life It's unavoidable and whether it comes in the loss of a pet or a loved one or a diagnosis or like you're gonna get fucking hit bro and I think that's the that's the thing that people live Not saying this person but a lot of people live in this ignorant state of It's not gonna happen to me It's not gonna happen to me and it does happen to you and it's a fundamental reality of life There are going to be unexpected Very difficult circumstances that you are going to have to deal with which is why it's so important To develop mental fortitude and mental toughness Inside of yourself. It's not something that people are born with. It's something they develop and so When it comes specifically to going through very difficult times The answer to getting through those times is often the opposite answer of what almost everybody else will tell you Because what will everybody else tell you they will tell you Hey, take it easy man. You're going through a lot Relax process it the reality of getting past very difficult things is to take action towards Where you would like to be and you've already said that you don't like feeling like a sad sack of shit And you always sad sack of shit right now and guess what? I'm a sad sack of shit sometimes DJs a sad sack of shit sometimes Everybody is a set it's called being fucking human bro There's nothing wrong with what you're going through and to be honest I get it bro. I had I had my duck get killed last year and everybody like Well, it's just a fucking duck. Well, yeah to you not to me like to me. I don't have kids I go there every morning. I see the duck. I go there every night. I see the duck the duck gets happy when it sees me You know she follows me around she thinks like that to me That's a big deal and so I was fucked up and when my dog Oscar died in 2012 2013 he died in my fucking arms. I was seven years old. It was a day before his eighth birthday Dude, I was playing guitar I had fucking heard him breathing weird. I looked at him and I could tell he was scared shitless And he got up and he ran and tried to crawl under the bed and hide which is what dogs do when they're dying they try to hide I pick him up. I take him. He's fucking dead 10 minutes later bro Like everything was fine and then he was dead and bro that I've never gotten over that I still fucking think about that all the time still he's still the screen saver on my fucking phone. Okay We all go through hard things bro But to get out of the hard cycle We have to bite the bullet and start taking fucking action and this isn't some Plug for live harder 75 hard But this is the time when you need that kind of thing you need a mission you need a purpose You need something to accomplish and recalibrate you into someone who can make the decisions Even when they don't feel like doing the thing and that's the power of the program. Okay, we talk about The program not being a fitness program because it isn't it is you get fit as a result of the mental toughness that you have to develop along the way and so bro Real talk I would start 75 hard and I would fucking do the program and I would do it perfectly And it will be enough to force you where you cannot complete the program while you're sitting there feeling sorry And you just have to accept the fact that bro you're not gonna be the same after losing one of your Dogs bro like every time I was talking to My father-in-law about this a couple years ago and he was like He's like dude. It's got to be hard to have dogs, you know, because he's not a dog guy like they have a dog He lives out in the You know their dogs live outside and shit. They're not like a farm dog. Yeah, they're not very warm It's different than like what I grew up with about dogs And he we he was we were talking and he was like He was like, you know, it's got to be hard to have dogs man because it's like they only last 10 years And it's like losing a kid every time and I'm like yeah, that's fucking exactly what people will say. Oh, it's not the same It's not the same for you if you have kids, but if you don't have kids you're you're an asshole for saying that Yeah, right, right, you know like these motherfuckers who do this every year who say oh you fucking it's mother's day Being a dog mom doesn't count or being a dog dad doesn't count. You know how fucked up you sound saying that shit Some people that's all the fuck they have They weren't able to have kids Okay, and that's all they got and because you're a fucking douchebag You go on the internet and say some fucked up shit Anyway, we know it's not the same, but it's the same for us Okay, so don't be a fucking fuck But at the end of the day, bro, you got to step the fuck up and realize that if you continue down this path You're gonna you are gonna be a literal sack of shit You have to get yourself past these hard things and it is very real and very normal and very human to work through these things and You know, you got to take action, bro. You got to start doing things that you know take your mind off of it You got to start doing things that force you to get up and move Otherwise you can't get them done You know one of the most powerful things about 75 hard and live hard is Is that there's so much shit to do like if you fucking lay in bed till one o'clock in the afternoon, bro You ain't gonna done yeah, okay, so by default you have to Move on and um You know and then the other thing I'll tell you dude like the other thing Uh from uh one animal lover to another like Uh, I don't think people really realize how animals How important they are to me um But When I lost Oscar I didn't know what to do and we ended up getting uh Otis Our bulldog now is the best thing I ever did was to get another one for good yeah And we got him like a month later And it was the best thing I ever did dude like it's it didn't make me feel any less about Oscar But it may be like Feel good You know what i'm saying? Put your mind on something else now you got this little puppy you got potty I take care of this dude right right right right right He loves you too you know and like it's i would recommend getting another dog if if that's Um where you're at bro. So Yeah, it's hard bro. It's this is hard shit And society doesn't make it any harder because they don't try to understand people that Fuckin don't have kids. They're total fucking fucks about it I think there's something to be said to just see your point of like dude It's life things are gonna happen wouldn't you rather be able to have like come out of that Yeah, bro. That's exactly the point Okay We're competing against Billions of people on this planet and a lot of people will say oh there's not you're not competing against anybody Accept your version of yourself yesterday. Well those people are broke. Okay. Here's the reality If you want to win if you want to become create build anything real you have to learn How to operate through the hard times that is the separator between people who win and people who fucking don't Okay, people who don't win every time they get a hang nail They say oh I need three days off and I'm fucking here a therapy to get better That's those people lose because anything that happens along the way throws them off track Okay, if you could become the kind of person that it doesn't matter what gets thrown your way no matter how hard it is No matter how frustrating it is no matter how Pissed off you are or any of these shit If you can operate and execute in those times you are executing at at least Double the rate of everybody else and if you understand math Like I'm sure you do you will know that double the execution put you Twice as far ahead as everybody else if everybody else runs two fucking laps and you're running for Who's gonna get where they want to go faster? Okay, and the difference between this is being able to execute when you don't fucking feel like it It makes you legitimately Unbeatable so it's a very important that when things happen that are hard Which we all have to deal with It's very important That you don't let it consume your life to the point where it throws you completely off track Because that's what most people do and you're not trying to be most people so This is a tremendous opportunity and as cold-hearted as that may sound now because that's what people are gonna call I don't care. Yeah, it's reality, bro. This isn't called Be nice. This isn't called idealism. This is called real as fuck and the reality is is when bad things happen like they happen to all of us Most people get thrown off track very very far off track Okay, and then to create the momentum again, it could take years Okay, so one fucking tragedy happens and then it costs you five years of your life is that really worth it For something that happens to literally everybody. It's not Okay, so if you can become the kind of person that will execute no matter what's going on around them You can't be fucking beat bro. It's it's literally impossible to be a person like that. You can't beat him Okay, and and what it here's what happens When you start to learn that you can do this and you start to learn that you can execute versus The other people that can't you know like when you're out in the middle of you know the 18 inches of snow when it's when it's minus fucking 20 degrees and you're doing shit and no one else can do it instills and builds a level of self-belief and confidence in yourself That cannot be fucked with it cannot be fucked with it does it fucking matter what the world throws at you You are still going to win imagine feeling like that Imagine knowing no matter what the fuck happens. I'm gonna still win And that's the kind of confidence that pushing through the hard times creates Yes, I'm probably right there man. Yeah, absolutely man. I love it. Let's get a we got one final question another call in Vince let's get a boy Vince on the phone. Okay, that's a good strong name Vince Vince Let's give Vince a call Oh This is Vince Vince.

How long you been doing that Four years by myself now. Oh, that's awesome, bro. How old are you? I'm 37 young 37. Oh, shit. Okay young voice. Hey, dude. He is young 37 still young bro. That's true Listen at 30 fucking six. I was 350 pounds didn't know shit Okay, I got I got I mean, I did do the same things as I was 19. I was doing okay, but I think I evolved yeah Evolution there. Yeah, for sure. So what's up, bro. What can we help you with? Oh, well, I am currently booked into the next year and I'm building 580 linear feet of fence by myself right now I'm sure they can't get people to show up and wake up to their long clocks or whatever excuse they're gonna have And I'm trying to find a way to incentive incentivize and find some good employees Well, did you have employees before? What's up? Have you had employees before? I've had a couple longest one lasted about three months. Okay, and What happened in that situation explain to me your general experience with employees thus far Um, I've had a couple pretty decent ones that would show up and we're pretty timely and pretty decent but The last one I asked him this he was having a bad day already with his wife and I knew that but I asked him to like shovel Three shovel folds worth a dirt out of some holes and he said he wasn't gonna do it and squared up And I told him he needed to go home So he quit quit over that. I wasn't trying to get him to quit or anything I was just you're not gonna listen to me and you're having Tables at home you need to go take care of that. Yeah, um the other guy just kind of ghosted me Okay, after a while and where where do you live? I Live in New Year's on him. Is that a rural place or a what is I don't know where that is It's a little south of Prescott Yeah, I still don't know where fuck that is It's about an hour north of Phoenix Okay So somewhat rural-ish area area yes, okay All right Well How are you paying those people were you paying them fair? I try to start my guys at 20 an hour, okay, and what do people get Normally in that area for that kind of work Other posts that I've seen from other contactors are starting at about 18 to 20, okay, and then Okay, lead guy would run at about 30, okay And how to retire by working for me. I think him $25 an hour. He was pretty good, but he's having some health issues, so okay Um How have you tried to recruit employees so far? Oh And all I said I haven't tried really hard too hard usually it's just like the Facebook post of Basically what we're doing jobs we do and the hourly start, okay When you when you have employees Are they expected to just show up clock in do the work go home Pretty much yeah, and then sometimes I'll even depend on where they live. I'll try to meet them to pick them up because So my job for an hour away, so okay, I try to pick them up to take them there. Okay All right Here's the deal bro you're graduating from the The Calis-Tanned worker to actually operating a small company which will likely move into a bigger company Uh, is that your goal? Is your goal to expand the company or is your goal to kind of just You do the work and have three or four dues to help you with it That's kind of where um look into via i'll i do enjoy doing the work I don't want to not looking to get huge. I really like one-on-one with my customers and Being there to do the work. Okay, so I was thinking that maybe three guys and then ultimately we do some more general contracting subcontractor type work and maybe build in some homes eventually. Okay. All right look you Any For you to Get where you're trying to go from where you are You are going to have to treat it as an aggressive building of a company. Okay Here's what I mean by that Business is ultra competitive. It's the most competitive fucking thing in the world. It's more competitive than any sport than any game Than anything. It's the most competitive thing and When Say In fit so i'm in the fitness industry as you know, so people will say shit like this They'll say i want to start working out But i don't want to look like you know Arnold Schwarzenegger or something like that And it's like bro you could work out every mother fucking day all fucking day for your entire life You could take every steroid you could take every supplement and you'll never fucking look like that okay And when business owners say Hey, I just kind of want to maintain where i'm at That creates a very comfortable attitude Amongst your company which Makes it very hard to build an effective team For what you're trying to get to so what i'm saying here is that you have to Go at this every single day as if you are trying to build the best Construction company ever and that's the effort that it's going to take for you to survive long term That's reality So you have to flip your mindset from i just want to do the work you can do the work You can have three guys but the attitude of what you need to have cannot be Hey, I'm good where i'm at and the reason is because you can't get anybody inspired to want to work for you With that attitude For you to get where you're trying to go where you're looking to have two or three guys Four guys and then eventually maybe a dozen guys that want to build homes all right you're gonna have to to frame it And build it as a real company and you're going through a process that Is very critical to your future in this business Let me explain to you what that is you can either say to yourself right now Well, I'm good where I'm at. I just need a helper all right, and you'll continue to have this situation Happened over and over again right they're gonna show up They're gonna get pissed off one day because they're wifey out at them and they're gonna say I'll kick your ass We make me move the dirt and you're gonna have to deal with this shit over and over again you don't want to deal with that shit so You have to say to the guys You have to say when you look to hire someone You've got to be able to say to him look. This is what I'm doing This is what I have done. I've worked as a GC on my own for the last four years my goal for this is to build a Company that does this and this and this we want to build homes. We're gonna get there I'm booked out all the way till next year with these kind of jobs But once we get through this we're gonna start moving towards that And you have to get it's funny because we I just answered a question right before this is very much Similar to what you're asking The point here is that you have to inspire these people to work on the big vision That you are creating for the company all right what's going to be the differentiator between someone who shows up for 20 bucks an hour And then eventually tells you to each shit because they're having a bad day and the person who Values their position in your company is going to be what's on the line for them in the future All right, so you are going to have to get really good The first thing you're gonna have to do is define What exactly do I want to do and it can't be like this You know, I think I'd like to have three dudes and you know, I'd like to Still do that that that's not a certain vision people won't believe in that Okay, you've got to give them certainty. I've been doing this four years. I love doing this This is what I love about it. This is what what I'm going to do and I'm looking to build this with people like you But this is what's going to be expected and that allows you to instead to say to them Hey, man, I need you to show up and dig some fucking holes To say hey Look bro, if you don't dig those holes, we're never gonna get where to fuck we want to go You're never gonna get to this place, okay, so You are going through a transitionary period of leadership. You're leading yourself You're able to get up every day. You're able to do the work You're able to build defenses and build the decks and do the repairs and do the additions But I want to do this at a bigger scale and so you know This is less about you attracting people and more about you getting them committed once they're there I don't think it's going to be very hard to find people that want to be a part of a mission like this especially with the Emergence of AI and technology where like dude a lot of the jobs are just drying up So if you're able to say to a young man or a young woman hey You come here. I'm gonna teach you this. I'm gonna teach you that you're gonna know how to do these things You're gonna have job security. We're gonna build one of the greatest home builders in Arizona and You know that is something to believe in because remember bro There's a big difference between someone showing up for $20 an hour To dig holes and help you and someone who's showing up for $20 an hour to help you build the best company. It's ever fucking existed okay, and You have to learn how to present that properly. So I need you to get clear on your vision very clear no matter what it is It doesn't have to be this huge vision either. It can be hey. I want to be a small boutique Custom home builder that builds amazing shit and here's the opportunity for you in that plan if you help me do this and you're you know and You lay out the expectations of what that is Um, so go ahead. That's what I was thinking the other day is I kind of haven't been I've been looking at him as employees instead of like the way I look at my customers and trying to help my customers and build what they want and need and meet there or go above their expectations I want to do that now for my employees and their families brother if I can do that for two or three of them and we can just crush it I'd be happy with that, but yeah, but you're saying No, you're hitting go for a hundred brother. You're hitting on the fucking you're hitting the nail on the head there bro How how you care about your employees is how they will care about your customers Okay, if you care about them and their families and by the way that's not letting them have seven days off because they stubbed their fucking toe That's reminding them hey bro We got this to do because we're building this and that's what's going to help your fucking family and it's basically becoming a coach bro for a bunch of young people and there's um I think that the fact that you thought of that on your own Shows me that you're on the right track anyway, and let me tell you something else dude and this is just This is the truth from someone who's been doing something and become very Financially successful personally I fucking love seeing my people grow develop earn more money succeed have families That is the coolest part of my entire existence. There's no question and it's if I think it's the most rewarding part of entrepreneurship that Kind of gets left in the fucking trash by most leaders And so you sound like you're a pretty good dude bro like it sounds like you you do care about people and You know not ever talking to you before I don't want to act like I know you shit, but like you You sound like a good dude, and I I think you sound like the kind of person that would get a lot of fulfillment and satisfaction Not just about you know what you built, but how you built it and who you built it with and And dude like that's just a framework shift from you saying You know I need you show like I said I need you to show up and move these boards to I need to show up and move these boards so that we can build these this amazing company And there's a there's a famous analogy And I can't remember what book it was that I read but I read it very early on and I cannot remember the analogy But exactly but the basically the analogy was this There's a big difference Uh in a stone mason who Has to build and it's funny because you're building 5,000 feet offense The the analogy they use is there is a massive difference between a stone mason who is told that they have to build a five mile three foot high wall And the stone mason who's told we're going to build the most beautiful cathedral that's ever existed in human history The person who is Inspired by the bigger vision is going to do better work. They're going to care more They're going to be more invested. You're going to like being around them more They're going to value their career more and they're probably not going to try to square up with you when you told them to do something real simple You know what I'm saying because they value what we're building together. You know what I mean? So it's tough, bro leadership and and where you're at in your business is the toughest part of business When you're going from working and doing the work To work, you know, you're working in the business To then shifting to working on the business meaning handling leads handling your employees Handling all the shit that goes with it you're marketing all of this shit That's it that's a transition that that is difficult for people. It was very difficult for me I've never met someone who was like oh yeah, that was fucking so easy to do. It's just You have to do it if you're going to go from where you are otherwise You're basically going to be doing what you do forever. So you have to look at it like this dude You know lawyers go to law school, right? That doesn't mean they know how to operate a business This is why so many lawyers switch professions after they graduate law school Because they don't know how to run a business This is why so many doctors go broke trying to run businesses. They they they go out They get their medical degree. They make a little money. They start opening these fucking restaurants or all this other shit They don't know about and they lose and the reality of what you've done here, dude is you've went to school for construction You I don't know if you actually went to school for it, but you did it in the real world. You know what you're an expert all right and you have to understand that your expertise now has to be trained and shifted in a different direction towards actually learning how to run a business running a business is its own skill set aside from You know driving nails you know what I'm saying and if you look at it like that You'll be much more successful like my skill set is great over here at doing the actual labor and I can build great Staircases and I'm an artist with my fences That doesn't mean shit when it comes to running a business and so you have to start looking at That as a complete different skill set that you're you're a brand new rookie at because up until now You haven't really been running a company and now you have to so I would start consuming everything that you can about how to do this and learning Everything that you can about how to structure it getting around other construction guys who are who have done these things You know maybe talking to them getting some mentorship for some guys who are where you want to be in your specific Industry these are all things that will help you a lot brother and and And dude, you know, I have no doubts that you're going to be able to do everything that you want to do here. It's just a it's just a little flip of Perspective switch that you need to make on where your role is Okay, yeah, so like another kind of question I had is um I want to after I started thinking about more towards than for ease and obviously the construction world We end up pretty crippled when we're older is implementing like Trying to pay or help pay for their supplements or like higher-practor adjustments once a month or Massages like every quarter Stuff to try to help with their health like yeah, man even boot gets certificates Soon should I try to implement something like that? I should I do right? Well worked into it. It depends on what you can afford to do bro But here's what you here's what you can afford to do For free and this is the most important thing that you can do I would try to organize group activities that are difficult With you and the three or four other guys Like doing an outdoor workout or you know Meeting up on a Saturday and trying to do a run even if some of the dudes are fat You know like the mutual suffering Creates teamwork bonds all right, and if you think of any great team that's ever existed The reason that they're great is because they've all witnessed each other Work sweat bleed and suffer and be bad at shit together and that creates an unbreakable team bond And it costs nothing. It's it's one workout a month You know where you go out and you're fucking you getting the park or wherever it is that you guys do and you run sprints and then You know you do you do some push ups and shit and um instead of just sitting on a tailgate drinking some beer Yeah, that doesn't bond people the way that people think it that's that's a different kind of bond like there is a bond to that It's been official but a real fucking like I'm gonna pick this mother fucker up if he's on the ground That comes from mutual suffering and so I like all those ideas you have I think that's great. I think that would help for sure But I don't think that's gonna replace. I'm I'm not saying anything. I know it won't replace The work that it's going to take to bond people Um, what you can do for fucking free bro. So I think those are good ideas though for sure Okay, you shared it. Yeah brother Well, thanks. Appreciate you calling in brother Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate all your guys the insight. I've been listening to you guys for a couple years now So it's cool to actually talk to you guys. Thank you for everything you do. Uh, you're welcome, bro Thank you for going out there and doing the best that you can do All right, guys have a weekend. You two, bro Yeah, I was thinking stuff. I've heard you say this a few times. You know people always come to 1p and they're like Man, where'd you guys find all these good people? Yeah, like I picked them off the fucking ploy tree Yeah, right, right. You got to build them. Yeah, you got to be there. It has to be some investment into that And then once the culture starts to once like it starts to materialize and gel The culture becomes the filter. Mm-hmm. Okay. So like once then those good people do come. Yeah. Yeah Good people it attracts good people But it also filters out the people that won't make it here. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? So In the beginning it's it's a little more difficult and And when it gets bigger it becomes like an organism That is self-sustaining for the most part you still have to pour a lot of Effort into it, but it's just a little bit different way, but where Vince is You know, that's a difficult situation in any small business owners Career, you know, they're good at their skill set, but they don't quite understand how to operate a team or the business I give him a lot of fucking credit for you know, the fact that he's like well, I was thinking you know I need to look at him like this. That's exactly right exactly right and um, you know my goal For a long time I ran businesses like he's kind of running them now where I just wanted you to show up Do your shit go to fuck home and when I When I started to understand And Here's what made me understand it You are asking that person To trade a large amount of their life for something It's got to be bigger than money You see what I'm saying and The great thing about this is that People love building big ass shit The bigger the thing the harder the thing the more inspired people are to take it on and um The greatest part of my life a lot of people think like oh, it's probably that he gets to drive these cool cars and fly private planes and know all these Fucking, you know people and shit like yeah, that's all cool The coolest fucking part of my life is being able to say That we built something that not only benefited our customers, but allowed our team members To have a great life for feel they go yeah, it's the fucking coolest thing ever dude. Yeah, and it's the thing I'm most proud of You know, it's not it's not it's you know all the other shit is cool. I'm not gonna lie. Okay. Yeah, it's fucking cool It's cool. It's cool. It's cool But what the coolest thing is is that when you when you see The people who have traded their time For this big vision winning as well. That's that's the shit. Yeah, bro New house new car. Yes. That's just fucking awesome, bro. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. That's shit ever Yeah, that's real man. I love it man guys Andy. That was three. Yeah, well they went hell of a way to start a Monday Yeah, all right. Let's get out there. Let's make some shit happen. We'll see you guys tomorrow With a little cruise the internet action and don't be a whole
