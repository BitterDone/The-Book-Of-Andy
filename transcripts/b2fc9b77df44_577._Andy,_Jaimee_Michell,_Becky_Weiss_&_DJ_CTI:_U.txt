What is up guys, it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate about it lies the fitness and delusions of modern society and welcome to Mother Freakin' Reality. I gotta say a different now because YouTube keeps digging us for the profanity. So we have to change it. I know it's not as cool, but it is what it is. Today we have Andy and DJ crews the mother loving internet. This is so bad. It's so bad. This is so wrong. I hate you YouTube. It's wrong on so many levels. All right. So this is CTI. That's what crews the internet stands for. We put up topics on the screen. We speculate on what's true. We speculate on what's not true. And then we talk about how we the people can be the solution to what's going on in the world today. This is a personal development business entrepreneurship podcast at its core. So when you come on here, it's not always going to be current events like it is today. We're going to have personal development. We're going to have entrepreneurship. We're going to have business. We have this other show called Q&A F. That's where you submit the questions and we give you the answers. Now you can submit your questions a couple of different ways. The first way is guys, you can email those questions into ask Andy at Andy for solo.com or you can go on YouTube now that we're on YouTube and go under the Q&A F episodes and ask your questions right there in the comments. Don't forget to click subscribe. We also have real talk. Real talk is five to 20 minutes of me just giving you some real talk. That's just what I think needs to be said. And then we have 75 hard versus for those of you that don't know, I am the creator of 75 hard. It is the world's best mental toughness training program. And it will never be beat ever because it's amazing. So it's free too. And that's the best thing about it. So if you go to episode 208 on the audio feed, you can get that for free. But we have this episode called 75 hard versus where people come on, talk about how they were before 75 hard, how they are after and how you can make those changes as well. And then other times we have full length full length is just where someone comes in and we have a conversation, kind of like what you see on most other podcasts. So for all of this stuff, you can go to the website and you can see the link on the link. And you can go to the podcast. So for all of this stuff, we have this thing called the fee. We're going to ask you to pay the fee. The fee is very simple. Tell a friend, all right? If we provide value, if we do a good job, we make you think, if we make your laugh, if we make you have a new perspective, if we give you some information that helps you win, share the show. I don't take ads on the show. You'll notice that you're not going to hear 30 minutes of me reading some bullshit from some company that's paying me to pretend like I like something. I don't do that. I make money in real life with real companies, so I don't have to do that. And that means I don't have to listen to anything that they say. And so I give you the real AF. That's what the show is called if you didn't know. So in exchange for that, I just ask that you help share the show. So when we say pay the fee, that's what that means. It means post the show, tell some people about the show, talk about the show. It means share the show. So don't be a hoe. Share the show. All right. So today we have CTI. And as you guys know, we always have a good time doing CTI. And sometimes we have guests. And today we have some amazing guests that we have been blessed with their presence on this CTI. We have Jamie from Gaze Against Groomers. Hi, how are you? Good. Thanks for having me. It's good to have you here. And we also have Becky, who's from first form. And also Gaze Against Groomers. Here we are. Yeah. So I'm fortunate enough to get that work with Becky every single day. She's one of my favorite people in the world. And Jamie stopped in. She came in from Florida. Milwaukee. Everybody thinks I live in Florida. Everybody thinks that. No, I'm in Milwaukee. Okay, she came in from Milwaukee. They got Florida people up there. So just like the Midwest. But here they are. So welcome. Thanks for having me. Yeah. First of all, I love being here. This place that you have created is beautiful. Thank you. Yeah, everybody should only be so lucky to step foot in here. But I'm honored to be here. A big fan of the show, big fan of everything you've done. I actually do want to try 75 hard. I was just telling Becky that I'm thinking about it. I'm a little nervous, but I do want to get into it. One does not simply try. Right. Do. It takes full commitment. Right. Yeah. So when you're ready. That's Yoda. When you're ready, we just go. Yeah, we do it. We'll do it. So a lot of you guys are probably familiar with Gaze Against Groomers. We've seen them come to popularity over the last couple of years. Jamie's been on on MSM many, many times talking about what they do. But for the people who haven't heard or understand what you do. Bring them up to speed. Yeah. So Gaze Against Groomers is a nonprofit organization comprised of all people that are in the community. LGBT people. And we are fighting back against the sexualistic community. And we are fighting back against the sexualization and indoctrination and Medicalization of youth that is being pushed in our name essentially. You know, you see this. It's just an onslaught attack on the children. And they are using us as a shield to do it. And to evade criticism and to silence and intimidate people. So I felt the need to create, you know, every gay person I know in my life and even trans people, I knew that they weren't on board with this. I certainly was not never have been, have been absolutely disgusted by what I've been seeing. But we had no really unified voice to push back against this. We were individually, but there was no cohesive message and group. So I saw the need for that. And I created it. And I didn't really know what I was getting myself into. It kind of took on a life of its own very, very quickly. I think that that just goes to show how much our voices were being raised. How much our voices were needed to help fight this battle. Because, you know, voices like yours and just straight people in general parents. Sadly, you know, they write you off. They instantly call you a homophobic, transphobic bigot. They're even doing that to us now. It doesn't stick quite the same way. They label us an anti-LGBT hate group, even though we're all LGBT ourselves. So it's quite silly. But essentially that's what we're doing. We have, I think, over 800,000 followers across social media now, all organic. Gays against rumors. I started at June of 2022. So, yeah, we're growing really fast. And it's awesome. What inspired you to step up and do that? Because I have been talking for a number of years about the need for people in the gay community to stand up and defend against the infiltration of, you know, the sexual predators that are hiding inside the, particularly the trans movement. Right. Let's be real, okay? And that's not an anti-trans statement. I'm just saying that's where they hide. That's where they go. And we can see it very clearly in things like, you know, grown man dressing up as women and going to read books to little kids with no underwear on. Or just in general. What was the thing? Because you've taken a lot of heat. You've had to put up a lot of stuff. A lot of things you didn't really have to do. So what was it that made you step up and do this? Well, for those that know me and have known of me for a while, prior to Gays against rumors, I had an account. I still have it called the gay who strayed. And I was kind of doing that since 2017. And it was basically me being a right wing lesbian. You know, so I've always kind of been pushing against the grain. It's just my nature even before that in my personal life. Like, I just, that's what I do. I don't know. It's my nature. But so I had built up this following. I had like 250,000 followers on that account. And I was getting really tired of the politics. Like, it was just the same thing every day. Posting memes, posting news. Nothing was really changing. And at that same time where I was feeling really tired of that, you know, all these videos started coming out of these drag shows with kids and seeing the curriculum in the schools and seeing these young children being put on puberty blockers and having their healthy body parts amputated. And I was just like one day I was like, you know what, I have this platform. I can't sit by and not try and do something with it just to fight this. Because I'm in the perfect position to do that, you know. And there wasn't anything. So the one, I'll never forget it was the one video that really pushed me over the edge to actually do it. It was the one, I think it was in Dallas. That drag show with the kids walking down the runway and behind him. Was that pink neon sign that said it's not like it's self. I saw that and I created the account. I came up with the name. I created the account. And that's how it started. Well, I think, I think there's a true real danger. When people talk about violence against that community, right, being lumped in. And then I think the hard line that most parents and just regular people would take against the grooming of our children. It's like there is a danger there when it is all being lumped into. Yes. Right against people who are in the community. And so it's like, there has to be some type of differentiation going on. So it's like, because obviously generalizing it is not okay. No, it's not all gay people. Everybody understands that. But it's like, how do you think everybody does understand? No, they don't. And that's what's happening. The backlash against all of us is growing. And so I've always said since day one, like Gays Against Grumer's mission is first and foremost to save these kids, protect the kids. But we also are here to help ourselves and save ourselves because the backlash against us is growing. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why. But people are assuming that all of us are on board with this. And that's why, you know, Gays Against Grumer's is so important for many reasons. And that is a main one. We're worried about that. You know, we just achieved our equal rights, which was a just fight. We fought for that. We got it in 2015 nationally, you know, federally. And as far as I'm concerned, we should have gone home and packed it up. But not even a decade later, now we're here. And, you know, we're losing our good standing in society because of these predators and pedophiles and disgusting people. And I want to say it's also, you know, these industries, every major industry in this country is pushing it as well. It's not just people, you know, there's like a fringed minority in our community that are disgusting and actually are on board with this. But you look, it's the medical industry. It's the education system. It's the White House. It's the media. It's corporations. It's everything is pushing it. But they're using us to do it. So we're being, you know, we're all being lumped in with it. So I had to draw a big red line. And I was like, no way. I'm not going to let this continue. That's what got me to start speaking about it too. You know, I started recognizing that like, because like, you know, with the, the where I stand, you know, I'm exposed to people on all parts of the spectrum politically from the far left to the far right. And I started noticing the backlash starting to boil, right? Like I started hearing people who three or four years ago, what does not say anything about gay people starting to like have biases against the gay community. And that's what started to get me to speak up about it. And that's why I started saying things like, hey, you guys in the gay community better wake up because the backlash is going to come and swing for you guys when it's not you guys. And so I think it's great that you, yeah, I think it's great that you stepped up and did that. You know, a lot of people can see the different, the, they can differentiate, but a lot of people don't, you know, they just don't think that much about it. They just see rainbow plastered everywhere going after kids. And they're like, so, you know, it's hard to even blame people that the, you know, for thinking is for starting to think more negatively about us. Just because that's all you see. Yeah, you see the rainbow shoved in your face everywhere you go. And then every time there isn't a quote unquote rainbow event, it's not like it was 10 years ago where gay people are walking down the street arm and arm with straight people saying, hey, we just want to be treated equal. Now it's people in BDSM gear or this fetish gear walking down the street with kids with their dick hanging out like this shit's and it's got insane. You know, we got to talk about the parents too. Yeah, like why are parents, but I try and tell them like, please, this is not what you think it is anymore. But they're like you signaling like they take their kids to these events because they think that's how they show their support for the gay community. But like, yeah, we don't want anything to do with that because it is such a fringe minority of the gay community. But I think most people are like me and Jamie here, like even whenever I heard about gays against groomers, because my mom told me about gays against groomers. And I was like, I don't want to be associated with a bunch of gay people. Like, I am gay people. I'm like, no, no, no, no. And then I looked and I was like, oh, other people like me actually exist. Yeah, normal people that are actually also gay. Yes, right. Like I didn't know that they were out there identity of the world. Right. I was like, I'm not part of this. Like I like, I might be who I am, but like I'm not associated with that. Yeah. But there are so many of us, which is why our voices are so necessary. Yeah. It's a big deal, dude. It's a big deal what you guys are doing. We're trying. We're trying. They're pushing back very hard. They don't like us very much. But we have to we have to look at the push back and be honest as a society. Like why would a group of gay people who say, hey, we don't want children to be exposed to chemicals that are preventing them from going through puberty or having their genitalia mutilated or amputated, which cannot be fixed or groomed by grown men dressed as women. Why would anybody push back against that unless they were part of that exactly the point. Yeah, it's like a self admission. The only people that are against us. It's like, why are you telling on yourself? Like I've never seen so many people openly out themselves as groomers and pedophiles and pervert. So you know, we have this special skill of just making them expose themselves. Yeah. And all these people are the ones who started saying groomer is now an anti LGBTQ slur hell no because we started calling them groomers and like, well, you're slurring against gay people. No, no, no, you're exposing yourself. Do you think that that's a slur? I think it's actually really offensive that people say that groomers and anti LGBTQ slur because they're basically saying that all of us are on board with this. Like that going after children is somehow part of being like gay somehow synonymous with the LGBT. Right. And it's like, whoa, I never consent to any of this. None of us did. You know, like, and it's really funny. You know, the fact that they call us, if you go to our Wikipedia page, it's really insane. They call us an anti LGBT far right, you know, hate group essentially hate organization. And it just goes to show that's literally the only line of attack that they have just name calling and it doesn't even make sense. We're literally all gay and we have multiple trans members as well. It is an interesting how how anybody that's associated with the right. It's automatically a hate group. We're not even right wing though. That's the thing. I know, but like, think about that. I know. And also think about like how they're you don't hear them ever talk about left wing hate groups. Right. Right. Which you legitimately the most hateful people. Yes. On the planet. Okay. What's up and down up is up is up is down down is up bro. The thing is the left is not the left of 10 to 15 years ago. Like people think it's it's gone. So it's gone to full communist and they have a number of hate organizations on that side. And everything on the other side that's not with that is labeled as hate. Right. Like if you're not with that, you're you're hateful. You're a big it or you're you know, you're you're some sort of of immoral subhuman parasite. Right. That's and it's also interesting how the mainstream media makes it seem like like gay people can't have right leaning views at all. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like it's being gay. It's the same thing they do with black people. Right. It's identity politics. Yeah. It's the exact same thing. It's so insulting because they're like, you know, we can't think for ourselves. We can't have our own opinions. You know, it's just I've always felt like from the left that coming from the left is so insulting. Yeah. For not just gays for for any minority. Yeah. It's ridiculous. Yeah. But speaking of you brought up your wicket, uh, pdf page. Yeah. So I was doing some some a little bit more digging, right? Uh, there's a Facebook group actually. That's that's building against gays against groomers. Really? Yeah. This is my first time here. Yeah. So they actually it's called gays against gays against groomers. Okay. But is that not horrifying because that's saying. It's so crazy. Those are gay people who want to groom against groomers. What the fuck are you saying about yourself? So the group was created by we want to groom children. Yes. What they're saying. Well, it's okay. All right. So we're going to do a little quick poll. Okay. So Christine McColley. Yeah. Oh, this is the trans woman. Okay. So of course it is a man. Oh, nice. But she's not even. Sorry. I he. They're not even gay. They're trans, right? I mean, who knows? But I mean it. No, that's that's actually maybe maybe they'll be just as successful as us. I don't know. They won't be. I wish them well. I don't know. I wish them well. I wish them well. I wish them well. I don't. Dude, look, I saw I saw a clip yesterday of a of a of a trans woman with a beard. Okay. So a man with a beard. Right. Right. Who's dressed in women's clothes? Has a beard. Yes. Okay. Talking about how nobody else can identify who is a lesbian and who's not other than than yourself. So this this is a man dressed in women's clothes talking about how he's a lesbian. This is why the T should not even be included in LGB. Like there should be a delineation between lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans because trans is not a sexual identity. Trans is a mental disorder and like we can call it what it is. But like it's not the same. Like we have a sexual identity. They have a mental disorder. Well, they should have never been lumped in together because gay is about who you love or you know who you're attracted to being gay or being out by and and being T being trans is who you believe you are and it is you know, one of your recent videos. It's sexual identity. You opened up the DSM five. Yeah. For whatever it's called. Yeah. And everyone's like that's so outdated and I was like, yeah, they changed the definition of it. Right. Right. Make it more culturally acceptable and less offensive. Yeah. Like they changed. And that funny how like everything else has been the same for years. What have been the science gender dysphoria and being transgender from a mental disorder to something less. Now to keep up. If genitals if genitals don't affirm someone's gender then how how to removing genitals affirm someone's gender. That's the multi billion dollar your question. Yeah. Why if there's no thing as a binary why is there only two options whenever you go to get a gender reassignment. Right. Yeah. It doesn't even make sense. Like it's all circular logic. And it's low. That's why they have to call you names because they cannot have a conversation. Their logic just collapses into itself. Right. So it's quite unfortunate that there are so many low IQ people that are you know. It's just the nature of non-binary is binary. Yes. Like to say you're non-binary means you're binary. Like it actually means you're affirming what you're saying doesn't. Yes. You're saying there's binary non-binary. And by saying you're non-binary you're actually putting yourself into a binary system of binary non-binary. Yeah. And by an area it's this or that. Yeah. A harassment brain. Yeah. Well, that's because yours works. I mean medically transitioning it's it's transphobic isn't it? It's claiming that you know there's only two genders. I mean why switch from one extreme to the other there's only two. Yeah. It's a ridiculous argument. Yes. Transitioning is transphobic. And here's what it is. And this is really what it is. I'm sure there's people out cross dressing and all that. That's what it used to be called. And it existed for years. It existed for thousands of years bro. And actually people have never really had a problem. No. Like it's been accepted in culture for a long maybe you don't maybe you get some weird looks but bro you're six seven two hundred forty pounds. You're going to get some weird looks bro. All right let's be real you're walking around with a wig and some high heels. You're fucking look like the bronjames like. Yeah. Like the shit's going to you're going to get some looks all right. But the reality is there wasn't like hate it was it was now because we have grown men. Who are dressing as women and who are talking about the normalization of pedophilia and the grooming of children. Now it's creating this. And by the way appropriate. Disarmament and sometimes hate against these people. Yes. And dude it's appropriate. It's an appropriate response. Well these. We have to fucking protect these children. These children are little bitty innocent creatures. Yes. That are being preyed upon under the guise of some some diversity or some sort of feeling that. That the adult has right like I'm I'm talking about my sexuality and what I like to do to a fucking three year old. Yeah. Like this is absurd shit and it's inappropriate. Any way you slice it by any way shape or form. You could call it whatever you want you could call it what they call it you could call it. You know whatever but the truth of the matter is is that this shit does not have a place in society. Not in a functioning society. No absolutely not and especially not near children like it was never an issue like you said. Until they started wanting to put it in curriculums and educate children about. You can be whatever you want to be you can be a different gender you can be a they person like it was never an issue until they started bringing it to children. Yeah. And creating a dangerous situation for not just the children they're endangering themselves and then they're endangering the entire LGBTQ community. Because a lot of people think that we are guilty by association when we're not we want nothing to do with those people which is why we have to fight so hard against it. Yeah. That's why we have to exist in the first place in the fashion that we do with gazing and screw well and that's that's the point like the history in general. Because pedophilia is not a new thing and they've tried to normalize pedophilia multiple points through history. Okay. There's things we can look back to like the Vimal Republic in 1930's Germany where they were trying to normalize pedophilia and the the backlash response went against the whole gay culture there. Okay. So like we have to be able to identify and discern what's actually going on. And who the actual guilty parties are and for that to happen people like you guys and other gay people have to stand up and say no, no, no, that is not what we are with. And the fact that people would stand up against it in any way, shape or form and say that you guys are wrong in your beliefs just proves that this is what these people are actually trying to do. Oh, yeah. You know, I don't think that they ever expected to have to confront other people in the community that were against it. You know, I don't think they saw it coming. No, because it's always been love. Right. It's always been acceptance. Yeah. And so I think we really threw them through them off guard and they've been trying to figure out how to deal with us ever since. You know, it's kind of a double edged sword for them. Yeah. But you know, yeah, it's sad that we even have to exist back when we were fighting for equality and even before us like our gay and lesbian elders, you know, that we're just trying to like live their lives, be able to love who they love and live a normal life like every other American. We could have never predicted this coming. You know, and I have a lot of resentment towards the people in our community that are pushing this as well because they're kind of like proving the slippery slope to be correct. That's right. Which is so upsetting and disappointing and honestly devastating because, you know, I remember sharing a meme back in like 2014 or something that said the gay agenda was like literally just to like watch movies at night and like go by groceries. And that's what I thought it was. Like that was my agenda, you know, like and so it has been totally co-opted and they're proving all of these people that warned, oh, gay marriage, what's next pedophilia? Right. You know, and it's like they're proving to right. Yeah, they are. And we don't, you know, that's why I say we really represent the majority of the gay community. And I believe even trans people, I really do believe. No, no, I think you're right. Where we really just want to live our lives, but they are you I always say I try and emphasize so much we are being used as a shield and they're throwing us under the bus because it is hurting us. It is hurting us and it is hurting the children. And you know, we're less important than the kids, but like we got skin in this game too. Yeah, because there's a lot of people who have more traditional views that were scared of this happening. Yes. And then, you know, I think that's how I'm saying, see, I told you I told you that this is what they were going to do. Right. And it's unraveling the support within their family network. Yeah, and you look at the data, I mean, the day the backlash is growing, you know, and it was growing, I think even before the attack on kids, like you say that this is all due to the kids being pushed on kids. And I think that's about 90% of it. I think also just shoving it down. That's right. People were going tired of that. Yeah, but I'll be real, like I'm just going to speak real. I'm fucking tired of it. No, I'm a Juno's my least favorite month. Dude, I got tired of it like three years before this shit started happening. It wasn't like anti gay shit. It was like motherfucker, like we have a whole month for people for who they like to fuck. Like that makes no sense. That makes no sense. Like that makes no sense. Yes. Like it's who you like to have sex with, bro, that's not a big deal. That's a small part of your identity and your personality. And we have a day for memorial veterans. I'm saying like dude, that to me always irritated the fuck out of me. And then when I would get pressure to put my put the rainbow or all my shit, And I never did, I would always get hate for you. Yeah, but like dude, I don't believe I don't believe in that. I believe in the American flag. Yes. I believe that flag represents all of us. That's the true pride flag. That's the only yeah. So I feel like anytime, you know, the reason I've never done anything like that is because I feel like anytime that you chip off into these other areas, right? What you're doing is diluting the message of what lots of people have died for and given everything for. Yeah. You know, which is an inclusive country that, you know, good people work hard to create good things. And you know, bad people, we fucking deal with them. You know, these people have to invent their own oppression at this point. It's like truly first world problems. Like we have it so good in America, gay people and even trans people. But we all have it so good in this country. You know, why don't they ever talk about the gays in the Middle East that are being thrown off buildings? You know, they don't want to go work on it. I think a lot of what they're doing with this gay agenda, the reason it's getting so much hype and blown up so hard is because it's highly agitating to people. And they don't want people to notice the literal invasion. It's happening in our country right now. They are trying to get people to argue over this while they invade our country through the border. Well, it's definitely something to argue about though, because especially with the children, like we have to focus on this. They're trying to molest children, but like I totally get that it's also, you know, they're doing this also. No, it's a real issue. Yeah. Not saying it's not what I'm saying is it's getting so much press because you know, it's always look here. Exactly. Not over here. You know what I mean? I don't want to actually got something. So this currently is the, I guess the universal flag for the LGBT. No, I think you're missing something. I'm sure I forgot something off of there. But it's not your fault. It updates every five minutes. That's right. That's not that flag. That's the anti white flag. That's what that is. That's all people will white people. That's what they know you're kind of there right there. No, bro. No, that's the trans. That's part of the trans. That's all protected communities except white people. Yeah. What's okay? I do have a real question. Okay. But what does the circle mean? That's intersects people. Okay. I hate that I even know what these things mean. Well, I mean, yeah. But my question is so if this is, you know, we talk about being able to differentiate, you know, who's in, who's out, you know, I guess what? Should there be another flag? Should there be a new flag for, for, you know, I mean, you got the gaze against groomers. There should be only one flag. Yeah. You should be called American flag. Yeah. Like, bro, there should not be seven flags for every fucking, like, bro, think if I ran around with a flag and said, I'm straight. Like that doesn't even make any sense, bro. It's a certain. It's a certain thought. And people like hang this like on their houses, they put it on their cars, they get tattoos of it. Like because they have so little personality, they have so little character that they build their entire personality in character. About who they're like sex with. Exactly. And if I see someone who like loves this kind of stuff, I'm like, okay, you have zero depth of character to you. If this is your entire personality, like that's embarrassing. I like to take things and look at them from the other point of view, right? Like if there's this, what's the opposite of that? Okay. So like when I, even before this crazy flag that legitimately does represent everybody except straight white people. Okay. So we're not, we know that's what I'm saying. I'm watching. Maybe likes to call things the way they are. Like she doesn't say gender, affirming care. She says mutilation of body parts and the amputation of penises. Okay. So I'm going to call that what that is. Please do. That is the everybody but straight white men flag. That's what that is. Okay. And that's what I'm going to call it from here on out. That's what the fuck I see when I see that. All right. So when we think about what's actually going on here and we think about the entire play that they're trying to run, we have to understand. That their play is to get everybody out here in the world to fight while they destroy our environment. Not in our environment in the name in the way of like Greta Thunberg. I mean like our actual world. Yeah. I mean our economy, our history, our culture, everything that we have here in America that we all have loved and appreciated about this country for 248 years. Okay. And they are destroying while we argue and and and like to your point, they have made real problems for us to argue about like dude that guy right there that you post that picture of that person that person 10 years ago would already be in jail. Right. Because we would have said, oh, that person is advocating for grooming. Let's go ahead and look at this person's email history and their drives and they would be in jail. So our favorite slogans is we always say what's on your hard drive in response to anybody that comes out against us. Yeah, we have merch that says what's on your hard drive because for real, like there is no other there is no other reason to oppose us unless you have an interest in and you know in children. Yeah. Dude, it's weird to me that someone would publicly oppose not knowing, not like not realizing what you're actually saying about yourself. Like how that's viewed to everybody else out here is holy shit. This person is legitimately openly advocating for pedophilia. Yeah, but like they take such a long, winded approach to their justification of saying, well, shouldn't children understand that you know they can grow up to be all sorts of different ways. Shouldn't children understand there are lots of different family types. Shouldn't children understand this than the other. And I think that it's a poor argument to make because like yeah, a lot of family structures exist. Yeah, there are all sorts of types of types in the world. But that doesn't mean that you should be in a classroom telling a little boy he can be a little girl and telling children like, hey, some people have two moms and then they start asking questions and that's not an age appropriate conversation or changing their name behind the parents backs in hiding it. Yeah, that's jail, dude. Yeah, you should go straight jail for it. Well, guys, listen, we got a great show. We got some some other good topics to get into. But yeah, so let's get into this. Guys, remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You can find them there. You can also drop down in the YouTube description below and find them linked there as well. So with that being said, let's get into our first headline. Let's do it. Headline number one. Headline number one reads, you in general assembly. What to expect is world leaders gather this week. What to expect? What to expect? There's a lot here. There's a lot to expect actually. Got a few Joe. Let's talk about him. You got to see the video. We walked into the flag. No, I missed that one. Well, guess what? I got it for you. So there's a lot. There's hookers. Did you know that every year or every time I do this, you and assembly, it's like for two weeks long. There is a massive influx of adult sex workers, escorts. How do we know this? Oh, because the sex workers talk about it openly. Yeah, they're like, this is the most money making time of their careers for most of them. Wow. Well, this is surprised me because all those people are disgustingly ugly people and they all have a lot of money. Right. It's our money. I think I think calling them sex workers might be a little generous because the reality is there's probably human trafficking going on. 100% no, I don't think it's all consensual. I think there's traffic here. Yeah, no, that's that's absolutely real. Absolutely real. But let's get into this because there's a lot of interesting some behind the scenes, closed meetings that they're being had during this thing. So let's talk about this a little bit. But first, let's get into Biden. Confused Biden walks into flag that appears to anger Brazilian president with handshake snub at United Nations. So here's the video. This guy went from bumping into the Brazilian flag to not being able to put his earpiece in to completely leaving Lula hanging literally. Let's watch this video. Well, if it was literally be doing the world a favor. The Republic of Brazil, a company by the director of the American community. Come on, bro. And to say to President Biden, can you hear me, President Biden? This is an historical moment for Brazil and for the US. President Biden, can you hear me? You can? Yes, good. Oh, my God. And so there's the US delegation that is here with me. I like to greet my wife that is also here. I like to greet the President Trade Unionists that came to my invitation by my neighbor minister and also. What am I to arrest to our country president of this country? I see you. I'm suppressing. That's his famous salute to nobody. And leave them hanging. Yes, all that. Okay, personal opinion. I think that they want America to look weak as shit. 100% global state. That's the only reason why they are bringing Joe Biden out at this point. Yes. Because they want to destroy the image of America. Yes. And how many times have you speak in events? Have you done thousands? Have you ever gotten miced up while you're on the stage? I did. Yeah, that's odd. Listen, Becky, you're 100% right. This is the intentional demoralization of our country in the world's eyes. Yes. This is about making us look like assholes to everybody. 100% on our dime. 100%. 100%. That's what that's about. It's crazy. And so like, you know, then you got Zelensky, right? So he wants to go speak to the House of Representatives. They told him no. They told him no. That was great. Really? But he did get a meeting with somebody. You guys want to guess who? Soros. I was bigger than that, man. Kevin McCarthy. Vladimir Zelensky holds secret New York City meeting with private equity bosses at J.P. Morgan, Google, and Blackstone to discuss rebuilding more torn U.S. How about we rebuild poverty torn America? Yeah. How about that? L.A. Chicago, New York. So Vladimir Zelensky attended a secret round table in New York City with the nation's top financiers, including private equity bosses at J.P. Morgan, Google, and Blackstone to discuss rebuilding more torn Ukraine. The meeting was hosted by the nation's largest bank, J.P. Morgan, on Wednesday evening, and included Google CEO Eric Schmidt, billionaire Mike Bloomberg, New England's Patriots owner, Robert Kraft, and hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman. And apparently, allegedly, former U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger was there, and billionaire Barry Stirlich. We're also in attendance, and that's from CNN. So I got that. I think the whole this whole year, the fuck is Kissinger still alive. Yeah, that's the fact that he's literally a hundred years old. He has to be, how old is Henry Kissinger? I think he's a hundred years old. I just don't understand how. He's a hundred years old. He's literally a hundred years old. So we have the elderly, weak people of this entire world all gathered together to talk about how they're going to fuck the previous, the next up and coming number of generations. Like, do you think these people are going to be dead? Like how? Yeah, they don't care. Yeah, dude, damn, this is not anything other than how do we preserve our wealth for our children? Not us. Yeah, nothing. It's how do we take from the peasants and keep the wealth in the hands of our children coming behind us? Like, what business does a dude who's a hundred years old have with anything? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. And I think it's extremely alarming because they do this stuff in front of our faces, and so openly at this point. Yeah, they don't care. They don't care anymore because they don't have to hide anything because it's like, what are we going to do? You know, like they're stealing all of our money and sending it to Ukraine. They're destroying our country on purpose. They're making our country look weak on purpose. They are completely destroying what is the United States of America. And they're doing it in front of our faces, basically laughing at us the whole time, saying, what are you going to do about it? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? And everybody else thinks that it's all going to get fixed magically because Trump's going to come back and fix it. No, one person can't fix this. Yeah. It's an entire country that has to change. An entire country. It's a culture. It's not it's a cultural change that's required. You know, it's not a revolution like we think in terms of revolution. It's a cultural change where people wake up to the reality of how they want this country to be, start living that way, not sitting on the bench waiting for someone to come in and fix it, and actually produce the outcome in their own lives that America should look like at scale. And then that catches and that starts to become what America is. And when that becomes what America actually is, then these people hold no power anymore. Because everybody looks at them just like we look at them and says, no, fuck you, right? And that's what America used to be. America used to be a place where we had no problem telling people, no, we're not doing that. And we've gotten bullied and pushed and subverted and abused and manipulated and lied to and confused to the point now where people don't know what's actually true. And they're so afraid to speak out against anything because for the last 10 years, anytime you spoke out, you got quote unquote cancel. Yes. Well, they can only cancel you if you stop. That's what people don't understand. Like, okay, so they cancel you. Oh, show up the next day and keep going, right? That's what happens. You know how many times I've been canceled? Fucking all of them. You know what I'm saying? Like, it is what it is, bro. You show up the next day and you keep going. And if we're really want to change things, we have to start becoming in our own individual selves, what we believe this country should be and behaving as such. And when we have people who are doing that, other people see that and they start behaving as such. And then we look at these people and they don't have any power because anything they say, we just ignore. Yeah. Right? We got to get there first and that's going to take people being autonomous in their pursuit of freedom. It's going to take them taking responsibility for their own freedom and their own life and being willing to stand on it on an individual level. And right now we have an abused population. We have a population that is no different than an abused housewife or a beat dog that is afraid to come out and say what they really want to say. When in reality, this right now is the time to come out and say whatever it is you believe that you stand for. Yeah. And everyone is just counting on a few individuals to speak out like you or Jamie or myself. Yeah. I know you know. And they hit you with, I love what you're doing. And I wish I could do it. I wish I could share. I can't even share this because you know, whatever the reason is. Okay. That's the reason why we're in the position that we're in because everyone is so beaten down by political correctness. Everyone is so conditioned to believe that whenever they speak up for what they believe and whenever they actually have a rock to stand on, that they're going to get quote unquote canceled. And someone is imaginary. It doesn't actually exist. They cannot cancel you. Yeah. You can't see me so. I had a guy on a coaching call last night that I did that mentioned, you know, he said he was in a very liberal tech industry aspect and that, you know, he agreed with everything that I stand for and say. But you know, because it's very liberal place, you know, he can't, it's like man, I fucking went off on him a little bit. I'm like, dude, it's, I'm like, do you know what you just said to me? Like you just told me that, okay, I can come out here and take all the fucking errors. But you're not willing to take any. So you're asking me to come out here and like, bro, you think I don't have shit to lose? You think I don't have shit on the line? I got more shit on the line. Every single motherfucker speaking out on this motherfucker planet. I got more shit to lose, more shit than all of them. That's real shit. And I still come on here and do it every single day. And like dude, it irritated me immensely to even hear that from somebody. Like you're going to look me in the face and say that you're too afraid to speak up when I've been speaking up for you this entire time. Like all I'm waiting for is you can motherfuckers to join me. Yes. That's all I'm waiting for. If you all joined, we wouldn't be in the situation. That's the problem. That is the entire problem that we have going on here. People will not stand up and have courage and say, this is what I stand for. This is what I believe. And I don't care what you think about it. If you don't like it, don't buy my shit. Because that's what I say every day. If you don't like it, don't buy my shit. But if you do like it, buy my shit. Because there's a whole bunch of people telling people not to. You know, real man. Guys, jumping on this conversation, let us know in the comments what you guys think. Hashtag, corn pop. Let us know down there in the comments. But before we get to our second headline, we always, we have this little new segment we put in. We're going to cruise the comments. So this comment is coming from boost hub 3143. Andy. That's for you man. I never know what I'm going to get here. It's like a box of chocolates. Yeah. This comment from YouTube from boost hub 3143 says is Andy the Florida man of his family or is it Sal? It's definitely me. Are you not even going to die? Definitely. So that's you. It definitely is. No, what makes somebody the the Florida man? Here's what I'll say. Here's what I will say. You put three or four beers in Sal. You become exceptionally Florida-y really quick. Real quick bro. All right. Well, listen, no denial here. Yeah. I like it. You guys got Florida man in your family? You guys know what we're talking about? Oh, I know exactly what you're talking about. Yes, we have to be on to that. Apparently everybody does. I think mine and my man can always identify the Florida man because he will always say at least once. Hold my beer. Always. At least once. Well, there you go. No, I would say it's me. There's no shit. Yeah. And I think most of my family would say it's me. It's you too. Yeah. And I, but I think Sal would be real close if we just gave him like three or he likes to drink bush. So if I gave him like four, three or four bushes, bro, that little corn alcohol gets in his blood. He starts to become a little Florida man. Like, Sal, where's your kid's kid from? Yeah. Love it, man. Well, guys, as always, we just want to say thank you guys for being real ass fans out there. Keep liking. Keep commenting. Don't forget to hammer people. It talks shit either. Thanks, guys. But let's get right back into it. We got a headline number two. A headline number two reads, watch Texas Liberals pray for drag queens and divine diversity. Oh, God. We got seen this. I actually think we did. I saw this. We've created about it. Yeah. So let's dive into this. So a bizarre video reportedly from inside the Cathedral of Hope, Protestant Church in Dallas, Texas showed scores of drag queens watching while the congregation prayed for divine diversity. Here's a video. For no reason. For no reason. Yeah, right. Bro, can they say that we're in a cult? Right. This is disgusting. This is like creepy. This is like M. Nice. Shaliman movie. For real, bro. You throw some music on this shit. We're winning an award for it. The Grammy goes to. Yeah, that's right. M. Nice. Shaliman, man. How is it not a cult? The way it is. Dude, how do they call us a cult? Like, you're chanting shit. And also, let's be real. It's like the two biggest pedophile groups endorsing each other. Yeah, I'm not sure. It's very honest. Oh, buddy. Yeah. What? What? Oh, nothing. That's it. Yeah, wrong. Well, you know what? I told you, I'm not conservative. Yeah, you're not wrong. No, it's the fight. It's the truth, bro. I guess one of those things. People get pissed off. They also hold the end. He's a full consumer right wing. Well, there you go, motherfucker. You're very Christmas. Yeah, I was saying. Happy Yonukkah. So disturbing, though. Like, why? We've just gotten to the point where this is, it blows my mind that this is what people are actually going along with. They think that they have to literally bow down to drag queens at this point. I mean, they think that they have to put us on a pedestal, put them on a pedestal. There is no hate and violence. I mean, maybe there is hate, but like you said, it's warranted at this point. It's been, it's, here's the thing. There is, before this kid shit started up, no one gave a phone. No, I didn't care, bro. You want to be a drag queen? Dude, I used to listen, my uncle's a drag queen. Now listen, bro, I used to work at this bar called Jordan Creek in Springfield, Missouri. Okay, it was the biggest bar in Missouri. I fuck, we had a great fucking time there. Next, I live there. We ended up having a loft there. Okay, next door, there was a bar called Martha's Vineyard. All right, Martha's Vineyard was a gay bar. I've been there. Have you? Yeah. It's a great bar. Yeah. Okay. So it's a, no, listen, it's a great bar. And the dudes that owned it at the time, they lived there as well. So they had a loft where their deck was, they could see our shit, right? And we became friends with these guys. We see each other's decks. That's right, we saw each other's decks. Hey, we had a bitter deck. All right, I'm just saying. We're going to talk about it. All right, but here's the thing. Like bro, we would go in there and they would have drag night and it was fucking awesome. Like it was awesome, dude. Like we would go in there. It was fun. Like the guys were cool. Everybody fucked with you. They were fucked. There's dudes that were happening to be gay that were in her having fun. And like it was normal to like hang out with these dudes and nobody gave a shit. Yeah. And it didn't become a thing until this thing where they are like in the schools with the kids. And I actually, to further your point, I actually think that most drag queens aren't even part of the shit. Yeah, right. You know what I'm saying? And so like, dude, when we're talking about like how far this has progressed, you know, like I'm not some crazy like anti drag queen like fucking far right big it. Like bro, we just, but here's the problem. By the way, that this is being instigated and promoted, it's creating that because now it's taking people like me who, you know, have had the experiences I've had, which have all been positive and being like, you know what? Fuck this shit. Yeah. So it's a problem. So they're actually, it's not that there was hate, it's that it's being created by their behavior. They call us anti LGBT and you and everybody, but that is actually what is anti LGBT. They are turning people on purpose against us because they're pedophiles and they're doing whatever they can to get it through at our expense. Hello. And you get, you're so right. You know, we're at the point now in this country where like literally 95% of the people do not care what consenting adults do with their lives. No, nobody cares. The battle's been won. Right. Like, okay, we're past that now. You know, that's why I say they're finding new ways to be oppressed. Like they need to be oppressed. There's, you know, the problem. The crowd is a currency in this country, but they're just, if they just leave the kids alone, nobody will care. They won't. That's all you have to do. They won't because that's not the battle. The battle in our mind was always, you know, just like treat people nice and like be cool and have the same rights. Like that was the battle, right? In your mind, in your mind, in all gay people's mind. And even in like, I would say, because I'm a centrist, I think in my views, that's what I was always like. I was always like, why the fuck should we, why should they not have the same rights as anybody else? Like that doesn't make sense. And what's actually happened because of this is that now we have people who, who, you know, like you said earlier in the show who were like, you know, advocating for that now regretting their application for these, this progress and all that progress is being undone and it's sad. But the reality is is, you know, when it comes to the battle, you know, where we thought the battle was, was one, right? Like where you thought the battle was one where like most people are cool with it. It's, yeah, we're dealing with some assholes sometimes, but guess what? There's assholes that hate everything about everybody at some point. And but that's not the battle for them, the globalist. Right. The globalist battle is to depopulate. It's to create a situation where people cannot repopulate. So they have taken this battle where it should have been one. And instead of saying, okay, everybody's equal now they say, okay, we're going to make more gay people. We're going to make more sexually castrated. Well, they're literally castrated. Yes. I think that's a huge motivation of doing this because that's their, a jet. Sure. Right. That is the real agenda that's being pushed because, you know, typically two dicks don't make a baby. All right. And typically two vaginas don't make a baby. And people who have their dicks cut off definitely can't make a baby, right? Or their vaginas closed up, definitely can't make a baby. So this has gone from this social argument that we all, you know, participated in in our lives that should have been one five, 10 years ago. To now it's, it's a, it's Pat, it's become something else. It's an ideology. Yeah, but it went from a cultural, you know, like, hey, let's get this. It's coming from the most evil people on the planet. Yes. It's coming from people who think that we are less than them. And they're saying, okay, like this would be no different. Like, let's just say we all lived in a house, right? And we're all living in a house and we've got a cockroach infestation. And we can't really just kill all the cockroaches because there's too many of them because if we kill them all, they would realize it and they would kill us. Okay. So how do we grow into cockroaches? I'm just saying there's a lot of them. There's a lot of them. There's only a few thousand of these people. There's eight billion human beings. Right. Okay. So let's just say we live in a house and we knew that if the other cockroaches saw that we just started killing them, we knew that they would kill us. Okay. We said, okay, well, how do we get them? How do we get them to stop reproducing? That's the first step. Yeah. Let's weaken them up. Let's figure out how we can get them to not reproduce. Let's put chemicals on the ground where they're eating that lower their sexual reproduction hormones, their testosterone. And let's make them not attracted to the males, not attracted to the females. We're not able to reproduce because we'll feed them this poison, right? Then let's play some videos because these cockroaches are smart, dude. They can watch videos. Let's play some videos that talk about how it's not cool anymore to mate with the female cockroach, what's actually cool is to mate with, to go with the men and the women go with the women. Do you understand what I'm saying here? That's what they look at us like. We are misunderstanding the way that they view us. They do not view us as equals. They do not view us as people who are on their level. They view us as an apperocyte that is infesting their world that they have to figure out how to keep from populating because, according to them, which isn't true, there's actually a population problem in terms of we don't have enough people, like Elon talks about it openly and it's true. But they've made up this agenda where the world is going to end with the climate agenda if we don't depapulate the planet. And so the purpose of all of this shit is all towards that. That's what this is about. That's what the vaccine was about. That's what this agenda is about. Everything is about getting people to not reproduce. And then once they get people to not reproduce enough, then the population goes down. Okay. Now, if we were in the house and there was all these cockroaches and we got the population reduced by 50%, we would say, okay, well, there's 50% less of them now. I think we could just start killing them now. And that's where this is going. Exactly. That's where people don't understand. So, let's sit here. I want to get another take too on this. When it comes to the grooming on the kids, one thing that I've definitely been seeing is like a massive rebellion from the kids themselves. I love seeing them. I love it. Yeah. It's pretty cool. So, I don't know if you guys have seen this video, but this headline reads hundreds of high school students organized walk out to protest trans bathroom rule, right? Or now compromise. So, hundreds of students from Pennsylvania's Perquiemont Valley School District walked out of class Friday after the local school board failed to enact a policy requiring transgender students to use the restroom corresponding with their biological sex. Quote, kids were upset. Girls, we wanted to protect them. They were upset. They didn't want men in their bathroom. I'm at who organized the walk out to Fox News on Monday. Here's the video. It's so epic. It's awesome. That John, not a kid to hear. Good for them. I mean, kids are naturally rebellious, right? You shove anything down their throat enough and tell them to do this. They're going to do the opposite. And I'm glad to see this. This should be happening. Well, every winning, they get it. These kids have more courage than a pair in this country right now. If the parents in this country had the kind of courage that these kids had to walk out, this wouldn't be an issue, but all these parents are freaking cowards. That's where I was trying to tell that dude on the call last night. I'm like, bro, if you guys would just join in. Yes. Like, if you guys would just join in, this would stop like tomorrow. Right. But they're also afraid. They all think they're all waiting for their. Afraid of what? Afraid of that? Exactly. Yes. No, the crypt. Okay. It's scared of being called a bigot. And it's so pathetic. It is genuinely pathetic, but this is how these people live. They're scared of losing friends, family, for somehow coming out against, you know, just I don't know. It's my moral disgusting shit. Yeah, exactly. Yes. And they think because what, they're straight that they're not, they don't have a place to speak. And the opportunity to keep getting pushed further and further and further and they just keep staying quiet. It's like you parents out there listening to this. This is going on in your kids school district. You cannot wait for someone like myself or like Jamie, like your common sense neighborhood gay to show up and save the day. Like we can't do it. Yeah. Super gay. Happy to know. Joe to lead that shit. Oh my God. No, that's real. That's real though, man. I think it's just cool to see. I love seeing it. I can't wait to touch it. You know what I mean? No, I love seeing it. I can't wait to touch it. You know what I mean? I have to say, what's that? That's the super gay. Is that the super gay hand sign? Yeah, that's how you go. Super gay. Bro, come on. How do you know it's universal? It looks to him. It's universal. I'm not. That's very universal. You don't know. You look at what you're a police officer, bro. Is that the trading? I'm giving you an hour. All right. Listen. I'll try to blow you in cover. Guys, jumping on this conversation, let us know. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be here. I'm going to be here. Running, the deck game. What exactly are you seeing with that just a distantick? Yeah. What about you? Yeah, principle. Slow the probabilities. Yeah. recommended sense. Be flexible. be positive. So this is what kind of 티ет ts that meansывing on. You were a place of business or your school or your community or ever it might be like no one's coming to save you You need to get up and save the day yourself. You had there. I go with the superhero thing again You got to get up and do it yourself. Don't wait for someone to come in like do it Just like this kid John did yeah, just stand up and go and people people will be so surprised when they do stand up How many people will be behind them and how many people will follow in their footsteps because courage is contagious You know people often wait for that first domino to fall They don't want to be the first one, but then as soon as they do you know you are gonna like we the support that we get is far outweighs You know the hate and and people you know other gay people and people in the community are telling us like thank you Like I feel like I can speak up now Yes, so it you have to just do it like just rip the band it off It's not that bad. You're gonna be fine. You might be surprised Yeah, and you will be surprised at the support that you get and the new friends You know if you're worried about losing friends whatever like they're not your real friends if they're gonna ditch you over that I've gone through that so many times now with being you know Being on the right whatever, but you know you're gonna have so disappointed in you That's what you always hear from these people. Yeah, I'm so disappointed in what you said Well, then fucking turn it off. Yeah, I had a bunch of old high school friends whenever I started posting especially for gays against Screamers D. N. E. Me like Becky. I love you. I'm just I'm so disappointed Like did you know you don't have to follow it? Did you know you can just unfollow me? Like you can click that button. You don't have to stay here It's weird how many people think their disappointment affects us. Yeah, like it matters And that they think it matters because it matters to them Yeah, because they've spent their whole life working to have the approval of every single person around them And which is the exact reason why they don't have any courage. Yeah, yeah, exactly I don't know about I mean I didn't spend my life thinking like that I never worried about the people around me. I worried about doing what I thought was right. You know same I think everybody in this room has that mentality, you know Yeah, I mean I thought I was gonna like lose followers whenever I started posting and the exact opposite happened I was like I have to say what I have to say because I have a very specific voice in this fight Yeah, I was like I feel obligated as you know a gay person who is also a mother like I have to use my voice because I have such a unique Standing point here and I thought I'm for sure gonna lose my platform I'm gonna lose all my followers like I'm gonna lose my friends. Well, you came to me and said hey man Is this cool? And I'm like yeah The opposite thing happens like the complete opposite like it's not as bad as you guys think out there. It's really not I feel like a lot of your listeners kind of get this. Yes You know that they they have this mentality, but there are a lot of people that really just need to put it into action You know, they want to they're like tiptoeing towards the edge about to do their like, you know Actually think the people that listen to this show are the action takers I think we're talking to the people who can swing The reality of what's going on if they would just get in the game You know, I think we have a lot of people who listen to show who are very open and understand what's happening right now that you know Uh Are much further ahead than a lot of the other population and so that by default means that you guys listening are gonna be the people Who are going to change this or allow it to continue to happen And I hope that you'll stand up and do something to change it because that's why I do this Shit man Guys, let's get into our third and final headline headline number three Uh, gotta get an update russle brand situation a lot has happened Uh russle brand sexual assault allegations live updates. This is from New York Post Peers Morgan releases government letter demanding tech firm punish and cancel actor Yeah, this is scary stuff Yeah, no, I know wild. Yeah wild. So let's dive into this. So russle brand is of course been accused of raping sexually assaulting and abusing four women over the course of seven years Now including a 16 year old he allegedly called the child According to a bombshell investigation published on September 16th the British actor and comedian whose 48 denied the report prior to its release Since the allegations broke Interviews to resurface showing brands ex-wife Katy Perry uh, his quote forgetting several martial co star Christian Bell discussing uh discussing his behavior years ago And his youtube channel has been demonetized um, so this is the tweet that came out from Peers Morgan tweeted this out saying quote The British government writing to tech firms demanding they financially punish and cancel russle brand before he's been through Do legal process over the allegations against him is a very disturbing or well-earned development So this is the letter This letter came from the culture media and sport committee from the house of commons in London Um, and they're writing they put all this and and you know nice british polite You know commentary essentially here But saying one of the parts out re here it says quote we would be grateful if you could confirm whether mr Brand is able to monetize his content including his videos relating to the serious accusations against him If so we would like to know whether rumble intends to join youtube and suspending mr Brand's ability to earn money on the platform quote We would also like to know what rumble is doing to ensure that creators are not able to use the platform to undermine the welfare of victims of inappropriate and potentially illegal behavior your sincerely Dame Caroline denny edge of and rumble responded. Okay. Now we all know rumble rumble I don't I don't even know if you call them a right wing platform, right? They're just a platform who respects Our freeter rights. Yeah, you know, uh, and so rumble refined respawn way. We're on rumble. Yeah, we all remember you guys can listen I'm watching rumble. Yeah, we did do that. Yeah, just totally for that. Yeah, it's recent. It's recent We are on there. Yeah, you know, but but but rumble responded they refuse to do it. They wrote this letter This is coming from their CEO It says today we received an extremely disturbing letter from a committee chair in the UK parliament while rumble Obviously deploys sexual assault rape and all serious crimes and believes that both alleged victims and the accused are entitled to a fool and serious investigation It is vital to know that recent allegations against Russell brand have nothing to do with content on rebels platform Um, and they go into it. They they conclude by saying although it may be politically and socially easier for rumble to join a cancel culture mob Doing so would be a violation of our company's value uh values and mission we Emphatically reject the UK parliament's demands um, so that's happened um He's even have people Catherine McFee she came out um because there was this uh, you know, they they tried to pull this Well when he was on Jimmy Fallon show Hercine oh, they're making it so you can't even have fucking fun anymore exactly They can't even have fun we have women across the fucking world complaining about how men won't talk to them Men won't hit on a met one ask them out. This is why this is why you can't even have fun You can't even go to a party you can't even joke around or whatever and it becomes You know this yeah, yeah, but I mean, but like he's gotten people that's coming out to support him right like so Catherine McFee Um, she said you know, you know, uh Russell Brad had to sit on the lap She's saying that was completely harmless and they're trying to use this is like one of the things like see his behaviors See how bad this guy is I guarantee you they call her and they said What did you think about sex or what did you do about Russell brands in appropriate actions towards you on Jimmy Fallon's show? I guarantee that's what they said something to that effect Who the fucker these people think they are like the way that letter was written that she that they wrote to him Like saying we we would like to know man, you know what we would like you to shut the fuck up. How about that? Like dude these people are so about Prince uh, can you charge whatever listen the tone they use is representative of how they view us They view us like we are not allowed to operate outside of whatever they seem to believe is the right thing to do Who the fucker you Who are you You're some person who was born into wealth who got a position and some sort of powerful government And now you're writing these passive aggressive letters to companies saying we would like to know you would like to know or what What are you going to do? How about this? How about fuck you That's what should be said. It's very very simple. Yeah very simple, but I mean do they've even cancelled all of this fucking tours It's so scary because this is literally they're just allegations He's already been tried and hung in the court, you know the public opinion and that will they're trying to I mean if a lot a lot of people are like wait a minute You know, but but the people that are in charge and controlling things I think they're trying to set an example Using him unfortunately for him, but you know work if the if the allegations are true That's one thing, but you cannot do this to somebody just based on allegations with no proof Yeah, but they do this over and over again. They've been doing this for years. This has been going on for Fucking 15 years people just don't want to talk about it like bro any time a man steps out of line in any way It always comes into the sexual inappropriate action or inappropriate action or this or this or this and it's like do Unless unless Andy not to cut you off, but unless it's a drag queen. Yeah, unless it's a drag Well, why would these women wait so long? That's what I don't that's what I don't get because that's not how it works That's not how it works. It's not that they wait so long that you're you're misunderstanding how it works I'm saying if it was real if they if it was true, but what they do is they go through and they start finding people from your past And then they offer them money to talk about it. Right. That's how they come up with this shit Okay, so they go on and they start digging through people's past relationships and their past friendships And they find the people that just like every human being on the planet that you know we have people from the past that don't really care For us that's why they're in the fucking past Okay, and then they pay these people or they offer these people something to then spill the tea right and this is what happened This is what happened to Eric Gritons Okay, who was running for a Senate here in Missouri right they went back They got his wife to say some shit. There wasn't actually true They ran it through the press and by the time it came out that it wasn't true It was the damage was done and the race was over This is how they remove people who are making an impact from the playing field and we could go down the list from you know Russell brand to you know fucking everybody everybody It always comes back to the sexual allegations like bro We these people want to talk about sexual allegations so much, but they don't want to talk at all About the things that work that you guys are fighting for every single day Those sexual predators like dude. This is absurd shit Okay, this guy's a Hollywood actor. You know how many fucking women Fuck this dude because they wanted his money or they wanted his fame or they wanted his Whatever he like broke that this guy probably has a body count that is thousands Thousands and thousands of women long okay, and they went out and they've they've gone through that list And they found a few people who are willing to say yeah, you know That's that's the surprise and they like you be told to be like this rock star type of dude You only got four women out of his pants. That was just it. That was it just for well It's cuz Russell brand also is speaking out, you know He's joined like the brigade of the kind of rhetoric that you talk about and exposing You know the elites and kind of pushing back really hard and he has a huge audience now, you know I mean, he's always he's been famous for a very long time, but he's kind of shifted his entire career and just Outlook and what he's vocal about to you know this kind of discussion now and they don't like that Obviously, so they're trying to get his head Dude, I can't stand this shit this this this whole the whole me two era and the you know believe all women era Oh, we're gonna believe all women, right? Like this is they're telling all the truth You lie every time you leave the house You know what I'm saying like dude this this shit is out of control unless there's actual proof photographs Evidence, I don't give a fuck. I really don't say whatever you want to say about the man I still like him. I hope he wins and honestly if they don't have real shit here on him He's gonna get bigger and bigger because of it true Yeah, I think I mean I would love to get you guys to take on this, but like I mean we got to look at the other side of this too I think we cover this one last episode, but I would love your take on it It's like the damage that this actually does to real instances Of sexual assault of rape right when we can play this, you know the boy cries wolf You know on these things and destroy these people And when the stuff comes out once once the facts come out all that didn't actually happen What is that what what messages is sending to people or women men to matter who are actual victims of sexual assault and rape? Oh, yeah, no, I mean it's horrible, you know Anytime you you accuse someone in its fake it only weakens actual victims, you know because they're gonna be let They're not gonna be there's a lesser chance. They're gonna be believed or taken seriously because they do this over and over and over again And it really I think weakens people that are actually being abused Of course and it's sad. It's kind of like you know the same thing they're doing us. They're saying they say that they're helping them racism Yeah, exactly they don't care about any of us, you know They they just use us to advance their agenda. Yeah at the risk and at the You know other people being hurt in the process. Yeah, well, we'll see. We'll keep you guys up They know there's a lot of this shit. This is bullshit like dude women have to start standing up against this shit Not just men, you know like women have to stand up against this and call these other women out Like this is bullshit shit like You want to know why why you don't have any dates? You want to know why men aren't shiverists? Why they don't take you out Why they don't ask you out why they would rather just go watch porn and leave you to fuck alone This is why because they're afraid that if they do anything if they go on a date with you and they kiss you And then eventually you guys break up that you're gonna make some story up about them that's gonna ruin their life That's that's what people that's what men are afraid of and until women stand up and say hey, that's bullshit Okay, and start calling these other women out who do this this will continue and with the culture will continue to be messed up All right women who make an accusation of rape or sexual misconduct that cannot be proven should have to serve the sentence of the accusation That would stop this shit immediately. It's absurd. It's got a way out of control It's affecting culture and by the way What doesn't happen when men Won't talk to women Procreation that's correct. It goes right in line with what we're saying about the other thing They want this is what they want God dude that last topic just pisses me off to you know Because like every single fucking dude on the planet is that risk of false accusations If at all times and like dude, it's so easy to ruin someone's life by just saying some bullshit Wasn't there that case where a girl accused this college student of Of rape and he ended up killing himself that happens all the time. Yeah, no, and that's only one you heard That happens that happens destroy and it wasn't true. He never does anything that happens all the time But he like got kicked out of he got expelled Like all this yeah, I mean his his friends, you know like totally ostracized and he killed himself dude Women this is a women leadership correction that's needed good women who want men to be men and come to them and take them on dates and treat them right and shit If you want that to start happening again, you have to call that shit out. Yes, that's what has to happen women have to stand up for the men They're getting accused by all this shit You know that feminism bullshit that went popular for from 2015 to 2020 where it was you know me too And if anybody ever floater with you was sexual harassment like all this shit that has caused a huge rift in society Where men now will not even fuck with women anymore. They don't even want to their terrifies. This is what's produced and they should be This is what's produced the entire quote unquote red pill community Which by the way them dudes ain't wrong. They're not wrong. They're on they're talking about reality and women don't like it You know they're under like dude. They're they're talking about how bad of a deal it is for a man to Invested in women these days because of how vulnerable a man is at all times like if you say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing Or just do something that they don't like they can accuse you of something and ruin your life You know if they marry you and you marry one of these women by accident they could take all of your shit They can take all of your money. They could like dude and this woman could be a total piece of shit herself And the way the laws are written and the way everything's written is completely unfavorable to men And that's reality dude and until we start talking about real shit This this problem that women are complaining about about not being able to find a man is gonna continue to get worse and worse and worse Because men and this is bad. I'm not advocating for this But young men are giving up the idea of having a wife and having a family for the idea of just becoming successful And running around and dating a bunch of girls and you know Just living a playboy lifestyle Because they realized that if they go the other way they could potentially be ruined in every turn from for trying to do the right thing Yeah, it's a very bad problem in society and it all comes from this feminist me to bullshit that women need to stand up against It's real shit man guys. That was our third and final headline. It is time for our final segment of the show as always We have thumbs up or dumb as fuck. So we bring a headline up It gets judged I'm just out of its thumbs up or if it's dumb as fuck so with that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads Are they barking mad hundreds of people who identify as dogs gather to bark and how at each other in Germany Oh I got the videos Let me guess they're part of our community not to be added to the flag because look at what it says it says around a thousand species Oh, no, so we're gonna have that including the flag can't wait no new update coming in 10 minutes No shit Yeah, so hundreds of people who identify as dogs have met up in a city center in Germany Where they communicating This is trolling this is not real bro.

It's real and these all these freaks who used to hide and sorry no not so it's really It's freaks who used to hide this shit in their basement like they feel so emboldened now to go out and public and feel like they're gonna be accepted being Weird like this like no, it's you know things really started going downhill when the insane assilums got boarded up Yeah, like honestly if I were president day one I'd reopen all the psych wards and just Put them all like you gotta go. I would open them. I would reopen them too and like right when you go in there be a wood shipper Like cafeteria this way Houses you know like coming our magic house and you just walk in the front door and it would be over Yeah, right this transpecies stuff like this is a real thing that's up in coming like it I think it started with like the pup play like you see these these guys who like where they puppy masks and stuff But I just hate to see it man. It's so gross. So bad and and we're supposed to like completely normal human We're supposed to be in the same community and kumbaya with people like this We're supposed to pretend like this is normal shit No, and now we got kids at schools who identify as kitty cats and they want a pee in a litter box And the schools are bowing down to it. It's disgusting There's this viral photo of like some some little girl at a pride fest with these puppy play things pup play things And she thinks it's all you know her innocent mind she thinks this is a cute. Oh look doggies And they're just sick fetishes with you know with the this kink that That are around children now and I just I don't understand how any parent can think that it's okay to bring their kids there I don't think that these things should be happening at all anymore that these parades and and fest I agree I agree I agree. I said lock up anybody to try to bring kid in Yeah, I mean yeah, I mean, I'm not a anybody who brings a kid in lock up anybody who's publicly nude In any way shape or form like this shit is absurd bro. Look at pictures of us from 50 years ago I was just gonna say that I look look at look at the Humanity since yes just just being a decent person look at the way they dress Yeah, the way they behave look at the way they talk to each other look at what we're doing now This is the decline happens so fast too. It's so scared to think like where are we gonna be in another 20 years? That's because they've used In the internet and webbing like that's how they've advanced this culture so quickly. Yeah, here's the video guys. Oh God Oh, I saw a pride flag of course. Yeah, yeah Great We need to bring back bullying I always say that shit make bullying great again. What are these people do like? I don't know man because here's how I looked into this not for personal reasons but like to get more research on the story This shit can get pretty expensive Like those costumes and stuff like that's not that's like that stuff's not cheap And I don't understand how they but what what what I'm here's what I'm saying why why okay Let's just say like like the people who like to do the cosplay right like they like dress up as their favorite Superhero or whatever and go to these conventions. Yeah, like which I actually think it's I think some of these people do some of those pretty bad ass shit Like I'm like damn dude, that's fucking cool But like These guys are doing that But then like it's becoming like the sexual thing on top of it like what what the fuck is like how like I don't get it. It's it's sexual to start. It's like a very obscure kink and fetish to dress up like an animal and then like do sexual play with it Okay, so like they they get it out of you do stuff together. I don't know what they do Yeah Right, I can only assume so much. Yeah, so like there's a set when I'm asked I'm being serious. So there's a sexual component To this no for sure. It's a not just a component. It's the foundation Okay, so these people put in dog mask on and fucking each other. Yes, that's exactly what they do. Like that like I just You know if you do go to a pride fest now I went last year actually to just see what it was like and see if there were kids and stuff Because I had just started gays against groomers and it is just Completely filled with people like this, you know, and they have butt plugs with their a tail butt plug And they just walk around like that and there's children there I mean even if there weren't children there just keep this in your house. Yeah, they do it I don't want to see it you if you want to be a freak be a freak But like keep it in your house like there's absolutely no reason to take this out to the streets. There's no reason for it I hate this reason for it. Well, yes, we and we understand that but It's and they get celebrated like they're celebrated for this, you know and Well, I actually think that's a lot of why they do this thing I think it goes along with what Becky was saying earlier about them lacking any other components of having an actual personality And I think that the reason that these a lot of these people make this their identity is because it's literally There only way to be relevant in any way Well, it's a complete social contagion. Yeah, they never got celebrated for 17th place back then Yeah, no shit. Yeah, that's real shit. So were we given this gas thumbs up or dumb as fuck? I hate it. I don't even like the word dumb as fuck. I want to say like degenerate. Yeah, uh embarrassing Yeah, it is embarrassing like it's yeah Like like I keep looking around like the world and like when I see like This kind of stuff or like just the culture in general like and how people how men dress now like dude There's men walking around right now legitimately in matching like like Top some bottoms like sweatpants shit, right that like 30 years ago Would have been seen as like the shit you wear around your house that you want nobody to see you in and now that's like fashion, right? Like right it would be cool if we could get back to like traditional fashion and like wearing a suit Dressing nice like I'm not saying I don't need to wear a suit to work every day. I work in an athletic company, all right, but Like There's something to be said for an orderly civil culture that I miss a lot and like this stuff is standard This stuff is embarrassing dude like think think if we took one of these people from 50 years ago Who was 20 years old or 25 or 30 years old and we take that person and we transport him into the 25 30 year old culture up today Like they would look around and be like This is fake. This is not actually around and say somebody closed the insane asylum People stopped punching each other in the faces at some points and it shows yeah Dude it's it's I feel like I was born in the wrong era dude Real talk like the wrong era like this this stuff is disturbing. It's frustrating It's demoralizing and it's disgusting and like I'm tired of seeing it like I'm tired of it Yeah, but like that's why you were born in this era Because like we wait for what did I do wrong in the last life? No, like because we need people who can actually stand against this you know what I'm saying like I think a lot of people like Like me and Jamie like fuck we don't feel like we belong in our in our community anymore born in the wrong era whatever Okay, no, but we're here for a reason because The world needs us to stand up and speak out and take charge against the big sit Can I join can I join your super gay I can hear your lesbian Guys Andy Jamie Becky that's all I got all right all right guys Thanks for coming on the show.
