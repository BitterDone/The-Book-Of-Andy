I mean, bro, yeah. Like, dude, why are you coming here waving other people's flags and shit all the time? Go there. That's what I'm saying, bro, all these people protesting and running up and down the streets with other people, other country's flags, then go back. You know, like it's real simple. They love to say Viva Mexico, but they don't want to say Viva in Mexico. Well, I don't have, excuse me. I don't have any problem with someone being proud of where that came from, but you should be more proud of where you are contributing to that. You know, and we see this quite often from where you're many different people. It's become the thing, we hate America, we're gonna fly all these flags, but we're not gonna fucking leave. You know, of course now, we wouldn't leave. I don't need crazy. They don't have Amazon. Let's not take it that far. I mean, that's what these people are like, and they always, it's always the same shit. It's what I just thought that was beautiful, bro. If you guys would not have a chance to see that clip, go out. It's like, it's like, it's like, bro, it's cool. I mean, dude, I think that's where we need to be as Americans, you know, like this whole idea that you really started with Kaepernick back in, you know, with his kneeling and shit. Of the flag being offensive and it's not for these people or for those people or for, well, if that's the way you feel them fucking leave, dude. It is for you. That flag represents all people, it represents all people that are citizens of this country. It also has a very specific culture, a freedom that it represents. It's the people's flags. It's not the tyrants flag. It's our flag. It's not their flag. And you should be proud of it. And we should be all working to create a situation that makes the entire place better. So yeah, so I, you know, now he's a contender. All right. I'm going to let you choose who gets the greatest of the day. All right. So you got cat Williams for choice one. And then choice two is representative Nancy Mace. She had a very interesting exchange. Let's check this clip out. To be in quick. Yes, sir. The general lady has used a phrase that is considered a slur in the LGBTQ community. And the transgender community. And let me please finish without an disruption. And. Tranny, Tranny, Tranny.

Like what makes your rights more important than everybody else's when you're the vast minority of people? We're all tired of it. We're not doing it. You did this to yourselves by pushing on everybody. So fuck off. It's real simple. Yeah, Nancy gets the guy you guys heard of here first. Well, sweet man. Well, let's get into our cruises. Yeah. We got a we got some good stuff in here, guys. Remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy forseller.com. You guys can find them all linked there for you with that being said, let's get into our first headlines. Headline number one. Headline number one. Headline number one reads 60 minutes publicly releases transcript of interview at heart of its dispute with Trump. Any other chance to see any of this shit? No, we've talked about it, right? We knew that it was like, okay, they definitely made her, you know, seem like she was better than she was actually doing on that interview. It's much, much worse than we could anybody can really imagine. So let's dive into this. This is an AP news article. CBS 60 minutes posted online Wednesday, the unedited transcripts of its October interview with Kamala Harris that sparked a lawsuit on the news. The lawsuit by Donald Trump saying that they proved its broadcast was not doctored or deceitful. That's what Trump's contended in a $10 billion lawsuit filed against the network in November. Reportedly, the subject of ongoing settlement talks. First of all, $10 billion. So shit, tell them why he. Yeah. And obviously, this is proof of point. I mean, shit, they gave, what's the guy's name? They gave what's the name of billion dollar lawsuit, the Alex Jones, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. All right. You know, but in a separate track, the FCC last week called for CBS to send transcripts and clips of the interview which CBS did before making them public on Wednesday, the interview with the Democratic President from candidate, portions of which were aired on 60 minutes and face the nation attracted attention because clips showing her giving different answers to a question about Israel that was posed by correspondent Bill Whitaker. Let's check some of these clips out. Bill, if I approached my life as though well, it's never been done before. Therefore, it cannot be done. I wouldn't be sitting here in this interview with you. What? I can't even know what she said, bro. One with this eight seconds, one more time. Bill, if I approached my life as though well, it's never been done before. Therefore, it cannot be done. I wouldn't be sitting here in this interview with you. If I approached my life. Listen, you were gifted everything that you have. I love these people that have leveraged everything around them and created nothing on their own, done nothing on their own, and have found themselves in positions that they don't deserve and then acting like they clawed their way up to get there. Like it's a joke. Cl� your way through the, yeah, through the dicks. That was bad, right? That was word salad. We were familiar with this from Kamala Harris. But I want you to check this next clip out. This was a big piece here. More importantly, you'll see they go off air and they're not recording. You've got to listen to the conversation that's had been, let's check this clip out. Thank you. Thank you, Bill. Good to be with you. So, can we just take this, on the other part of the clip, so I can put it in the short shot? Yeah, it's not so. You need to talk with the editor. Hold your talk with that, about how we're going to pay for it. And I'm going to show you the way, you know, with your plans. I'll watch this clip. The way you watch it, some works is not hard. So, how are you going to get so you're writing comments that what you say, your plans, are something that they should always be to and provide to you and make you have a manager. No information you get after this one. Is that what you needed? Yes, sir. I'm going to send 36 responses to the room. Mark. It's going to be taxes, it's going to be literally the economist. I mean, from each spectrum. Yeah. Yeah. I know. But that's her with digging the cameras are off. Right. Trying to answer the question. Yeah. Now, the FCC chair calls CBS News Conduct hard to explain following the release of Kamala Harris interview transcript. He had this to say. The big story is 60 minutes. And you said you have to turn over the transcripts of the vice president Kamala Harris interview because of the way obviously was edited. And they're already being sued for $10 billion by the Trump team. Are you worried about the precedent of asking for these transcripts because now everybody that has to edit down a interview with a high profile figure will have the same situation. No, not at all. It's actually interesting here as the precedent we're following is the precedent that the Democrat FCC set when it came to Fox. There was a complaint lodge against Fox and so they opened up a public proceeding on that. And we're simply applying that precedent. You know, look, there's a lot of people in this country right now on the radical left that are upset about this investigation into CBS and the work that I'm doing on broadcasters. And it's our paraphrase. Tom is so when the government has been weaponized in your favor, it feels like discrimination when all of a sudden there's even handed treatment. There's a lot of people that have been on that sort of that upper road of the two tiered system of government. And what I'm here to do is apply the law evenly. This is a rare situation where we had extrinsic evidence that CBS had played one answer or one set of words and then swapped in another said and CBS has conduct through this frankly has been concerning. You know, look, they just did an interview with vice president Vance and immediately fully disclosed the unedited transcript for some reason. They decided not to do that in this case. And so we've now opened a proceeding. We think it's in the public interest to allow people to participate in comment and we're going to take this one step at a time at the FCC. And hopefully you can talk. Well, I mean, he makes a great point, dude. You know, these people have gotten away with everything that they wanted to do. There's been no checks and balances, no accountability. Nobody's saying, hey, you can't do that. We've watched them just make up the rules as they go and that doesn't just go for the media that goes for the judges and the courts. And everybody for the last four years, I mean, it's been complete. Unconstitutional chaos that has violated pretty much every single law that could be violated. And you know, now that the law is being applied and reality is setting in these people all crying discrimination. It's not going to work, dude. Nobody cares. Okay. Three out of ten people support the Democrats right now. And only two out of those, if you took the three that do it out of those people only two out of ten support. So it's like are two out of ten or men that support. So like, dude, we're talking about, you know, we're talking about allowed minority that, you know, honestly, like, I think most people are just sick of. Yeah. They're 100%. Now, to your point, I do got some good news for you. When we talk about accountability, okay, this just came out, not sure if you guys saw this. But check this out. 17 state attorney generals unite to challenge Biden's preemptive pardon vow to prosecute serial liar Anthony Fauci. This is fucking great. Yeah. This is great. So this just came out 17 attorney generals from the states have formally requested aid from Republican congressional leaders to delve deeper into the origins of COVID-19 and explore possible legal actions against Dr. Anthony Fauci at the state level. This concerted effort spearheaded by South Carolina attorney general Alan Wilson aims to circumvent the preemptive pardon issued by Joe Biden on his last day in office, which shots a shield Fauci from federal prosecution. We know this was a blanket pardon that was issued and it wasn't just under the Biden administration. He went back all the way to January 1st of 2014, which makes me wonder, you know, how, how soon were they planning all of this stuff? How early did they start that process? And obviously we had that congressional investigation that was done on that. We know that he purged himself on the stand. That's all there. But it's good to see that, you know, we're getting somewhere. We got 17 attorney generals. Of course, she got Andrew Bailey on there. A big dog from Missouri. I don't know why it's not 50. I don't know why it's not, you know, well, I mean, it's not 50 for the same reason that people went along with all of this stuff the entire time. Okay. For some reason. And I think we've gotten to the, you know, core of it with the USA thing, which we're going to talk about in a minute. I'm sure. You know, people have figured out that this is all pay for play. People are getting all kinds of kickbacks in many different ways to say, silent or go along with illegal shit that punishes the American citizen in many different ways. So I think there's a lot of people in a lot of positions right now that are straight up. Shitting their pants about what's going to come out. And it makes the situation very dangerous. You know, it's, it's we're primed for some sort of black swan major event. The more that comes out, the more dangerous it's going to get unless they sweep in very quickly and, you know, keep these people from doing messed up shit. No, 100% man. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. That being said, let's go cruise the chat. Yeah, I actually got an email to start with. This is an interesting one. I guess it could have been for Q and A, but because of the nature had be asked on CTI. So Andy, I got a good one for you. Okay. Good morning slash evening Andy. I am a 13 year old student in Wisconsin. The other day, one student said that it was quote, unconstitutional for Trump to sign the executive order to make their only B2 genders. Should I rip the leftist bullshit to shreds or just leave it be she is a good person, but we shouldn't let that into schools. Thanks for the help. I mean, look, first of all, you know, I like that you're involved and you're paying attention at 13 years old. Most people don't, but what I will say here is that if you let people get away with things that aren't true and you look the other way, it empowers them. It makes them more powerful. They continue to repeat it. And when they repeat it and not other people start to believe it. And then we have a situation where it's a bigger battle to fight that would have been when it first started. And you should remember that lesson because the reason that we even need an executive order to tell people very basic biological truths is because when these people started saying this stuff, nobody stood up and stopped them. So I'll let you choose what you think is right. But we need to understand that when people do these things and we do nothing about them, they become more powerful and more real and more people accept them as truth and it creates a much bigger problem that has to be dealt with. So that's how I would answer that question. It's a fundamental reality, scientific truth that there are two genders. It has been that way since the beginning of time. And we shouldn't need an executive order to tell us that that's the truth. That's absurd. And people pretending like this is a huge win. It's not actually a win because it should have always been that way. It's sad. A lot of these things that Trump is doing, people are considering big wins when really they're just the way it should have been all the time. So you know, you could do with that what you want. But I appreciate you paying attention. Keep paying attention because it's very important for you and your fellow students in your future. No, 100%. All right, there you go. Yep. This next comment comes from at Cody, KS 1988. This was actually you replied to a tweet from Elon Musk. Elon tweeted out, he says, Doge is the woodchipper for bureaucracy. To which Cody said, I know about a guy in the woodchipper at any of the stuff. That's funny. Yeah. We'll see. Yeah. It is, I mean, listen, we got, like I said, we got plenty on the doge shit coming up. Good. It's crazy. This last comment, let's check one more out from Jared. All red 50, 67. He says, what kind of shit are these guys on? Because I'm about to get on it. On point, haven't missed yet. Where is your crystal ball? What deals did you make with the supernatural? And in DJB shaman's. Trump's team be following your plans. DJ, you deserve another trophy and Andy needs another double dick goat as well. Triple dick. Triple dick. So I do believe that there, you know, people are listening to our plans because it is something that seems to happen right after we talk about that. It's happening. Yeah, I like it. Yeah. But I appreciate you, Jared. I don't know about DJing another trophy, but let's fuck up. Yeah. But we didn't make any deals with the supernatural, it's just called, you know, paying attention. Yeah. It's the, you know, that's what it is. It's the free mason's. It's my, it comes with my free mason membership. It's included in the, in the bylaws comes in the, yeah, they tell me what's up. Yeah, that's right. 100%. Actually, I got one more for you. I did it quickly from Marvin, Marvin Sir joiner soldier 6884. He says, I was watching the show on the big TV in the basement and my dad walked in and said, since when should night got out of prison? This is the most accurate comparison we can make on DJ. That's pretty funny. Yeah, that's funny. Let's shake morning. All right, fix it. Guys, we appreciate you for being real ass fans. Make sure you guys keep liking, keep commenting. Make sure you guys are subscribed and hit that bell notification on the YouTube to stay up to date with the latest episodes from really, if that being said, let's get deeper into the cruise. We're going to headline number two. Held on number two reads, White House press secretary Carolyn Levitt delivers a brutal reminder to Democrats melting down over USAID shutting down. Also sites for more insane examples of USAID waste. So during a Wednesday briefing, Lovid addressed topics such as Trump's imminent shutdown of the United States Agency for International Development, Border Security and a successful tariff threat against Canada and Mexico and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit on Tuesday. She had plenty to say regarding USAID after or including far less political receiving millions, but she saved her harshest words for Democrats melting down like babies over the agency potentially disappearing. Let's check this clip out. And we're going to get into this shit. Let's check this out. And one more thing before I wrap up because I do want to get to these meetings and I will see you all at the EO signing later this afternoon, I would just say that you brought to mind California and North Carolina who continue to be on our hearts and the president and this administration are committed to ensuring that these individuals get the funding that they need. And I would just say a strong message to Democrats who are out there pretending to be outraged about the long list of crap that this administration is cutting federal waste and funding like $2 million for sex changes in Guatemala, $6 million to fund tourism in Egypt, $20 million on a new Sesame Street show in Iraq, $4.5 million to combat disinformation in Kazakhstan. I could go on and on and I'm happy to provide this list to every single one of you. Democrats are outraged that the American people want to be, they want their taxpayers going to good uses, not stuff like this. But then they're very quiet about the fact that there are still North Carolinians and people in California who have lost everything and in the last four years this federal government did nothing to help them. This president will continue to put Americans first and I think the successes of this week so far speak to that and it's only Wednesday. So I'll see you guys later this week and we'll see you this afternoon. Thank you very much. She's such a boss. Yeah, she's such a boss. Listen man, for the amount of shit that's been stolen for the last, we should not be paying any income tax. I used to say 10%, we shouldn't be paying any for a long-ass time. They already stole all the money. They already got it. They already got it. It's infuriating, dude. Well, we got to dive into this. Yeah. Now, a lot of things have happened. Okay. And we're going to go through all of the, we're going to trace all of this stuff back. But I do want to bring up just before that, you know, Trump gave an offer to a lot of federal employees to basically, you know, resign, take this buyout, severance pay. And I just want to give you guys updates this morning and start it with 40,000 federal workers have taken the Trump buyout offer. This is a three minutes ago that number is now up to 60,000. Good. I'm cool with that. Go ahead and dismiss yourselves. You know, but, but, but people are freaking out over this USAID stuff, right? You got people like Bernie Chuck Schumer, right, Democrat of New York. He said that Musk was operating a shadow government that put all government services at risk. He says, quote, if Dodge attacks USAID today, then you can be sure they'll move on to another target tomorrow. Who knows? Maybe it'll be the postal service or the IRS or even the Social Security Administration. He said, yes. Well, I mean, I don't agree with the postal service, but the IRS and Social Security, I don't think a single person has a problem with that. My thing is, if it's happening here, it's happening fucking everywhere. Well, I'm just saying I think there's a lot of good postal workers deserve to keep their jobs. They use some innovation and I think they could use some updated non-bureaucratic systems and better trucks. I don't know. I never drove one, but my point is is the IRS for sure, Social Security Administration for sure, Chuck, you're not doing a very good job of selling your point of view. You know, and yeah, and you talking about a shadow government is comical, especially when we find out that this USAID is funding places like Politico, okay? And all kinds of propaganda that's all far left communist shit and has been for a long time. All right? So you guys are in, it's whatever, do anybody crying about this is caught because that's how they've been making their money. We talked about this on last show about how these guys, you know, like do you really think there was a single sex change in Kazakhstan that actually happened? No, they sent all this money over there and then they kept it. So they said they wrote it into a bill or whatever they did. They said they were sending it and then they kept it and then they sent, you know, five bucks over there or something, right? I mean, no, you look at like places like Haiti, right? USID USAID sent Haiti $50 billion since 2% made it. Yeah. So what was the foundation that was in charge of all the quote unquote, looking out for Haiti? Who was that? Oh, that was the Clinton foundation. That was all Hillary and Bill. Hmm, shocking. So we're missing $48 billion. No, we're missing $49 billion and we don't know where it went. Okay. But like these people, they want to get out in the streets and lose their shit. No, they don't. Nobody's out in the streets losing their shit. This is a bunch of old fox, like Maxine Waters and Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton who have been fleecing the country for 70 years. And this is where all the money that they sent over to Ukraine went. They kept sending more and more and more and more and more and more because they understood that Trump was going to win and the house was going to be clean and they were going to lose their unlimited resources of money. The spiket was being turned off and so they kept sending it. They knew what was going to happen and this is why they did it and they ran our economy into the ground intentionally. These people are traders and they should all be dealt with as traders. Period. Every single person that stole or embezzled or took any tax dollars and it ended up in their personal account or any sort of account like Chelsea Clinton. We're going to talk about that in a second. I'm sure those people should all be in fucking jail. All of them. All of them. All of them do. Yeah. I mean, but like have you seen the clips? We got people. Dude, I was getting gas this morning on the way to work. We got people that are, you know, clicking the gas pump to $8 because that's all they got. You got Chelsea Clinton getting $80 something million of our tax money and billions of it going to her family and who knows where else? Bro, all of these people deserve to go to jail and real talk. They deserve more than jail because this mentality of I rule over you has to be eliminated completely. All right. That is a, that is a mentality that will always be there. Those people fundamentally believe that they are entitled because they are better than you and me and everybody else. These people should be dealt with harshly. They should be dealt with like traders and that's the bottom line, dude. Like why, why, why are these people like this is our money? I do to dude was clicking the fucking gas pump to $8 this morning. You know what I'm saying? And this guy had a work truck. He's working. It's not like he's just, dude, he had his work truck. He had pipes on it. Like this guy was doing an electric and conduit. You know what I'm saying? Like there's no reason that are working class and are middle class and are people that work for a living should be struggling like that. Now obviously I understand some people are irresponsible with their money. I understand that. But that is not the case in this country right now. In this country right now, people are taxed into poverty for a reason. And the reason is so that they can steal it. And in the same breath, they can create a situation where people are so busy trying to survive that they can't even understand how their money's being stolen. The fact that we pay this money in tax at all is it's insane. It's absurd. Any other people in the history of our country would have revolted already. But see, we were born into it. We were born into this. We've been told and lied to and propagated a good American pays their tax. You should be proud to pay your tax. You're doing your duty. You're a patriot for wanting to pay your tax. Shut the fuck up dude. You're fucking stealing our money. And then you're taking the money that you stole to create that narrative to us. This is bullshit dude. And it needs to stop now. And if Donald Trump and these dudes don't hold these people accountable, they're just as bad. That's the truth. Okay. And I think they're doing great shit. These people need accountability and it needs to be harsh and it needs to be real so that it never happens again. Yeah. Dude, let's watch some of these fucking senators. You mentioned Maxine Waters, Chuck Schumer. Let's see this shit. We won't rest. We won't rest. We won't rest. No one elected Elon Musk to nothing. That's right. Not one demo. No one elected George Soros. No one elected Claus Schwab. No one elected all these left-wing ultra billionaires who became billionaires because people like you stole our money and then filtered it in the back door deals with these motherfuckers. Okay. Okay. Nobody elected those people either. Not one Democrat in America voted for Elon Musk. What we not gonna do is stand around what I'd pull this bull. We are gonna be in your face. We are gonna be on your f**k. We will see you in the courts and Congress and the streets. Elon Musk is a Nazi-Nepal baby. Every movement needs to scrape a little f**k and I am the person. I need each and every one of you to get in touch with your inner scrappy little f**k. Nobody elected your f**k. This is not Elon Musk's country. Take your foot off my neck. We are at war. Shit don't work anymore bro. It's a joke that CNN was laughing about it. They're doomed. CNN, look at these people bro. All of these people are telling on themselves because the reason they're upset is because they're getting money from this program. Mm-hmm. Well I mean, until you're a point about how are you gonna cheer against and try to rally against people's tax dollars being embezzled in the end of shit. They're up there talking up like this is some sort of civil rights. What is the point? What are you protesting? You're protesting your own well-being and you think that these people are so f**king stupid that they're gonna be with you. Nobody's with you. Nobody's with you. But it's interesting though, right? To your point of like, they're condemning all of these great things that have happened. Why? That's a great question to ask. And then more importantly, just like you know they did in 2016, 2017, they have to stop it. And how do they stop it? Well we got a representative here. This is representative of our green. Here comes the impeachments. The president should be impeached. I said that on the floor of the house. He should be impeached. I rise to announce that I will bring articles of impeachment against the president for destiny deeds proposed and destiny deeds done. But it should be because he's unfit to be president. This is the plan. Protest, complain now, impeach later. Let's get to calls because the lines are pressed in the other direction. Richard and Savannah Georgia Republican, you're a first secretary. Thank you. I watched you yesterday with the Democrat Party out protesting everything that the Elon Musk is trying to do to the American people. The USAID is a 100% of money laundering scheme around the world. Kick back, back to the Democrat Party, whether it's through the Clinton Foundation in $84.4 billion and $84 million went to her daughter, Chauclenton. All y'all have is impeachments and race and gender, et cetera. And you actually do nothing for the people of America today. I think the Democrats should sit back and let America see what it's like to reduce the people in government, the wasteful spending. And all y'all can do is just complain and be negative. And we're sick of it. Yeah, that's exactly right. I'm sure that's what the electrician at the gas pump would say to you know, and like, I mean, it is what it is. There's already benefits you got, you know, and it's helping the migrant process as well. The NGOs, they have to shut other migrant shelters, as releases, end-of-money drives up. So that's great. But let's dive through a few more of these examples of where this money was going and what USAID was actually sending their money to. Let's go to a good friend of ours. Senator Eric Schmidt, he's breaking down some of this spending. Because you can't really defend this kind of stuff. 45 million for diversity and inclusion scholarships in Burma. Three million for a girl-centered climate action in Brazil. 125 million to racialized public health. 288,000 for diverse bird-warsher groups. USAID, which is in the center of the storm right now and rightfully so, spent 1.5 billion to quote advanced diversity, equity, inclusion in Serbia's workplaces and business communities. 70,000 for the production of a DEI musical in Ireland. 2.5 billion for electric vehicles for Vietnam. 47,000 for a transgender opera in Colombia. Not Columbia, Missouri or Columbia, South Carolina. The country of Colombia. 32,000 for a transgender comic book in Peru. 2 million for sex changes and LGBT activism in Guatemala. 6 billion to fund tourism in Egypt. This is what they're mad about. We are. And you notice that it's all overseas so that you and me and everybody else can't really see if they do it or not. Yeah, places will never go. We'll never know. Was there actually a DEI musical in Ireland? And what kind of musical costs $70,000? You know what I'm saying? Well, I mean, here's some other things for you, right? Like, I mean, it's also been- Why are we spending any money on any of this shit? On anything? On any of it? Yeah, I mean, it makes zero sense. But it's not just so much sense. That's my sense because this is how they're stealing the money. Well, no, people got to understand this. People have to understand they are stealing your money. They have been stealing your money your entire lives. Well, Democrat and Republican, they've been in on this scam since this was created in 1963. Okay. So all you guys, you say, well, my favorite politician is this guy or my favorite politician is that guy from the past. Heads, stealing from you. Oh, you're in the greatest country in the world. You guys are free. We're free. You tax us at 50% and are more all in when you add up income tax, property tax, sales tax, estate tax, etc, etc. Death tax, you tax the die. Yeah, that's true. People don't even understand that. You tax the die. You could work your whole life and you're going to get fucking half your shit taken that you've accumulated and already paid tax to produce exactly. It's insane, dude. And dude, after all of this shit, like we shouldn't have any tax in this country. We shouldn't have any. It should be all fucking tariffs. It should be zero tax. It's fucking bullshit. Bulls you would fucking bloom. I know. Awesome. That's the crazy thing. But I mean, like, where else? I guess not. Okay. Okay. The transient issue. Like I've been saying this for years and years and years and people are like, oh, dude, you paranoid. Oh, you don't even know how the shit works. Oh, I don't. The fuck just happened. And they're just getting started, bro. No shit. That's the other thing people don't understand. They're just getting started. Not just USAID. Okay. Someone said I saw on the internet. They're like, well, that only represents 1% of the budget. Yeah, I know. But they do this on everything here too, right? Why is it that everything that the government does cost 4,000 times as much as it should? Oh, by the way, the insurance companies do it to you too. You think aspirin really costs $800 fucking dollars? Right. Okay. We are getting fleeced by our government systems and we need a complete reformation. And so far, it looks pretty good that that may happen. But until it happens, I'm not going to get excited about it because you know what? I'm still getting taxes taken out of my shit. I still got to pay extra like how does this make you guys feel about paying taxes? You're paying taxes to people. Oh, nothing you actually voted for, bro. Bro, it's insane. Nobody, like none of these things are fucking votes. Like we didn't get to vote. These wasn't propositions. You didn't vote for $288,000 to diverse bird watching groups. No. Like, you know what I'm saying? But it's like, the more scary dangerous part is kind of like two two people. These are the pieces to it. I mean, like, again, like one, this is one, yeah, 1%. They're just getting this ain't even like the fucking fool. The lit ain't even off the can yet, bro. Yeah. Right? But it wasn't just diverse bird watches this shit went to. I mean, there's more sinister stuff. I mean, it's funding enemies. It's, you know, they found USAID care packages with Hezbollah weapons and Lebanon. Right. And I mean, think back to the fucking, the Afghanistan with draw. Like how much money we left just left behind intentionally. It was all intentional. It was all fucking intentional. Now something more sinister. I mean, we're going to this kind of increases as we go by. But yeah, of course it's intentional because not only do you leave the equipment there. Now, now if you leave the equipment there, what does that mean? It means you have less equipment here, which means what? You got to build new equipment, which means what? They can overcharge for the new equipment and get kickbacks on that shit. Because they're going to need the new equipment to fight the people who took the old equipment. Yeah. I mean, it's like, it's crazy. But even more citizens that we got to talk about this political shit that went down. This head on means White House confirms millions of taxpayer dollars went to Politico. Millions. All right. And I've seen the number kind of range around, or I've seen it from eight million up to like 34, 35 million dollars. That was funneled from USAID. Why is it just a Politico? There was a whole bunch of. All of it. It's all of it. It's all of it. It's all of it. But we're going to focus it on Politico because this one, I mean, we've covered a bunch of Politico headlines here as well. But when you talk about the narrative that was being driven into culture, that it was attempted to be driven into society, and to know that these were not just some fru-fru-journalist writing this shit. These people were literally paid by our government to do it. I mean, you look back at some of the fucking headlines that Politico, the rights fascism problem, Pizzagate, Q and N on the Epstein list, why the far right is just looked at the fact that they're putting that out. Tells you right now, that's true. It tells you that's true. If they're putting out shit against Pizzagate in this child trafficking and how everybody's crazy for looking at it and the government's paying for it, what does that say? It was all true. Fucking right, bro. It was all fun. We're going to find out. It was all true. Yeah. And just not too long ago, the vice presidential candidate for the Democrats, right? Tim Walls, remember what Politico did to him, right? Said that his wide eyes showed his passion, but yet JD Vance's beard had potential ties to white supremacy, right? Like, yeah. This is the shit that they were doing. Yeah. Right? They were the mouthpiece of the government. And we thought it was just Twitter files. And we knew the media was corrupt, but like now we know here is the actual proof of how we've been living in a real... The legitimate matrix, okay? They've been taking our money and then turn around and spend it on things to oppress us and mislead us and lie to us and create false narratives with a whole bunch of people, half the people. Now, the bigger question is, is how do you get that half of the people to unbrainwash? You see what I'm saying? It's going to be hard. It's going to be really hard because you got people again, Chuck Schumer, tweeting this shit out. An unelected shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover of the federal government. Doge is not a real government agency. Doge has no authority to make spinning decisions. Doge has no authority to shut programs down or to ignore federal law. Doge's conduct cannot be allowed to stay in Congress. Must take action to restore the rule of law. Look who retweeted that. Yeah. Alex, for this. Like, bro, what the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, but George Soros can fund every single prosecutor in every blue city across the country and basically tell them not to prosecute crimes so that we have massive amounts of death and destruction in our cities. Here's a more sinister piece to it, right? Because again, political, $8 million, $34, $8 to $34. They have a lot of nerve to sit there and say, it's the white man and it's the Republicans and it's that mess in this. When the Soros group is literally creating chaos in the black communities, they've paid all these prosecutors to not prosecute violent criminals and then they've convinced everybody that it's white dudes that are doing it. Like what are you talking about, dude? It's wild. But as you alluded to it, it wasn't just political. It wasn't just political. Look at this. USAID was spending $268 million to fund over $6,000 approved journalists while at the same time spending millions to silence conservative, independent media like the Gateway Pundit. So not only were they, you know, the Twitter files which uncovered a bunch of stuff, not only were they trying to silence and shadow ban and cancel. They were paying to post the articles and and and lift up the other side. Yeah. Right? I don't know. What's the quick math on that? How much is that per journalist right there? 28 million. 268 million. About about 6,000. 45,000 a piece. It's not bad. But you have, I mean, they're basically selling their souls for that. Jesus. It's crazy. You know, and one of the interesting pieces with all of this, you know, and again, it's been, there's proof here, right? This is a one of these, these these NGOs, okay, called Relentless Development, okay? And very quickly, you can see who their funders are, okay? The Obama Foundation, again, USAID, HHS, Clinton and those initiative Bill Gates, you in. Right? All of these, you know, common contenders we see with all of the other issues going on in this country. And the Foundation here, they were, you know, pushing young leaders to create a better world by, you know, following the narratives that were assigned to them by those same donors is how it, that's how it worked. Yeah. Now, if that doesn't get worse, today, just before the show was recorded, Michael Schellenberger exposes the shocking USAID and CIA connections to Trump's impeachment. Have you seen this? No. Let's check this out. Do you have this new piece on sub-stack that the USAID and the CIA helped orchestrate Trump's impeachment? Yeah, I mean, just say it's a crazy story. I mean, you might forget that, you know, the House of Representatives impeached President Trump in December of 2019. Many people may not remember that it was a CIA analyst who was left over from the Obama White House who wrote the memo that led to the impeachment. It was all based on hearsay. The person had not actually been in the room with Trump. Nonetheless, this memo that he wrote relied heavily on a report done by an organization funded by USAID. In fact, it's initial founding funding. I mean, now it's tens of millions of dollars had gone into the group called the organized crime encryption reporting project, a name that's not very memorable, OCCRP, but it was basically created as an extension of the State Department and then of USAID. And as you know, Jesse, this is very serious to be involved in an effort to do regime change at home as we've been discovering as the files have come out with what Elon Musk has been doing. We know that USAID was really about regime change abroad. It was a kind of public facing part, you know, regime change operation like CIA, but not covert, more overt. Well now you see a similar blowback, just like they did censorship abroad and brought censorship tools back home. They were doing this sort of thing abroad, creating a predicate essentially for Trump's impeachment. So I think it's just one of many revelations that we'll see coming out in the next. So USAID was involved in regime change abroad and here at home. Very interesting. If you want to read more about what Mike's talking about, go to his sub-stack after the show. Don't go right now. Go after the show. Thanks, Mike. I mean, dude, look, look, it's just one of a whole bunch of other stuff and they're screaming and crying right now because they don't want any more digging because I promise you do the big, the big discoveries haven't even been made yet. No, it's just getting started, bro. Eric Schmidt had a good clip today. He was like, you know, it's annoying. Or he said, it's unbelievable that I, you know, that I hear this with fellow congressmen and women where, you know, they say, oh, it's just 1.5. It's just $4 million. It's just $3 million. Well, tell that to the dude at the gas station down here. Right. You know what I'm saying? Like this is insane, dude. These people, I mean, look, man, they're all traders and they took an oath to represent the people of this country. They violated that. They've stolen the money. They all deserve to be dealt with every single one of them that took a fucking dollar. 100% guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let's know what you guys think. Now, without being so, let's get to our third and final headline. We got headline number three. Let's talk about a little foreign policy, I guess, a little update on the deportation going on in this country. Did you see this, this, this headline reads, Saladorian president offers to house US inmates from any nation for fee. Did you see this? Yeah. How sick would that be? I mean, it'd be great unless you're one of those people. You know, the president of El Salvador told US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that his country is willing to take convicted criminals from American prisons and lock them up in his country. The offer came in meetings on Tuesday with Secretary Rubio who was on his first foreign tour after being confirmed by the Senate. Here is the official tweet from El Salvador's president. He says, quote, we have offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system. We are willing to take in only convicted criminals, including convicted US citizens into our mega prison or set-cott in exchange for fee. The fee would be relatively low for the United States, but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable. Now I feel like we probably covered, I know we have covered the prison systems over there. I mean, then this dude came in, got elected, and within a few months. Yeah, I had everything cleaned up. Every fucking thing. Yeah. And bro, like these dudes, like who are fucking murderers and shit over there and rapists. And I mean, bro, they're in fucking line. They make them sit fucking balls of all. You know what I'm saying? I wouldn't want to be over there. I wouldn't be over there, but I'm down with sending some people over there. I'm not opposed to it. But not just the convicted criminals. Why? Why would we send violent criminals anywhere? Why wouldn't we just dispose of them? Why would we pay our, and we paid enough tax for these, for this bullshit? Well, that's the thing. I think, I think a twofold, right? I mean, bro, if you hurt, if you, or if you're a violent criminal, rape, murder, all this shit, like peace. You know what I'm saying? I'm down with it. I'm down with it. I mean, the prison system here in this country's fucked too, which is another thing that needs to be looked into because most of it's privatized now, right? And the same people that are making money off of USID are also building these fucking prisons, shockingly enough, and they're profiting off of that shit. So I say stop all the profits. I'm down with it. But not just the convicted criminals should be going there. Did you see this? New Jersey governor, Phil Murphy's office, backtracks after he implies he is sheltering migrant. Did you see this shit? I saw he said he was. He did shelter migrant, but I didn't see this. Yeah, he backtracked now. So New Jersey's governor, Phil Murphy, his office backtracked after the governor seemed to imply during an interview that he was sheltering an illegal alien in his home. See, the governor of New Jersey, practically, adhering the agency to come to his own home, Democratic governor Phil Murphy declared on Saturday that he and the first lady are allowing someone pursuing legal status to stay at their home. The governor a little vague on this, but the bold admission came in an event during a broader discussion about the policies of the New Trump administration. Here is the governor. Listen. Tammy and I were talking about, I don't want to get into too much detail, but there's someone in our broader universe whose immigration status is not yet at the point that they are trying to get it to. And we said, you know what, let's ever live at our house above our garage and good luck to the feds coming in to try to get her. First of all, pretty interesting. The state's attorney general. He's lying. Okay. He didn't take nobody. No, he didn't take anybody in. Second of all, Phil Murphy is a fucking asshole. He's a cocky fuck. He is one of these guys who thinks he can wield the hammer that I rule over you. Look how he handled COVID, dude. Look what he did. I mean, he was on the street with no mask and everybody was yelling at him, screaming at him. He's like, what are you going to do? Like this guy's a, these people that think they're above the law need to all be dealt with, dude. 100%. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Send us as a fucking else to have a door. Yeah. Listen, no mercy, no mercy on me. I agree. Now, we got our own issues here in this country we've been working on and Trump made a very interesting play. He's passed a couple of days, concerning what's been happening over in Israel and Palestine in Middle East. Let's talk about it. Trump. The United States will take over Gaza. We will own it. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the United States would take over Gaza, remove debris, tunnels and explosives left there by him, I asked after the war with Israel, adding that he saw America taking a quote long term ownership position. Let's check his actual words. Let's see what he said. The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it, too. We will own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area to a real job, do something different. Just can't go back. If you go back, it's going to end up the same way it has for 100 years. You also added that the US would be developing Gaza economically, sending troops if necessary, making some investments. We called it the potential of Gaza unbelievable. But he said the Palestinian control of Gaza will never work. He added, you have to learn from history. We have an opportunity to do something phenomenal, the river era of the Middle East. When he said that he envisioned the world's people, quote, the world's people living there, he adding quote, I think you'll make Gaza into an international, unbelievable place. I think the potential in the Gaza strip is unbelievable. And I think the entire world, representatives from all over the world will be there. And of course, you know, you got the left wings now. They're jumping in on the conversation, saying that genocide Joe never looks so good. And it's just to play by all the big media heads, mainstream media, of course. Wednesday morning, they set their native. Genocide Joe never looks so good. That was Washington's post. You got the sun, saying Greenland, Panama, Canada, and now Gaza. The sun will never set on Trump's colonial empire. NPR wrote a headline that quote, Trump says the US will take over Gaza and relocate its people. What does it mean? And yeah, so what do we got on this? Well, first of all, if it's surface level and he's just saying we're going to go take it over. And this and that, I do not support that at all. We have too many problems here. I do not think I do not support or believe that we should be spending any money or any resources anywhere else in the world to do anything like this. So if it's what he's saying at surface level, I am 100% in disagreement with that. We shouldn't be spending money anywhere until our people are taken care of. I can't decide if that is something that he means literally, or if he's playing chess and trying to intimidate or threaten. I don't know if he's trying to stop, basically stop Israel from doing what Israel does, which is stir the pot over and over and over again with the people around him for the last 100 years almost. 80 years, bombing and doing all this shit. I don't know what to think yet because I don't know what I can't tell what the end game is here. If I had to guess what the end game is here, I'm just speculating on my own observations. If the United States does this, this is going to make the Muslim world hate Israel even more than it already does, like way more, which is likely to create a scenario where Israel is being terrorized or attacked by the three billion Muslims globally, when there's 14 million Jewish people. If the United States takes over Gaza and then they allow that pipeline to go through, and Israel is getting attacked because they pissed off the whole Muslim world, I could see potentially later, I think I've mentioned this on the show before, where they actually relocate people from Israel somewhere else, like Ukraine. There's nobody there now. Well, they fucking killed all the men. I know that sounds like way out there, but whoever thought you'd see Donald Trump say we're taking over Gaza. Well, if you see, there was another video angle. I just feel like we see all the anti-Jewish talk on the internet. People are like, Zion Don, just doing what Zion Don does. I think it's deeper than that. I think there's been a lot of people to hate a lot of people right now. And I think it's wrong to hate entire groups of people. We're not talking, I mean, dude, you guys look at Americans. Americans and America's government don't necessarily represent each other. We could go to any country, and there's big groups of people that don't fall in line with the actual ruling government. And that's no different in Israel. There's a bunch of people that live in Israel that are Jewish that do not agree with Netanyahu. In fact, he was about to get kicked out before October 7th happened. It's hard to tell what's going to happen, man. And, you know, I'm not one of these people that jumps in on the groupthink or the mind, you know, like I'm not a no matter what Trump does. He's right. Like, I don't know. I don't think that. Like I'm an America first people. I believe that our country and our people should be taken care of first. I don't believe that we should be spending any money overseas for fucking anything until our place looks and feels and produces. And our citizens have the kind of life that they deserve here in this country. And so my opinion on this, you know, is like, dude, yeah, okay, Greenland, that makes sense. That's a strategic strategic advantage Canada, you know, they don't have a functioning government that really works. That kind of makes sense. Israel or Gaza Strip across the globe halfway over there, you know, no, that doesn't make sense. And, you know, maybe he's just going to orchestrate that. Maybe he's just going to facilitate the building. Maybe it's not going to include Americans being there or troops being there or indefinitely it shouldn't include any of our money being spent. There's a lot of rich nations around there that should be contributing to that. And, you know, I don't know, like I don't think Palestinians feel real good about having their, you know, getting evicted from their home or it's not going to be a good thing. And from their home or exterminated like now that we look at like this move that was made, I mean, really it has been a sort of a genocide. You know what I mean? Like let's clear out the land so we can do something with it. And I can't get down with that, bro, that's not right. You know, and this isn't about, you know, anti anything. This is about America first and what our responsibilities are for our government. And nowhere in our government, nowhere in our constitution does it say we pay money for other countries to benefit. Doesn't say that. That's not our role. That shouldn't be our role. Not a role. No. And, you know, real talk, dude, Israel should have to deal with the consequences that it creates for itself. That's the truth. Okay. They were, they were given a piece of land that we help facilitate. Great Britain helped facilitate with the Balfour agreement or the Balfour Declaration, you know. And, you know, I don't know, man, it's not, it's not like to me, it's not something that should be on our list of responsibilities at all. No concerns. I agree with you 100%. And I mean, to your point to the, you know, this whole relocating thing, again, it's not like this is the first time that's happened. Yeah. This is not the first time that's happened. And, well, I just don't, you know, like, dude, I just don't. I mean, dude, like, like I've been saying on the show for years and years and years, we need to be, we need to be dealing with the people who actually make the decisions, not in labeling entire groups of this or that. Like, you can't label all of Palestine's terrorists. You can't label all black people criminals and you can't label all Jewish people, you know, these corrupt, you know, whatever the fuck, you know, it's the people that run these countries that are doing the fucked up shit, you know what I mean? And I don't know. I'm just, I'm tired of seeing our money go anywhere else besides here. And I know I can't get down with this at all. If it's, that's the surface level thing for sure. I also, I mean, I also think to like, I'll try to play devil's advocate man and nothing that Trump does. I can look at, you know, you may like, you know, you always doing this. I was like, man, why is he doing it? Oh, shit. That's why he's doing that. He's very strategic. Yeah. My great stuff. And so like, I have a little faith call it, hope cautiously optimistic, whatever you want to call it, man. But there's definitely something there. There's something there's something deeper that's going to happen. Yeah, I agree with that. You know, that's why I said, I don't think it's as much as like people are like, oh, Don's owned by Israel. I don't, I don't think that's it. No, I feel like there's more to it. And because that was the case. I mean, if that's the case, everybody's fucked anyway. Exactly. Exactly. Well, I'm not saying this to you. I mean, like if that was the case, though, we wouldn't be seeing impediments from, you know, already starting three weeks into his term. Yeah. You know, so it's like, we're, I think we have to wait and see on this. We got to see why I haven't said anything about it. So everybody's so quick to jump on these and make the make opinions about this. I just, I just don't really, the only opinion I have is that we shouldn't be paying for it. And we shouldn't be getting involved in it. And our troops shouldn't be putting any sort of danger for that. Not our neighbors, brothers, sisters, nobody. That's what I think. Whatever else happens, it is what it is. Yeah. Guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. I was that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. Got thumbs up at dumbest fuck. That's where we bring a headline in. We talk about it to get one of those two options. So with that being said, a thumbs up, or a dumbest fuck headline reads, man, taking credit for mysterious viral prank in Oregon speaks out. This is an interesting one. All right. So the mystery behind a viral prank that is unveiled after sparking a controversy in BAND Oregon, locals in the community began spotting Google eyes, Google eyes plastered onto different sculptures around the city. And December city of bid officials took the Facebook to ward off whoever was behind the prank. Quote, we love our roundabout art and BAND. So let's do our part to take care of it. While the Google eyes placed on the various art pieces around the town might give you a chuckle, it costs money to remove them with care to not damage the art, the post read. But the man behind the Google eyes, Jeff Keif, spoke with the Associated Press, revealing that he used duct tape to attach the eyes to the sculpture. He says, quote, I think the biggest thing is for me just to get a laugh. When I come up on those on these roundabouts and I see families laughing, like hysterically laughing at these, it makes for a good time. Keith told, so here's some pictures of the sculptures and his work. Now, this is where it gets, again, you know, government efficiency here. Oh no, they're lying about how much it costs to take them down. $1500. Yeah, I know. $1500. I know, they're lying. Yeah, I saw that. I picked that up right away. The guy used duct tape. This is fucking metal. It's damaged to those fucking sculptures. Fuck out of here, dude. Yeah, I know. I know, I must go there, bro. So I'm going on and bid. I don't know. It's everywhere. It's from top to bottom. This is shit is happening. This is not just happening at the federal level. This is happening at the state level. It's happening at the county level. This is the way the government works. And this is why so many people that can't cut it in real world find their way into the political system. Because they know that if they go along, keep their mouth shut, their palms are going to get greased. That's reality, dude. And everybody who's ever been close to politics knows that's reality. You could fucking see it. I like the sculpture. Yeah, I do too. I like the Google. Yeah, it's just a fucking metal ball. I don't know what that... That big product cost $5 really. No shit. Exactly. Yeah. $5 million in $1500. Well, I mean, like, hey, bro, I got this energy drink here. I ask you how much it is. How much is it? It's $400. Really? Yeah. Actually, it's $800. $800 bucks. Yeah. See, I just, I went to the store and bought it for two. Uh-huh. And then I keep the rest. Gotcha. That's how that works. Got it. I mean, like, I know as funny as that sounds, that's the level of scamming that's happening. Like, dude, the hospital is charged $7,800 for fucking aspirin that you can get for $4 entire bottle. Oh, T.C. Okay. Like, but, dude, people accept it. And until people stop accepting this blatant gouging of the individual, that'll come from you. If we want being gouged the way and having our money embezzled and our tax money stolen, the way that it is, dude, every single person listening to this, you would be well off. If you're not stupid, you're not stupid. Yeah. You're money. 100%. What we got for Jeff here? I mean, I give Jeff thumbs up. I give the government that thumbs down. Good one. That's always though. I'm always gonna give the government up. I love it, man. Well, guys, Andy, that's all I got. All right, guys. Don't be a hool. Show the show. We're from sleeping on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck a boat. Fuck a stove. Counting millions in a coke. Bad bitch. Booted slow. Got a own bank road. Cankfold. Doesn't know. Here's shot case. Go, go.
