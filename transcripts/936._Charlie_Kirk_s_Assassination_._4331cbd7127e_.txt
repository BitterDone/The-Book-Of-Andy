Dude what's going on man? Oh nothing. It's a lot Yeah, there's a lot going on. Yeah, there's a lot. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I don't really know how you intro it Yeah, I don't feel like it's really even appropriate. Yeah It's tough, but uh Well, obviously get into it Let's just get to it guys as always remember we got the live chat rolling Guys would like to be a part of that check the link in the description below Today is September 11th when we're recording Which is like do that listen there's so much shit going on I don't know what to how to look how to process how to feel but as always guys we're our goal here is to just try to connect some dots and Just be a voice of reason for everybody. That's what we're gonna try to do pay the fee as always All that good stuff Yeah, September 11th 24 years it's 24th anniversary of 9-eleven. So that that's going on today. That's kind of Big thing there's a there's a big group of lawmakers that are heading up there. I think Trump made a visit to the Pentagon But obviously that is being overshadowed Unfortunately and kind of running congruent, I guess if you will with situation that happened yesterday Which is also going to be our first headline Charlie Kirk man Charlie Kirk assassination Person of interest released gunman is still at large. This is from the FBI And like obviously we got a lot we're diving on a bunch of this things that are going on A bunch of this things that we know that are happening right now But I got me dude, I guess I just want to say like my I'm it hurts bro And I didn't know Charlie personally or anything like that You know, I know he was married two young kids It's sick man It's it's sick And sick and I think one thing too that also really bothered me about the situation Situation and I think you know, maybe it's just the risk Well kind of like the trade-off I guess you get with the speed of the internet and communication, but it's like how quickly the videos Just started going and like there was no stopping it and it was everywhere I just started feeling for his wife man of just like like I could not imagine that just You know I'm saying just out in the open just constantly was right there. So was this kids? Yeah, just so we're clear. See I didn't I didn't know that. Yeah, I didn't know that Did I don't I don't wish I mean It's tough man It's tough. So yeah, let's just go through what what we know. It's publicly out there and then obviously we're gonna have a little talk about it But you know Charlie Kirk he was assassinated yesterday At a college this was his kickoff tour, you know, he does these college campus tours And he was assassinated yesterday 23 minutes or so into that event We've all seen the clips of how these events goes. It's kind of like an open mic You know people come up there change my mind. I think it's how we kind of got going to prove me wrong Type of just open free debates. I guess if you will And A lot of stuff has been coming out a lot of things have been coming out about this obviously there's a lot of speculation and things that are still going on and In situations like this. That's what happens when you know, I would say Transparency isn't going at the speed that you know, the public wants it obviously Dots and conclusions start to get drawn and come to But what we do know is that there are some things that are going on in the public eye What we do know is that there were you know, obviously multiple clips going around Just be very clear. We're not playing the clip of that situation specifically But there was other angles that started coming out And one of the the chill the clips that came out it possibly shows Charlie Kirk's assassin on a rooftop Moments before and after the fatal shoe shooting at UVU So this is one of those clips again is showing the crowd is gonna zoom in to kind of like the rooftop To where you can see a silhouette and I got the still shots here in a second, but let's check this clip out Right after the shots fire And you kind of it's just quick. It's a quick clip, but when you slow it down You can kind of see That right there There is a person about 200 yards out On a rooftop All right. Now there was a lot of people at this event again. This was like the first kickoff of this specific tour at UVU There was a lot of people in attendance a lot of people but this is about 200 yards away from Where Charlie actually was? And then this shot again, you can see kind of circled in that there was a person and you see him moving off and running Shortly after the shot is fired You know and I remember watching this stuff as it was going on and kind of just monitoring the situation I remember and this went all over the internet, you know, they had somebody in custody, right? And there was these videos and pictures coming out of this like this old man pants around his knees In handcuffs being literally carried out by law enforcement For it then to come out that it wasn't him that he was not the shooter He was not the shooter a simple person of interest I guess if you will These are the allegedly he told them he was the shooter. He did he did and there's a video where he's on his knees Tell like tell I know I have right to remain exactly right exactly And so, you know me looking at this. I'm like, well, that's odd. Why would who would do that? Why would somebody do that if it wasn't someone else time to get away? It's extremely organized Like to me that that is a telltale sign of organization there is a organized scheme Yeah to intentionally, you know draw attention to yourself to law enforcement, right? Tell them you did it and so they put all of their resources manpower time and attention on you That gives all the time in the world for the actual person who did it to go away and to escape Now at the time of the recording in this person still not in custody. The FBI did just release Some still images of who they are saying is a person of interest tied to this Tied to Charlie Kirk's assassination. These are not great pictures. This is what the FBI released and I imagine they have better images, but this is what they just publicly released to the to the public now There was a lot of very weird things happening around this right and one of the first things I want to draw you guys to if you guys have not seen this yet is This this video is literally seconds after the shooting And it's from a POV inside the the crowd right in the front of the tent And there is a man who? Starts celebrating. All right, let's check this clip out So the audio taking it out Charlie is already on the on the ground there and this guy is literally Celebrating and not only is he celebrating though. He's looking back To the position to the point where the shot actually came from Okay smiling Well, not really. Okay, he where he's standing The sniper is to the right. So if you're looking at him If you're looking at him we're looking at from the left Mm-hmm that guy running around on the building was over that man's left shoulder, which would be our we're looking at his right Okay, his left shoulder. So I Saw this theory and I don't believe that he knew where it came from But he is certainly celebrating the dude's death. Yeah pretty instantaneous. Yeah And as we're but and I mean, here's the benefit of the internet is that you know People can typically find who you are pretty quick so this came out isn't that guy's name is Matt Tabber Who has been identified as a man cheering? and I went to his Instagram page He only had a story up zero posts and this was on a story I'm deleting my post because I want to not because of anyone's hate your negativity doesn't affect me. Yeah, not yet right now Again I'm just there's a lot going on here obviously President Trump delivered An address from the Oval Office. Yeah, I was weak as fuck. I agree He also ordered flags to be put at half staff. Yeah, that's weak as fuck, too He's posthumously giving the presidential medal of freedom. Yeah, does that bring him back to life? You know now And I'm sure everybody's seen it too, this is the other piece like I mean I'm talking about Literally infuriates me how fucking sick it is but all of these people that are celebrating Making these ignorant fucking comments ignorant posts. I Mean like do you fucking believe me now? Do you believe me now after sitting here watching these people? Celebrate this man's death. Do you do you will finally believe me that these people will fucking kill you if they get power again Do you finally believe me that they want you fucking dead? These are the disgusting immoral weak cowardly ineffective soy milk pieces of fucking shit that have no capacity for safety on them on themselves or Taking care of themselves. They're not equipped for violence and because we Continue to tolerate Behavior that is unacceptable to us as a society This is what happens All of the silence all of the times that you've tolerated All of these things that you knew were wrong because you were convinced that tolerance is some sort of virtue You were convinced that your own moral feelings of right and wrong Were hate and bigotry And even though you knew in your heart That all of this shit for the last decade was wrong you kept your fucking mouth shut to keep the peace and There's been people out here telling you That it's important to speak up. It's important to stand up It's important to use your voice and because the majority of Americans who believed That this shit going on in the world for the last 10 20 years was wrong and stayed silent about it That is what caused this assassination So let's be fucking real Okay, there's way more of us than there are of them and we've been convinced to Give them tolerance and give them space. But the reality is they have no Intention of giving us any tolerance or space back and when you give tolerance to the wrong people It's not noble It's suicide Just because you wouldn't do bad things to people doesn't mean other people won't do bad things to you And we've had it too good for too fucking long in this country. That's the truth. All right Civilizations don't crumble because of strong enemies. They crumble because of weak citizens They crumble because people are afraid to speak the truth They crumble because people assign tolerance where it doesn't belong to appear noble When you know that something's wrong and you tolerate it anyway, that's not nobility. That's fucking cowardice and Our collective cowardice as people who know right and wrong is what causes this shit And if you don't think that this wasn't a fucking attack on free speech, you're insane They're trying to tell every single person Every single person that if you speak out will fucking kill you Charlie Kirk wasn't the most aggressive person He was actually the only person that was willing to have open dialogue with the other side and they fucking killed him for it They're not gonna like what comes next Because I'm gonna tell you bro. I'm fucking done. I'm done tolerating any of this crazy Shit, I'm done tolerating fucking making any excuses or having any kind of empathy for these crazy fucks This is good versus motherfucking evil and we've known it for a long fucking time. Our leaders know it, you know it We all know it and we've all stayed silent and we've all tried to be good people and we've all let the Psychological warfare convince us that you know a little bit that we're maybe we could be a little more tolerant But the problem is they're not tolerant of us And if you're that naive and that's stupid To continue to give out tolerance to people Because you have been convinced to feel bad or feel guilty Those people will kill you and you don't understand I've been saying this for years I've caught so much heat for saying this over and over and over again Do you think that these people can be fucking reasoned with now? When you see them laugh their fucking asses off about a man and by the way Charlie Kirk is not my cup of tea, bro. He never has been he's far less aggressive than what I thought needed to be done Okay in my opinion he watered down the aggressiveness and the level of urgency that needed to happen But I admire the way that he did it. He led with Jesus. He led with God He did not apologize for that. He allowed people to have a say back Which is more than what I would allow for sure, bro So I have to commend and respect him for that. Yeah, okay, but here's the thing You guys that listen to this show and your friends and your family and everybody who's reasonable Needs to stand the fuck up and get motherfucking loud Because your silence and you're saying oh, well, I don't have a platform Oh, I don't want to confront my crazy aunt who thinks this and this and this that's the shit that allows this to happen and Now we're in a fucking shit storm because we have Millions of people out here who believe that this was a great thing and the reason they believe it was a great thing is because We've tolerated this fucking insane shit for the last 10 years This is not a few crazy people. This is a communist Ideology that is repeating itself almost 80 years from the last time that it happened And if you would have read the fucking books that I've asked you to read like the fourth turning or rules for radicals You would be able to clearly see what was going on But no, that's too much effort No, it's too much effort to speak up and stand up man. I might get fired. Well fuck bro You let them take control. They're gonna put your family in a fucking camp They called the president Candidate for the Democratic Party stood in front of the country For fucking week before the election Calling everybody that wasn't gonna vote for her a fucking Nazi we've had years and years and years of these Democrats calling for violence and celebrating violence and saying they're thinking about blowing up the White House and fucking all this shit, bro, and What do they do they blame it on the conservatives every time there's not a single fucking one of these instances that hasn't been perpetrated by one of these communists left as fucks and We sit here and allow them to shame us into silence Allow them to pretend that they have the moral high ground Over us to tell us that we're fucking wrong for pointing out the obvious Things like a man is a man and a woman as a woman and we shouldn't be teaching our fucking kids how to Dicks are sucked when they're two and three years old or allowing our kids to become Opposite sex when they're five or letting teachers fucking groom children all of this shit contributes to this and Because people are too fucking weak to stand up and say no This is what we're what we get and broke I'm fucking pissed off Never ever ever Should ever anyone tolerate this crazy shit in front of their face ever again These fucking weak little pussy fucks who never got their ass beat and got told they were special they think they are immune and And they think they have a right and a justified right to commit violence and disrupt society They don't and it happens because you fucking allow it to happen Now Do you fucking believe me you think you can reason with these people When they're celebrating a fucking father's death his motherfucking brains coming out the side of his fucking neck You think you can fucking convince those people to be decent If you do you deserve what the fuck you get that's insane shit That's like walking into a fucking lion's cage with fucking stakes stuck all over you thinking it's a good idea You're a fucking idiot There are evil fucking people out here in the world and it's time that everybody that is fucking of common sense Unite together against it We are being played against each other Fucking all day long black white gay straight left right this that This is us versus fucking them bro, and us is the common sense People in America who want to fucking do good be good contribute be cool live their lives Make some motherfucking money and do the right thing raise a family pay their taxes do the shit and All these crazy fucks are on the other side and by the way so are the fucking elite government It is us versus them and until fucking all of us figure that the fuck out. We're gonna continue to lose We're gonna continue to get our asses beat you're gonna continue to see things like this happen over and over and over again God fucking pisses me off, dude it's like it's like the Fucking like that MSNBC anchor bro like the moment this shit happens He's reporting the O is probably one of the supporters all of these people should be in jail like all of these people who the press the fucking people who bit that the the Fucking what's that girls that black lady's name from fuck, California? Maxine waters all of these people who have been putting out all this violent rhetoric Obama Fucking all of them should be in fucking jail All of them and then they turn around and make these comments like oh, we're so sad I don't can't believe this happened to that's called cover your ass Because they understand what the fuck they just created when they say they don't want political violence. That's exactly what they want Then you have people in Congress today legitimately saying Every single time this happens. It's right-wing violence. Where the fuck is the right-wing violence? You don't even know right-wing violence, bro It hasn't even fucking started yet Fucking little fuck Yeah, like there's been so much that's been coming out about this and like here is the side that I don't know right like I don't know I Don't know how deep this is right could this have been a one-off person that is just triggered by the call to violence from the left Has been happened. Is this something that's more orchestrated? I don't know There's a lot of weird shit. It doesn't make a difference The bottom line is they're all connected Yeah, all of the people that could potentially be responsible for this are connected in the same ideology. Yeah, all of them You know people are complete, you know saying oh well it was a professional shot, you know fucking know that You don't know that you don't know that that's the actual picture of the the killer that they're giving us We don't know shit because they don't allow us to know shit We don't know anything. Oh It's a professional shot. It's 200 yards away motherfucker I can fucking hit a fucking one by one fucking steel target with a pistol at 200 yards Holy shit, I shoot three times a year Like the amount of ignorance to fucking understanding what's going on 200 yards with a rifle is literally like a Fucking you pick a knife. It could fucking do it pick a nostril. That's where holy shit, man Yeah, oh, it's gotta be professional hit at that distance, bro. I could fucking shoot behind my back You know I'm saying like get the fuck out of here Anyway, I'll let you finish the topic I'm gonna tell you this dude until we stop tolerating this fucking shit this crime this fake racism Degeneracy, yeah, all of it. Yeah, nothing's gonna change. You're you're not virtuous by tolerating. You're fucking cowardly Let's get that fucking straight You are not virtuous Let's get that fucking straight You are not virtuous by tolerating it because your aunt or your cousin or your fucking somebody else Shames you into it that makes you a fucking bitch, bro And the problem that we have in this country is that we got a bunch of bitch assness You fucking let these motherfuckers you don't want to cause a scene. I understand that bro I want to live and let live too, but live and let live only works when both parties consent to it When you live and let live and the other people don't want to let you live You're a fucking idiot and that's what's been going on for 20 fucking years in this country So all you fuckers that are like, uh, it's till it but when it comes to my door, bro, you're the problem All you got to do is use your motherfucking voice. We'll drown these motherfuckers out there's fucking thousands to one of us to them and People oh we can't say this they won't let us say that That's weird because they can say whatever the motherfucker you can say whatever you want. You're being a bitch. I Don't have a big platform you don't need one. In fact, if you told the truth you might have one Yeah We allowed this to happen and then you got this dude who's got two kids a wife Who is by all means a fucking great guy. Everybody that knows him says that And he's gone I Hope this is the fucking you know, I hope this is the turning point. I Hope people wake up and realize that these people are not fucking Worthy of your tolerance. They are not worthy of your tolerance at all at all They will fucking push you in front of a motherfucking subway and then laugh and put it on fucking tick-tock Celebrate it. Yeah, I think that's the thing like I've been battling this like I've been talking to a few friends of mine that you know People want to take the the the the Christian high road, man That's what God is here and the problem that I have I'm Christian The problem that I have I'm Christian but the problem that I have with that man is like No, at least and I haven't I haven't found it right like I've read the Bible Sometimes fucking good men got to do bad things for the greater good I've I have not read in the biblical. It's in the Bible, dude I have not read anywhere in the Bible where it says that it is noble or okay to turn your back Against evil like that. It actually says that we're supposed to destroy evil, you know And like people pick and choose what they want to say Stuff man, no, it's not tough. It's real fucking simple real simple People who hurt other people deserve to fucking die. It's real simple Your job as a as a fucking Christian man is to fucking stand the fuck up against evil against evil Your job is even a fucking man is to stand up against evil Oh, I don't want to fucking want Daniel Penny, you know, yeah, we all understand But if we all did it, they wouldn't be able to single out one person Well, yeah, dude, it's just fucking Cowardice shit, bro. I can't stand it And then seeing that dude's fucking neck explode just set me over the fucking edge, bro I'm fucking done. I'm not tolerating this shit One fucking bit The good people of this country need to fucking unite The good people yeah black white gay straight left right whatever the fuck you think you are If you're a good person and you don't like the way this shit's happening Everybody needs to come together and we need to hold the motherfuckers accountable that create this situation which is these elite fucks at the top of the fucking food chain in this government if Trump had any motherfucking balls at all He'd already have these motherfuckers on the front lawn in a fucking wood chipper You think they don't know who the fuck did this already these motherfuckers know everything And here's what's gonna happen by the way Trump If you don't fucking take care of these motherfuckers in a very obvious Violent way to make a statement which by the way has been the way of mankind for fucking million years or whatever 12,000 years of recorded history if you don't make an Example of bad people bad people do not fear repercussions And we are in a scenario now where the government and that's that is Trump. That's fucking Biden That's all of them have allowed crime to run fucking rampant To the point where we are going to start seeing vigil ante things happen And when vigil ante things start happening society crumbles and then we that we devolve into a fucking third world country Okay, that's what is going to happen if Donald Trump and his friends don't fucking handle this situation. That's the truth So and you guys could say oh well, he's doing this and this and this he could have fucking cleaned up the shit the first Time he was here I'm fucking over this shit, bro We don't deserve this Those people doing these crimes They don't fucking do the things that we do. They don't work. They don't Contribute they don't pay tax they sit around in their fucking moms basement wearing their fucking moms underwear Putting lipstick on not knowing who the fuck they are because of the policies of these fucking leftists that started 20 fucking years ago That's the point the point was to create a generation of people like this who fucking have no idea How to work how to survive how to operate in a real environment I've been saying this for over a decade When you give kids fucking 18 place trophies and you tell them they're special and you tell them they're gonna win no matter What and you tell them that they could be anything they want They could be a cat and you tell them all this shit and they get out in the real world Shit and they get out in the real world they're gonna go crazy and that's what we're seeing You know the interesting thing on this too, bro is like the amount of people that like You know, it's either said some crazy shit You know revolving this situation in the moment that the heat gets on and they're like, oh no, no That's not what we meant. It's not what you know, not what was said like dude. There was this website Jezebel Go figure But they put an article out. This was on September 8th. Okay two days before They wrote this article. They put this article out saying we paid some Etsy witches to curse Charlie cook Okay, and they put this out and then they completely backtrack Once once people caught wind of it man They completely tried to backtrack Yeah, I mean it's sick Tomo Jezebel condemned the shooting of Charlie Kirk in the strongest possible terms We've got any doors encourage or excuse political violence. I won't write about it the day before Yeah, what the so what the fuck is that? Yeah, it's just like TMZ bro. Did you see that shit the TMZ did? Fuck TMZ bro TMZ is forced to apologize as staffed filmed erupting in laughter as Charlie Kirk death announced during live stream and Then the excuse that they gave afterward I don't know if you look I got the check this video out. Let's check this Janet Go you hear him in the background fucking? Go go to Have somebody look at the Fox And then they have the nerve to say that they were cheering about a high-speed chase happening in California That's what they were cheering about Well, obviously they're lying It's sick man And then people say oh well it must be this or that you don't know dude Yeah, you don't know who it is at the end of the day It doesn't matter who did it it really does it because it all spawns from the same ideology It's all bad shit that we've tolerated and allowed to seep into our culture. Well, it was the trans guy Okay Well, then we should have stood up against that ten years ago when the shit started happening when they fucking said when Target first came Out and said we're gonna make transgender bathrooms. We shouldn't everybody was like oh, well, you know Yeah, I guess you know they could do you know And and then it went to schools and it went to this and then it went to that and then it fucking keep and nobody said anything Okay. Oh, well, it's got to be Netanyahu in Israel. Okay. Well if it is Those are the people responsible for the trans shit anyway So it all comes from the same destabilization fucking chaos agenda, which is to divide motherfuckers Okay, they're trying to create division between right and left but at the end of the day Most of the left disagrees with this too The only people cheering for this are these fucking whack job Nobodies on the far left who literally fucking think it's Halloween every motherfucking day of their life For real. Okay, and it is time to fucking stop Tolerating any of it. They do not tolerate reasonable humans They do not tolerate people who have their own lives together. They do not deserve our tolerance or are Allowing them to operate in our civil society We are the majority They are the minority the tail has been wagging the dog and it is time to fucking stop I'm fucking done, dude You guys act surprised this happened, but you didn't say shit for the last 15 years about what was going on Where do you like? What do you like? What do you do, bro? Did you think this is gonna go to you fucking somebody douses your fucking house and gasoline and walks 200 yards down the road with a trail of gasoline and then they stand there with the match and you're like, oh well I guess that's his right to do in America. You could do what he wants He's not hurting anybody. So then he lights it and you look at it and you're like, oh, he's still not hurting anybody He's still not hurting anybody and then the shit gets to your house and burns it down. You're like holy shit the fuck man Dude whatever man You want to let this country fucking crumble you want to get put in fucking isolation camps and duck and fucking Genocided like has happened every single time the Bolsheviks and the communists have made Progress into power, which is what they're trying to do and keep the fucking keep quiet. We'll see what happens Dude, there's been a number of people trying to point this out for years and people will not fucking stand the fuck up I come on here every day you come on here every day for the millions of motherfucking people And say this shit and people won't say a goddamn thing to their fucking neighbor Fuck can't stand it dude, dude shouldn't be dead Anyway, what else yeah Yeah People have to come together bro, yeah, like good reasonable people have to come together. It's the only solution Every single thing that they do is designed to divide the population bro Along racial lines along political lines along socioeconomic lines along sexual lines Every fucking line of contention or potential disagreement Every fucking line of contention or potential disagreement they use against us Why do you think that is because the number one thing they are afraid of is us coming together? The second most thing they're afraid of is you using your voice. Oh Well, my voice doesn't matter. Yeah, who convinced you of that and why do they spend? Trillions of dollars convincing you that you should be weak fat Unintelligent broke they teach you that fucking it's a moral high ground to lose in life And you can't admit it They are terrified of your voice they are terrified of our unity That should be enough indication for every single human to understand what needs to fucking Happen and we have to put trivial differences aside for the greater good at least momentarily. Okay, you may Think this tax policy. I may think that you may think this I may think that you may think this I may think that Do you think that? Kids should be reading about fucking dick sucking in school. No, none of us do Do you think millions of people should be allowed to come in our country and drain our resources? No, nobody does Okay, so let's find the common ground that that we can all agree on which is this We all want to fucking be left the fuck alone from the government We all want to make money. We all want to be free. We all want to have an opportunity We all want to live in a safe society and what we don't want to do is have a bunch of people who don't know if they're a boy or a girl or Whatever a bunch of criminals disrupting our fucking lives period. That's it. So why don't we unite around that? To fix our shit I I don't dude Fuck man I'm not saying unite with the crazy people. No, you can't you don't need them. You can't unite. You don't need them You're never gonna get them to like you. They're never gonna approve of you. They're never gonna fucking you're never gonna reason with them I saw a dude today Who i've known for fucking 20 years? he writes me a message and he's like He's like bro. You're right You're right about all this He's like I I you know, I I can see it now after charlie kirk i'm like, yeah, man, like Why the fuck do you like that's what it took? Yeah you know like You in any in any and then I see on his story it says Confront woke ideology with kindness. What the fuck are you talking about? That's what we've been trying to do They don't want that they don't want to unify with you they fucking hate you And if you can't see that on the on the internet right now, I don't know what to tell you That was a parent from charlie's clips bro Like he'd be in there and you have this fucking you know They them come up and the crowd would start going and try like no we're not doing that be respectful I know you know i'm saying like it does not work because then that person would immediately go on to call him all the names You can possibly call like it doesn't it doesn't work man It doesn't work man now We've also heard uh on this topic that this was Allegedly according to some intel sources. This was like charlie was like like just the first And that this is actually a line of like targeted attacks. Yeah, they're supposed to be more Yeah within like within the next like week week, you know And that's from some of the other people that are on the internet And that's from some like, you know a person that would know and uh I know twitter's going crazy. I think canis was like following this string because I saw this thread of like Uh, apparently right after uh charlie was assassinated Because uvu's like five minutes from this private airport There was like this plane that took disappeared and then turned off his transponder And then like arrived in provo like an hour later or something like that came right back Yeah, like I mean like dude there there's listen like like we always say guys There's a lot of things happening here. One of the things I don't personally like to do I don't think we do it on the show but like jump to these wild conclusions like it's what we know I mean we can make some you know, there's a conclusion i'll jump to yeah, uh If they don't round up that black dude that slipped that white girl's throat Yeah, and this fucker and I don't give a fuck if he's black or white. No, whatever. Whatever. Whatever If they don't take these fuckers and fucking execute them to make a statement We will devolve into fucking complete third worldness eventually. That's the truth and donald trump But we're gonna see what the fuck he's about because i'm pretty fucking sure That he's what he's gonna do is he's gonna fucking say Like if you listen to his speech last night That that extreme rhetoric is gonna stop right now And what I think they're gonna do is fucking unroll a whole bunch of fucking speech limiting laws And use palantir just like they did with fucking hold on just like they did with fucking 9-eleven With the pain the patriot act and I think that their answer to this shit if it gets any more unrest is gonna be More control and more speech control and more tech control More speech control and more tech fucking entrapment Instead of just taking the nasty motherfuckers that did this and pull them apart on the motherfucking white house lawn Like should happen that would solve it in a fucking hour But he won't do it because bro this ain't about fucking safety of us this isn't about what's good for us This is about what's control for them Yeah, bro that palantir shoots I started like I saw I was unaware like what all and how the fuck like dude that shit's fucking wild dude Y'all motherfuckers better stand the fuck up and you better fucking get loud and you better use your voice If you don't use your voice, they're gonna restrict your voice to the point where you can't say shit You know my buddy who messaged me today. You know what I wanted to tell him the point of standing up was five years ago So Remember five years ago everybody when I was telling you all this shit and y'all fucking said Oh, where's your tin foil hat? And then we played along with it, right? I've been telling you I fucking gave up the number one fucking entrepreneur podcast in the world I could have made fucking hundreds of millions of dollars between that's what I gave up I gave up hundreds of millions of dollars of fucking profit into my own Motherfucking pocket to try and warn motherfuckers about this for the last five fucking years and everybody fucking I Bro you need to calm down you need to this and that you don't know where this is going dude This is going towards total communist control Nobody in the government can be trusted fucking nobody There's maybe two or three, yeah Anyway, yeah guys What's the chat say yeah chat what we got on this About say let us know down in the comments what you guys think. Let's see what the chat's saying You guys should never allow any of these these progressive people To fuck with you fucking ever They're way too comfortable dude There's no repercussions They live they've grown up at a time where they have not experienced violence And i'm not saying violence is the answer right now But i'm saying this you better stop letting them walk all the fuck over you're going to be one receiving the violence bro, and the crazy like, you know the point that i'll always come back to about all of this is like How they are using? Our money to do it paul corne is right. That is why we can't trust the government We cannot trust the government because if they actually cared about us this would already be fucking solved to be handled It would have been solved years ago. They would have fucking Bro listen, it's on our backs If we don't stand the fuck up And fucking unify as people that are going to continue to press us into a a terrible situation That's it's going to it's going to be it's it we're going to turn into we will eventually have a genocide in this country That's what will happen and it ain't going to be them. It'll be us every fucking genocide every fucking time in history that a weak population physically has taken control over a strong population and Oppress them is because the strong population was convinced that they were morally misaligned and guilted and shamed into Accepting things inch by inch by inch by inch. That's what's happened here None of you fucking believe in any of this shit You know and do the people who advocate it don't even believe in it, bro You know what they do. They fucking they advocate for oh No, let's Migrants deserve to be here. But the minute you say, okay, we'll host one. No, I can't do that Yeah, they're everybody's a liar Nobody's for this there's fucking like five people in the world that are actually telling the truth about this and fucking we're one of them You these people are hypocrites bro They know the the liberals don't even want it. They want it for us. They don't want it for them. Yeah, right I should even say liberal. I should say fucking leftist The reasonable democrats communist it is common useful idiots, bro The democrats the democrat parties understand that you have been hijacked by fucking communists Who are going to use you and sacrifice you for their mission? You are the useful idiots that they write about in history And if you don't want to be one you need to figure it the fuck out Do you really agree with all these people that are supposedly on your side? cheering for a man's death To get murdered in front of his wife and kids. Those are your people and then streamed all over the fucking internet That's what you're about You're about your party doing every single mass shooting in the last five fucking years Trump better fucking stand the fuck up bro That that that that that fucking address he gave last night. That was some bitch shit. Yeah I don't give a fuck if they do listen the show Fucking care you're a fucking leader, bro. You go in walking around acting like it doesn't make me feel like no You're walking around acting like you're the fucking man with a 10-foot dick Like you have your whole life and a lot of us voted for you and a lot of us said hey man Yeah, do it come in clean it up. What have you done? You fucking pander? You're still pandering to people that are never gonna fucking like you You Start playing along with their agenda bro, it's embarrassing. Yeah Yeah, I didn't feel any like reassurance. No from that. Oh, good luck guys. Yeah, right. Good luck, right, right Can't talk about these people are these people who have uh, you know said this rhetoric for a long time They're the ones that are guilt. No shit. Yeah, what do we do? Really? You're the president bro? You're supposed to be one of the smartest dudes out here Uh No shit, well i'm pissed at trump right now i'll be real real talk Fucking do what you're supposed to do do what you're supposed to do protect the motherfucking people protect the people Somebody was a couple people were saying that trump's uh, the dress last night was ai whatever dude, everything's a conspiracy. Yeah Fucking everybody was telling me that there was there was dudes in my dms telling me that charlie kirk's that was a hologram Yeah, he was and this was a this and this was a that and this was a that not everything's fucking conspiracy, man The dude got his fucking neck blown out on fucking real tv, dude Like his security detail and all those people like, you know, there's people that know those people My people know those people You Trump Yeah, don't use this aggressive language. We're gonna handle it Put up or shut up big guy You walk around like you're the baddest motherfucker on the planet dude And right now you ain't fucking living up to it and that's what we voted for we voted for you to handle shit And you ain't handling it Well, the constitution won't let us do that Yeah Yeah, there were me i'd do it anyway and then by the time they declared unconstitutional it'll already be over Yeah, yeah, man Police need to do their jobs. They need to be allowed to do their jobs Okay, this woke shit is over. Yeah, bro, even like the uh The lady that was killed on the train bro, the judge that released that dude Wasn't even a fucking lawyer didn't even have a law degree Didn't even have a law degree I saw that came out like and then apparently there's a couple of states that allow that dude. I'm just like Wait, so the people that have to you know, either defend or prosecute these criminals. They have to go to law school They have to study law. They have to practice it But a judge that's weighing in on the matter doesn't didn't have to the magistrate judge So shouldn't be the case I wrote this last night and I was going to post it And I think it's important for people to hear and i'm going to read it instead of posting it Because this is what has gotten us here I just want to be very clear people say how we get here We got here because of you We got here because of your tolerance We got here because we accepted things that we knew shouldn't have been accepted Shouldn't have been accepted Little by little by little by little that's what we did. We did we did it us We're the reason this is happening It's been too good for in this country for too long And we have been shamed into believing that we are wrong because We don't tolerate people who literally want to kill us be intolerable. Okay, so i'm gonna read this and uh Yeah Unfortunately, we live in a time where tolerance is being weaponized against us tolerance only works if all participants participate If all participants respect the boundary if all participants are willing to live and let live But when one side plays by that rule, it's not tolerance anymore. It's surrender It's dangerous and it's eventually deadly and that's the danger. Most people are not understanding Because being tolerant of someone who refuses to tolerate you doesn't make you virtuous It makes you vulnerable it hands them the leverage. It gives them the power over you while you feel morally superior for giving it away That's not nobility. That's not fairness. That's not progress and that's not courage That's capitulation It's danger and it's cowardice and history shows us this clearly The people willing to exploit tolerance always end up controlling the side naive enough and cowardly enough to keep offering it unconditionally If you think you're safe because you're being kind or open-minded Understand this you are not evil doesn't see your kindness as noble. It sees it as weakness Evil doesn't see your opus openness as progress. It sees it as permission Once you hand over that permission, it's almost impossible to get back So the point isn't to abandon tolerance. The point is to apply it with clarity love Unite work together. That's ultimately the only solution We have to hold the people that break the law into account criminals not black not white not gay not straight not democrat not republican criminals, this is good versus evil and evil people will use your good heart and tolerance against you They will convince you that you are the bad person if you don't allow them to impose their will on you So understand clearly that tolerance only works when it's mutual and that offering it to people who refuse to offer it back Isn't a higher moral ground. It's a free pass to your own destruction Tolerance with respect is strength tolerance with reciprocity is peace Tolerance without either one of those is suicide So stop pretending your endless tolerance makes you righteous or noble. It doesn't it makes you a target It makes you weak. It makes you coward Furthermore, do you really want to live in a country where you get murdered for speaking your mind? Make no mistake This was designed to silence you and make you afraid. It's a move of desperation Just like throwing daniel pennie in prison was to make people afraid of doing the right thing and standing up for the weaker people Right now you have an obligation as a citizen of the united states of america to protect free speech by exercising it Sitting out is not an option. They will eventually come for you, too Speak louder than you ever have stand stronger than you ever have unite with each other of like mind heart and values And help each other stand together as collective good versus collective evil give tolerance Selectively and reserve it for people who give it back to you Do the right thing do not let them intimidate you into silence Now is the time to stand loud and firm That is the fucking bottom line You're not some morally high-horse individual by saying oh i'm so fucking open-minded intolerant No, they will kill you for that. They hate you. They don't want you to accept them They want you to open the door of opportunity to fucking exploit it for their benefit It's it's beyond my understanding how people can't understand this There is good and there is evil evil is a real thing just because you wouldn't fucking hurt people doesn't mean other people wouldn't hurt you Anyway, no, that's real man click back on the chat here Okay, there's people in here saying more security for andy. Here's the thing motherfuckers. I don't give a fuck I don't care. I'm not afraid to die. You know why i'm not afraid to die because I have real faith If you have real faith you shouldn't fear dying I'm not afraid. I don't care if they fucking come for me. I never have that's why I speak up I don't care bro. Fuck these motherfuckers bro. I'll give everything I fucking ever had to fucking stop them You people are surprised. It's like oh, well, you know, dude. What do you think bro? I got more to lose than fucking anybody Like let's see some collective fucking bravery, let's see some collective courage Let's see everybody stand the fuck up and if they did there would be no punishment for the people that stood up No, because they couldn't fucking stop everybody. I think that's my other issue, too. It's like all right trump So he doesn't do anything cool, right? Don't their shit there can't when you start seeing the vigilante shit. There can't be anything done to those guys Don't punish the vigilantes that's the only way that I mean if he's not going to do anything if our government's not going to do anything And the people decide to there can't be any bro. Listen these people up there in washington do not understand How fucking we are living out here? Yeah, no, they don't understand that for the last 10 years You've had to bow down to this woke shit that made no sense at all It made no sense and we were forced to go to the police Made no sense and we were forced to do it. Otherwise you lose your job. You lose your career. You lose your company Now because these people have lost the cultural momentum. They're freaking the fuck out And it's going to get more violent. So you those of you out here that are like Listening and you believe what i'm telling you better fucking prepare yourself dude and be ready at all times Yeah, I mean, what do you do when you're backing up against the wall, bro? That's what they do They are against the wall and that's correct that's and it's going to get worse and less fucking our government and our fucking President that we elected to protect the country starts doing his mother Fucking job not fucking around with fucking israel and all these donors and all this bullshit I'm, so sick of it, dude You Charlie kirk's talking about epstein two weeks ago for the first time and he gets fucking killed You think that's a fucking coincidence. He was telling all his friends. He's like Man, he's like I started I you know, he went on megan kelly. I've been on megan kelly. Yeah They were talking about israel. He was just on with ben shapiro on like the eighth, I think He was talking about how he agreed that a lot of the shit they were due because dude charlie The reason I don't vibe with charlie kirk is because he supports them unconditionally And over the last 60 days he has switched that view it started to change. Okay, and then he tells his friends Well, I think they're gonna kill me and now he's dead and do you know what else is so weird man? Like and i'm not saying that this isn't this it because to me people are like well It's israel or it's this or it's just some crap Or it's just some crap the thing is it doesn't matter because it's all the same ideology, bro It comes from the same place. Yep Yep, I saw that dude and like and the weirdest part about it man Like and you guys can check this yourself if you go look on twitter Netanyahu's twitter page bro, like he's been like very oddly and weirdly invested in this situation like Almost like to the point. It's like You know like oh, you know, it was that fucking movie we cut all the time there's no drugs in here It's like, you know how we didn't do it. You know i'm saying like it was so Suspect to me man. It's so suspect but to your point man It's all it's all fruit from the same poisonous fucking tree bro. Like it all comes from the same exact thing It all comes from the same thing. It's very simple. This could be handled very simple like real talk All you gotta do all you ever had to do is what i've been telling you all you ever had to do Was look him in the fucking eye and tell him to shut the fuck up. That's all you ever had to do That's all you ever had to do for the last 10 years. That's all you had to do. You couldn't do it and now we're here Once these people figure out that they're the fucking minority they will cower away like the little fucking bitches that they are And when people try to silence your voice and they try to scare you and intimidate you and make you be quiet That is the signal to do the opposite and if we don't all do the opposite you will continue to see more and more political violence From that side and I don't mean democrat. I mean communist If you are a reasonable democrat and you are someone who is reasonable You need to figure out that we are in a dangerous situation to you because I am telling you right now There are people that are far More extreme in their ideology than I am and these people are fucking ready to go And that is not what we want. That is not what we want in this country. You do not want that It is very simple. There's very few of them. There's a whole lot of us All we have to do is refuse to tolerate their shit And it's over Trump could fix the problem I don't think he's gonna I think he's gonna use it to control they're gonna impose more speech and they're gonna impose more surveillance The patriot act 2.0. Yep To protect the page. Yep, because if you really wanted to solve it dude, if you really want that's right, that's how it works They get the fucking right all riled up the patriots all riled up the patriots accepted without understanding how it's going to be used And then they fucking lock us down. They couldn't do it the other way the last four years They couldn't do it. They tried to get people to uh, you know Go along with the social credit school. Yeah, bro, and they couldn't do it So now what are they gonna do? They're gonna create pain and then offer the solution and the pain is going to be so strong that everybody wants to see the solution Yeah, we'll be able to stop this hateful rhetoric before they even type it Yeah, but what that means is that you can't even have a conversation without them watching it, right? Which is they're already doing anyway, you know I mean dude, what do you think dude? I know I mean am I off base? No, no, and I can't find the fucking words, but i'll be honest I really can't I cannot find I just keep looking at that fucking picture with his wife and kids man And it's just like this different for you because you got family like that Yeah, but I mean it's just still like that. I look at it and i'm like This guy's 31 years old 31 years old. He's been fucking doing 17 is when you got started You know why they killed him dude They killed him because he's doing the same thing that jfk did he's doing the same thing that martin luther king did He's getting people to have conversations regarding understanding each other and unity, you know and uncomfortable truth Yes And he did so with empathy and respect which is more than I can say about almost everybody including myself That's the truth. I don't have tolerance for this shit Okay He represents the solution That they do not want which is the unity amongst people in the dialogue correct And that's why they killed him dude, whether whether whether it was a trans crazy person Or whether it was an mk ultra or whether it was fucking a foreign agency or our own agency They killed the motherfucker Because he's unifying people or at least spreading this starting to sprout. Yeah. Yeah the seed And what was he doing in that bro? He was doing that college campuses, which if you've listened to any of our shows we've done with like curtis bowers That's the fucking like that's the home base. Not only that he influenced a younger generation the reason that The reason that gen z and all these people are waking up. It has a lot to do with charlie kirk, bro No, you know and they will say well, we we watch nick fuentes, but you didn't watch nick fuentes first Yeah, right. Right, right charlie kirk's been doing this shit for literally 10 years. Yeah um I'm just dude i'm over it and I think we all need to be over it And that doesn't mean run out in the street and do some violence and all this shit That's not what the fucking means. It means use your fucking voice It means become the opposite of what they want you to be they want you to hate you need to unify and love They want you to be fat. You need to be fit. They want you to be poor. You need to be wealthy They want you to fucking Waste your life away as an ultra mega consumer on your couch eating all their addictive food Taking all their medicine to cure the the the effects of this addictive food Watching their streaming Using their social networks. They want to own your life And you need to figure out how to not do it. You need to be the opposite of them This is why i've been talking about personal excellence for so long. They cannot control Someone who is sovereign they cannot control someone who is fit Healthy who takes care of people who's kind of people who's wealthy who is in control of their controllables They cannot control that person That is why they spend a trillion fucking dollars trying to make you a fat slob on the couch That just consumes their bullshit propaganda Okay, so if you really want to win stop tolerating shit that you know is wrong Have a fucking backbone and start becoming the version that represents american excellence If you do that, we'll win if we don't do that We'll eventually all get killed and that's the bottom line all of this. That is the bottom line That's really all I gotta say I think that's it man, how should we stand up You stand up on an individual level you don't allow people to encroach on your shit You don't allow people to tell you that you're a bigot for thinking very common sense things You don't allow people to cause scenes and throw tantrums and act like an asshole in public Okay, you don't allow this shit You use your voice you speak up you stand up you work together If you see someone doing some fucked up shit in real life If you look at the dude over here and the dude over here and you say all right We gotta fucking handle it And fucking handle it. Yes The fuck man Yeah, don't be the man on the bus hey look dude i'm so pissed off right now I don't I don't think I can continue to do this. Yeah, I think we just need to Yeah, yeah listen guys, uh, we'll be back on monday for q a f as normal, um Sorry for the Plethora of profanity today. I'm probably sure we hit a record, uh, but i'm fucking angry and uh I need you guys to fucking I need you guys to set the fucking standard bro In the comment sections in in the fucking in the world everywhere we have to hold the motherfucking line. That's the truth so We do what we do. We do what I just said We'll win. We'll be all right country will be better than it's ever been We don't do that There will be a genocide in this country that will come within the next 10 years And it's very likely that people who are the quietest are the ones that are going to get it first so It's now or never and I would stand the fuck up I'm not calling for violence because they're going to try to twist this say i'm calling it for violence I'm not calling for violence. I'm calling for the stop of tolerating of people who have never experienced violence Coming to you and stepping on your motherfucking toes. Don't let them if they step on your fucking toes You stomp on their motherfucking throat. That's the truth Figuratively, yeah. Well, I mean if you do want to call for violence just register as a democrat, you'd be fine Yeah, man guys adi that's all I got man That's all I got. Yeah, me too. All right guys. Listen, have a good weekend. Be safe. Be aware Be smart don't tolerate any shit Use your voice now your voice needs to be used today and from here on out loud as fuck I love you guys. I'll talk to you soon
