What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realist's thing about the lies the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome the mother fucking reality guys it's Saturday and that means we have audio exclusive today all right today I'm gonna talk about four mental exercises for elite level execution now there's only one way to achieve goals and dreams and that's by developing mental toughness we talk a lot about that on the show there's a lot of ways that can divide mental toughness I could break it down I could talk about the qualities of mental toughness grit confidence perseverance fortitude the ability to endure etc etc etc if you follow 75 hard or you've done 75 hard you understand what I'm talking about but I'm gonna operate today on a very simple definition of mental toughness mental toughness is the skill that enables you to execute to get everything you need done no matter what no matter how you feel no matter what the situation is no matter what the circumstances are you are able to execute regardless of what's going on the reality is the entire reason that I've experienced personal and professional success in my life is because I developed mental toughness I developed the skill of being able to execute no matter what okay and here's the reality guys and I've told you this for years I'm not successful because I have more talent or I'm more intelligent than other people I don't have accesses to resources that no one else had I'm where I am in life for a very simple reason and that's this every single day I have identified the critical tasks that needed to be done and I did them I was able to do those critical tasks every single day regardless of how I felt regardless of what was going on because I intentionally developed this skill set called mental toughness and this is what I want to talk to you about today because just as you can do physical exercises to become physically tough you can practice mental exercises to become mentally tough now obviously this is what the live hard program is all about but these are four exercises that you can do in addition to this program that will help you develop mental toughness and I'm gonna walk you through these four mental exercises that will help you develop mental toughness that you need to execute no matter what is going on in your life because the reality is guys conditions are never gonna be perfect there is always going to be hardship there is always going to be inconveniences there is always going to be things that are not ideal and if you can only execute when things are ideal you can not win you cannot win okay so what are these exercises let's get into them number one consistently remind yourself of your purpose you're not gonna get anything done if you don't know why you are doing it you have to have vision for what you really want in your life you have to have a purpose that drives all of your hard work now I've told you guys the story about my life many many times but for the first 10 years or so in my business I didn't make any money in fact I made $58,380 collectively over the first 10 years and the reason I did that you guys often think oh man you had so much grit you had so much fortitude you were able to push through these hard times that's not exactly what was going on what was going on was I was trying to sell I was trying to get rich I was operating my business for me not in a way of serving or helping other people and we went through this process we were gonna close the business and we were gonna move on to other things because we weren't making any money and that was our goal and you guys know that I was gonna start a carpet cleaning business and Chris was gonna go to officer candidate school okay and we were gonna close the business and during the training for the carpet cleaning I got injured and while I got injured for 30 days I was on my bed we had a bunch of conversations about the business and we decided that we didn't actually care about getting rich and we didn't want to leave the business because there were certain parts about the business that we really loved we really loved when by accident people would come in and we would talk to them build relationships and they would come in six seven months later three months later a completely different human and they'd be crying and they'd be so thankful and so grateful and that was awesome that was something we could not get in other areas of business and it was something that we both love and so we changed our intent and we changed our purpose at that point in time and for the next number of years we grew a hundred percent every single year because we switched from being about ourselves to being about our customers and that was an adjustment a pivot in our purpose that has allowed us to become successful to this day that sense of purpose drove our actions and it will drive your actions it helped us focus on helping people rather than you know getting rich chasing the paper and all this other shit that people talk about okay the money took care of itself when we got our purpose aligned properly all right now noticed that I realized that my ultimate purpose was helping people and providing value if you ask most people who are in business and you say what's the purpose of your business they will say to make money which is why they don't make any money serving people providing value should be the ultimate purpose of every single business out there if you provide value you won't have to worry about the money okay personally it's okay to be motivated by material goals but eventually you're going to grow out of that and either way you have to consistently call to mind your purpose and keep that at the forefront of what you're thinking about and what I mean when I say that is you need to literally turn your mind and your mind's attention to your purpose consciously every single day inside your head you should be constantly asking yourself why am I doing this when you ask yourself that question you should know and state the answer immediately you should be able to recall that right away it's imperative that you consistently remind yourself of your purpose not just because it will keep you along the path but also it will keep you fulfilled along the path to success if you don't know why you're doing something you cannot do it and you cannot have fun doing it and you cannot feel fulfilled doing it so what is your purpose you have to be able to keep that at the front of your mind the second thing is make up your mind that the rules are set in stone you cannot change them once you start average people make the assumption that if things get tough they can compromise the rules they can change the path they can adjust the situation which is why most people are most people okay when you set the rules for what you're trying to accomplish you have to make up your mind that those rules are non-negotiable they are unchangeable they are set in stone zero compromise zero deviation I am going to do this no matter what happens no matter what comes my way no matter what challenges no matter what hardships no matter what pain I am going to do this you have to have that mentality because compromise leads to quitting people tweak and adjust and make little sacrifices because conditions aren't perfect and they don't understand that conditions will never be perfect so if you give yourself the option to compromise when conditions aren't perfect you will always compromise and compromise leads to complacency complacency leads to loss of confidence and loss of confidence leads to quitting the truth is guys you shouldn't even try to accomplish anything if you haven't made up your mind that compromise is unacceptable okay you shouldn't even go because you won't make it make up your mind decide that you are going to do this you are going to overcome you are going to push through and no matter what comes your way you are going to get where you want to go and when you make that decision and you mean it you will see major progress in your life point number three get your mind clear on the specific critical tasks that are essential for you you know the phrase you've all heard it aimed for nothing and that's what you'll hit too many people are way too vague in the way they try to accomplish things they have some general idea of what they want to do but they don't know specifically in detail what they need to do or what they want to become every single day you need to get your mind clear and get the critical tasks you need to complete that day to move you forward we talk about this a lot with when the day and the powerless system you can go to episode 16 and get my exact system for this for free okay don't just make a mental note you have to follow a system alright you can't just wing it you can't just say I'm gonna fucking do these critical tasks today and they're gonna get done that's not how it's gonna work you have to consciously list them out you have to consciously follow the system and if you follow that system exactly as I've laid it out in episode 16 you cannot fucking lose it is the only system that I know of that will guarantee success if you execute on it and it's free so go to episode 16 and get that point number four intentionally focus your mind on what you will gain not what you're giving up this is a huge thing guys repeat after me action follows focus your actions will always follow your focus the reason people fail at achieving their goals is that they focus on what they have to give up when they're dieting people fall off their diet because they think about giving up pizza and french fries and their brain is constantly fixated I can't have pizza I can't have french fries and eventually it gets to pizza french fries and pizza and french fries and pizza french fries and eventually it breaks them and they go eat the pizza and the french fries okay instead you should be thinking about how great you're going to feel when you look in the mirror and you're fucking jacked and ripped and look in the best you ever did and getting admiration from everybody around you because of the discipline that you clearly display on a daily basis you should be thinking about how you're going to feel when you go on that vacation or when you go to the pool or when you go to the store and your clothes actually fit you should be thinking about when you go to that wedding and the suit fix fits good that's the shit you should be thinking about not what you give up but what you're going to gain if you focus on what you're giving up you will lose because you will give up it will mentally break you so focus on what you're gaining because if you focus on what you'll gain you'll keep pressing on you will stay on the gas like I said focus how awesome your life's gonna be focus on how great you're gonna feel focus on how much you're gonna gain focus on all the money that you're gonna make because of the respect and the relationships that you're gonna build and these things will help you press forward action always follows focus the minute you start wavering you should ask yourself what am I gonna gain from this what am I doing this for which also ties back to point number three of purpose okay so ask yourself if I keep repeating this action what will the good result be focus on what you're gaining not on what you're giving up okay so the recap we have remind yourself of your purpose consider the rules set in stone get clear on your critical task and focus on what you're going to gain not what you're giving up remember guys mental toughness is the skill that enables you to execute to get things done no matter what it is the source of your problems the reason you are not where you want to be is not because you don't know what to do it's because you don't have the capacity to do it when you don't feel great when things aren't perfect and that is a requirement for winning so yes go out and live the live hard lifestyle yes practice mental toughness but also keep in mind these four tools because these four tools will help you break down any obstacles that come your way during this path that you have chosen to go on never sleep on the flow now my jury box froze fuck up fuck up stone count it millions in a coke bad bitch who did slow got a own bank road can't fold does it know here's shot case closed
