The first way is guys email these questions into ask Andy at Andy for sell.com or you go on YouTube in the Q and A F episode, drop your question in the comments, we'll pick some from there as well. We're just going to get right into it today. I like doing the intro the first half of the week. If you want to hear what it's all about, go listen to yesterday's episode. What is today? Today is the first day. The first. Yeah. Today is when they're hearing it though. August 1st. We got CTI again tomorrow, right? We're going to start cranking out more CTIs for you guys. Then as MFCO project launches, we're going to do personal development over there and keep society culture and funny business over here. Cranking it out. Yeah. Anyway, what's up, dude? We got a little switch up there on the desk. We'll desk a roof switch up. You guys know we don't take sponsorship dollars. We got a little switch up there. Big ass titties. There goes the neighborhood. Yeah. You got to say it like that when you open the traffic lighting, dude. It's the rule. You don't say that during when you come out of the can. I'm going to take it to church next week. You are? You know that for church? Oh my. Oh heavens. Like they weren't out with their titties out one time. Exactly. How the fuck do you think we got here? Grandma's doing all kinds of nasty shit. You ain't slick Margie. All right. Yeah, you think about how and you think about how nasty they were bro. We got population decline right now. So you know they weren't asking you. Yeah. So don't let them grandma's fool you. Yeah, they're in retirement phase. Oh, you hurt my feeling bullshit. All right. Anyway. It is bullshit. You guys made 30 fucking kids each. Yeah, fuck man. They were having big, big families bro. Yeah. Cranking it out. Yeah, man. All right. Well, let's let's make some people better. I'm glad you guys are still. Everybody, all the parents are explaining their kids right now. Oh, this is a part of Andy. This is, that's more. Yeah. You know any parents come out to me and they're like, Mom, are you in retirement? Yeah. Yeah. Well, what's he talking about? Oh, shit. It's funny. No, I'm glad you know what I'm happy about though, dude. Is it like everybody just lets us do our thing. I don't fuck with us. I like it. Nobody bitches. No. And if you do, fuck off. Yeah. So what I pronounce a few words wrong here and there. Yeah. So what you can't read. So what? I. So what you got a face for audio. What? So what you stole a bike. Yeah. All right. Let's get serious now. Let's do it, man. This is the serious part of the show. We're getting better today. Mom, are you out of retirement? All right, guys, guys, Andy question number one. I got three good ones for you as always. Let's dive into these. Andy question number one. I have a real question for you. My goal is to raise a human that thinks outside the box who works for every dime he makes and appreciates and values money. With that being said, he had a great idea to pull weeds and help people bring the garbage bins to the road and back up to their house every week to make money to put into his own bank account. I obviously would be there to help him as he is still a young child. I posted about it on a town page and have received a lot of backlash for it. Here's why. He's four years old. But this was his idea and I am just there to help him and support him and not knock his ideas. My question is, do you think this is too young or do you think I'm raising an entrepreneur and should keep trying to help him? How young is too young for entrepreneurship? I just think it's interesting that it's okay for a four-year-old to choose their fucking gender, but it's not okay for a four-year-old to embody the principles and the cultural guidelines of becoming a capitalist entrepreneur, which is what it takes to survive and succeed here in this country. That's interesting. That's interesting. So here's why I advice to you. Tell those neighbors to eat a fucking dick. That's what I tell them. And I would continue to raise your son the way that you feel he needs to be raised, which if you're asking me and I'm no parent, but I'm gonna guess, I think that's a great thing. I think you teach them exceptional value system. I think you teach them the actual rules of the world, not the fake, idealistic rules of the world, which so many parents teach their kids, their kids grow up, they get out in the real world, they can't figure out why nothing that they do works in the real world because their parents and their teachers and their aunts and their uncles and everybody they've known has taught this fake version of reality to them, which is you were born, you breathe air, therefore you are entitled to the best possible life ever. And if you don't get it, you should go protest. That is not reality. That person will fail 100 times out of 100. And if you are a parent raising your kid and not teaching them the reality and the tools and the guidelines and the value system that it takes to become successful in reality, you are failing as a parent. Okay, so to all the parents that are yip yoppin' at you, tell them to eat shit, okay, be a leader. Don't let these people group raise your kids. Look around at the world, has group raising the kids by these crazy far left liberal fucking middle class white women who've got something to say about every mother fucking thing that we do, has that worked out? Has that worked out good? Do we think that's working? Because I don't think that it is, because we got grown adults bringing their fucking parents to job interviews now, okay? We got people who are in their 20s and mid 20s screaming and pouting and crying about how come they can't get a job when they got their whole face tattooed and they got 50,000 piercings in their fucking face. There is a reality and then there is idealism. And most parents these days teach their kids idealism. They teach their kids the way it should be, not the way it is. And if you wanna win, you gotta play the way it is. So I think that's awesome that you're doing that. I would spend way more time doing things like that than listening to the fucking crowd who all their kids are wondering if they should like cut off their fucking genitals, right? And your kids actually out here operating in reality, learning the do's and don'ts of how to become a functional and successful man. I was raised very similarly to what you are doing with your child. I was taught from a very young age that things aren't fair. I was taught that if I wanted things I had to work. I wasn't giving bikes and toys and shit like that. I was told, hey, here's something to do to do that. You can wash car, you can clean the yard, you can rake the leaves, you can go door to door, sellin' shit. These are the principles of this man. Yes, bro. And I did that from a very young age, which is why the fuck I am here now. And while you may not wanna be where I am, that's okay. But those principles still apply and you could take them as far as you want. So by no means by saying that someone has to be an entrepreneur. But what I am saying is that those values are consistent with anything you wanna do in life. Joe has a multi-platinum, what do you have? Two platinum records, okay? As an audio producer, did you get that by being lazy as fuck? Did you get that by someone giving that to you? Bro, Medat started just three years ago. He's kicking ass, he's winning tournaments. He shows up every day and works hard. That is the reality of winning. You have to show up every day, you have to work hard, and eventually you gain skills, and then you start winning. And these parents, like the ones in your little town's Facebook group who are raising a bunch of fucking loser kids that ain't gonna do shit in their lives, should have zero bearing on how you raise your kid. Stop asking for validation from fucking weak ass parents and start being the strongest parent and being an example, and maybe they will join you. Stop asking these crazy fucks for their opinion. They're so, not only that, these are the same people that insert their opinion on everybody's shit. I don't know about you, but I think that if you're going to insert your opinion on everybody's stuff, you should have your own shit together, right? Why is it like when everybody says they're gonna have a kid? All the other fucking moms decided chirping and tell them how to raise their kids when their kids are shit. Why? Why when someone says I'm gonna get in shape, all these fat people talk about what they shouldn't do to get in shape. These are low IQ people that you're asking for their approval. So what does that make you? What does it make you when you ask low IQ people for their validation approval? Think about that. It makes you dumb as fuck, okay? So you're doing a good job. I know you've never been a parent before. I haven't either, but what I know about being raised by good parents is that you're teaching your children the right shit and you should feel good about that. You're being a leader, you're being a parent, you're not being the best friend, you're teaching them reality. And that's what the fuck this is about. I'm just keep thinking about like when that kid turns 18 and then the other little kids in neighborhood turn 18 like he's gonna run, he's gonna be running over dude. Bro, listen dude, that is the game right now. If you are a young person and you are fucking 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, you're in that age range. If you have any understanding of reality as I just explained it, meaning go, learn the lessons, get better, go, make mistakes, learn the lessons, get better and you're willing to do that. You're gonna crush everybody, everybody. Because they've been raised by idealistic parents who don't know shit and even worse think they know it all. Like I've never understood how people can look around at their fucking bullshit life and think they know anything. And they're the authority of them. How, how can you be the authority on fucking on anything when your life looks like dog shit? How are you the authority on parents when your kids are turns? Okay, and they play video games all day. How are you the authority on fucking anything bro? You look like shit, you make no money, your household's a wreck, your kids suck, but you're on Facebook telling other people how to parent their fucking kids, fuck you. Raise your kids the way you think you should raise them. I love it, I love it. I would do more shit. Bro, if I was, you know why God never gave me kids? Cause I kill all those parents bro. I could, they come up to me and they say, you know, and I'd be like, shut the fuck up. What I, how you would, yeah, you would, fuck away from me. And I would even do more man, do fucking like when it snows, put them out there with a shovel, lemonade stands, all of that shit man. Yeah, and if you really wanted to be winners bro, I got a tool for that by the way. I got some of the best selling kids books in the whole fucking world. And you know what they're about? They're about how to become an operator and an effective person in reality as an entrepreneur. And I built these books and got these books together for you because I know that a lot of parents are confused about what to teach their kids. So every book is a story about my actual Bulldogs, Odess and Charlie, and then going through life, learning the lessons that your kids are gonna need to learn to become successful, effective, fulfilled individuals, impactful individuals in their life. So there's a little plug for that. You can get them at AndyFersela.com. I love it man. God, that pisses me off dude. Yeah. Like why is it, it's always the same fucking people. It's the same people. You know what I'm saying? They don't have shit going for them, but they got the fucking biggest mouth in the world on the internet. Telling parents that they're raising their kids wrong because they're teaching them reality bro. Dude, how do you think this country was built? This country was built by fucking parents raising their kids on work ethic and how to show up every day even when you don't want to. And like, I'm fucking over it. Yeah. Fucking losers dude. That's what it is man. Guys, Andy question number two. Andy, I hope this message finds you and the team well. It does. I like that start. That's a nice start. It starts a very polite. Yeah, I like it. I am aware of my purpose and make an effort every day to pursue that. However, I find myself in moments of self sabotage. Though they are brief, they can be extremely careless and later on affect my productivity or ability to do certain things or activities. More specifically, my bank account tends to take a nose dive due to bad decision making. While it may be on a smaller level and have less consequences now, what is some way to stop myself from spending on necessary money? When I know ultimately most of these choices I am making do not benefit me in the long term or even in short term most of the time. I feel like an enemy of myself. Self sabotage, where you get you got anything on that? What's your thoughts on that? You know, I've never really understood what self sabotage means or what people mean when they talk about it. Like it never made sense to me. Self sabotage. Like are we talking about procrastination? We talking about just bad decision making. I mean, like what are we talking? That's like the awareness that you're making bad decisions you still fucking make them. So why would you do that? No, I'm being serious. Like if I know something's wrong and it's a fucking bad decision, why would you do that? Why would you do that? I've never connected with that. You know, I'm not saying I make every decision the right way. I made a lot of bad ones, but I, you didn't make them knowing they were bad. I mean, there's been a few times yet, but like dude, that was just me becoming a mature human being, right? Growing out of that phase of understanding that like, really what it came down to for me, dude, was I started to understand like this is my life and it's now, I'm not gonna be here forever. I'm not gonna have forever to start making the right decisions. So I need to start making them right now. And you know, that honestly took me till I was about 35, 36 years old to figure that out. Had I figured that out when I was in my 20s, I'd be much further along. But, you know, I, I think the best thing that you can do is to always keep in mind, here's what I think. I think the people make decisions that are poor in the short term and the long term because they are not clear and they are not focused consistently on what they are trying to achieve. I think most people don't put enough planning into who they want to become, what they wanna build, what they wanna create, what kind of life they wanna live. And because they can't clearly see it, they don't have the ability to make the decisions that put them in that spot. So whether it's through ignorance or whether it's through lack of discipline or whether it's through just not having that image in your brain all the time, they make the wrong decisions. And so, we have to, you know, solve those three areas, right? If it's ignorance, it's not, you know, you know that you're making the wrong decision. That's why you're asking. Okay, so it's not ignorance. Is it lack of discipline? Could be how discipline are you? How much, how able are you to make the correct decision to where you wanna go even when you don't feel like making that decision? Okay, you gotta be honest about that. And if you aren't able to make the decision that you know you need to make, then that's a discipline problem. And you gotta work on developing discipline, which is the purpose of the Live Hard program, which you can give for free at episode 208. Okay, and then the third thing is lack of vision and clarity and focus on what you're trying to become. If you don't know what you're trying to become, how can you make the right decisions to get you to there? You see what I'm saying? And I think that those three things are the things that you should probably try to work out within yourself. Okay, am I ignorant? I don't think so, because you're asking the question, do I lack discipline? I think you do, because otherwise you would, it sounds like you're aware that you're making the wrong decisions as you're making them, all right? So if you're making wrong decisions, and you're aware you're making wrong decisions, as you make them, that means you're lacking discipline to make the proper decisions. So you can work on that and you could build that. Discipline, grit, fortitude, self-belief, self-esteem, these things are all tied together, and you have to practice them in order for them to get better. It's just like a muscle. If you work out your arms, your arms are gonna be stronger. If you work out your discipline, your discipline's gonna get stronger. So I would practice on that. And then the lack of clarity, where do you wanna go? What are you trying to do? Who are you trying to become? What kind of life you're trying to live? If you keep that in mind all the time, it makes it that much easier to make the proper decision to get there. You're saying when you know what your goal, your end goal is the decisions you microly make should all be a part of that. Yeah, brother, every decision that you make, this is the thing, see younger people think they have all the time in the world. And when you get to be a little bit older, like in your 30s, you start to realize you don't. And then when you get in your 40s, you're like, oh fuck, I don't have that much time left. So your urgency to make the right decisions increases, but your time and the ability to produce that result decreases. So you wanna figure this out as early as possible in your life, bro, had I figured out what I'm talking about right now when I was in my 20s, fuck, bro. And my life would be completely different, right? And I'm not saying it's bad, done a lot with what I've got. I'm not a regret state. No, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying I'd be a lot further along, which is the goal, right? So yeah, man, I think it's, I think it comes down to those three things, you know? Are you ignorant to what you're trying to do? Do you even know, right? And can you make the decision even when you don't wanna make it? If not, build your discipline up. Do you know where you're trying to go? Are you focused on that all the time? And then dude, we have to understand that our decisions, the every decision we make, for me to, whenever meal I eat, every exercise I choose to do, every post I make, or everything I say, these things either move me forward, closer to where I'm trying to be, or further away. There is no neutral moves. It's what's this decision going to do? Is this decision going to move me further to where I'm trying to be, or further away from where I'm trying to be? And if you can learn to have that level awareness on a micro scale, combine with discipline, you know, that's where you get in the sweet spot of being very effective in your life. I love that. I love to do this too, because this person touched on this, having specifically issues when it comes to money. And I know for you, you know, it's been, you've become disciplined financially because you were in situations where you had no other options, right? Like, I mean, that's just what it was. And then those skills that you learned that, it kind of just overflow to when you start to have a money. Do you, is there a difference for people, I guess, you know, who, like yourself, went through that same process versus people who, you know, never had to really worry about that. And so are they more frugal? Like, how do you develop that, that, that discipline, if you never really had the, I guess the quote unquote struggle part of it? I don't know, because I was never one of those people. Yeah. I always had to watch my money. And remember when you and I talked about this, you know, and I had to talk with DJ, I don't know, a while back, a couple of months ago. Yeah, about the importance of having, and developing money skills when you don't have a lot of money, right? Because people think that if they earn, earn, earn, earn, that they will just have lots of money. But that's not what happens. What happens is, is whatever discipline that you have around money when you don't have any, carries into the situation when you have more. So if you develop good financial habits, when you are, let's say, making less money or struggling, and it's, you know, it's lean times, right? If you develop, that's a great time to develop the financial skills that you need, because then as you get more money, you are more disciplined in your system of, you know, income and bills and cash flow and it's bad as a sucks. Yeah, it's just way better to develop when we don't have money. And it's not the idea that people think they're gonna make more money and they're gonna change their habits is not true, because if you lack discipline with a little money, you're really gonna fucking lack it when you have a lot. You're gonna be giving it away, you're gonna be spending on dumb shit, you're gonna be doing this and people could say to me, oh, well, you're the one with all these cars and shit, yeah, I'm a fucker, I make money on my cars. That's like stocks, my shit goes up. You know what I'm saying? So it's just, you know, develop the habits now, and as you go, they'll get, you know, you're being a much better spot. I love it. I love it. Guys, Andy, I thought provoking question number three. Andy, I've been a fan for a little over a year now, and you are one of the biggest influences for my personal development. I love listening to the show and getting your take on things. My question is, Andy, how do you deal with adverse circumstances? It seems as of late in my personal life, I am inundated with choices and situations that conflict with my interest. I have a full time job to pay the bills, but I'm also putting in what free time I have to woodwork. I've made some outdoor furniture for friends and family and have been told that I could possibly sell some of it. Since receiving this, let's stop this. What do you mean you've been told you could sell some of it? No shit, you could sell some of it. Make some good shit and people will buy it. You don't need people to tell you that you're fucking qualified, bro. I'm gonna stop you right there. Keep practicing and make some cool shit. Go sell, you know what the common theme is with all the questions we get here? It always has to do with getting validation from outside motherfuckers. You do not need them to believe in you. You do not need your friends to tell you you're great. All you have to do is go become great and they will recognize it. You don't have to fucking get a permission from fat Suzy Homemaker over here and fucking PTA meeting or how to raise your kid. You don't need permission from Bob the Builder to become a fucking woodworker. Like you don't need permission motherfuckers. Stop framing your questions that way. I'm gonna make funny every time you fucking do it. You don't need nobody, nobody ever came to me and said, Andy, you have what it takes to become a successful entrepreneur or Andy. You have what it takes to build multiple successful podcasts. Actually, I got told I was a fucking idiot. Actually, I got told that I couldn't do shit. Actually, I got told I should get a real job. Actually, I got told that I wasn't capable of any of the things that I've done. I'm not trying to do them, I've done them. Okay, if I went around and fucking asked people what I couldn't couldn't do, I'd be sitting in the same spot I was 20 fucking years ago. So stop it. I'll do it. Receive with your question. Yeah, man. But they say since receiving these comments and compliments, I've started to shift my focus to start selling my projects. Since making this shift, it seems like the world's against me. Once I get off work, I go straight to building. I only have a couple of hours every day during the week to get stuff done. I bank on the weekends to get the majority of my work done, but it never fails at something else always comes up, whether it's birthday parties, company parties, date night, obligations, long care, property maintenance, and even other bullshit, like I break a tool or someone stops by the house randomly or calls to talk to bullshit. Does this, has this ever happened to you? No, man, you know what? I wake up every day, everything goes exactly as I plan. Nothing wrong, it ever happens as smooth as fuck and I just make all kinds of money, bro. This is super unique, sir. Listen, dude, it's just you. And honestly, if I were you, I'd just quit because it sounds like the whole world's against you, man. Fucking tools break, people call you on the phone. Who the fuck calls someone on the phone? Oh, you got to mow your yard, fuck, bro. That's a disadvantage. I'm sorry. This happens to everybody, bro. It's hard. It's not easy. Every day you wake up, you're gonna have shit go wrong. Every day you wake up, you're gonna have bad things happen. How you need to look at this as a fucking test? It's a test. Do you pass the test? Or you not pass the test? You need to fucking when you have a bad day, bro. You wake up and fucking, everything's going wrong. And by the way, none of that shit is, that's called life. That's not even hard shit, bro. What are you gonna do when hard shit happens? Okay, that's what you're talking about, life. Oh my wife called me. Oh god, I'm fucking gonna die. Like what the fuck, dude? That's life. There's gonna be distractions. Your job is to fucking discipline yourself to a point where these distractions don't pull you off track or you're able to manage them. Okay, but ultimately, here's the reality. It's never gonna go your way. It's never gonna be easy. There are always gonna be things that break. There are always gonna be things that go wrong. And your job is to get through this, regardless of what comes your way. And the best perspective that you can take is to fucking look at it like a test. Okay, when I wake up in the morning, I already know. And by the time I wake up in the morning, I already got 40 fucking texts on my phone, at least. Okay, and do you think any of those texts are good? Not a single one of them is like, hey Andy, I love you, bro. I hope you have a good day. Every one of them wants something from me. Every one of them needs an answer from me. Every one of them is a problem to solve. By the time I get out of fucking bed, I know what I'd say when I get out of bed. I'm the baddest motherfucker on the planet. Doesn't matter what happens today. It doesn't matter if there's a fucking fire earthquake or tornado or the fucking heavens, rain down, fire and brimstone on my mother fucking face. I'm getting my shit done. Okay, and I pass the test. And that's the difference between people who lose and people who win. They have a mentality that you are not going to fucking touch me. You are not going to throw me off track. And it doesn't matter if it takes until three o'clock in the morning, my list of shit gets done every mother fucking day. This is why LiveHard is such a good program for people like you. Because if you actually do it the way it's laid out, it'll take care of all these problems that you have in terms of all these little distractions. It's absurd, bro. What do you think it's like? Do you really think that all these people that went out and built all this shit drive up and down your street? Fucking KFC, one of the greatest fucking success stories of all time. Colonel Sanders didn't get his fucking chicken recipe in any store until he was after 60 years old. He got his balls kicked in for 60 fucking years. You're complaining about mowing the grass and going to birthday parties. Okay, drive up and down the street and look at all the shit that everybody's built. Do you really fucking think they did that with no distractions? Do you really think they did that with no hard times? Do you really think they did that without breaking a fucking tool? Get the fuck out of here, bro. This shit's hard. If it was easy, everybody be doing it. Everybody have the biggest furniture company on the planet. You got an opportunity in front of you because you have a skill set. You should hone that skill set in and become great at what you do and then become great as a human, meaning effective, meaning I can work through these things as they happen. And you'll get there, dude, but I'm gonna tell you this. What you're going through, everybody goes through and probably worse. That sounds like some weak ass shit. I'm not trying to be an asshole. Okay, that's life. You're dealing with life. Yeah, that's just the Tuesday, bro. Yeah. I love it, man. Ro, it's like fuck, guys. I love you, guys, man. I want you to win, but fuck. You know? Yeah, we got changed, I mean. Yeah. I don't have that mindset. Dude, it's a test. You're the baddest motherfucker on the planet. Nothing's gonna stop you. Who the fuck's gonna stop you? I don't care what they say. I don't care what they have to, what they post on the internet. I don't fucking care. All I know is that I keep taking steps forward. Shit happens. Good shit. That's all you got to do. Just keep moving. Doesn't matter. Nothing else matters, bro. Not, dude, that's the thing. The thing about this whole game is that nothing else matters. Other than what you do, okay? People think there's like this outside circumstance that controls success. I used to think this, too, by the way. And they think like, they're gonna need approval from somebody who's credible. You know, I used to think like the success fairy flies down from the universe and taps people on the head. And I used to think like, I wonder if I'll get to be one of these successful people. And it's just the wrong way. It's just not what it is. And once you climb the mountain or climb a few mountains, you look back and you're like, that's all it took. Like when I bought my first Lamborghini, bro, it was 2012, 2011. And owning a Lamborghini was a huge thing for me. Huge, huge, huge, huge, huge massive thing for me. And when I got it, Sal was with me when I got it. I mean, it was awesome. It was fucking surreal, dude. It was the cool, one of the coolest experiences I'll never forget in my life. But in that instance, I realized what I'm telling you today, which is, all it is is showing up every day, doing the shit you know you're supposed to do, going to bed and repeating that as long as it takes. And making sure that no distractions, no bullshit, no people, nothing gets in your fucking way. You have to have the attitude of a fucking warrior to become successful. It is not easy. It is not for everybody. It takes more than what everybody else is trying to give, which is why nobody else has it. Okay? But if you can teach yourself to be disciplined and you can teach yourself to not quit and you can learn the lessons along the way from the shit that you fuck up, you cannot lose as long as you keep going. You will get where you wanna go. If you fucking have the ability to persevere, you have the discipline to do the things you wanna do when you don't wanna do them. And you have the ability to keep going, no matter how long it takes, okay? That's called passing the test. I'm passing the test today. What did I say to you right before I walked in today? Right before we got in there, what I say to you guys? What I say? I said I felt like fucking shit today. Slap bad. Yeah, I slept terrible. I got fucking threw up in my fucking sleep last night because I got acid reflux, right? I fucking think it was an hour of sleep today. You know what though? I'm beating shit's ass today. I just killed it in the workout. I'm killing it on this podcast. I'm about to go kill it in everything else I do. And when I go to bed and won't matter that I fucking felt like shit, it'll be an A plus productive day. So if you can take all the days that you feel like shit or all the days that you're distracted or all the days you're pissed off, you don't feel like doing it and you make those A plus productive days, how the fuck can you lose? The answer is you can't, okay? So start looking at these things differently. This is a test that you need to pass. And there will be tests every day that you need to pass. And the more tests you pass, the easier it is to pass them. That's the truth and that's how you need to look at it. I love it, man. I absolutely love it. Guys, Andy, that was three. Yeah, go pay a fee. Never sleepin' on the floor. Now my jury box froze, fuck up, bow, fuck up, stole. Counting millions in a coke, bad bitch, booty swole. Got a own bankroll, can't fold. There's a no-hit shot case, clothe, clothe.
