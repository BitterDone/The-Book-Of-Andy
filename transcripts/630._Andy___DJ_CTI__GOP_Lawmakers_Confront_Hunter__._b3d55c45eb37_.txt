Yeah well flavor. Oh you know that's flavor out there right now it's a shopping light man. That's definitely a good flavor. Oh it's a solid choice man I like that one. Yeah what's going on with you? Oh nothing. Yeah just hitting it hard man. Yeah. Day uh what's today? The 11th? The 11th. The other day. Day 11 is 75 hard. Day 12 when you guys are listening. Yeah. Fucking crushing dude. Yeah. Crush you know it's funny because that's actually what I wanted to kind of bring up so I mean you you have a what some would call a great track record of just winning success right and obviously there's an equation there. Um and it's not unique to you right like I mean you you talk about this. There's a lot of other winners out there and I want to bring up a few winners because there's been some changes going on and just get your takes uh billbell check. He's out. Left the Patriots. Yeah um so after 24 seasons uh new England Patriotek coach. Bill Bell checks out. Um and then another shake up. Nick Sabin. But Alabama uh he's out. After 17 seasons. Now these guys have a phenomenal. Phenomenal track record right. Nick Sabin 292 wins 71 losses. Says he's earned about $121 million in basic annual compensation to 17 years. Seven national titles. Seven national titles. Bill Bell check I mean again these are just too high-leg 24 years of basically dominating the NFL. With one I mean didn't he have a couple of almost like perfect seasons. I mean uh yeah they had that perfect season. I I would I think they lost the giants that year in the Super Bowl. Yeah yeah um well yeah I mean you know I'm simply like I mean guys who understand the equation. Yes man. He carol too. He carols enough. He carols. He just left the scene. Right. All in all in same 12 hours. Interesting. It does. Three the best. I would say Pete carols in the match below those other two. Sure. Um well Pete carol he's still staying on though. He's staying on is like an advisor. Oh is he. Well look I like Pete carol. I'm just he doesn't have the track or the other two guys. I'm not knocking him. But I mean Nick Saban and Bill Bell check are fucking legends. Okay those guys will win anything that they do. All right because they understand the fundamental reality of winning. Which is focusing on the tiniest minute detail and doing it with perfection. You know the best quote that Nick Saban has in my opinion is we practice uh not until we can't or we're not until we get the play right but until we cannot get it wrong. And that's the level of focus and discipline and expertise needed to actually win. You know I think a fundamental problem with the world right now is that the expectation of what it takes to win and build and create an amazing existence is far out of whack with the reality of what it takes. Meaning it takes much longer. It's much harder. It takes much more effort. It takes a much higher skill set than pretty much the entire internet understands when it comes to winning. Most people I think they underestimate it by 10 fold. I think most people underestimate what it takes by 10 fold. And you know it's not profitable to go out there and tell that message right. Like as a in the personal development world you know I've been very successful in that in that world and um you know had I been willing to tell people that this shit was a little easier than it actually is I probably would have been a lot bigger but the truth of the matter is it's fucking hard and you have to be good and it still takes a long time and it still takes everything you got and people underestimate it dude and because of that they get frustrated and they they think that they're doing something wrong when in reality you just got to keep going you know and I think these two guys exemplify uh in the way that they coach their team and their players what it takes to win it anything so it's you know I don't see any other coaches like these guys out there right now like not even close dude. No. So I mean there's talks about so I mean so next day when he's he's 72. Bill Bellichek 71 there's some talks about Bill head into Arizona and coaching the Cardinals out there um but not not any real news coming out from from saving but like this is my question for you right like I mean guys that are like that like guys who have you know built themselves into these winning machines bro like there is no real there's no such thing as real retirement right like there's not there's not an off switch for people like that yeah that's what I'm like so I just it got my like I'm just into it's like what what is what is saving on the dude like does he go back to the NFL he's gonna have to find a way to contribute and compete um you know he might take some time off but like bro I could promise you it he ain't gonna like it and they're gonna be long yeah no I won't yeah you know he'll he'll this these guys these guys play the game until they're in the ground and this is why like dude this is this is what I'm talking about the expectation right like people do not understand the level of competitor that some of these people are that you're observing from the outside as winners that you want to be like but you want to do so with balance and you want to do so with free time and convenience and comfort and what you don't understand about comfort is that the pursuit of comfort is a lie anyway because all of y'all are here pursuing this comfortable existence not realizing that comfort doesn't actually exist and the more that you chase comfort the more that you pursue comfort the more problems it creates in your life because you're not addressing the real shit and needs to be addressed which creates more stress more anxiety more problems to solve so when you pursue comfort you're actually creating problems in your life that mean you'll never have it you don't ever actually get to a place of comfort that's now what happens what happens is you acclimate to the path you acclimate to the journey the things that were hard for me 10 years ago 20 years ago are now something I don't even think about anymore and because of that it's perceived as comfort because you become acclimated to the path to the journey all right and this is what 75 hearts all about 75 hard and live hard is about mentally calibrating your brain to become accustomed to the path all of you are out here trying to make the path easier this is why these fucking idiots out here that try to make their own program that's easier and more sustainable and this and that they don't even recognize that the whole reason that their life sucks is because every single path they try to get on they try to make easier for themselves they try to make better for themselves they try to make it more convenient that's most people's entire problem dude when in the reality is the best way to prepare yourself for the journey of life is to build yourself into someone who's uncompromising who is dedicated to the path who becomes mentally tough mentally hardened discipline and high skilled to where the path doesn't feel hard anymore it feels easy that's the whole key that's what the program's about that's why I get so annoyed with all these people who decide to take it and who really having no platform to stand on for mental toughness they haven't really achieved anything in life and the reason they haven't achieved anything in life is because they do that they take every mother they're so they lack so much awareness bro that they take every mother fucking thing and they try to make it more convenient for them and you don't people do not realize that's what's costing you everything you don't get to bend the path to your will bro it's not the way it works you get to become a bad mother fucker that can handle the path and then the path feels easy that's the actual comfort in reality and people don't like that because that means you're always going to be in the fight you're always going to be in in the struggle and you know the goal is to become so bad ass that the struggle don't feel like a struggle you know and anyway I love these two dudes I would love to play for these dudes and love to be around these guys because they understand the fundamentals of what it takes to actually win consistently over and over and over and over again which is you know focusing on doing things perfectly every single time and you know I would if there was more people like this see when I was growing up dude when I'm talking about here was known people understood this now it was just a choice of whether or not you want to do it yeah now they think they hear what I'm saying bro dude if when we look at what people say when they see like a fire clip of mine where I'm talking about the way things really are and you go read the comments they're like oh that looks like trauma to me fuck off fuck off with your little bitty life dude I'm trying to listen everything you are I am working to be the opposite so it makes sense that it doesn't make sense to you you know I'm saying anyway man look how tired he looks yeah motherfucker that's what happens when you get up every day and kick ass and fucking care about everything when you care about every mother fucking detail and you care about winning so bad that it's everything that's inside of you that's what the fuck you end up looking like when you're 70 years old but you know what history will remember him forever thousands of men who played for him will remember him and credit him for being the inspiration to the greatness of their life so when I look at that I don't see like people would look at that and be like yeah that's what you get when you only focus on blah blah blah blah blah they don't think about the greatness this man has created both of these men so like dude I can appreciate looking like that because that's what the fuck I feel like on the inside every single day yeah you look like that you're doing something right yeah well my goal is to eventually look like that and have people say holy shit look at that fucking guy I want to be the old lion bro with the fucking scars and the fucking shit and everybody's like fuck yeah don't mess with that dude you know what I'm saying that's dude would you fuck with that guy you 70 years old that guy will fuck a rip your Adam's apple out bro that guy is screaming at grown men who are six nine three hundred fucking pounds and they are sitting the fuck down yes that's a fact okay so this dude these dudes are these are these two guys are fucking it in my opinion yeah and a great congratulations on an amazing career and you those two dudes have inspired me more than a lot of other people there they're a big reason why we have the life that we have around here so yeah just thought that was a interesting little little conversation I have bring up man two two great great legends I wonder what the conversation was you know like because you know their buddies they probably call each other and be like yeah are you done apparently they did like a sit down interview together like they interviewed each other I really I've seen the clip like I want to I want to watch the whole thing because I guarantee you fucking phenomenal hey you want to go fishing yeah me too let's tell these guys to fuck off you know what I'm saying like they figure something out oh one of those coordinated effort yeah but the time is definitely interesting yeah well guys let's get into our crews remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to adfacela.com you can find them link there that being said headline one let's get into it headline number one reads GOP lawmakers confront hunter Biden at contempt hearing you have no balls just say it's great let's dive into this so Republican lawmakers confronts at hunter Biden at Wednesdays hearing to hold him in contempt of Congress for defying a congressional subpoena and what appeared to be a public relations stunt hunter Biden along with his lawyer Abe Lau and so called quote unquote sugar brother Kevin Moore showed up at the hearing congressional leaders could have sent the house sergeant arms to arrest and detained hunter for failing to comply with the subpoena quote you are the epitome of white privilege you have no balls I think hunter Biden should be arrested right here right now and go to jail representative Nancy Mace said directing her gaze towards the president's son here's the clip I believe that hunter Biden should be held completely in contempt I think he should be hauled off to jail right now because it wasn't long ago to my friends on the other side of the aisle that you also believed in the the power of a congressional subpoena not long ago at all you believed in holding those who refused to comply with congressional subpoena accountable but yeah and then so then they walked out hunter Biden and his posse immediately left the hearing when representative marjorie Taylor Green began to speak here's the clip from that times expired chair recognized miss green from Georgia for fun and a mouth thank you mr chairman uh excuse me hunter apparently you're afraid of my words I like to reclaim my time mr chairman wow that's too bad this because you know she's like shown pictures and stuff on the on the stand but yeah he just dipped out of there it reminded me of like an episode of marie you know and like they say you are not the father my fucker just takes no he got out of there quick um got out pretty quick but here's a very interesting thing so when he was leaving out you know you got swarmed by reporters and shit right they caught this I don't know if you seen this clip check this out would you please I'll answer your question if you be quiet and let me make a statement crack you normally smoke mr Biden starting to buy and his private citizen are there different kinds of crap your name is like crack bro he said that's so quick what kind of crack do you normally yeah but are there different kinds oh for sure what is there like hey you just mommy you can try to get like you can smoke it you can snort it okay you know I don't fucking know anything about crack you know yeah I'm not a I don't I know about weed you know I have a couple things yeah I don't know about crack it just reminded me of that movie lean on me you know I'm saying you smoke crack don't you you see that movie yeah it's classic it's going um but yeah and of course you know like here's a good thing so he didn't tell anybody that he was actually showing up that day right made a bunch of commotion in the hallway and apparently nobody in the lighthouse knew that he was going to go there as well um but shortly then after oh mama Jill uh she says what Republicans are doing to Hunter is cruel here's the clip first lady Jill Biden is speaking out against Donald Trump and House Republicans and also coming to the defense of her son Hunter in a new interview she did not hold back when it comes to the efforts underway to hold Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress listen think what they are doing to Hunter is cruel and I'm really proud of how Hunter has rebuilt his life after addiction you know I'm I love my son and it's had it's hurt my grandchildren and that's what I'm so concerned about that it's affecting their lives as well her rare public comments about her some come as Hunter Biden is set to appear in a federal court in California today yeah anyway we got on this you know everybody has an opinion on this including me uh and I'm glad that I have this opportunity to express it um but all of you smooth brains out here arguing that you're missing the point of what this is the point of this was a very public demonstration to show the world that they are them and we are us they are people that you cannot touch and can do anything they want and we are the peasants and can do nothing about it that's what this whole entire thing was about yeah this was about hit this was about these people rubbing our faces in the reality that we are under their control and there is nothing we can do and that's what this is about and I think they're going to be surprised because I think Americans do know that they can do a few things yeah so yeah I mean like do think about I mean he's definitely that's my take on what I saw 100 bro you don't listen you show up unannounced yeah my fucker walk straight through security they didn't even check them yeah maybe only know they try to check them well they don't want to check them anymore because they know every time they do the motherfucker's got an eight ball on his pocket and it makes the fucking news so that he's like the crazy cousin that shows up and fucking Thanksgiving bro high out of his mind and you don't even ask any questions you're just like they don't do yeah every family has one right if you got a real family that's the photo of the day every family has a Hunter Biden they did fucking do I got they got a total fuck up in their family the shows up all fucked up out of their you know what you gotta watch them because those couples a couple see couple years of my life it was me all right so like you know people to show up they're fucking drunk or they're fucking fucked up and they're you just look at them you're like and you're talking to your cousins you're like what the fuck's wrong with him they're like just leave me alone you got locked the bedroom doors yeah bro this is the guy that's the guy and so yeah they're not gonna search him dude because they know it's bad PR but I mean look man that's what I saw when I watched this and I see all the conservative talking heads trying to can you believe that he yes I can believe it just like I can believe everything they're doing is a signal to us that they are us and we are them and there is nothing we can do about the things that they do this is this is what we're talking about when we talk about the mask of communism coming off we are trying to play the victims bro huh then they try to play the victims yeah of course like yeah so that the right I got another clip here this is well that's a typical fucking progressive mentality coming you know oh you can't use these words against us when you're saying exactly what the fuck they're doing as soon as you call it out yeah so there was another clip from lady Jill who they say don't do media appearances but she controls every appearance with her Joe Biden here's another clip from that same interview with the mess nbc what do you think when you hear Trump or public hands calling it the Biden crime family or I have one congresswoman the Biden crime family sold out America marty telegram he's a liar he's mentally incompetent and let's not even talk about what let's go branding means but you have US senators holding signs that say that I'm hard to realize our country isn't it I mean to look at it what we used to have and what the other side the extremists have turned this country into I mean we would never see things like that say 10 years ago the fuck we didn't see it 10 years ago we saw with Obama it's the same shit same dudes calling the place second of all you're the extremists we're all the people that are like hey man we're out here in 2005 and all the sudden people are cutting their fucking dicks off okay they're the extremists they are they are gaslighting they are projecting and they are playing victim they are abusers they are abusing the citizenship of this country you and me and the rest of us peasants are being abused by these people they do these things then they stand up on national television and say I can't believe how crazy this country's got our country has become ruined when they say our country they don't think me and you they think them when they say democracy is failing they don't that doesn't mean our republic democracy that we fucking think of when we think of America it's their power center their control their ability to manipulate and fucking abuse people is crumbling that's what they're saying and they're trying to get you to feel sorry for them so you vote for them whoopie goldberg's no different who whoopie goldberg sits on TV every day talking all this crazy shit when she's fucking bro one of the most pretest she's lived a privileged life she's been a fucking a list Hollywood celebrity says not the fucking 80s okay now she she probably had some regular people stuff before that but this woman sitting on the view talking about how Trump's gonna do all this shit that these people have already tried to do are done every day or will do she said oh they're she said they're gonna remove all the journalists they're gonna they're gonna take all the gay people where the fuck is Trump said anything about gay people he stood on the stage with the fucking rainbow flag talking about LGBTQ which by the way I personally believe he shouldn't even done because that rainbow flag doesn't represent the basic normal everyday gay American anymore it represents a progressive communist ideology where they're teaching our kids to suck dicks and take hormones and cut the fucking dicks off while people in China are teaching their kids to assemble fucking AK 47s and fucking rifles and do exercise in grade school like if you can't see what's happening bro your brain is not functioning properly this is the conquering of America and this man and his family have been paid to do this they have been paid handsomely to allow all these things to happen that are happening in our country we have people in New York City and Chicago in the urban areas who are 100% three years ago fucking hated Donald Trump who are now saying they're going to vote for Trump because they have done exactly what I got called and you got called fucking racist for saying was going to happen which they were going to replace the black vote with totally illegal fucking migrants now they're sending these black children home from school and housing the you got this and I got that cool well I'm on top of it today I'm just saying like bro lady you are fuck you do listen she's not delusional she's a fucking criminal yeah she's a fucking criminal she is with them he is too they shouldn't lock his ass up right there listen if any of our fucking government officials had fucking balls at all they'd be calling for the arrests of these people these people are fucking traders but we do not have the balls nexus look I think it's this is what I think I think it's funny when they talk about how extreme Trump is when I actually believe that the heart of America is further extreme than he is yeah I think people want legit I think these people are so behind the curve of what the people are actually wanting we need a fucking person in that office who is willing to deconstruct the establishment completely not play their games not play their word games walk in there sign the fucking executive's orders to dismantle the fucking government the way that it needs to be dismantled in the way fire hundreds of thousands of government employees change all kinds of shit on one fucking day and we don't have that because Trump ain't gonna do that either no Trump is the old Trump is the bridge to the person who will do that okay that's that's that's it so like when these people say oh Trump's gonna do this and that now you're too early that's twenty twenty eight that's coming later guys I've been on this conversation down in the comments real talk yeah do you guys want someone who's gonna come in and clean fucking house or do you want someone who's gonna tip toe down the line with all of these establishment corrupt criminals what do you want because I believe from what I can tell people want someone that's gonna go in there and do the fucking job and say fuck you set the government back on the right course and go the fuck away that's what the that's what the country needs and it Trump either and it Trump's just the best option right now in my opinion they're trying hard as fuck to push Nikki Haley out there and get all these women on Nikki Haley so that she has a chance Nikki Haley is their fucking controlled out this time okay like she's their Obama she's their Joe Biden they understand that they cannot the Democrats cannot win the election because people are like somewhat awake they have realized so the Democrat party is fucking not for us they got one hill Mary-la yeah they're gonna bring in Michelle Obama 100% oh Mike 100% they are bring it's coming in okay and I said that before fucking anybody yeah okay and that's on record we got fucking record of that I said that before fucking anybody that is happening these people and that you know who knows man because like we do we got here's how I see it playing out they got Michelle Obama they're gonna bring in the race and they're gonna try to pair her and I believe they're like you guys might not agree but I think they're gonna pair her with fucking Camila with Camila all right and then they're gonna divide everybody on race they're gonna say if you don't support him you racist and they're gonna say if you don't support him you're sexist and if you think about those two lines of division they're gonna divide people amongst race and they're gonna divide people amongst gender which is there two main lines of how they're gonna try to divide people and they're trying to get all the white brunchers to vote that way again and they're gonna try to get all the black people to vote that way again because they're black it's new yeah and who knows if it's gonna work bro I don't know but I know this that's gonna be their play if I was on their team that would be the play I ran because it's our only chance for us to actually win and if you think about it a little more deeply than what we're talking right now it actually divides the household because now you're gonna have yes now you're gonna have husband and wife arguing over this and I think they're gonna try to divide everybody down to dividing households over this men women thing and over this race thing I think that's what's gonna happen they cannot unite and that's another thing people want people want someone that's gonna come in and clean house restructure shit get us set remove all this ridiculous spending get our taxes right be enforced the laws get our streets cleaned up and unite people not divide people and this this fucking these people are all about division because that's the only way they can maintain any power center because they have no legit policies that serve us so this is what they're gonna do I I think that's the play I'm convinced that's what they're gonna do and then on top of it they're gonna throw all this extra shit on top of us another coven another another thing I don't know what the thing is yet it's gonna be you know a combination of war a cyber shutdown power shutdown panda whatever they try you know they're they're gonna try to create mass chaos and division go do all over the face yeah yeah yeah they're not gonna let down Trump wind dude like people think I don't and I think their backup plan is Nikki Haley like if they if they don't if they can't get the Democrat party to win they want Nikki Haley to win they know they can get all the women to vote for a woman because she's a woman well that's why women shouldn't vote well I don't I don't say that I think women that don't contribute shouldn't vote but I also believe that men that don't contribute shouldn't vote right nobody that does nobody that that lives without a current tax return should have the ability to vote yeah period no I think that's fair yeah if you're 16 and you pay taxes because you have a job vote you get to say but like the problem is is we have a lot of these people out here both men and women of all different races of all different you know fucking parts of society classes that get to say and they vote either they vote for shit that really they have no right to say anything about because they don't contribute yeah guys jumping on this conversation down with the comments let's know what you guys think that being said let's cruise over to the comments this comment comes from at Drew Putnam 83 he says I've gone through a lot of fucked up shit in my life and I have never thought that cutting my dick off would be the solution to any of my problems I have on occasion wish it was a little bit bigger though that's fair that's fine that's fine that's not gonna solve problems either well it's not what is it that's gonna create a whole new set of problems I might be broke my dick being you know what I mean that's all right that's okay you think that bad like imagine me and broke with a small dick like that's terrible you can't even do only fans bro and you got real problems I still I still stand by my statement bro like why the fuck would you cut off your dick like why would you do that that's got to be the dumbest shit

XM Patriots bright bar news daily Blackburn said when she first heard about Adams throwing students out of their school to help border crossers and illegal aliens she thought it was fake news quote you know I heard this story and I thought this is something from Babylon B certainly a school system a local government would not shut down a school a high school and send the kids home that means they terminated their sports activities and other things and place them on remote learning and turn the school over for use for shelter Blackburn said quote we don't know how long the people will be there we don't know how long it will be used as a shelter Blackburn said uh we don't know how long it takes to put the school back in school order to move it back into a classroom setting from a shelter setting setting I thought this cannot be possible but yet we're learning that indeed it is she continued which uh while parents and elected officials protested outside the high school on Wednesday the New York Times portrayed any objections to turning schools into migrant camps as quote hate fueled by conservatives the city schools uh principal uh principles union joined outrage it is hate we fucking hate it fuck we fucking hate that these people are coming across our fucking borders who shouldn't be here we hate that we're paying for it we hate that they're causing all this crime

everybody yeah sure um but yeah the city school of principles union joined outrage parents and blasting atoms for using high schools to shelter migrants and thus forcing students out of in person learning in a letter to school leaders the city's principles union wrote that quote while we recognize the safety concerns brought on by the storm schools should never be used to temporarily house non-student populations uh quote we urge the city to consider more valuable alternatives union officials said adding that some migrant students from Florida Bennett field would be likely to need it quote additional support in the coming days as they navigate through this unsettling experience yeah viable alternatives means your home yep but there's a lot of things going on in New York and I

likely not based on scientific data so you guys know the whole oh we got a socially distant state stay six feet apart because covid can't go within six feet right yeah bullshit as we all knew you mean how they you know they they thought stickers on the floor the grocery aisle that said go this way and that way because we can only go in a certain and you mean how like when they did the debates for

think for themselves at all at all yeah at all like a magic like dude this is like when we were in the height of this it's still sounded that absurd to me oh it always sound crazy yeah and it probably everybody but the problem is people were so weak and so cowardly and so unable to stand on their own two fucking feet they just went along with they said fuck it let's play by the rules and we'll get to go outside do you listen to your bro do you listen to yourself you think that sounds free like you live in a free country right just 14 days just play by the rules yeah just and you'll get to go

a mask oh I gotta go here I gotta go there yeah well I gotta go here like y'all say you're about shit but you ain't about it and now we're here yeah and now this motherfuckers reversing course and here's the thing like and they they mentioned in the article two you know the shiddys saying well I hope I hope I hope we live long enough to see this man executed legitimately legitimately hung he deserves to be hung it's crimes against humanity yeah the person is for that if they take the tap 20 fucking perpetrators of this Fauci, Klaus Schwab a few other people and fucking hung them this would never happen again yeah so I mean he's reversing course Fauci 83 made the startling revelation and they closed I'm surprised nobody's fucking like I'm surprised nobody that lost their business or had their loved ones fucking die over zoom or any of the shit have like I'm surprised this guy still has air in his motherfucking lungs dude it's a counter I mean how do we know that there hasn't already been attempts but they you know like like genuine real fucking attempts like bro if you they're not gonna air that out bro they they can't put that out there because it will fucking make more of it bro they can't yeah it's crazy to me that like it's it's I don't know man are fuck if you guys think our government's gonna hold these people accountable you're fucking insane right they're fucking pussies these people that you elect to they go there they play the game and hope that it's gonna benefit their own their own fucking pocketbook yeah there's very few people that are actually serving the American public in our government very few very few you know the craziest thing is like they have his testimony and like it's all out there right and a lot of people have been talking about it but their steel mainstream media is still trying to lie directly to our face no shit lines like this about you get like they say the truth and say that it's still feeding conspiracy theory of course boy so you made it tell me that the guy that you guys all loved what are they gonna say right hold on what do you expect them to say hey we lied hey we were part of this fucking conspiracy hey we we we create a situation where hundreds of thousands of businesses closed we create a situation where loved ones had a die over zoom calls we created a situation where actual therapeutics were were denied so that we can maintain a state of emergency and continue to transfer wealth from the middle class to the upper class what do you expect them to say what do you expect them to say let's not talk about the 17 million motherfucking people that are fucking died from the fucking complications of the vaccine according to a number of scientists and the data which is processed by insurance companies that basically shows the overall amount of deaths no that's just from Schaden it's no yeah right all cause mortality shows that we are we are in vaccinated people we have had 17 million people die across the globe because of this that's just the start bro just the start yeah whatever whatever whatever whatever the punishment is for the for crimes against humanity I mean he's like we're we need neuroinberg two point treated us like fucking guinea pigs bro criminal no they didn't they tried to eliminate a large popular a large amount of the population which they successfully did they tried to transfer the money before they eliminated them from them to that from from us to them which they successfully did bro the the rate of fucking stillbirths are up miscarriages are up I'm aware I'm I'm afraid to see in fucking 10 15 years that they delete are already able to delete an entire generation of people bro of course that's the goal and I I bet I will predict that in 10 to 15 years everybody who got vaccinated will have will be either dead or seriously fucking yeah yeah yeah but make sure you guys are you know tell your people out there be careful shoveling snow I don't know dude and and this is happening because people won't stand up and speak up man I'm sick of this shit you know like do winter people gonna come together bro like winter people gonna come together people are not extreme the majority of americans and the majority of people on this earth are not extreme progressive left people they just make it appear to be on the media because those people are who controls the media most of the population in the real world is not people who are thinking about cutting off their penises they are not these people who are literally fucking insane like they like the conservatives love to show these people as like that's how they all are that's not how they all are okay most of the people to the left of senate are still common sense people who just are not extremists they have big hearts they believe in like giving some grace for people but unfortunately those people's big hearts have been attacked and taken advantage of and used against them and a lot of them don't realize it some are starting to realize it but then we have this other side of the far extreme right which is fucking just as insane most of the people were in the 90% of the middle when is the 90% of the middle gonna come together and be like fuck these people are destroying our country they're destroying our lives they're destroying everything that we feel like we should have gotten or were promised in this country they're destroying it and until those people come together until we come together and have unity which they are doing every single thing they possibly can to ensure that we do not have but until that happens they will continue to destroy us that's reality so we have to have unity and we have to have mass non-compliance and what that means is when they try to do shit we tell them fuck off that's what has to happen and until that happens we will continue to lose so I don't I don't know what it's gonna take to get people to understand we're on the same team we're on the same boat and we got a couple knuckleheads at the back of the boat drilling holes in the bottom of the boat and we should throw them motherfuckers on overboard these people have no power it's perceived power it's perceived power these are the weakest sickest unhealthiest oldest and capable human beings physically on the planet that is a frail old man look at him if that old man was fucking up your neighborhood what we do that old man oh we put him in a fucking girl I'm so fucking pissed off dude we put him in a fucking hole we would put him in a hole that is a week those people are weak look at them they're weak they're not healthy they're not smart they're not intelligent they were born into a system that they were controlling us in it would be so easy for millions of Americans to show up at Washington DC 10 million fucking strong bro and say your days are fucking over there's nothing they could do about that I'm sick of it dude it's coming man it's unity and non-compliance that is needed we need mass levels of that these people are ruining our lives they're ruining our country they're ruining our future they're ruining your kids future they are psychopaths they give two fucks about you and they've got you convinced they have your best interest in my or dude are you crazy are you not paying attention are you really gonna let your ego like dude most people can't even tell you why they don't like Donald Trump they can't even tell you they came and tell you and by the way I don't even think Trump's the answer I think we need someone who's gonna do more damage in terms of wrecking and redoing we shouldn't be paying 50 percent fucking tax all in or more these state this frivolous spending and this suppression of people and this financial fuckery that we have to live in every single day has to end bro we are not free this isn't a free country we're not free there are more people in prison in this country than any other country on the planet bro you see what I'm saying we are we are we are not free it's what big prison man it is we pay what explain if you work okay right now the average American works until August to pay the government so if you work eight months from January to August so if you work from January to August to pay your tax all in not just your income tax but all your tax what does that make you it's layered the nitty how is that so hard to understand how is it so hard to understand that we work for them and then at the end of our lives after we've accumulated all of these things apparently that they tell us we can get which are almost impossible to get unless you give everything to it they take 60 to 65 percent of it when you die so so along the way you're paying them all your money a majority of your money and then when you die you give them the majority of what you were able to accumulate with the money that you were actually able to keep yourself have the crumbs they gave you what is that what is that it's not American that's not fucking freedom bro no that's fucking slavery and we need a leader who is going to go in and correct that we would this country would be the cleanest most efficient most powerful most prestigious richest wealthiest healthiest country if these people weren't doing the shit that they're doing for their own benefit for their own wealth how the fucking someone go into Washington DC worth a million dollars that come out worth a hundred million that should be illegal it shouldn't be legal to do that you really want to fix shit bro you start taking some of these rich mother fuckers and you say hey we'll give you zero taxes for the next eight years if you serve in government for four years however long you serve you get a tax abatement completely now we start having some smart mother fuckers going to serve people that know how to run things and build things and create things that's right not going into a compound listen there's no saving this without dramatic action there's no saving this without 1776 heart and mentality there's no bringing it back bro we have to have some sort of turnover in our system and whoever we elect should be willing to do that and right now I don't see any candidates willing to do that none of them are willing to do that not even Trump a lot of people love Trump I like I think Trump's the best option we have currently I actually think for vape will be the best option but he don't have a chance to win yeah and and and by the way I don't think either one of them are aggressive enough of what needs to happen to correct this shit no I mean I mean like do you understand the amount of wreckage that has to happen to clean out the corruption man well that's what I'm saying like I mean that's the double advocate part of it maybe they do and maybe they just can't put it all out there because it's not palatable I mean guys like it it will not be palatable like it's going to be some hard fucking truth and we're not in action bro and a lot of people are going to be able to handle that people don't start participating and speaking up and standing for the right shit publicly unapologetically we have no chance no chance guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think and with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is what we bring our headline in we talk about it it'll get one of those two options and so with that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads dog shocks Pennsylvania family by chowing down on four thousand dollars in cash shredded all over the room you gotta go you gotta go for that's 10 gallons of milk right there yeah for sure Biden's America yeah a Pennsylvania couples home improvement funds nearly went to the dogs when their pup made a snack out of a large sum of cash they pulled out to pay for the job quote it was shredded all over the room uh carry law of Pittsburgh to Fox News digital about the money quote there was one area that was pretty decently covered in bills some that had little puncture marks from him biting into it she said of the dog and a lot what a lot of it was missing so we kind of figured out that he had probably swallowed a good chunk of this money Cecil a seven-year-old golden doodle and never done anything like this before law said quote that's why it was kind of shocking law said uh he is just such a goofy dog and such a sweetie he's a hundred pounds and he's kind of a lap dog he loves leaning on people and getting belly scratches a lot of people to describe him as having like a human side a human inside of him uh didn't even register like the dogs hit yeah like the dogs yeah that's what it is bro he really eat it you just stuff that is right that's right dumbasses this guy works for the government yeah uh so this says the couple had just taken out four thousand dollars out of their bank account and have been sitting on their kitchen counter for about 30 minutes uh they said we were planning on paying for a landscaping project in cash law said now we know it was the government now it definitely was the government yeah now we fucking know they're gonna get their piece for the fucker uh I was working at the other end of the house and all of a sudden I hear my husband Clayton yelling that Cecil had eaten the money it just didn't even register because he's never done anything remotely like that in his life she said it was not making sense but it was obvious uh what happened here's a few pictures so they they tried to collect as much as they could and I guess they're like putting pieces of the puzzle back together but uh there's yeah Cecil's got to go bro it's got go he's an IRS he's one of the IRS agents they house correct they fucked up when they said when they said in cell phone distance they were gonna pay for the project in cash yeah easy I gotta get the 60% and then they turn and then they turn on the 5G to activate the chip inside little chewy there to get the money that's what happened bro he's a he's a fit bro this is my fuck work with fits yeah it looks like a good boy he's got go bro he's got go look at him he got no that's 10 gallons of milk right now man he's got go he's looking at he doesn't even know what he did he's like what yeah fuck man I brought be pissed I'd be pissed of course I'd be pissed yeah mm-hmm we'll be giving him this Andy I know this the minute you say you're gonna pay for a job in cash and the fucking press the IRS gonna come fucking look at your shit oh yeah they're gonna come examine the dogs poop for sure no I'm just saying like what why are you painting cash what difference does it make there's like one reason to pay for shit in cash like $4,000 in cash bro and you say that in the press I'm giving this thumbs down because you're so fucking stupid you don't even know what the fuck you're saying who who's the landscaping company I wouldn't say that holy shit man these guys oh shit see some about the good time man locked up yeah these people are these people have watched CNN believe it yeah fuck man oh are any of these media channels bro did you catch the Republican debate on CNN no they had Nikki Haley and Rodney Santas on there with CNN and themselves yeah Anderson Cooper doing the interview it was weird dude it looked weird yeah it was weird and this is why I know that they're putting Nikki Haley as their backup plan because like dude they were trying to like prop Nikki Haley up real hard and she just can't swing the bat though bro like they give her a little soft pitch I don't know she I don't know she did pretty good in this debate yeah yeah she did good she uh I think she did better than the Santas in debate really yeah I mean she fuck but I mean but yeah they gave her the last word on every question they let her fit it they let her talk over them the whole time equality yeah it's the same shit they do to Trump that's you know I'm saying yeah um but then they had a panel afterwards where they like broke down the Republican debate and it was so weird to see them because like they never even like pretend like Republicans exist no you know what I mean and and this is why I came up with what I was saying earlier in the show where I said you know their plan is to have Nikki Haley um because I think they believe they understand that the damage to the party on the Democrat side has been done where I don't know that they think they can recover so they're trying to position like now that they're they're a little more common sense like you like all the commentary was very like quote unquote you know what I mean it wasn't like how they usually are it was like these people are becoming defeated and now they're understanding that if they don't fucking like shift over a little bit they're gonna get yeah all 200 of their viewers yeah no shit I don't I don't think the trust in the media is gonna come back dude now now I don't think it will be it will be it will be it broke because here's the the problem the reason that the reason why is because nobody knows how long it's been like this the media probably could have been like this for 50 fucking years and if that's the case it'll take 50 years to get back I think for us to trust the United States government again and for us to trust the media again it's going to take full disclosure okay and I think the way we get full disclosure is through complete unity meaning everybody who's common sense everybody who wants to live in a free country for real everybody who doesn't want to pay you know more than what they get to keep in taxes everybody who wants peace who wants safety who wants a good economy who wants a good life who wants to build the American dream be left to fuck alone every single one of those people needs to come together whether you're vote Democrat your whole life or whether you vote Republican your whole life and you guys are gonna have to realize that for us to get where we're trying to go there's gonna have to be some 1776 mentality I'm not saying violence but I am saying demand change I am saying mass unity and non-compliance of change that has to happen and unless that happens there nothing will change it won't matter who's elected it won't matter because I don't believe that any of these candidates that are that are electable will make the changes necessary to actually fix what's going on I don't believe they'll do it I believe whoever wins we're still gonna be paying all this tax we're still gonna be getting you know being the slaves of America we're still gonna be the iron fist enforcers for NATO across the globe right like I like dude this is not what America was founded on America was founded on peace prosperity common culture the pursuit of happiness and wealth and success the opposite of oppression freedom these are the things this country was founded upon and we have long long ago left those things in the past and that that that goes for both Democrats and Republicans and they want us to argue over the color of our skin or who we like to have sex with or who blah blah blah all the while they take all the things that actually fucking matter and they they make it harder and harder and harder and harder and harder to survive you know like I think people at this point a lot of people are what can we do and that's up that that's that is the question what can you do there's a lot you can do you're just passing the responsibility of doing anything off to everybody else because it's hard it's hard to speak up it's hard to stand up it's hard to upset your friends and family it's hard to be the first one to say some truth when everybody else is going along with the lie these are hard things to do but you know what I believe that the payoff is worth those things would you like things to continue the way that they are because if you do continue to behave the way that you have behaved the last five ten fifteen years or we can all come together we can all get a revolutionary mentality and start demanding some real fucking radical change in this country that's what needs to happen that's what we need to do and the next time they roll out the big thing we have to say no we're not doing that and anybody who goes along with it they need to be ridiculed and embarrassed and made fun of and made a joke immediately yeah like this idea of not bullying people needs to end people need to be fucking bullied that's that's reality they bully us they have no problem bullying us they don't even think twice about it in fact that's their preferred method of getting what they want and then we're over here convinced don't be mean no I'm gonna be mean because I don't want my country to burn and I want my my brothers kids and your kids and you're you guys who have kids I want them to grow up in a real America not this fucking bullshit that we have now so you should think long and hard about what you're part in that is and start participating because if we don't this thing will burn the fuck down and you won't have shit your kids will never even have a shot at anything and whether or not you've taken advantage of your opportunities that you've had in this country let's say you're an adult person and you live a shitty life that you're not happy with you had the opportunity you just didn't take it so maybe it's time to flip over the mentality and say you know what I fucked up but my kids are not gonna fuck up and I am gonna make my life mean for something like if you're searching for meaning in life right now there's never been a better opportunity for your life to matter than right now in this country ever the decisions that we make as a collective group of people right now will define the future of humanity not just America so when we think about like what can we do we can do a lot and by the way if you've lived a life that you're disappointed with and that you're frustrated with and that you regret here's your chance to make it matter right now so that's my message dude we need it real bad and we need everybody to participate and if we don't I think we all know what's gonna happen guys Andy what's all I got gonna be a hoe show shot
