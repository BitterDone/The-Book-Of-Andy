were like you know tomorrow we got to yeah I'm like not technically huh they're gonna hear it on Monday I'm not gonna pretend that this is Monday though like hey what do you what'd you do this weekend oh I don't know I did some shit that I didn't even do yeah I was actually you know I was worried that I was gonna get hammered in the comments about that it was all right what it was that nobody hammers anybody in the comment the only people that do the hammering are people yeah but like I was like oh DJ you know that was gonna get when these turds get in there and say some shit I love the way our people hammer people and other people's posts yeah that's always what I like like I like when I click open somebody's else's post and some dudes in their sands of shit and our people are just all over them yeah that's always good we got a good group yeah it's great we got a good group man it's good people anyway yeah let's get into it yeah you want to you want to get into it yeah you want to do it yeah I do all right let's do it let's make some people better there we go yeah see yeah hey guess what what I got through your ones for you all right all right yeah so it's pretty nice as I said that I'll show yeah like last last last show yeah a couple of days together guys any question number one let's get into it hey Andy I am a professional soccer player and I'm a goalkeeper right now it has been between me and another guy for the starting job on the team whenever he has played and done well there's always a part of me that hates it and once to see him get scored on I know however you talk about how important our feelings are towards others success for our own personal successes the tough part is usually I don't get an opportunity to play until he has a poor game or makes a mistake how would you approach a situation like this do you have any practical advice to keep my mind and intent in my heart right so I can have success when it is my time to play I think it's super natural for someone who's competitive to want the other person to not do as well so you could get a chance to do well however the problem with that is is that when you root for people to lose you tell the universe that you like losing and the universe delivers losing to you so how do we balance these two concepts it's very simple if the person's better than you you should celebrate the fact that they're better than you because you know that you are equal type human to that person and what one man can do another can do so if you are behind someone who happens to be better than you it is okay to celebrate how good they are knowing that they are actually doing you a favor because they are showing you where you need to improve where people get in trouble with this is is they hate on people who are actually better than them and that hate blinds them from recognizing where that person is better and how they can improve themselves to actually be better so for example when I am out here in the world and I am deciding who I am going to be friends with I look for people who are winning big I look for people who are great and a lot of times these people are better than me at certain things and I love that because it gives me an indication of where I can improve and by the way where can I learn how to improve oh the guy right here who happens to be my friend who's better at me than this and this and this and I happen to be better at him that this and this and this so we get together and even though we're competitive we can learn from each other and improve and we both get better a rising tide raises all ships so while I can understand the internal battle that happens when you're in direct competition with someone I have found that when you root for them to lose not only do you have a harder time winning but you blind yourself from obtaining the skill set that has allowed them to be better in the first place so that's how I view competition I root for people to win I root for my enemies to win the reason I root for my enemies to win is because I know in my heart that I will do everything they do and more to win I am confident in myself I am confident in my abilities I am confident and I know what I am willing to do what I'm willing to invest and what I'm willing to sacrifice to win and the answer to that question is fucking anything if I have to go back to living in the back of my first retail store on a pistein mattress to beat some motherfucker guess what I'll do it I'll do it at this stage of my life I did I would have done it five years ago I would have done it 10 years ago and I'll do it 10 years from now and the reason that I'm successful is because I have that ability to recognize where other people are great and then I am willing to do whatever the fuck I have to do to beat as great or better than them at that thing so why would I surround myself with people who aren't better than me if the people who are better than me are showing me how they got better and also instilling a drive and a competitive spirit for me to get better what do I lose by rooting for that that's how I see it do you feel like there's also like the there's a team aspect to it too right because it's like what is your real like what's the real goal here is the goal for you to be the winner or for the team to win well the goal is for the team to win in a team atmosphere when when you're running a business you need the business to win that's the team right while the team is winning you also have a goal to contribute and to improve and to directly impact your own personal standing your own personal skill set and the results that come from you building that skill set so there are two goals when being on a team first is team first we need the team to win so if that goal is better than you you need to be okay with him winning some games because ultimately you being on a winning team is going to help you tremendously down the road secondly the goal should be for you to improve your skill and what better way to improve your skill than to be on a team that wins yeah so there's two there's always two goals there it's okay to have two goals there it's not this or that it's both you should want to be on a winning team and put the team first and also while you're on the winning team you should want to be the best player on that team and what way to be the best player on a winning team than to be surrounded by fucking winners who know how to be the best players you see what I'm saying most people want to be the big fish in a small pond and what you really want to do is you want to be a big fish in the big pond and you can only do that when you're surrounding yourself by world class winners and world class skill set individuals and that's going to make everybody a little insecure that's going to make you feel a little uncomfortable but if you're a true competitor and you're someone who knows what you're willing to do to get better that shouldn't scare you that shouldn't empower you that should drive you it should inspire you because if I look at someone over there who can do something better than me I clearly because I believe in myself and I have high self confidence I look over there and I say oh that's how he does it okay well I'm going to go do this so I could beat him at that you see what I'm saying yeah and that's that's what you're saying the importance is of bringing those people in close to your circle yeah you hit them up for like to get some work out in the practices you know I'm saying teach you some techniques right like so it's it's it sounds like this is just coming down to a ego issue here no no no I think it's just a competitor yeah when you're competitive this is something that is mentally difficult to sort out okay it's it's it's just it's most competitors they look at people I want to fucking smash them which is cool because I do too however we have to recognize how the smashing occurs does the smashing occur because you just want to smash them and you're emotional about it and you see red no the smashing occurs when you recognize their gifts you do the work to build those gifts and those skill sets in yourself and then you go out and perform at a higher level that's where the smashing occurs the smashing is not a curve because you're angry the smashing does not occur because you wanted to it doesn't occur because you're highly emotional and I've got all this drive and I'm ready to kill that's not where it happens where it happens is I observe what he's good at I put practice into that I adopt that skill set for myself and then I go out and put results up that are better than that persons I love that man I love it I love it guys Andy question number two this is this is one of my favorite questions I like it I like this guy all right Andy first off I love you bro real shit no diddy I found you about six months ago and as a black man from Dallas you be speaking straight facts my question is I've noticed that you speak of consistency a lot the daily wins and being consistent with that have you ever had any issues with consistency being boring I mean I feel like doing the same shit every day can get old let me know if I'm not looking at this right or what you're not looking at this right not or what all right and I appreciate the love all right but I'm gonna let you in on some real shit here the greatest people that you have ever observed at anything in life have mastered the monotonous tasks and do them day in and day out without fail they do not consider the fact if it's boring they understand what result it produces all right so when we talk about Michael Jordan there's very famous stories about Michael Jordan what he did at practice he started with a very specific exercise which was chest passes do you know what they start you doing in basketball practice when you're five years old the first thing they teach you oh they teach you chest passes so you have the greatest athlete ever in this sport undeniably by the way for all you young bucks that think LeBron's even comparable you're fucking insane starting his practice after 30 years of playing the game with the same drill do you think that that gets boring or do you think that he says this is what I got to do to be great all right when we look at the greatest home run hitters of all time or the greatest soccer players of all time or the greatest CEOs of all time these people are not doing different things every day they are mastering the monotonous tasks and the reason that people have such a hard time with success is because they're unwilling to do the boring shit at a high level over the course of time they get to a point where they're like okay I got this figured out I know how to throw a chest pass and then they're like what's next 360 dunks and they get fancy with the shit and they never master anything okay so when we talk about what it takes to succeed the reason that most people can't succeed is because they get bored with the basic shit not realizing that the way you win basketball championships is not 360 reverse dunks it's fucking lay ups okay it's free throws it's the most basic shit in the world and that goes for anything that goes for business it goes for fitness it goes for life the simplest path the boring path is the path of getting the most results and people can't do that because they get bored they they confuse their emotion is how they feel about the action with the actual result that it produces and why are you doing this thing you're doing this thing to produce a result whatever it may be so when we talk about it being boring champion people don't think about boredom they don't think man this is boring they think this is what's required for me to succeed and I think there's a big misunderstanding in society and we can observe this by the way people behave right most people get a job they work that job for two three years they get bored with that job and then they say this job isn't for me and then they go find something else and that might even be an entrepreneur I started a business I'm three years in it's not really working out the way I wanted to so this must not be for me I'm going to start this new business and they repeat that cycle over and over and over again not realizing that every three years that they waste of time is is three years that they're not getting back okay so most people waste their entire lives of this cycle start a thing it gets boring quit a thing start a thing it gets boring quit a thing start a thing it quits board it gets boring quit a thing if you were trying to run a marathon and that was your whole entire goal of life and every time it got a little bit hard or a little bit boring mile 11 mile 15 mile 12 you just quit you say fuck it I'm going to start a new thing how do you ever finish how do you ever get them how do you ever get paid how do you ever be great you can't and this is what people are missing the monotonous shit that you do day in and day out and by the way you are in control of this most of these monotonous tasks that create the biggest payoff in your life are so boring and so simple that people overlook them you can control all of the elements that will create an amazing outcome for your life it's just that people can't do it over the course of time they can control what they drink they can control what they eat they can control the information that goes in their brain they can control the way they move their body they can control who they associate with but they can't control those things over the course of 20 years they can do it in short bursts two weeks here three weeks here before the wedding oh I'm getting serious now so they do it for 30 days not realizing that to produce greatness and produce amazing results that the controllables have to be controlled over the course of years sometimes decades all right greatness is not and all you can eat buffet bro it is a very small tiny bistro with like 10 seats in it and you're lucky to have a place in it and for you to have a place in it you have to be willing to do the things that everybody else can't do and let me tell you what they can't do they can't stick the shit for more than the amount of time where it gets boring so if you want to stand out and you want consistency to really work for you you have to control the controllables without fail over the course of a long period of time decades and you will produce whatever it is that you want to produce and this is the difference between people who are great and people who are not great this is the difference between people who are fulfilled and people who are not fulfilled this is the difference between people who have lots of money and people have no money it's the difference between everything is mastering the monotonous tasks day in and day out and if you can't do that you're leaving your life up to chance and let me tell you how many people get where they want to go by chance fucking zero all right so keep that in mind mastering the monotonous is the most important skill set that you can develop over the course of your life and if you can realize that the basic shit the shit that I just listed off the things that you are control of every single day of your life are the defining factors of greatness you got the game figured out actually this is because when when when did you when when do you think you really like honed in on that on that concept like when did you start becoming super aware of that concept when when when did that happen for you in your journey it happened in pieces so early in my business life I had no awareness once I got to be about eight to 10 years in I started figuring a little bit out of it once I got to be 14 15 years in I figured out a little bit more it took me till I was 36 37 years old to really put all this together and understand that this is a game of compounding efforts compounding inputs attached to the length of time that you do it does that makes sense it makes sense it makes sense so like my my question is follow up on that then did you have any what was there any frustration when I guess you you looking back like fuck okay well I probably fucked off a few of those years that could have been yeah you know I'm saying like how do you have what am I going to do about it how do I go back and fix the first 16 years of my business career and say damn dude I fucked all those away because I didn't understand the shit I understand now how do you think I understand the shit that I understand now the reason I understand it is because I fucked off those first 16 years and by the way I was pretty successful even fucking off so think what's happened between then and now right the amount of exponential growth that's happened from the time I figured this out until now is nearly unheard of all right so this is the play and if you could figure this out there's nothing you can't create in your life you are in control of your outcome whether you want to admit that to yourself or not that's up to you most people won't admit it because if once they admit it and once they say dude I am a control of my outcome that means they got to get up off the couch and do a bunch of shit otherwise they always feel shitty about themselves okay so it's very hard to live a life where you are aware that you are in control of your outcome and then just sit there and watch it go by that's a depressing frustrating aggravating existence that most people can't deal with so what do they do they stick their head in the sand and they say luck circumstance fairness and they bring up these ideas that let them off the hook for being accountable for the result that they're producing yeah I love it man I love it guys Andy question number three Andy I just got recently promoted my job and I've been here for like three years now the only reason I feel like I got this promotion is because the guy who had it fucked up and it kind of got handed to me by default like I don't feel like I really earned this and to be honest is messing up my mind a little bit have you ever dealt with this with any of your employees and what's the best way to change my mindset right now well sometimes good things happen that you didn't earn that's reality but you were in the place where you benefited from that you shouldn't be mad about it you shouldn't be upset about it you shouldn't piss on it just because it didn't work the way he wanted it to work but I think the fact that you recognize that you didn't earn it should be something that lights a fire under you asked to say okay I got a little bit of a break here let me capitalize on that so that I can progress my career down the road faster and faster and faster you know there's a saying don't look a gift horse in the mouth okay when good shit happens don't fight it fucking take it take it and make the best of it so yeah this sounds like one of those situations where maybe you didn't earn it maybe you were in the right place at the right time these things happen but this wouldn't happen with you sitting on the bench you're in the game and that's where the breaks happen so you got a break it was favorable for you and now your job is to capitalize on it and outside of that I wouldn't let a fuck with you at all I would say this is reality this is what happens this happens to everybody who continues to move down the path this is what I was talking about last Q&A about luck a lot of people like to say when they hear luck they like to justify their lack of results by pointing at luck well anybody who's going down the path is going to have breaks that other people are going to call luck and it is happen stance it is the circumstance it could be called luck but the reality is is that anybody that has those things happen to them they are moving forward in life lucky breaks chance encounters circumstances that favor you do not come to you when you're standing still they only come to you when you're moving forward so if you need to justify it in your mind justify it like this the reason this happened to me is because I've been moving forward and as I move forward there's going to be other things that happen that are going to not make logical sense but are going to benefit me and I am going to use those scenarios and use those situations to improve my situation faster I'm not going to fight it what are you going to do walk in the office to say hey boss I'm not going to take this promotion because I didn't deserve it okay what are you bitching about bro like fucking take it make the most of it and go make something great out of the situation that has happened damn yeah that's right let me let me on this topic of luck you know I was thinking about this so I mean because I know we don't like like like you said it's not something you'd like to address and like because you know a lot of people will see oh that's what we're talking about but with this concept of luck is there do you do you believe in the I guess the flip side of that is there's such a thing is just somebody being completely unlucky or is that also a product of their actions it's almost always a product of their inactions you know people say unlucky but then you look at the actions they're taking and they they really can't say they're taking anything that moves them forward you know oh I know it's not fair okay well what are you doing oh nothing all right cool uh I'm unlucky all right well what are you doing oh well I'm going out parting four nights a week I'm hanging out with a bunch of losers I'm doing a bunch of drugs I'm getting fucked up for four days uh but you know nothing's good is happening well no shit mother fucker nothing good is gonna happen to you because you're not doing the things that create good things for you okay so yeah you're gonna feel unlucky when you're exercising the behavior of a fucking loser all right and that's the reality dude look at anybody who says they're unlucky look at anybody who says I am perpetually a victim I I am the victim of life I'm a victim of circumstances I am so unlucky stop listing them and audit their actions what are they doing what are they eating how are they moving what are they putting in their brain who are they surrounding themselves with what are they drinking what kind of drugs are they using oh and that list will tell you the reality of why they are unlucky so I don't buy this shit from people and the reason I don't talk about luck as as real thing is because the minute you bring it up those mother fuckers attach their identity to it see I'm unlucky no bro you act like an asshole you live like an asshole and you have asshole results you're not unlucky you're just getting the fruits of the seeds that you're planting and you're planted the wrong motherfucking seeds so that's the reality of unlucky people are unlucky things going to happen to people are people going to get sick are they're going to be accidents are they're going to be things that happen that are unfavorable yeah that's not that's called fucking life yeah that's what happens to everyone everyone has those things not just you all right so cut it with the victim bullshit nobody buys it anymore it was cool for 10 years when people actually didn't really understand how to operate on the internet and they were like oh my god look at this person they're so unlucky they always have these heart now you've worn that out so much that people are like god shut the fuck up that's what everybody thinks dude all you victim motherfuckers that write about your set you'll never see me write about sad stories you know how much shit I got going on in my life at this time right now now you talk about you motherfuckers are a bunch of pussy's bro and you need to stop it no one cares and the more you bitch the more you cry the more you're gonna find yourself alone and by the way you're creating this inescapable box of victimhood that creates your identity once you tell the sad story and then you keep telling these other sad stories and then you tell more sad stories what's happening is you are creating an identity of that you are a victim and when you have believe when you believe that you are a victim and you created the identity that you are a victim how do you become someone who achieves anything if you're the one sitting there saying I can't achieve anything because all this unlucky shit happens to me I'm the most unlucky I'm always sick I'm always this I'm always that people who did this to me people that motherfucker that's everybody that's every you know many people feel like shit day in and day out you know many people have had people fuck them over day in and day out you know many people have had bad relationships you know any people have been treated poorly fucking everybody so shut the fuck up do something about it the nobility doesn't come from you saying oh I'm got this sad story it comes from you overcoming the sad story and then saying hey look what I went through you can get through that shit too that's where the fucking juices but we haven't figured that out as a whole society so keep shaming these perpetual victims they deserve it I love it man it's the truth I love it handy one one more yeah we'll do another one I got some extra sauce for you yeah yeah I like extra I know you like that exercise I do yeah guys any question number four Andy I came across this real the other day and it was talking about humility and how to quote unquote win the room and the guy had said that you basically want to be the dumbest guy in the room now with all the gurus shit going on I figured I'd start bringing them to you for verification so is there any truth to this statement that you you should want to be the dumbest guy in the room have you heard that do you know what they're talking about is more context neither here what they're trying to say is put yourself in environments where they're you are around more successful smarter people and I think that's a very good policy I think it's very smart for you to try and be around people who know more than you have achieved more than you have done more than you who are more experienced than you and then shut the fuck up and listen so that's what that's saying and I do agree with that that's very very important no matter what level you're at I still to this day and I am a very successful person if I were to sell all my shit retired today there would be books written about what the fuck I've done in my life okay and I'm 44 I'm not fucking 74 all right I could cash it in today and everybody could say this guy succeed in life he built two number one podcast he built all these companies built this mental transformation program impacting millions of people most people don't do that in their whole life okay so I could stop that right now and fucking that would be the story all right but I don't want that to be the end so you know what I do I put myself in situations where I'm around motherfuckers who are older than me who have done more than me who are worth more than me who are smarter than me and I shut the fuck up and I listen to everything they say now do I do everything they say no because there are things that have changed the society that are different than let's say someone who's 75 years old and a multi multi multi multi billionaire but the principles of what that person talks about I do absorb and I do take very seriously so how do we do that well guess what we have the internet who do you follow that's more successful than you who do you follow that knows more than you and I'm not talking about these unverifiable dumbasses on the internet who fucking you know sell coaching programs and talk about how fucking rich they are these motherfuckers ain't built shit they built a business on promise of people shit that they can't even fucking really deliver or nor have they done okay especially when it comes to the entrepreneurship side I'm not talking about those guys I'm talking about household name success stories learn their stories learn their skills pay attention to what they say try to be in proximity to them and then when you are be quiet and let them teach you don't try to assert how much you know which we see this a lot we see a lot of young people we see a lot of people who want to be successful they get around people who are more successful and they try to like flex how they belong in the room by communicating how much they know you don't even know how fucking stupid you are that's what you don't understand you don't know how stupid you sound when you're talking all this shit around motherfuckers like me who've been playing this game for 25 fucking years just like I don't know how stupid I sound when I'm around motherfuckers been playing it for 50 okay so when they say be humble and be the dumbest motherfucker in the room there is a lot of truth to that and if you can't be in the room consume their shit read their books following on the internet listen to what they say and make sure that they've done what they say they've done learn from very very very real verifiable success stories there are so much fakeness and so much bullshit and so much flash in the pan lying that's going on in the internet it can be hard to tell who is telling the truth and who isn't okay if you want to know who's telling the truth ask yourself some very simple questions what have they actually built who are their customers how many customers have they served how many employees do they have who are their employees what's their employees say about them where's their headquarters do they offer a real product can I order their product does the product come to me like they say it should do they service the customer like they say they do what where can I find these products is this an imaginary company or is this a real company is this one of this guy's 18 companies he owns and he can't identify it and you never see it and you never see his employees or is the guy there every mother fucking day and you could very clearly see is who the fuck he says he is if you just vet them very simply like that you will be able to easily identify who the fuck is who okay so learn for people who have actually done it not people who are pretending that they have done it and you will understand what that means okay so do I think that's good advice I think it's excellent advice I love that is there something to be said too like even when you are the smartest person in the room you know it to still be yes absolutely it well it depends okay there's sometimes we need you assert yourself and you stand up you say I know this is the way it fucking is there's other times where there are people in the room who are not as smart as you that you can learn from okay and if nothing else you might be able to learn what not to do okay so it's always a good idea to be humble in this regard when we're talking about learning yeah all right humble doesn't mean driving a shitty car and living in a small house and not thinking highly of yourself humble actually means going out becoming successful and then remembering that the reason that you are successful is not because you are great it's because you took the actions that made yourself successful and when you look at another human being you understand that if that human being were to take the same actions as you they would be successful as well we are not attaching our success to us we are attaching our success to the actions that we take and so what that means when in terms of humility is not that I think less of myself with I understand that I am a result of my actions and that person is a result of their actions that's what humility is about it's not about meekness it's not about monstery like everybody likes to say oh I don't need that kind of life because I'm humble no you're not because you got to be great as shit before you could be fucking humble about it all right you got to have skills before you can be humble about it you got to have wealth before you can be humble about it all right just
