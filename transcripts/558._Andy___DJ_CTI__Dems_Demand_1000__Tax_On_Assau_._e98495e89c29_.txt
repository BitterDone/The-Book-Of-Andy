I get messages from you guys all the time saying how much you appreciate it, how you think the message should be out. Well, as you guys may have noticed, I don't do very well on social media because they suppress the shit out of me and I need you guys to help me share the show. So if the show made you think, if it made you laugh, if it gave you a new perspective, if it's worthy information that you think needs to be heard, share the show. And that's it. What's up? Nothing, what's up with you? Nothing much, man. I felt sexual a little bit. Did it? Yeah. Take a move, what's up? Yeah. Is that how you got Alex? Yeah, it's actually exactly how I got you. I could tell you, you got to say shit. That felt a little weird. No, she was on me, man. I ain't going like, no cap, she was on me. You got a big week? Yeah, it is a big week, man. Got a big week. Listen, I think part of me, I want to turn my fucking phone off because I'm tired of dealing with everybody else. Oh, bro, weddings are nightmare. Bro, yeah, listen. Never again. Yeah. Let's kind of the point. Yeah, right. Yeah, sure. I ain't doing this shit ever again. Yeah, ever again. I don't, I don't, never. Yeah. I don't blame you, dude. Just one time. It's a fucking shit show. And you know what's funny is everybody's coming to drink and no one gets a fuck. Bro, true. Your friends too. My friends too. No. They don't even want to go. They don't even want to go. How many weddings do you actually want to go to? Yeah. Yeah. I was just there for the liquor. You're just saying this is true. This is true. Have you ever went to a wedding you really wanted to go to me neither? Not a single one. And if I did want to go because I wanted to get fucked up. Am I lying? This is true. We like fuck it. It's daydream time. We're drinking all day. It'll be all right. Get dressed up. Open more. Listen, get dressed up. Daydream. It's fun. You're like, yeah, okay. But like real talk. Do you really fucking care? I get it, man. I mean, I'm sorry. Maybe I'm just somebody that doesn't give a fuck. I don't. No, I mean, yeah. But I'm down to come. I go to my friend's weddings and do all that shit but like real talk. Like you put all this stress in, all this money, all this fucking work. And you could just have a barbecue. You know, say it. More as part. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's really much. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Hey. Guys, I want to bring up something real quick before we get into our top. Before we start cruising. So many women are mad at me right now. I fucking ruined their fucking spec. They fucking know because like I'm sure they're like, yeah, no, he's right. Yeah, they didn't want to go either. Yeah. No. Now, dude, it's just a fucking hassle. I don't know. It'll be fun though. Yeah, I'm sure to be good. We'll see. Oh, Mark, right? It is. Yeah. Make sure. Yeah. I made sure there will be no, no, but like, no, but like, no, no, no, I'm just going to cut that out. I was going to get me so I think we do that's Bella. Oh, that's your shit. Yeah, I know. That was there. Dude, I'd break a beer about, I don't know. Two months ago, I drank half of a beer. I was enough. I was like, ah, you can do it. Yeah, really? I think I told the story on the show. No, yeah, no, I did. Remember, I looked around and I'm like, everybody's fucking wasted. And I'm like, these fucking people are playing right into the agenda. I thought I told you that. I told you this. Oh, yeah, bro, we went to eat for Emily's birthday and we both ordered a beer. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I told you that you did. You did. You couldn't do it, man. But that was a bit of a bunch of, that was a little bit. I can't, I don't know. I thought the environment made the beer. Maybe made the beer. I might be done with alcohol, bro. Yeah, like done done. I'm not going to sit here and claim it. Like I'm done forever, but yeah, I don't have any desire for it. Yeah, that's real. That's real. I'm not there on with it, man. So what's going on? Well, dude, so this is a, this is a big topic going on right now. It's the Elon Musk. And it's, it's, I have such a hard time getting a real good like, I feel like Elon doesn't want people to love him. I think he just wants people to like him. Does that make sense? Like, I'm not sure what to think. Dude, it's just weird, man. But either way that Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, it's a real thing again. Like, it's real. It's, it's going to be on and popping. And apparently, this is how I read Elon Musk announces his battle of the billionaire's showdown with Mark Zuckerberg will be live streamed on X with all proceeds going to charity for veterans as the world's richest man reveals how he's preparing for the fight. So Elon Musk has claimed that his showdown with Mark Zuckerberg will be live streamed on X with all proceeds going to charity, both Musk and the Facebook founder have been pictured training since the former tweeted the idea of them facing each other in a cage match in June. Dana White is even chimed in. Next year. No, that's when they started talking about it was in June. Dana White even chimed in. Dana White was quick to get involved in the budding clash between social media moguls, remarking that the clash could take place in the UFC and would be the biggest fight of all time. So Elon Musk tweeted this out just a couple of days ago. He says, or yes, I'm sorry, Zuck, the Musk fight will be live streamed on X. All proceeds will go to charity for veterans and then he followed it up with, he says, quote, am lifting weights throughout the day preparing for the fight. Don't have time to work out so I just bring them to work. Shouldn't you be practicing fighting if you're going to fight? Yeah, I mean, I mean, there's lifting weights, translate to fighting. Very little. Yeah. I mean, I know everybody thinks it does ask anybody who's jacked because listen, Zuck, Zuck's been going. I mean, he's been training pretty heavy. Oh, he's got a blue belt. Oh, he's got blue belt. He's been at. Could you take that would kill Zuck? So how many belts are there between where you are in black belt? It goes white blue purple, brown, black. Yeah, so I mean, I don't know. You have to fight thing going on, but I want to point out a bigger move. That Elon Musk is making right now that I thought was pretty interesting. Let's tell him. Apparently he's beating him the shit out of him and the children making category. Elon Musk has nine children. He has not fucking kids. Read that. Children. No shit. I didn't see that. Holy shit. Damn. Look, dude. What if it's this? What if it's they're going to come together and then tell all the truth about everything? They're going to get everybody to watch. And they're going to get all the fuck. It would be a biggest audience of any event ever in history. They're going to get everybody to watch. And then they're like, yeah, this is what they're doing. That'd be awesome. That'd be pretty fun. That's what you guys should do. Yeah, I mean, like dude, it makes sense because like, you know, as this is developing the fight and shit, that's funny. That's cool. But this is how it comes out. Elon Musk vows to go to war against companies that punish employees for activity on X. I saw that. Yeah. So I thought that was pretty cool. Elon Musk said on Saturday night that his company would go to bat for people who are punished by their employers for things they do on his social media platform. He tweeted this out. He says, quote, if you were unfairly treated by your employer due to posting or liking something on this platform, we will fund your legal bill. No limit. Please let us know. And yeah, he's got quite a few people like respond to him. And he says, he says, he follows up saying, and we won't just sue. It will be extremely loud. And we will go after the board of directors of the companies too. Good. Yeah, I mean, like I said, like I just feel like he doesn't necessarily want people or need people to love him. I don't like him. Yeah, look dude. You know, I, I don't know man. I, oh, that's Lex Friedman in there, huh? And that's GSP who's that guy on the left there? John Donner. Who's that? He's the best GDC coach in the world. OK. Fuck you can afford it. I like Lex's stuff. Yeah, I like his stuff. Yeah, dude, it would be a lot cooler instead of you guys fighting to just like come together and tell the truth about what's going on in the world. Because I know Zuckerberg's been heavily compromised. He went on Rogan and said so. You know what I mean? He told us what was going on with the FBI fucking leveraging him basically on Rogan. Yeah. And, you know, he's definitely making Zuckerberg is making more of an effort. I'm putting my tim full hat. This is a big ass stretch. But I mean, Zuckerberg's definitely been making a real strong effort to be more accepted by traditional male standards. You know, like what you would traditionally call an alpha male or what these puts, he's called toxic masculinity. Right. Like he's starting to fight. He's starting to like get jacked. He's starting to, you know, use that first form protein. You know what I'm saying? Like he looks good. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. But all I'm saying is, you know, is dude, do the right thing. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Because that window is going to close. Yeah, it is going to close, bro. And this is dangerous. And Musk knows it. That's why he's putting out this lawsuit shit. You know, and I feel like Zuckerberg, my opinion has, no, I don't think he's like by any means like, like minded to me and you. Okay. But I don't know that he is this villain that he's been made out to be. I feel like he's trying to show people that he's like a normal guy and these guys got their claws in him, like right away and just chosen. Yeah, dude. And that's another thing too, like people don't understand. And that would be one way to get out from underneath that. Broke it the whole world to watch and then show what they've done. I mean, I know it's wishful thinking probably, but I think he was chosen because we talk about like like the actors, the actresses, everybody that we see these are, these people are chosen. They're selected. Seems to be that way. Right. And so like if we apply that same sort of thinking in this situation, I think he was chosen and I think he woke up and realized that he was chosen. You know, and he's trying to make this, you know, wiggle out of it. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like it's possible. I don't know. It seems to me like the moves he's making are to try and show people that he's not this like alien dude that they made him out to be. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. It's also like, you know, you see how these celebrities are controlled. You know, like did you see the Jamie Fox shit? It's how Jamie Fox, uh, uh, uh, Nio just had the same thing happen to him. Uh, Nio. Oh, that is. Oh, the rapper. Yeah. Yeah, the singer guy. Yeah. Really? What do you say? He called out the trans. He just, so we did the interview and they were talking about the trans issue. Yeah. He's like, listen, I just don't understand what it is about these kids. Yeah. Like why? Where the parents have like he calls it out. Yeah. They need doubles down a statement. Uh, huh. They apologize. And then apologize. Come on now. Yeah. I stand by the LGBT community moving forward. I will better educate myself. Like, I mean, it's completely scripted. Right. And it's just obvious. I'm a control. Well, dude, I think most people are seeing that this like when Jamie Fox apologizes the way that he did, when in reality, he really named nothing wrong or said nothing out of line or out of factual context. And they're getting attacked like these people are showing their cards, bro. Too much. And people are starting to understand. And they're getting to the point where you can't ask questions. You can't even ask real questions. Like if you ask things like this, do you think it's okay that government officials that have been elected to our Congress and our Senate or high political office have dual citizenship? And if you even ask the question, you get labeled anti-Semitic. Mm-hmm. Well, how come we can't ask questions? I can't we just ask questions. That's the point. They don't want questions asked because some of the most evil people in the world are using these generalities to hide behind. These elite people have been genius about how they've designed their defense based around these generalities. And I think the more they make these people apologize, the more exposure it comes to what's actually going on, which is there's a bunch of criminals who all know each other working together to fuck everybody else. Yeah. They're just fucking criminals, bro. And they use these things as defenses. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like I don't understand. I think people are starting to see it because it's becoming too fucking obvious. Yeah. When you attack somebody for, you know, like the control mechanisms for all of these celebrities is insane, dude. Like it's insane. Like it makes you wonder like, is this just a threat? Like, hey, if you don't fucking do this, we're going to we're going to make you not famous anymore? Is this a threat like, hey, if you don't do this, remember that thing you did over there at Epstein's house? Exactly. You see what I'm saying? Exactly. Like there's a fucking couple hundred very evil people, very powerful people that are doing things in the world that are not good for the rest of the people in the world. And you know, they don't want you to point it out no matter what you say. And so the more that they do this, the more people realize that we're not living in a free world. We're living in a highly leveraged, highly controlled reality that actors and influencers and celebrities and politicians are all operating off of some sort of leverage that we don't quite know what it is. But I find it interesting that, you know, we can talk about the CIA killing John F Kennedy potentially, probably, okay? Allegedly. Right. I think it's true. But we can't identify who's on Jeffery Epstein's island, right? You see what I'm saying? So like, what is it? Like I think aren't people kind of finally putting it all together? Like what's your take? Yeah, not another. That's the same thing. I mean, you should even go down to the Trump indictments. Like how does Trump have more indictments than anybody on Epstein's list? And he's not on it. He's not on it. People like to throw Trump. I'm glad he brought that up. They like to throw Trump on that list and say he's friends with Epstein. People don't realize that like when Trump found out what Epstein was doing, he kicked him out of Marlago. Like the narrative of what the Democrats are told about Trump on that particular issue is another rush of gay shit. Like it's totally false. And I don't, it doesn't matter what you think about Trump. We have to stop buying into these identity politics or teams or whatever. We just start thinking critically, you know? It's, it's a one plus one equals two, man. Yeah, bro. And like, you know, it's weird to me that people are still falling for these labels of like racist and anti-Semitic and fucking bigot and misogynist. Like dude, they're clearly using this to stifle the truth or to intimidate people from speaking the truth. And it's working. And the only way it's going to stop working is if people stop believing it and start calling it out for what it is. It's bullshit. It is bullshit. We should be able to ask questions about anything that's going on on the planet with any group. You know, like I saw this. Did you see the, did you see the shit going on in South Africa? Yeah, with the kill the board. Yeah, calling it for white genocide. Okay. How, who's a New York, who's that, who's that Washington Post? Did what? Well, they took about a context. And they said that it was a conspiracy theory and the people that are spouting like pointing and saying, hey, fuck that. That they're white supremacists and racist for calling it out for pointing at something in another country and saying, that's not okay. They're screaming and killing white people and they're killing them. It's not, it's not that they're not killing them. There's thousands of them have already been killed and people will argue, well, those people are living on occupied land or whatever, right? That it's been, that was stolen from them. Okay. That's not the same discussion. Like, what are we going to justify that? Because if that justifies it, then the Native Americans here have the right to genocide. Everybody else. Everybody else in the United States, it's justified. No. Is that an logic we're using? It's a terrible president. Okay. Like, dude, what, and then, and then how far back are we going to go? So are we going to go back and say, well, actually, this belonged to the cavemen. So the cavemen have the right to genocide. Everybody, including the American Indians. Like there's no logic here. Okay. There's things in the human history. It's called conquering, all right, and cultures conquer other cultures. And this is happening right now and people don't understand it. The entire, this is happening on a global scale right now. This isn't just a one country that's being conquered. This is an entire global movement of communism that has led out of the world economic forum and the biggest banks in the world that are literally trying to impose communism. And you can see it. You can see it with how they're pushing AI. Like people like to say, oh, AI is this beautiful thing. But you're not really thinking it through, bro. I see a lot of working class Americans saying, oh, no, AI can't build houses yet, not yet. Right. Okay. And when they totally eliminate human capital or the need for it, what do you think they plan on doing with people? So people have this fantasy in their head. They're like, oh, it would be great. I'll get paid. I want to go to work. That's not how the fuck it's going to work. It's not what will happen. That's not what will happen. Okay. Like when we think about these things, we have to think them through. Okay. Like I read this fucking article actually, my buddy sent it to me. A guy who's been on the show is a good buddy of mine. Very, very smart. Send me this, this link of an AI program. That this wine company implemented. Okay. And this wine company had like 200 something employees. I think it was like 250 employees. And they had a 2000 something catalog of wine that they had to teach the AI, right? But they had these sales people. These sales people had to be educated on all the different wine. Well, they were able to teach the AI, the wine library in like two or three days. Okay. So you know what they did? They fired all of their fucking people. Okay. And this is how they're working to eliminate people from the workforce so that they can impose straight up communism on society. Like it's all part, it's all together. And it's all happening right now. And so the biggest conquering that's ever happened in human history is happening right now by a small, very wealthy, very powerful group of elite human beings, allegedly human beings who are working to take literally everything from every fucking citizen on the fucking planet and keep it to themselves. That's what's happening right now in this point in time in history. You still on saying? Yeah, man. Fucking crazy, dude. What a time to be alive. Yeah. And it ain't going to be for long if we don't do something about it. You shit. Well, I mean, back to your point, be cool with these guys. Call that shit out. I wish they would, dude. I wish these guys would start telling the truth. You know, Musk puts out real tweets about real shit that's actually going on and calls it the fuck out what it is. He put George Soros on blast today or yesterday, you know, saying exactly what Soros did. He brought up that clip from Soros being interviewed where he calls himself basically a God. Yeah. I mean, these people are, this is insane. Like you guys do not understand how these people look at you. They do not think you're a human being. They do not look at you like that. They look at them as elite level above you class. I don't even think they think that we're people. I think they think we're fucking like cockroaches who infest their shit. You know, and now they've convinced the dumbest people in the world about fucking climate change. Okay. When the climate is always changing, you got Ili and Omar out there talking about it's you know, the hottest summer ever and 170,000 years. How the fuck do you know that? You got time machine? You probably do. You know what I'm saying? Like, dude, we got like, we got to get smarter. Bro, and time's running out. Yeah. What's that man? We should be able to ask questions. At least he, I'm less understands that. He's one guy who's somehow, and I don't know if he's part of this shit or not, because he doesn't seem to get the same treatment as all these other dudes that talk out. You know what I'm saying? So I don't know what to think of it, but I know this. I know there's some fucking really bad shit happening, and I know people should ask questions, and I know people deserve to be able to ask questions without being labeled certain things. And if they label you certain things, you should tell them to fuck off. It's that simple. Yeah. That's simple. Yeah, well guys, let's get into this. Remember, if you want to see any of these headlines, pictures, articles, links, videos, go to antifacilla.com. If you're also on YouTube, you can drop down in the description below and check them out there. But with that being said, our first headline, headline number one, headline number one, reads, Democrats demand 1,000% excise tax on assault weapons, high capacity magazines. So this is new. This is coming out. It's not new in the sense of like, you know, they haven't tried this before. This is a second time trying this. So let's stop. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So hold on. Yeah. A thousand percent tax on fucking on a on a P Mag, Mag pool. Yes. On an AR 50, a thousand dollar run in the middle AR 15. Yep. So that now it's 10,000 dollars doing a math right? I mean, yeah. Maybe. Yeah. So how much is a P Mag now, 20 bucks? Yeah. Yeah. Bro, it's insane, man. Let's dive into it. This is Fox News article reading more than two dozen house Democrats put forward legislation Friday that would slap quote assault weapons and high capacity magazines with a 1,000% exercise tax, a change that would raise the price of a $500 weapon to $5,000 in a bid to reduce access to guns across the country. A representative dime by a bear out of Virginia and 24 other house Democrats introduced the legislation Friday. It's the second time Democrats have put forward the idea. Bear and 37 Democrats proposed the same idea last year when Democrats controlled the house, but it never moved. The text of Bayer's new bill was not out as of the weekend and it was unclear if any changes were made from his 2022 version. His bill from last year imposed the tax on any magazine or related device that can accept more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The same 1,000 percent tax would be imposed on any quote semi-automatic assault weapon, which last year's bill defined as a semi-automatic rifle or pistol with a fixed magazine of 10 rounds or more or that have other various features. Under that rule, a weapon that normally costs $2,000 would force customers to pay more than $20,000. A change Bayer argued last year could help quote curb the epidemic of gun violence. He says quote, Congress must take action to stem the flood of weapons of war into American communities which have taken a terrible toll in Evalde, Buffalo, Tulsa, and too many other places. Bayer said quote, again and again assault weapons designed for use on the battlefield have been used in mass shootings at schools, grocery stores, hospitals, churches, synagogues, malls, theaters, bars and so on. Now the NRA replied back. The National Rifle Association has argued gun control advocates invented the term assault weapon to quote deliberately confuse the public and advance the political cause of gun control. The NRA says the term quote unquote assault rifle applies only to automatic weapons while gun control advocates are looking to put controls on semi-automatic weapons. Bayer's new bill was introduced a day after more than 100 Democrats told House Speaker Kevin McCarthy they are quote unquote disappointed that House GOP leaders haven't moved any legislation this year to curb gun ownership in America. Do you see something interesting, Reetness? You see all the places that he listed out is, you know, yeah, all the mass shootings. Yeah. That were done by mentally ill people that were done by people that are lenient Democrat. They were done by their people. Yeah. Where is the legislation, the reason these people want gun control so bad is because they understand that the second amendment is the only thing that stands between them having complete totalitarian authoritative control over the entire world and not. That's what they understand. They understand that. And then you have Joe Biden on TV saying, well, what are you going to go hunt deer with Kevlar, but Vess and you have all these dumbasses who like don't understand, right? They, it's white liberal people who, no for real, who scream when they see a gun, who cry when they see a gun legitimately, okay? Trying to push this and every single gun owner in the United States understands very clearly what the second amendment is about. That's what you guys don't understand. There's no way to get the guns. There's even if you pass a law, you're not getting them. Period. And that's it. Nobody's coming, nobody could come take them. You don't, what do you have a bunch? You have a bunch of pro two A police officers and military that come take people's guns. They understand what the two A's for. They understand what's going to happen. So what are you going to drone strike the entire fucking United States? Like what, what do you guys think you're doing? It's not going to happen. It's never going to happen. It doesn't matter if you pass a loss for it. The reason these people don't like assault weapons and the reason these people don't like these kind of guns is because we intend to use them against you if you keep stepping on our fucking toes. That's reality. And they know this. So they push for it. That's what it's about. So you should ask yourself why we're sending, if we're such friends with Ukraine, if we're so friendly with Ukraine and they're people that we care about and they're people that we love and they're people that we are willing to help. Why are we sending them all of our guns and then trying to take them away from us? Right. Well, so they can defend themselves, Andy. So why do they want to take them from us? This is everybody understands this. It's basically all crusty pieces of shit continue to try and make it about hunting or ain't dude. You guys are the most tyrannical group we've ever had in the history of the United States. The second amendment was designed for you and we're not so stupid that we don't fucking understand that. In fact, gun ownership amongst Democrats is at the highest level ever. Do you know why it's not because of crime? It's because they're afraid of the same shit. They understand exactly what's going to happen if the population gets disarmed, which I don't give a fuck how many soldiers you have. I don't care how many police you have. I don't care how many fucking laws you make. They're not giving them up and ain't going to happen ever, ever. And all this is going to do. What do you think is going to happen today? What do you think is happening at gun stores today? It's going to shit gun sales through the right gun. Guns are like this is amazing, right? Because they're killing all this stuff. Bro, there's the y'all Democrats have no idea what you're talking about here, bro. There's more guns in the United States than all the other militaries on the entire planet combined. How are you going to get them? Are you coming to get them? Name me some of these police officers that are willing to come get them. They're going to put their life on the line and come get some guns from some crazy fucking Americans. No. Ask a police officer. Ask the anyone you know. Are you going to go get guns? They ask you to ask them. Ask them. Ask them. They're going to say, fuck no, I ain't doing that. I ain't doing that because they know what will happen. And dude, that's the line. So like, bro, keep pushing on it because this is what they're trying to do. Here's what they're trying to do. I am convinced from my observations that their plan is to try and incite violence amongst the citizenship amongst the quote unquote, madder Republicans, right? Which really what they're talking about is any common sense American that owns guns and understands what they're for. And they're labeling it anybody who's outside of their narrative as madder Republicans. When in reality, it's a whole bunch of people that have common sense and understand, like you all think you're so fucking smart and that everybody else is stupid. We all understand what it's for. Like it's not for deer and kevlar vest, Joe Biden while he shits his pants on TV. Like what? Like it just shows you how how stupid I would touch. They think people actually are. You know what I'm saying? So like, dude, my opinion is that they're trying to incite violence. So while they're in control, they can use the military to crush the violence, all right? And then make new rules that say, well, accomplish two things. One, eliminate the leadership of the quote unquote domestic terrorist, aka regular American human being threat, okay? The people who organize it because they're counting on those people being at the uprising, right? And the second thing is, is after they do that, they can say, well, we had J6, we had this, what are we going to do with these people? And they're going to try to fucking remove these people from society and kill them. That's what I think they're going to do. Guys, chime in on this conversation. Let us know what you think in the comment. Tash tag ain't going to happen. It ain't ain't going to happen. It ain't. Let us know in the comments, guys, what you think. It ain't ain't fucking happening. Ain't going to happen, but yeah, I'm with it. Guys, let's keep this cruise move. We've got a headlight number two. It's insulting to our intelligence that they keep trying to do it. Want me to get, I mean, because I mean, even if that did go through, like, I'll be, here's also something that I'm not accounting for. Most of the people who, you know, want the guns, they already have them, right? They don't only do they have them. They have a shit ton. They don't understand. They have a shit ton. Not only that, they have a shit ton, and then they have pallets of ammunition. Dude, I know dudes who are like regular dudes who like have a regular job that have a hundred grand worth of fucking guns and amos. No, you're creating an outpost. You don't understand. There's a dude in every single human's neighborhood right now with enough weapons to arm the entire neighborhood and provide ammunition. In every single red state, in every single neighborhood, in every single subdivision, there is that dude. There's that dude. And then there's a bunch of other mini that dudes, right? Right. They're not doing it. And this stuff is, this stuff about doing it is only antagonizing people more and more towards violence because the more they push to that, that's going to be the line. The line is when they come to try to take guns, it's going to spur violence. And I wouldn't be surprised if they figure out a way between now and election time to legitimately make some sort of order or emergency or something where they try to take the guns. I think, you know, conspiracy, it might be tinful at times, but quick conspiracy on this, right? So a few months ago, I remember reading a headline when I was talking about how like Mastercard had turned over the receipts for the purchase of guns, correct? Yeah. And they turned that over to the FBI and ATF. And then, you know, you have this, you know, because they do these every couple of months. Yeah, but doesn't the ATF already have everybody's information? This is the thing they don't understand. Yeah. Like, when we, people think that when you go to buy guns in a red state, that you just walk in and it's candy, like you just fucking get the shit. No, you have to fill out paperwork. They got to call the ATF. They got to run your shit. Like, there already is restrictions in place to prevent criminals from getting guns. And guess what? Do you know why criminals are called criminals? Because they don't obey the law. Like what the fuck are we talking about? So you're going to make laws, like the criminals to follow. That's how you know it has nothing to do with anything other than the disarmament of the population so that they can impose their will on us any way they want. Yeah. Yeah, man. I don't know, man. Like I said, guys, check in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. Bro, Democrats are buying guns at the highest rate ever because of the crime situation in these cities. Like, yeah, I mean, there's record numbers. You're not all of our buddies that run, you know, fire on businesses. They've been killing it. Oh, yeah. Kill it. No punks in it. Well, look, man, I'm come get them. Yeah. Yeah, guys, make me first. Get me first because I'll make a point of it. Guys, let's keep this cruise moving. We got headline number two. headline number two reads. We said we're going to check in with this and the point that we do, we got Facebook files. Man, metaphiles. Let's see what the newest update is. This bright bar article headline reads Facebook files FBI lied about extensive meetings with Zuckerberg's platform about Hunter Biden laptop from Hill. Now, couple of weird things before we dive into this. I just want to point out one bright bar is pretty much the only news agency out there that's actually reporting on metaphiles. Okay. Unlike Twitter files where, you know, everybody was kind of talking about it, even CNN. Nobody's talking about it. Twitter ain't doing it because they're fighting right now. Right. Right. But nobody's talking about it. Like no, like no mainstream media sources really talking about it. That's one. But the other thing I want to point out, Jim Jordan, man, he and Eric Schmidt, who we just had on the last CTI, they're putting in some work. They are putting in some work. So let's dive into this. Let's get our meta files updates. See where we're standing with this. A Bible article reading. The FBI lied about the extent of its communications with Facebook regarding the Hunter Biden laptop story in 2020. Newly disclosed communications from the tech company reveal a representative Jim Jordan out of Ohio says that the FBI's claim and only met with Facebook once about Biden's laptop from hell are quote, completely false. Of course, we all knew that. This is the latest installment in rep Jim Jordan's Facebook files, a series of internal communications from the social network, networking platform obtained through a subpoena by the House Judiciary Committee, which Jordan chairs. In a sworn deposition in the Missouri, the Biden case, FBI special agent Elvis Chan, this guy, which I mean, holy shit. Can we just say a second on this guy? Give me your best shit, what you got? I mean, he looks like exactly what I would think. What does that mean? It means what the fuck it means. These are not real people. These are not real people, bro. These are people. Bro, I would take his lunch money if I saw him in school. But I want to take a guess. Yeah, sure. But apparently, is this guy's fault. So they're saying that this guy, Elvis Chan, he's an FBI special agent. They're saying that Elvis Chan, who is the main conduit between the bureau and big tech companies, claimed that apart from one instance, he was not aware of any meetings between Facebook and the FBI regarding the Hunter Biden laptop story. But again, one is too many. Yeah, one is too fucking many. One's too many, absolutely. But in the same deposition, he also claimed that he had, quote unquote, no internal knowledge of the FBI's investigation regarding the troubled Biden son's laptop. The Facebook files reveal that both claims to be false. Internal Facebook communication reveals that Chan had more than one meeting with Facebook regarding the Hunter Biden laptop story. So let's look at this thread. Now, it's interesting that you said Twitter wouldn't happen or X wouldn't happen on this, but he's actually been releasing this on Twitter or X. Can you just call it Twitter? Yeah, I mean, that's why I'm saying you can't get sued for that. I call it a fucking X. You can't get sued for it. It's fucking Twitter. Okay, it's Twitter. Yeah. It's still at least it is still Twitter on like laptop and Twitter. Yeah, that's top version. Fuck you. Twitter. So let's dive into this. Jim Jordan, this comes out today. As far as he says, the Facebook files, part four, FBI lied about meeting with Big Tech regarding New York Post's Hunter Biden laptop story. So let's dive through this. So he says, FBI special agent Elvis Chan is the main conduit between the FBI's foreign influence task force and Big Tech. So the FBI made this task force called the foreign influence task force. I mean, that's who Elvis Chan was running that task force and that's how they were communicating with Big Tech agent Chan was in the meeting between the FBI and Facebook on October 14, 2020, the day the New York Post published its story on the Hunter Biden laptop. Laura Demlow is the current section chief of the foreign influence task force on October 14 when Facebook asked if the laptop was real, she responded, quote unquote, no comment. Even though the FBI had the laptop and knew it was real. I says in July, they interviewed the judiciary, GOP and weaponization committee interview Laura Demlow. Okay, her testimony was shocking. She said that in October of 2020. Is that correct? So what? Go back on that. On October 14, is that 2020 or this past October? That was 2020. Okay. So so while I know that's this October 2022. Yep. All right. I know. That was on October 14 meeting with Facebook. So Facebook asked her on October 14th, the day the story came out. About 2020. Okay. So right before the election. Correct. All right. So on October 14th, the FBI who knew the laptop was real said no comment when they were asked about it. Correct. Okay. Just wanted to make that clear. Yeah. So that's right before the election. And these are the same people who made Twitter and Facebook and some of the major MSN pop publications removed this story and label as false. Okay. Yep. And he says that Jim Jordan says that her testimony was shocking. Well, hold on. Which we now know is completely real. Come come absolutely real. Okay. So so how are these people not in jail right now? We need to get Jim Jordan on the show. I'm not on that. Yeah. He says he says her testimony was shocking revealing that the FBI deliberately withheld critical information from social media companies about Hunter Biden's laptop the day the New York Post story broke. In her interview, we learned for the first time that the FBI met with Twitter on October 14th before meeting with Facebook the same day. And when Twitter asked if the laptop was real, an FBI agent said yes, but a second FBI agent, a lawyer jumped in, cut him off and said no further comment. There's your fucking proof right there. Well, man, we all we all know what's going on. This is just the absolute proof of what's happening. Yeah, that's all this is. But Jim Jordan says it gets better. Jim Low revealed that the FBI then had emergency internal deliberations to decide how to answer that same question going forward. Someone at the FBI, the FBI refuses to say who ordered that the FBI would say no comment going forward. Later that same day, October 14th, 2020, Facebook met with the FBI, including Elvis Chan and Demlow, Facebook asked the same question is the laptop real now having its story straight the FBI responded no comment. The Demlow, Jim Jordan asks, he says, Demlow, know that the FBI had the laptop and it was real? Yes. Did other key members of the FBI's foreign influence task force know? Yes. The FBI knew the laptop was real and yet decided it would say no comment. We know what happened next Twitter and Facebook censored the New York Post story, the Biden campaign secretly set in motion, the events that led to the 51 former Intel officials discrediting the story as Russian disinformation. Which all 51 of those people knew that they were lying when they did that. Absolutely. Absolutely. Which is now proven. Yeah, I mean. I'm. So go ahead. Yeah, I mean, my thing is here like, okay, we're getting all of this. We have the proof. You got Mr. Fink thing brothers here, fucking Elvis chain lying under of. It's perjury. We have all like. Why is he not like how is he still free? Bro, here's what bothers me the most about this is like who the fuck gives these people the right to do this shit? Like how elite do you think you must be over the rest of America to think that you're in a place to censor the truth for American citizens? Like that should give you some insight about what they think about us. They do not think that we are their equals. They do not think that they serve us. They think that we exist in their world and that they have the right to craft the narrative anyway they want true or not true because we're just little peasants out here. We don't matter. The further that this goes along and the longer it keeps going the more true that becomes because this information continues to come out with no accountability for any of it. All of these people should be in jail. All of the people in the FBI who know about this should be telling the truth about it so that they don't get mixed in with the people who are going to be found guilty of it because justice is going to come. You are not going to be immune and all the people who went along with it are going to be held accountable. Well, yeah, I mean, here's the dangers that they've made too with all these fucking indictments on Trump. You understand what I'm saying? Absolutely. Like, bro, people are starting to backfire. No, dude, people are starting to understand that the CIA, the FBI, ATF are all agents of a rogue federal government that does not represent the people that is potentially in place because of fraud. And I see it as a coup. When people are whizing up, they're starting to understand that these people are part of them, not part of us. And there's a whole bunch of people in all these agencies that are regular people that have those as a job. And they're staying silent because they're being told to stay silent. But to those people, I would say, dude, you better think it through because if you know what's going on and you're staying silent when accountability comes, it's going to come for you too. And that's real shit because eventually the accountability is going to come. These Jim Jordan, these people are not going to give up. They're not going to quit. They're not going to be railroaded. They're not going to be silenced. The cat is out of the bag and the public understands what is out of the bag. And you guys are still staying quiet and you're still afraid you're going to lose your job, bro, you might lose more than that. It's important that you guys wake the fuck up and tell the truth because, dude, this is getting to a point where the truth is out. And people are seeing who's guilty and what they did and how they did it. Well, that was my point too. Like even with the Trump indictments, right? These are things, you know, we talk about election interference. That's exactly what this was. A government agency intervened with Big Tech to censor a story weeks before the presidential election. They done more than that, bro. No, 100%. I'm just saying, just in that one example, right? People were like, well, election was not election was, it's not secured just based off of this. You look what they did for the seven years to Trump with the Russian agency. Yeah. Like, bro, do you guys, do you guys not remember how much shit was thrown at Trump during, and you could hate Trump all you, why don't you give a fuck if you like him a note? The whole narrative for seven years now has been what a criminal this guy is, what a piece of shit he is, how he colluded with Russia and he's a trader. He gets peed on by Russian prostitutes like all this shit and none of it's true. And they disrupted our civil peace and society. They polarized the population. In our tax dollars to do it. Bro, they've put in a thousand stories to divide us and to get us to fight about everything. This is our own government and three letter agencies running this play on Americans, dude. This is like legitimate, legitimate, mental abuse of Americans that our own government is doing. It's a psychological operation that, dude, they're abusing people, they're driving people insane purposefully. Like, dude, this is, this is fucking fucked up, man. Yeah, I mean, listen, I'm, I'd be excited to see, you know, what comes next, you know, we had Twitter files come out that laid out all the proof that it was happening. And what happened? Nothing. And then now we got all these meta files coming out and Facebook files coming out. What's going to happen? Nothing. Do you know why nothing's going to happen? Because we're not calling for accountability. Well, first of all, that, but they don't plan on doing anything. They want to show you the information and then show that nothing happens because that demoralizes society to thinking, well, this is just the way it is. We can't do anything about it. That's the point. The point is, yeah, we did it. So what? Yeah, we lied about what you're going to do. Trump Russia. They want violence. They want violence while they're in power so that they can use their power to squash the violence and stay in power. That's what's going on. They're saying to us, do something about it. Fuck you. Peasant. Like, that's what they're saying to us. Yeah, man. Guys, let us know in the comments. Put up down below what you guys think where you guys stand on this following the comment hashtag meta files. That being said, let's get onto our third and final headline of the show headline number three. This one was wild. I'm sure everybody's been seeing it. I've been tagged probably a hundred fucking times in this. Let's talk about it. Headline reads, wild brawl breaks out on Alabama doc among dozens of people in caught on video. WWE style mayhem. Did you see the audio, the audio overs that are going around about this? Like the play by play calls. Oh my God, dude. I laughed my ass off so hard, dude. I mean, dude, listen. There's a lot here. Okay. And listen, like for those of you guys who know me, I typically try to reserve judgment until like, you know, most of the information's out. And I saw so many people jumping in on this. All this is, you know, fuck it. I'm glad our ancestors will be proud. Kick those white guys ass. Right? And you do all of this and like I was looking at the video and one of the first things I thought, man, I said, we'll hold on. Why does it, like why does the video just seem to cut right to the fight part? The fight. Yeah. And I'm like, well, hold on. I've seen this before because they do this quite a bit with all of these viral videos that go on, right? Like it's cut. Right? Like there's a reason that that starts it, right? But like you've been in fights. I've been in fights. It's never just like nobody just walks up to somebody and just throws a punch. It's more than that. Typically. Maybe the video starts where they're arguing like pretty heavily and heated. Correct. Yeah. Now, another, like let's just, let's go through this and we also don't know like because I haven't seen the other part of it, but we don't know if there was any physical contact before that or whatever, right? I've seen it. Well, I'm just saying. Yeah. So let's dive into this though. So let's just say what we know now, okay? We're here. This is a New York Post article reading. An out of control brawl broke out on an Alabama doc Saturday morning among dozens of people in a manic scene that mirrored a massive WWE fight all captured on video. The wild battle, which witnesses said, started when a group of voters attacked a Montgomery Riverfront doc worker ended up ended with people thrown into the river multiple struck with a folding chair and several in handcuffs according to footage posted to social media. Just pause real quick. Honestly, it's Alabama. I would not expect anything less. You know what? I watched enough of the video to say this. I thought it was cool that they fought and didn't shoot each other. Yeah. It was just a fight. I would have liked to see some hand shakes after when I was coming up, dude, that's how you fought. Like you were getting these big fights. Now, I'm not race fights like this. I don't even think this was the race fight. Well, I genuinely don't. It turned out to look like that. But the point, the optics definitely looked like that. It looks like white people fighting white people. I mean, I'll tell you that I would say white people need to get more black friends, black people get more white friends and it wouldn't look like that. I mean, I don't know. Yeah, listen to all of saying is when when dudes ran up, they knew what team they were fighting for. Yeah. Like, bro, we were, oh man, that would be a rough of me were there. Yeah. Okay, do you got to go to that? I bro, yeah. Yeah, I'll say this. You white guys, like you're, you're, you're, you're high-long game as weak as fuck. Yeah, as weak man. Yeah, you guys had the shit won. You showed some mercy and then you got your ass beat. Yeah, you can show mercy now. Got a fit. We would have been blaster for that though. Yeah. But oh, yeah, I'm, I listen to me over here. Fucking white surprise. Oh, shit. So, so Montgomery police have issued four active warrants as of Sunday and more will likely follow as they review videos posted to ex formerly known as Twitter. Local NBC affiliate station, WSF, a reported. The melee occurred at about seven p.m. Saturday at the 200 block of Cusa street police told station a witness claimed that the group of boaters refused to move their pontoon boats so that the Harriet two river boat could dock. I'll also say this. I don't understand what the infactuation is with black people in boats. I personally don't get it. What do you mean? Like, bro, they love their crew. They're cruises. These fucking river, but like, bro, I ain't getting on it. Well, I ain't getting on either, but they because I'm black. Like, I don't know. Bro, it's just like, it's like there's an inner like a inner ancestor call to say like stay away from those boats. Stay off the boat. You know what I'm saying? Like, it just, I don't do it. I don't, I don't either here know that. Let's watch some of these videos. So this is the first one. This is the one that everybody has been seeing. It's really, really mainstream. This is the first video. Uh, let's dive into this. This is the first video. This is the first video. He's got the hat toss. He's got good bass. Look at that weak ass shit, dude. Come on, they're not even beating up anybody. Oh, dude, oh, dude. They're coming reinforcements. Bro, you're swimming in the water. It's taking a minute, though. Did you see the video? It's like that's black aqua band. Bro, it's taking a minute there. Maybe he's better swimming than me. Take off your shoes. Alright, so then there's a breakdown video. That guy swim from the river boat to the fucking rock. Yes. So that's the boat that was waiting to dock. Yeah, okay. Alright. Now this is second video. Don't even ask me. It's work. We're trying to get on the super cycle. The Mary, I try to come through. And the man would say, I'm gonna move that. Well, that'd be real. I can't understand what the fuck she's saying. Yeah, can you? No, no, no, it's a little too southern for me. Yeah, I'm gonna fast forward to the violence. They're coming about there. They're going for it. They're going for it. They're going for it. They're going for it. They're going for it. They're going for it. They're going for it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now fight was over at this point. The minute it restarts. I'm going to talk a minute about it. Yeah. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Pause the shit. You hear that woman? That's what gets people killed. Yeah. Women get these dudes killed all the time by doing that shit. Yeah. I'm not talking about black dudes. I'm talking about all dudes. Women standing in the back screaming. More dudes getting fights because women fucking start them than any other reason. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I mean. There's always about, there's always about some... And they're egging the shit on and then someone's getting killed and then they're posting ghost and go fund me on their page when it's their fucking fault. Yeah. So let's be real about it. It's a fact. Woo. That's bad. Woo. That's bad. Woo. That's bad. Now at this point cops are here. Oh, my God. Completely outnumbered. That was chicken. That was chicken. That was chicken. That was chicken. That was chicken. Oh. That's a man on the woman. She went behind. She went behind. That's a man on the woman. That's a chicken. Oh. In the woman. In the woman. That's a song. Because now we're all. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You're fine. Uh-huh. Both. Both. Both. Both. Both. Both. Stop the thing. Woo. People that do this, like this, like this woman, she should go to jail with all of them. Uh-huh. I was, I, I, they should proactively arrest people to instigate like this. Yeah. Honestly, I, I, I honestly, I have a like a, like I can't stand people who just sit there and record the shit. That's all society with anything. Like that person, like that, that's a really like and like it's not just for like fights and she like it but it would be anything. Fucking, like no concert or fucking. Instead of using their phone to call fucking 911. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? It's like, what the fuck? Do something. You know, okay. Oh, this is this is likes and shares. This is what likes and shares and intention economy has done to people. Yeah. Now, did you see the videos from the riots? Oh, in New York City. Did you see it? Well, everybody had their phone out and saying, bro, which it's it's insane. Now, I will say this though. All right. I do like every now and then I like seeing that there is still a little backbone and, you know, fuck you mentality in Americans and, you know, at least the capability of fucking violence. It's nice to see every now and then. But we got to know when the fucking when when the when the hold it, hold it back and then stop it from escalating into all these crazy things. Now, I did see a video. I've been trying to get it up. We might see if we can upload it on the back end of the show. But how this all started is because that security guard started. So the guy's one even on their boats. He goes to the boat and unties it and tries to like push it off into the fucking water. So that's when the guy comes down. I was like, yo, what are you doing? That's my boat. That's when the verbal authentication starts. And in turn, it's physical. Um, so I mean, there's that. But, you know, speaking of violence, did you see those, uh, those seven, eleven store owners? Uh-huh. Now they're, they're possibly going to be getting some assault charges for a whoop of the guy that was still in them. Nobody's with that. It's the most popular meme on the internet. Bro, that's the most popular video going around the internet. Do you think people are going to support this? Bro. Now I don't know. Now this is California. It's going to make sense. Yeah. It's California makes sense, right? Um, but in a now-vowar video, the workers are seen smacking the suspect with a stick after he entered the store and stocked in with a garbage can and began filling it with tobacco products behind the counter. Here's the video. Let's, let's check this out real quick. And now you can do it, man. So, it's coming. No, don't, don't, don't do that. Don't do that, man. Don't do that. Oh, I love it. Oh, shit. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What the hell is that? That's all over you. That's all over you. I love it. I do too, bro. The guy deserves a fucking award. Let's find out who he is and send him like a golden stick. Okay. Like, like, this is awesome. Bro, it's fucking great. Yeah. But here's the thing, man. So you find the part. So apparently, this was, yeah, here we go. So the attempted that was, so that video you guys see and that's from July 29. Okay. That attempted that was allegedly the third time in two days, the man had targeted the store on a previous occasion. He tried to intimidate staff by claiming he had a handgun. Despite widespread praise for the workers for defending the business, Stockton Police Department said they are now under investigation for assault. The robbery probe is also under. Quote, it has been brought to our attention that a video of two 7-11 employees assaulting a robbery suspect has been circulating. That's not assault. It's called self-defense. Yeah. You're protecting your property. This is protected by law. It says we are aware of the incident and the investigation is ongoing. Staying set on Saturday. The witness who records the fracas has since praised the courageous response of the workers. Police said the incident follows several thefts at the store by the same suspect. This is a repeat of ending. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if it's his first time or his 30th time. Looks like a game of lash for every time now. This is for Saturday. This is for Thursday. Don't beat me upside down. That guy has chopped some wood in his day, man. He was giving it to him, bro. The best part about that video is when he starts yelling, okay. Okay. Like he used to do with your mind with your ass. Okay. Oh, fuck, man. Yes, I mean, what we got on this, man. I don't know, man. I'm happy that nobody got killed in any of this stuff. Yeah. You know, that's nice. Like I think people should go back to the at least this kind of violence instead of this bullshit of like shooting everybody that you don't like. I also would like one of conscious like caution caution people. That's not like let's not feed into their play of making everything about fucking race. Not genuinely. Don't believe this was a race thing. Well, it became about race like very quickly. Yeah. You know, like. But that's how we're trained. You know what I'm saying? Like you can't just be a bunch of people fighting. It's automatically got to be racist. Yeah. You know, but like it ain't racist when groups of black people beat the fuck out of white people in the street. Yeah, no racism there. Yeah, we don't fucking see that. Like when we played that video a few months ago that black mob of teenagers. They were all black exclusively black pulled that woman by the hair and beat the shit out of her. She's trying to get into her house like nobody calls that racist. Yeah, that's just teenagers. Yeah. I'm just saying the racial double standards real dude and people don't want to address it. It's a real thing. Yeah. Like they're there. So we got to stop playing into the shit. Yeah. Got you. Got you, man. Well, guys, you have heard about Boston Tea Party. Right. Yeah. All right. This Alabama Tea Party. Guys, let us know in the comments what you think about this. And that was our third one. That one dude ended up swimming, man. Not the guy to swim over, but the other guy got tossed in. Oh, there was a few people got tossed in. Yeah. And I think one of the videos at the end, there was like a picture of a fucking like this dude with the fucking, oh, you know those hard stories. Well, you ever been in a fight like that? Yeah, I have to. Once. I've been in a couple once. Yeah. Like working in the bars and then also just being a degenerate my younger days. I've been in a few group fights. Yeah. They're like, how the fuck happened? It was like, I was hoping you don't get killed. Yeah. It's crazy. I mean, it's exactly what that looks like. I knew that. I fuck it. Shit's coming for everywhere. I fought a bachelor party once. It was like my first time. Dude, I was real quick. So we got to. I was 17 years old. Okay. Working in a bar and South City, St. Louis. My first day on the job. I'm standing outside the intrigate, right? Card and people, right? I'm not even supposed to be at the fucking bar. But there's that. And the next thing I know is the way the bar was, I'm outside. And the way the bar was kind of set up. It was like, there was this balcony rail landing that was on the second story, right? So I'm sitting there. Next thing I know, I hear, hey, watch this. And this is a few years ago where there's glass bottles and bars. This fucking guy throws a fucking, I've never, it was a butt-like platinum bottle. I can throw it down in the lens, like right at my fucking feet, shatters, right? Now look up. I see his fucking face. I'm like, you're mine, right? My fucking run up the stairs, grab a guy. By the time I get up there, he is fucking, he's drunk. Like he's slump. And so I'm like, I'm gonna take it easy with this guy. All right. He's obviously had too much. Let's just get him outside. So I'm gonna start like walking this guy down the stairs. I mean, these are wooden stairs. It's the old deck. And you know, it's a fucking second story, old school, 15 foot, vaulted sillings, right? I got a long way to go. I was probably on the third or second, you know, last step to the bottom. And as we're walking out, it was a bachelor party. And one of his guys comes up behind me and fucking hits me in the back of my head, right? My other bouncer catches it. And now it's two on fucking like eight. And it was just all over. Yeah, but the drunk people are easy to beat up. Super easy. Yeah. And so like, you know, where that bar was, taxis would line up out in the front of the bar, right? And so when I caught that guy, I gave him some. And I took his head and threw it in the back of the fucking taxi. Like, hit the fucking head, like broke the head. I mean, dude, it was just all out. Bro, I'll ask you probably about 30 seconds, but yeah, like three hours. Bro, I got my ass beat so bad in one of these fights one time. Like, look, look, dude, you heard it saying beat the shit out of someone? That's an actual thing that happens to you and ask me how the fuck I know. How do you know it? Because I shit my pants. That's how bad I got my ass beat. All right. We were on the beach. We were 17 years old. And I was like, fuck, and destined. 17 is a good year, man. That's just a good age. We were, we were in destined and it was me and like five of my buddies, Chris was there. Yeah. And my buddy Derek, who, you know, was pretty wild back then. And all the girls like Derek, because he was like, he had like a man body, like at like 17. You know, like, abs and shit. Well, there's like three months of difference. Right. Like, yeah. So like, so like, we walk up on this party. And we, we've fucking, you know, totally lied to our parents and we fucking partied our ass off and got fucked up. I somehow they let us go down there like three days earlier and we were supposed to be. It was because they fucking had three days, bro. We caused like literally thousands of dollars of damage because like, like another thing happened where this person down below in the balcony had a astroturf carpet on their on their balcony and the dog. And we were up there smoking and fucking, one of the ash put a hole in the thing. And so like, we had to pay to fucking replace their, there's a whole big, we were, we were, we were, we were wild. 17 year olds. Yeah. Okay. And we walked up on this party and it's like, you know, I don't know. Probably a hundred people total. Okay. They're partying on the beach and they're all like our age. So we walk in there and we're chilling. Dude, it's cool. Like they were all cool. She was cool. We were fucking partying and his girl walks up and she's talking to, she's, she's talking to Derek and she's like trying to like hook up with Derek, right? And Derek's like not having it. He's like, now, you know, blah, blah, blah. She was standards. Yeah. She wouldn't leave him alone. And so he finally, he was like, Hey, look, I'm not fucking you. I'm not talking to you. I'm not, leave me a fucking alone. He was pretty stern about it. So she fucking goes away. She comes back in like three minutes with like all these dudes and they all, they're all built like Derek. Yeah. And so like 18 year old. Yeah. So this dude walks up and he's like looks at fucking Derek and he's like, my girlfriend said you were trying to fuck her and like, bro, it was a total opposite thing. Like this girl was trying to definitely, I was listening. I was standing right there. And Derek's laughing. Like Derek does it. Derek did not give a fuck. He didn't care. So he's smoking a cigarette. This guy is like screaming out his face and he's like super calm, dude. And I'm looking at him. What the fuck's this dude so calm for? Oh, that's the best. Yeah. And I see Derek take a drag of his cigarette and just fucking put it out on this dude's chest right in front of him. And I'm like, right in front of me. And I'm like, fuck. And before, because I was the biggest dude. So I knew what was happening, bro. They were coming to me. All right. You get first. So like, bro, all of a sudden I went from like standing there looking at like holy shit, this is happening to like all these flashes happening around my head. And what was happening was I was getting stomped on on the beach. And dudes were kicking me and fucking stomping me and beating my ass. And I was trying to get away. They stole my, I had a gold change. They stole that. No, but dude, I had to like struggle so hard to get away. I shit my pants. So I got to shit beat out of me. He's real shit. And this scar, not this one, not this one, but this one is from that fight. Yeah. Dude hit me with brass muggles. Okay, but see like that shit's not fair. Yeah. Well, I mean, Baronucle brawl. Hey, it is what it is. You know, be careful because you get to shit me down here. I lived a fight another day, man. Bro, I remember running down the beach. I was running down the beach, bro. And I had to get the stuff out of my pants. So I'm like running down the beach. Like I couldn't run full speed. These dudes were all pretty fit. So like, and I was fast, but I wasn't fast enough. They're all hit me and shit. And I'm like shaking my head. I can get it out so I can run. Yeah, bro. I had a fucking run. I wouldn't have got killed, dude. I was sore for about two weeks after that one. I'm sorry. Yeah. That's what it is. Hey, keep it real the day, man. Yeah. Hopefully, don't have it again. Next time I'll shoot y'all. All right, guys, those dudes tell this story from the other side. Dude, I remember this time. You saw these fucking assholes. We beat the ass so bad. The one guy should himself. And it is what it is, man. It's a real thing. It's real shit. It's real shit. Hashtag real shit. Hashtag real shit, man. Guys, it was our third and final headline. It's time for our final segment of the show, as always. We have Thumbs Up or Dumbest Fuck. That's where we bring our headline in. We talk about it. It'll get one of those two options. So with that being said, our Thumbs Up or Dumbest Fuck headline reads, does his own stunts, body cam shows, Florida Deputy jump onto Unman, runaway boat. It's pretty fucking cool. Florida Deputy is receiving praise for a, quote unquote, bad ass moment of heroism caught on tape as he jumped on a runaway boat traveling over 40 miles per hour after its driver fell off. On July 30th, Pinellas County Deputy Travis Fernandez, body's camera, captured his pursuit of a vessel cruising wantonly through Tampa Bay. Several miles east of St. Petersburg, Florida, according to the Miami Herald. With his colleague, Deputy Gillian Constant, maneuvering their own craft up to the side of the loose vehicle. According to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, the two officers answered a call from US Coast Guard trying to take control of the boat. Quote, the driver had fallen off and was rescued by a Ditz-Maritan, the sheriff's office wrote on social media. Coast Guard attempted to deploy prop fouling devices to stop the vessel, but they weren't successful. According to the sheriff's office, the boat was going about 41 miles per hour on the curved path and Deputy Constant matched its speed. On the tape, Deputy Fernandez is her telling her, quote, you got it, I don't care about getting wet, you got it before she pulled up to the runaway boat. Here's the video. It's pretty bad ass. Well, I feel like it looked pretty easy. What's bad ass is he just kept going. I'll play us off the horse. How did they black out a watch? That's plenty of skills. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool, yeah. So pretty seamlessly. I tried to get the version of Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. They posted that to the social media, but they had some bad ass, fucking Miami Vice music going on. I couldn't fucking pull it though, because of college. You just catch the video of that brawl with all the commentary over it. Well, the dudes are doing it. I tried to find that. I couldn't find the fucking original. It's so fucking good. Yeah. It's so good. That's thumbs up though. I mean, that's definitely, I mean, I would like to think that I would do that, but it looked pretty easy. But dude, I guarantee you, in the moment, 41 miles an hour out of the open, no restraints or water. That's, I mean, remember, like, I think I've been like, 40 on the water, like 40 on the street. Yeah. You know, it's a lot faster. I mean, I wouldn't, again, I don't do both. Yeah. You really don't? I mean, listen, I just don't feel like there's a good historical, no precedence here. You know, so I just shot it, you know, like a lame lesson. I'm gonna take it or leave it with boats. Yeah. I don't like cruises. I would definitely never go on a cruise. No, it's not happened. I don't understand why so many people like you. I'd be fucking trapped on that fucker. Whoever? I don't even know who the fuck's there. And, bro, listen, like we all know, there's weird people that do cruises. Like, I kind of feel that way too, dude. Like, that's like you, you motherfuck, you didn't. I feel like it's like it's own class of citizen that does cruises. No doubt, bro. And like, they're fucking frequent, what, I mean, there's frequent fires. It's like you either love it or you don't do it. Yeah, yeah. So I, I never do a cruise now. Like, bro, we go get, you know, we get a big fucking yacht. That's might be a little different, but I'm, I'm not gonna get that. That's absolutely different. Just the idea of being trapped on a large boat with 3000 people, with 3000 other people that are looking to book the cheapest fucking vacation in the town that has the best buffet. Like, it sounds like old town Vegas on the water. And it's, it sounds horrible. Yeah. Like, it sounds fucking horrible. I'm sorry if you go on cruises, but I'm not going. There's no fresh water either. Like, it's like, it's no different like air. It's just, it's just not appealing. No. I like to be alone, dude. Yeah. Like, I don't want to, I don't know. It's just not for me, man. No offense, but offense. Yeah. They've got one. They for me. Now, now, dude, like a yacht or like, like one of those like high end cruises where there's like 10 fucking people on it, but it's a big fucking boat, like maybe, maybe, but I'd have to know the other 10. I got to pick them. Dude, they'd have to be people like a tolerate. Yeah. That's just that, that crowd open, like, the whole thing, like, dude, it really honestly, like it makes my skin fucking calm. I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. Yeah. No, and I brought, I've seen Titanic too much. So it's like, that's another thing that doesn't make sense. Like you, you've seen, you've been with me when we've been seen these cruise ships. Like, they're fucking massive. Huge. And I just look at him and I'm like, this, this looks top heavy. This doesn't look safe. I don't know. Yeah. Like boats lower to the water make more sense to me. Like not a skyscraper tall. Yeah. Like eight football. Does that make sense? No, it doesn't look right. No. It also doesn't make sense to me how an airplane that's a size of like four greyhound buses goes 40,000 feet in the air. Yeah. Like, yeah. Well, we're about to fucking bankrupt the cruise industry. I don't think so, because I don't think those people give a shit. Yeah, that's what they do. They love the cruises. They love the cruises. I love it, man. We got thumbs up for this video. Andy. Yeah. That's all I got. All right, guys. That's the show. Don't be a hoe. Show the show. We're from sleeping on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck up, bro. Fuck up, stole. Counting millions in a coke. Bad bitch. Booted slow. Got a own bank road. Cankful. Doesn't know. Hit shot. Case closed. Close.
