know I was looking through some of the some of the stuff to bring up man I saw this I was just like man this is this is where America needs to be there's a lot of interesting stuff you guys know we had the Grammys this past weekend a lot of stuff happened there but I found this gym and I just think this is awesome this tell me it's Tracy Chapman's Grammy moment of pure Americanism just see this no you know the song fast car yeah it's a great fucking song amazing song and so she did a duet with with Luke Holmes and it's just fucking awesome this Bible article reads using only her art the legendary Tracy Chapman took to the Grammy stage Sunday night and made the most American of statements the story behind Chapman's iconic Grammy winning hit fast car dates back 36 years to 1988 it was first released she was only 23 then but in the synthesized saxophone 80s fast car was something all on its own according to the legend many years after it was first released 1988 fast car was the first song 33 year old country superstar Luke Holmes fell in love with as a kid fast forward another dozen or so years and Holmes cover turned fast car into a platinum selling mega hit all over again Chapman's timeless and poetic plea then went on to win the 2023 country music award for song of the year an award that went to Chapman his respect for Chapman her song is so complete that Holmes didn't change a word not even a lyric quote and I work in a market as a checkout girl you kept in now there's been drawn some hate right com to do in this cover of Chapman's I'm not gonna focus on that but just a couple of dumb shit you know what what what could possibly be hated what what is this cultural appropriation yeah fuck yeah and they're saying that these people are fucking relentless it's anything man dude it's I'm so dude are we not done with this yet we are as a society can we be done with this shit like holy shit then they're gonna try though that's the thing they're gonna have a white girl singing a song boy a black woman that's fucking okay well let's just hate each other's culture fuck everybody fuck you fuck you we won't see each other shit we won't buy your shit we won't listen to your shit and everybody suck a dick how about that like dude this is ridiculous these people are insane they belong in mental institutions real this what by myself I mean this is not you know the article to you says this is not a debate that takes place in a healthy society the ignorance and blatant racism is beyond the beyond what's especially going is that those complaining are the ones pretending the success of com's cover song had nothing to do with the black career woman believe me I could go on but I don't have to because during sundays night otherwise obnoxious hateful and pure lay Grammy Awards Tracy Chapman said everything that needed to be said after being out of the spotlight for years she returned for only a few minutes to respond to all of this ugliness and the most effective gracious and American way imaginable here's the clip he was up and in your car he's about to tell our cow is gone yeah that's the heaven's home I'm still not stop around my story I got and a feeling that I belong I got and a feeling I could be someone be someone it's fucking great bro that's fucking awesome that's great bro she looks great she looks well what you know they say like on crack like don't crash right she does look great she looks amazing she's 59 I think bro that that's super cool yeah I just thought it was awesome dude like I said I mean that that's that's what we need right now yeah how yeah she's 59 years old right now looks I mean we throw all these dumb fucks in the fucking woodshipper dude I'm so sick of their bullshit everything's racist every bro and it comes from white people it comes from white people it doesn't even come from black people fuck yeah I think it's awesome yeah bro it's super racist a white guy's honoring a black woman song and it's and he does a great job and makes it a mega there's a change a lyrics he makes you go make a platinum and and fucking brings her back into relevancy because he hates black people right shut the fuck up yeah I just don't fuck it's it's bro dude I think that's awesome yeah yeah shut up the loop comes and trace see Taylor Swift had to be the only one stand fucking stand bro she's so tired of her name being ahead lines look dude I've never had a strong opinion against Taylor Swift ever I've always appreciated her work appreciated what she's done you crushed it huh you a swifty I wouldn't say that I mean sound that sounds good dude I can respect someone's I don't know any of her songs I don't know any of her songs so if I play one so you you gonna start singing along I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know bullshit motherfucker I know okay who's more likely to know a Taylor Swift song who's more likely 100% DJ who's more likely Keith DJ Joe who's more likely that's right that's right you know I have to fucking say anything let's not talk shit you talk shit around here you get hit I don't like I don't like Taylor listen I'm just saying you can't not respect what she's done in terms of her fucking career it's amazing sure okay but it is getting a little bit overboard with like her the amount of attention like you've heard this thing about her being a side up yeah okay it's hard to watch yeah how much press she gets over nothing over nothing just over having a boyfriend the place for the chiefs okay who happens to be sponsored by Pfizer all right it makes more money from Pfizer than he does from his playing contract allegedly that's what I heard I don't know if it's true or not I don't but I heard that it's hot it's hard knowing how corrupt the media is and how much attention they're putting on her to not believe that a little bit you know what I'm saying like it's it feels like how they did with the rock in 2020 very like well how they they they make them it they they they make them into a superstar yeah and an extraordinary with an extraordinary a level of coverage and then they have them endorse whoever right it seems that that is the play that potentially could roll out yeah very inorganic I would be surprised if Taylor Swift doesn't at some point in time make some like big statement saying that she she endorses Joe Biden or whoever's running on the Democrat ticket corne pop yeah and it's interesting because if you go back in time and watch some of her videos where she talks about how her masters were bought by a company that was affiliated with George Soros did you ever see that video yeah so and she seemed to be upset about it so it's it dude I'm just saying the amount of screen time alone is starting to become suspicious because it's just like Taylor Swift overload dude anything well I know she's like the one of the probably top five most famous people on the planet I mean I understand she gets a lot of attention but like it's even it's like five times more than normal you know what I'm saying just don't feel right maybe like a new don't know shop yeah maybe maybe maybe it's maybe it's all bullshit yeah maybe it's coincidence I don't know maybe it's maybe it's maybe it's just nonsense who knows but I know this I wouldn't be surprised if some sort of big ordeal comes out towards the election that tries to get her voter base to like go vote for the Democrats yeah which are probably ruined their fucking career I don't know I don't know man I mean I think they've identified her as the leading influence for Gen Z yeah especially Gen Z girls and I think they've I think that's accurate I think she is the leading influence for Gen Z girls and I think this is influencer marketing like if you want to reach this certain demographic you're gonna go after and make this person this certain person say your message and who knows how they do that but I'm just saying would you be surprised no does it feel weird the amount of attention she's getting it's feeling like it's coming yeah and like I don't like I've never dislike Taylor I don't even dislike her now like I really know I just it's just odd yeah it's it's and it's noticeable so I don't see you guys tell us what you guys think down in the comments let us know but let's get into our cruise I think it's odd that she's getting all this attention and then the dude she's dating is wrapping the vaccine yeah that's fucking odd man you know I'm saying I think he's gonna propose to her yeah almost 50-year-old line at the Super Bowl bro I listen I think we should get rid of the internet I think the internet I think the internet is fucking bad yeah for everybody I read this stat over the weekend 50% of internet traffic is bots what yeah 50% what does that mean though that means that 50% of the accounts on social media 50% half platforms YouTube Instagram Facebook yeah I don't believe it was talking about TikTok but YouTube it was it was Google in better 50% according to this report that I I can't now I don't remember where to fuck I read I read a lot of shit but 50% bots that's wild yeah so so dude think about that in terms of like what the the what was that thing the Twitter files when it came out and show that Twitter had its own bot network that it used to prop up certain people celebrities messaging and then censored the other side bro think about that in in terms of what the social narrative really is these social media companies are not just this isn't just social media between us the people this is narrative crafting using fake accounts and fake traffic to make people believe that's people are in a certain place when they are not in a certain place I got it here yeah it was a study done by Baracuda Baracuda report reveals 50% of all internet traffic is bot driven with about 30% being bad bots which would be you know driving the narratives the negative the propaganda stuff so 30% of the of the internet traffic is intentional bot traffic to prop up a narrative or suppress a narrative think about that like think about that what that means because dude most people are not the kind of people that can just stand on their own ideas right now most there's a reason that the biggest way to attract a crowd is with the crowd because people join the crowd this is why mob mentality is mob mentality when people see that social proof that a certain amount of people believe X then they just adopt X as a thing they believe and that's this is dude I believe we're living through one of the craziest fakest bullshit times in human history where people are completely manipulated society is completely manipulated like they're saying this is down bro like they're saying is down from like in 2021 it reached up to almost 40% yeah well that's because Twitter got taken over and they washed all that shit out like this and that's crazy yeah but what I'm saying is dude like really think about this how easy would it be to get people to believe certain things were true and certain things were not true if you were able to digitally look at them and say look at this everybody believes this you're the only one that doesn't believe it that's what they're doing yeah they're fucking with our hierarchy of needs bro since the belonging to an innate human creating false perceptions so that people join in shit that doesn't make any sense yeah like bro it makes no sense like zero sense zero sense if you said this 15 years ago that you were going to give a child puberty blockers people would put you in jail 15 years ago now because they've used this technology to believe so many people are okay with it there are people actually doing this to their kids that's insane man they're getting punished for not like let's let's back up here let's just back up we're not in 2024 we're now in 2005 okay and let's think about what the response would have been to grown men shaking their dicks at little kids schools dressed up as women let's think what the response would have been of grown men competing in women's sports let's think what the response would have been to Leah Thomas winning an NCAA championship in 2005 there were been just like unbelievable amounts of backlash okay how do we get here well we got here because over the course of the last 15 years they have manipulated us via this fake bot traffic and social media to move people from common sense to insanity it is insane to allow a minor to somehow inject hormones in their body that are not consistent with their actual sex that is insane do you know what that does to someone's brain do you know what it does to a man's brain to just inject massive amounts of estrogen in their body and makes them insane okay and vice versa like this this is insane shit like I I cannot be the only person that but like that is still set in reality you know that this is insane like say out say it out loud what these people are doing these people are having their children mutilate their bodies that irreparably like children people under the age of 18 are doing this this is insane man and like dude if you don't speak out against it you know all those people that say like oh dude I would have stood up for the Jews and world war two no you fucking wouldn't you're a coward for real this is one of those situations where the right thing is very clearly the right thing and people are ignoring it because they don't want to face the social backlash of their manipulated absurd friends it's absurd I'm sorry and I'm not going to back off of that now these are children dude these are kids they're not full grown adults do you let a kid get attacked too nope do you let a kid drink do you let a kid join the military do you let a kid do any of the shit like you see what I'm saying we have no more parameters but we can elect to allow them to make literal decisions about their development as a human being when they're eight years old a puberty blockers bro that's fucking insane those parents are fucking insane that is child abuse and if you don't speak out against it bro you're you think you would have stood up for the right thing and all these situations through history no you wouldn't you would have been wrote you would have shut the fuck up you're a coward because we all know deep down inside it's wrong all of us we all know it and we're saying nothing some people are saying stuff but not enough yeah what should man guys let's get into our headlines remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links I had to get refreshed after that monologue I don't blame you that artful vocabulary that I just laid out I don't blame you you switched it on the waters there too and I had I had to I had to get one of these amazing first form screaming freedom look at the hand energy drinks it's all about the hand placement it's right I need you to add a little ding in here okay like ding ding right here all right let's get let's do it this time all right all right by my shit all right on with the show and that wasn't an ad by the way I didn't even get paid for it yeah they can pay for it yeah I should make those motherfuckers pay me anyway guys let's get it too we got to headline number one oh yeah we did get some new waters there you do got new ones we do we got a royale a f water normally it's real a f but is royale a f because I got tired of the peasant water yeah so we had to spice it up and luxury real a f h 2 l ingredients water distributed by real a f warning drinking might make you a common sense realist oh that's dope yeah I just got this shit motherfuckers I got I got really off with Andy Frasala sweat yeah that's included it's good it's good it's good for electrolyte this stuff a little salty yeah but you feel stronger and sexier you know it smells like a musk no it's like what's it like hot dog water hot dog water yeah hot dog water it's about like on season chicken okay good enough of it though man it's good stuff guys just give it a headline number what But this is a big conversation that's happened speaking a lot of bringing up a lot of discussion around the interwebs headline number one reads Republicans at war over $118 billion border bill Mitch McConnell faces fury over new law that would shut down border if crossings reach $5,000 a day and ends catching release as GOP colleagues say it's even worse than expected. Why I don't okay, I don't know why they have so so long headlines like it's such as long headline is it like a British thing? I don't know but um fuck me yeah yeah well let's let's let's not into this so so House Speaker Mike Johnson has joined other Republicans who have already deemed the bipartisan Senate border deal dead on arrival and dubbed the proposal quote worse than expected three chief negotiators for the border security package senator James Langford uh Kristen cinema and Chris Murphy unveiled the text of the sprawling deal on Sunday but Republican infighting is likely to tank the compromise a Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer plans to bring the first procedural vote to the floor on Wednesday knives are out for a Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell who is facing much of the fury from Republicans opposing the bill after he insisted last year that border policy changes be included in the funding package for imbattled countries um senator Mike Lee out of Utah said the Republican Party quote needs new leadership now quote this feels like an elaborate practical joke but it's not funny not one bit Lee posted to ex-farmly twitter I cannot understand how any Republican would think this was a good idea or anything other than an unmitigated disaster now what's the real issue inside this bill like so we covered this last week and and here's here here are the numbers this one hundred and eighteen billion dollar deal backed by the White House includes fourteen billion dollars in aid to Israel sixty billion dollars to Ukraine and also twenty billion dollars for securing the southern border amid a massive increase in illegal migration it also includes billions for critical partnerships in the end of Pacific including Taiwan um senator twitter you said quote any Republican voting for the Senate America last open border amnesty bill must be paid off by foreign interest and is acting as a foreign agent representative major Taylor green posted to ex-what an embarrassment shame on them uh former freedom caucus chairman scot parry called the deal a dumpster fire we got senator jadey vans from Ohio posted quote the the house is impeaching my orcs next week while the Senate will be voting to give him massive discretion to not enforce the border why would any Republican vote for this um so the bill would mandate that the money yeah yeah very clear yeah very clear because that shit's coming right back to him um the bill would mandate the border be shut down if there are five thousand encounters over the course of a week or eighty five hundred migrants encountered in the single day but many Republicans don't think this goes far enough um and House Republican leadership made it clear over the weekend that the package doesn't have backing in the lower chamber um now that's the one thing that's going on but what about the migrants that are already here what bills are being passed about them did you see this new york city launches fifty three million dollar program to hand out prepaid credit cards to migrant families taxpayer dollars going to people who are not tax paying citizens we're not citizens at all right in New York anyway what do we got on all of this so there's a lot I feel like it because here's something like there's a lot of legislation that's about to get passed through we talked about and we got a really important one coming up in the next headline um but a lot of this stuff is happening you got people like Adam too you know so oh no we don't want them to send them away and now you're doing stuff like this it's just like you got nine thousand dollars being handed out in in Chicago for illegal immigrants nine thousand nine thousand dollars per per migrant that's insane let's let's let's work back for this okay go back to that first little slide where it talks about um let's see all right a hundred and eighteen billion dollar deal back by the warehouse that's your money by the way our money okay yours and mine fourteen billion to Israel israel's one of the wealthiest countries in the world okay per GDP they're doing pretty good yeah um but we're going to send fourteen billion dollars to them for what reason I don't know other than a whole bunch of our government is dual citizens with israel okay so that's why all right let's be real clear it's I don't give a fuck what you say about it we shouldn't have anybody in the government to dual citizen with fucking any country not israel not Germany not Italy not fucking anyone nobody it's bullshit all right that needs to be fixed those people need to be fucking get out they need to be taken out of the government so fourteen billion in aid to a country doesn't fucking need it okay the constantly gets us wrapped up in shit all right sixty billion in your crane to you crane sixty billion dollars of our money to you crane for what they've already lost their men are dead they have killed tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of men there they're gone there's no winning that war it's impossible to win and that's what I think what we're going to find out because Tucker Carlson was apparently just interviewing Putin all right so we're going to find out what Putin has to say and just like I've told you for years they don't show his shit here in the United States what harm if Putin was the person they say he is wouldn't it just reinforce the fact that he's a maniac tyrant if they just let his messages be played here why did they censor it so much if that's what he actually is okay so we're going to find out what Putin has to say apparently and I bet they're going to try to delete that shit off the internet as much as possible including kicking Tucker off the internet so we'll see what it has to say then we have so we have sixty billion dollars going over there and then they're going to take twenty billion and secure the border so our money only twenty billion of the one hundred and eighteen billion actually goes towards the problem that the bill is intended to solve do you get what's going on yet do you understand they're stealing this money from us right in front of our faces and do not give a shit okay now let's think about this they're saying skip to the next slide they're saying next one the bill would mandate that the border be shut if there are five thousand encounters over the course of a week or eighty five hundred migrants encounter in a single day how about zero how about zero motherfuckers allowed over here they aren't supposed to be here how about that how about we allow zero migrants through the border of the United States of America for any reason shape form for anything how about that that's the law how about we take a hundred and eighteen billion dollars and put it all on the border and fix this problem so that we have zero and the reason that they're wanting to allow five thousand or eighty five hundred a day is because they're trying to naturalize those people into American citizenship and they understand the common sense Americans pure nationalist Americans nationalist is not a bad word by the way people who believe in America and our patriots of America want America to belong to Americans there's nothing wrong with that okay these people want to change that and they want to change the the actual culture identity of this country to their liking so that these people will vote for them and because we don't want those people here those migrants want to be here so which way are they going to vote so they bring them in they they they give them amnesty they allow them to vote and it changes the entire demographic that's clearly what they're doing Elon had a tweet about this over the weekend we've been talking about this the replacement theory for years and we got called racist and bigots and liars and misinformation and the truth is that's exactly what's going on and the people calling us those names they want the democrats to have permanent power too which is why they try to call you those names when you point this out so it's clearly what's happening so there's a number of problems here none of that money should go to Israel not a single dollar none of it should go to Ukraine not a single dollar all of it should be put on the border and not a single motherfucker should be allowed across that border ever again and on top of that we should figure out how to get rid of all the how are we going to get rid of 10 to 20 million people because it depends on who you ask bro if you ask Tucker Carlson they say 22 million people are here other people the actual media number is 10 now has the media given us any accurate numbers over the last number of years okay so let's say there's 22 million people that are here that have come here in the last three or four years that are not supposed to be here how would we even logistically deport them how would you do it yeah how would you do it the police can't do it there's not enough of them no military can't do it no the citizens would have to get involved in doing it bro for real and that's where we get into the conversation of an actual conflict on our on our soil yeah this is a problem dude and you saw did you see the video of them beating up that cop in New York yeah I saw that did you see how they got and they they got off scot free basically got walking out of court row yeah walking out of fucking cameras and shit fuck these people bro there's a difference between asylum seekers people escaping oppression and military age people coming here and signing up for the benefits you know there's a difference between families who are escaping places that are god awful coming here to America and going through the process of becoming a citizen like our Bosnian community here you know we have the biggest Bosnian community in the United States here in St. Louis those people came here the right way to escape what was happening in the country was a fucking literal genocide well that's the thing man and people got to take this back if we go back to 2020 right and when they started this whole defund the police that was the whole point the whole the whole point for all of this the the the George Shore prosecutors was to prepare Americans for this time right now because the shit that these illegal invaders are doing that is the norm in their countries that is how they operate there's not a problem to be fucking kick cops from the down that's normal what they have been doing has been desensitizing Americans to prepare themselves for this type of crime and day-to-day life where this stuff is being normal here they've been preparing us for that that's all that's what all that stuff was about released in the criminals not to prosecute them making laws making laws in New York where if you if you discharge your weapon you could be personally liable and go to jail you know why those cops didn't shoot those motherfuckers because if they shot those motherfuckers they'd be just like Daniel Penny right now they'd be charged and they'd be in jail yeah and then you got Eric Adams at the police station today saying we're going out anybody who he's dressed in a police uniform did you see it with a 700 dollar scarf did you see that mm-hmm he's dressed in a police body armor with says police Eric Adams who fucking hates the police shows up there dude they hate you bro like you're making these these New York these New York police officers incapable of doing their job you're ruining their careers you're ruining their lives works and you have the nerve to show up at the police station and put on some fucking body armor for some PR stunt and says police on it bro and then say let's go get these people dude they can't do their jobs because of the stuff that you pass that you champion all right but my point what I was saying before is I'm okay with people coming here our country was always meant to be a melting pot of cultures all right but we're talking about people coming here who are real refugees who are really being oppressed these people are not being oppressed bro they are coming here for the free upgrade over their life wherever the fuck they're from those people should be in their countries taking care of their business handling what's going on in their countries and make their situation better not coming here on our dollars or our backs and somehow you know causing this shit this is insane man and this is totally planned out they don't want to stop like we have to understand they do not want to stop this they don't want to stop it yeah dude I just wonder how the average American feels about their money just getting stretched so thin to where they can't make ends meet and then to watch their tax dollars just float away into thin air to Israel and Ukraine over and over and over and over effortlessly and you're just you guys are sitting here fucking dying you know what I'm saying like what are we doing why are we not all in this why is that everybody engaged in this why is that everybody speaking up and standing up and calling this what it is yeah guys jump down on the go ahead we stopped it we stopped this shit two three four years ago we wouldn't be here you guys wouldn't listen though nobody would listen I was just some crazy unhinged conspiracy theorists and now here we are and I'm going to tell you this the same crazy unhinged conspiracy theorists that told you everything that's going to happen the last fucking four years is telling you we're going to sink the fucking ship if y'all don't get involved guys jump down to the comments let us know what you guys think that being said let's head over to them let's go cruise them we gotta cruise the comments this this comment comes from at Joshua leading 4228 he says a live pack podcast would be awesome do a tour of the US throughout this year state by state it's one thing to watch this online and share the show but to actually sit down and talk in person maybe even a Q&A at the end of the show would unite the people

get back to the cruise the headline number two now this is probably the biggest topic of the day is starting to really really make some traction and I want to break it down I want to talk about it let's dive into it I was not necessarily a headline but if you guys go to congress.gov and you guys can search this for yourselves okay it's going to be s.3589 preventing private paramilitary activity act of 2024 now this is a bill that just got introduced to the Senate on January 16th of this year and it is sponsored by Senator Edward Markey Ed Markey this guy who is a senator from Massachusetts looks like a fucking corpse and you know some of the big things that we've gotten from Ed Markey you guys probably haven't heard his name before or seen him much much much less than that but there's a few things we can think you know he's been a very big advocate of taking down big oil green new deal a huge advocate of trans rights trans health equity Twitter spaces he's done and a very big advocate for protecting refugee rights so basically all the bullshit this guy's been one of the you know you got the you got the guys are on the stage you got the guys behind the scene behind the stage this is one of these guys I mean it's also responsible for pushing in a bill called the grace act that would set an annual refugee admission amount at 125,000 at minimum and then you know some some awesome things so he comes out he introduced xenophobic pop fuck you man I'm so tired of this shit xenophobic because we don't want fucking criminals coming over here and raping our women and beating the shit out of our cops and getting off with no bail or is it if that xenophobia then I'm fucking xenophobic say holy shit we got identities now yeah well all the other phobias that we are and the is we are let's just add that one in there now I'm just trans folk because I don't like bicks I'm your trans folk because you don't want to fuck a trans woman I'm just not gay yeah but yeah so we got everything so so let's dive into this man because this is actually I saw this and it really scared me because there's a lot like the language that is in this bill that's being proposed now mind you this is not an official bill it's not official law you guys can see the little tracker there says introduced but it is out there and and so so let's dive to it so so bill s dot 3589 and this is what's called a single rick written by a mentally ill whack job senator marki yeah I mean but but whack job or not the the implications of this are real so let's dive to it it always starts off with some definitions you know some cool things there and then defines a private paramilitary organization it says the term private paramilitary organization means any group of three or more persons associating under a command structure for the purpose of functioning in public or training to function in public as a combat combat support law enforcement or security services unit okay well we'll just we'll just make a bunch of groups too of two that's it that's it yeah like fuck um but yeah so unauthorized private paramilitary I love how these people think that we're that you're going to legislate us into like you're insane bro like we're way past the point of taking the shit oh well me dude like that's the thing the language of this bill it would it it eliminates companies like pdg or any private it eliminates local jujitsu class exactly exactly um but yeah so it should be unlawful to knowingly in a circumstance described in subsection b while acting as part of or on behalf of a private paramilitary organization and armed with a firearm explosive or incendiary device or other dangerous weapons to publicly patrol drill or engage in techniques capable of causing bodily injury or death it's uh legal to interfere with interrupt or attempt to interfere with or interrupt government operations or government proceeding interfere with or intimidate another person in that person's exercise of any right under the constitution of the United States you mean like you're doing with this bill on uh the second amendment with this bill yeah you mean like exactly what you're doing here right anybody the challenges that yeah bro this government we they are way out of line way out of line man the way out of line like that's the thing like your point number two interfere with interrupt you know uh government operations or a government proceeding it's in our constitution to do it it's in the constitution for these people are fucking insane yeah man now let's let's look at the penalties here um let's look at the penalties like what what what happens if somebody does this right this bill becomes law what's the penalty um any person who violates subsection a shall be fined under this title in prison for not more than a year or both except that in the case of a violation that does not result in bodily imagery um and is committed by a person who is not prior to the commission of the violation uh been convicted of violating a federal or state law the person may be sentenced to probation now in the case that the violation that occurs after a prior conviction under this section has become final the person shall be fined under this title in prison for not more than two years now in the case that the violation results in damage the property the person in this out uh under this title in prison for not more than two years or both and in the case of a violation that results in bodily injury the person shall be fined under this title in prison for not more than five years or both or death the person shall be fined under this uh title in prison for any terms of years or for life so some heavy penalties there and the the the craziest thing is that not only if you get convicted of any of these whether you kill somebody or just damage the property um you lose all of yours that's under the forfeit your clause um any person that violates subsection that you'll be forfeiting all of your property any property personal or real involved in used or intended to be used in any manner that all goes to to uncle Sam so if you get caught doing this they could take all of your personal property right all of it your house your cars isn't this the reason this is the exact reason that this we founded this country was because of people like this yeah 100 percent bro look at this fucking corpse look at this guy he's a fucking week away from being dead he's probably 200 years old too because he's sucking kids dicks and shit he's fucking douchebag look at this guy look at this fucking guy bro look at this guy he's protecting the crown man bro these people are way out of control dude people better wake up man i've been seeing a lot of people talking about like all of our guys that we know like people better wake the fuck up to what's going on Greg Anderson leave Robin like i mean do this is some real this is listen it's again it's just introduced but why would they be putting something like this out Andy like what would be there's two reasons one they either intended follow through or two they're intended to instigate people into like legit violence because this will cause it this will cause it man yeah pass this law and see what happens bro because no police no local police gonna enforce this and they get fuck brother police will get fuck a shot of the face you know what i'm saying no one's gonna do that the police don't even dude look man yeah the bottom line is this the armed forces in the military have to draw a line in the sand our government is completely fucking corrupt we need resistance from the the people who have taken oath to protect the people of this country to start resisting what's going on with these crazy old fucks we're clearly in the midst of a communist revolution it's impossible to deny at this point in time all right every single action that these people have been taking for the last five years four years has been to destabilize the United States all right we go through the list of shit the ridiculous allowing of crime in all the cities okay the release of these criminals during COVID the the migration crisis the devaluation of the dollar through inflation the the depleting of our strategic oil supply you crane war the Israel conflict like everything we're doing is designed the woke shit to like the like the social narratives the social narratives that are being created based around making people weak and dependent and stupid and now helpless okay against the everything they do is against our interests as citizens at some point in time the people who have taken an oath to stand for the protection of the citizens of this country need to start fulfilling that oath and that goes for the police that goes for the military that goes for the three letter agencies the ones that aren't in on it like this is a huge problem and these people are criminals these are the exact people that were talked about in the declaration of independence in our constitution these are the exact people that they were we were warned about these are them and we are the people that are tasked to fix what's going on at some point in time we're going to have to accept reality that's the truth now what do we do about it i'm not sure because the people who are supposed to be to fail safe don't seem to be fail-safing you know what i'm saying like you know it's bad when you have members of our government trying to introduce bills with this type of language it's insane bro it's insane how far is too far how tyrant is there going to tyrant dude this is the most tyrant shit that i've seen out of all the shit that we've seen that old bag of shit that we call our president standing in front of a red wall that's nothing in the terms of tyrant compared to what this is who the fuck gives these people the right to do this shit you know what i'm saying bro it's insane man they're trying to remove the resistance the people who would actually stand up to them they they can't outlaw the guns so they'll just make you know organizing with your friends with guns illegal it's fucking insane bro people don't understand what's going on you know what bothers me the most brother is people people who think people who think this is just normal ebbs and flows of politics like this is oh this is just normal no it's not normal there's nothing normal about this the man who's supposed to be the commander in chief of our country has taken money from other government governments is making decisions based upon their interests not ours a whole bunch of our people in government are dual citizens with other countries and are making decisions in their interests and not ours we have ilean Omar who is legitimate on tv saying that her interests lie with samalia not the united states and as a arab before anything else she doesn't even mention being an american or representing ameri these people should not be allowed in our government at all you should have to be a dedicated american citizen to serve in our government like 100% none of these duals shit none of you were imported from somewhere else that's bullshit oh that makes you that makes you a big it whenever the fuck it makes me that's what i am i don't give a shit no man guys jumping on this conversation let's know down in the comments what you guys think on this disgusting old bag of shit yeah well we'll definitely look at him dude like dude this dude looks like a fucking i've seen people in a casket that look better than this guy he looks like a Rothschild he look dude he does look like one of them guys like a Carnegie you know what i'm saying like he looks like that look to him he's got that look man well this is the old this is what i'm saying dude these are the people look at this guy like look at his face this is the person and these are the people making our lives hard think about that think about your old grandpa and christmas that is three quarters of the way kuku these are the people making our lives incredibly difficult like think about that all these young healthy men all these patriotic men all these able body men all over the country we're subservient to these pieces of shit no way dude no way they're time their time their time needs to come yeah guys let's get to our third and final headline headline number three we got little hero trophy we got to give out oh really yeah headline number three headline number three reads officials text imposed as minor to lura sex offender before federally shooting him hey i like that it is it some good news it's great you don't see nothing good on the news no more yeah well i saw a video online i follow a couple dudes that do this stuff on the internet i can't think of the name of their account right now but dude i saw jay does j who was that their name yeah anyway bro they like go get these dudes and then one time they went and one of them got shot oh shit yeah by one of these guys yeah another one like they go around beating these dudes ass yeah i love it dude it's probably it's like one of my favorite accounts for sure but like there's this account who they literally go around and they bait these dudes into like agreeing to have sex with like little boys and little girls and shit and dude every time they like like it's like it really opens your eyes that first of all all the people to do this shit are like the same they're like the same kind of person they all look the same they all kind of looked exactly and what's crazy it what it really does dude is it opens your eyes to how common this shit is like how rampant it is bro and it's it's interesting you know i've thinking about this i don't know if i mentioned this on the show but did you see the Taylor Swift AI thing where they there was like a bunch of nudes AI or something right bro and that became like a massive story okay and it got me thinking like are they pushing that story now this might be a little tinfoil but dude i don't know man these people you know i i i thought this through a little bit if you if you knew that there was all kinds of evidence of you and your friends doing fucked up shit with children that was gonna come out wouldn't it make sense to put out a story with the world's biggest celebrity with fake nudes and fake voices and things like this so that when the evidence actually came to the surface you could say well dude that's just AI that's fake that's not real hmm i didn't see anybody say that and it's like that's what i that's my first thought when it came out with that story is like dude these people are all this is why they're hiding all this Epstein shit notice they haven't said shit about the Epstein shit since the beginning of January no and they're all they're all implicated potentially all right and if they're all implicated but if they're all allegedly allegedly implicated wouldn't it make sense for them to push this story and then so that they have like something to say whenever the stuff actually comes out yeah i just wonder how that's gonna work though man because like like i mean isn't it like a screener or something that like shows if a picture is AI or not bro bro bro but they can do anything now like the the voices yeah are they're almost exact you know what i'm saying like one of my buddies rob Bailey made a AI voice of it that's and he was just doing it with proof of point and i saw it he took it down but i saw it and it sounded exact and i know rob and Dana and person very well been friends for a long time but we saw it in a and it sounded exactly like her dude like if you know Dana like it's sounded exactly like her and so they can use this technology to make someone look anyway they want and sound anyway they want think about that yeah like how do we know now how do we know now what's true and what's not true how do we know if pictures come out of someone doing fucked up shit like the hunter Biden pictures that are floating around the internet how do we know how do we know yeah what's real i'm what to see what i'm saying and it seems like they're really pushing on this stuff to get it known and not doing anything about it so that there's some sort of defense mechanism where they can say oh that's fake that's AI you know when it comes out because dude what they've been trying to do i don't think anybody can argue is they've been trying to normalize it and normalizing it isn't working people are not buying that no one in this country of common sense is going to eventually buy into the idea that what they got over there in Europe where they're trying to argue for children's rights to decide to have consensual sex with adults okay we have members of spains government yeah arguing in public for children to be able to choose that they can consent to have sex with an older adult person okay and that shit isn't being that's not being culturally accepted so if that's not going to be culturally accepted here what's the next phase that they can move into oh they can move into saying oh it's AI it's just fake that's not my text that's not my picture that's not my voice it's bullshit and we have no way of really knowing yeah yeah man anyway please continue because i feel like i'm going to be happy with this yeah this is cool man so a man is accused of killing a convicted sex offender in Houston, Texas have to be allegedly posed as a minor to lower the victim court documents officials have charged 22 year old James Lewis Spencer with murder after the incident that occurred on May 29th 2023 kho reported Friday in an update Thursday the Houston police department identified the victim as 37-year-old Sean Connery showers an image of the suspect in the case is this young man here he's the killer yeah okay after Spencer's arrest on Wednesday a Harris County judge said it's bond at $250,000 the kho report continued quote according to court records Spencer told a witness he knew how to track sex offenders via an app on his phone and that he wanted to rob and hurt them he later reportedly told that witness that if the police weren't going to do anything he'd take matters into his own hands you know Thursday's probable cause uh court hearing judge said that cell phone records showed that Spencer and the victim had been in contact court records indicate Spencer posed as a minor and discussed the victim's sexual history with minors before agreeing to meet up with him now according to police someone reported an unresponsive man lying in a ditch at 900 northwood street the man who was later identified as showers was pronounced dead after suffering several gunshot wounds quote an initial investigation determined showers was walking along the roadway when a vehicle of unknown making model approached him someone inside the vehicle then shot showers at that time there was no known suspect description the agency said quote further investigation identified Spencer as a suspect in the case now by conditions for the suspect include 24 hour house arrest a GPS monitor and he is forbidden to access firearms ammunition or weapons the kho u article noted in March a Minnesota man was fatally accused of fatally beating and elderly sex offender to death with a shovel and moose antler according to bribe bar news yeah um i say hometown hero by the way that the man that he met up with had multiple prior convictions of listen there's no hearing these people can't cure it bro these people these people are mentally fucked okay and we could say whatever reason we could say their parents didn't hug them enough or they were molested or they got into porn and got into weird shit who knows but these people are predators and they're fucked up and there has to be accountability for them and the the the government isn't really do it they're trying to make it to mission the the media and social narrative is to normalize this shit yeah so it's only a matter of time before people start taking this into their own hands because this is unacceptable in a civilized society yeah so i'm not surprised to hear it by any way shape or form uh you know this unfortunately this this guy is probably gonna go to prison and probably you know spend a large significant part of his life in prison which i don't believe is okay if i was president bro he's getting part yeah no shit me too immediately yeah i'm pardoning that dude out in california that keeps killing the sex offenders too yeah i'm gonna turn him loose i'm gonna make him the fucking pitos arc bro he could be the host of the big that's right he could be the commentary guy yeah yeah no guys you're doing it wrong feet first yes this is listen listen man the people are in denial about what's going on yeah that's the problem they're in denial they're looking around they're saying dude this can't be that like I have people who are friends of mine who are democrats who are like dude you're you're blowing this way out of proportion yeah yeah Biden's a criminal yes but so is Trump you know like dude it's let's stop this shit look at society man look at what's happening this isn't i'm a democrat or i'm a republican this is the degradation and reduction of a civilized society into a literal Sodom and Gamora Vimar Republic from 1930s Germany this is this is terrible disgusting non civilized society shit that needs to somehow come to an end and it it's only getting worse the internet's made it worse we have people like you know the meta like we talked about on the last cti which by the way all the cti's are getting fucking hammered on video like and censored and shit so please share those out but the point is you got Zuckerberg you know in the meta guys not handling this like every single person that clicks on one of these child porn images should automatically go on a list and automatically be dealt with they should automatically get a visit from the FBI and fucking track and looked into in their hard drive examine and fucking bro and put in jail if they if they are into this shit no we have to remove this element from society that's praying on our children we have to and parents need to stand the fuck up and speak up on it this is not just bullshit yeah guys that was what you guys think jump down in the comments let us know on this on this topic or we need to get a lot more vocal yeah like you guys listening you guys got to get a lot more vocal and it's not just sharing the show out it's being vocal it's having conversations it's getting involved it's standing for things it's going to your school board meetings or your executive meetings in your county and being vocal it's being engaged in vocal right now we are still at a point in time where we can solve this by using our voice but that window is closing and if people do not participate that window will close and it will be if you speak out you go to jail and there will be nothing that you can do and so the only thing that can be done past that point is violence which nobody wants nobody wants to pick up a gun and have to go fucking do this I mean some people do but even those people they're not prepared listen man nobody wants to do that we we we live in a civilized America this should be handled by our government with the tax dollars that we pay not sent to Ukraine or Israel or any other country this this is one of the things that should be handled here like bro if you go to Dubai and you go to the Middle East they make it they make the Middle East seem like to us like it's a bunch of you know Neanderthals and the fucking sand no dude they don't put up any of this shit oh they're brutal no shit to people who do shit like that no that's I want that bring that here please you see what I'm saying like stop this shit no crime like the people should be afraid to commit crimes like there should be legit fear if you fuck with a kid you know you're going into wood shipper it'll stop and if it doesn't stop we can start the big show you know what I'm saying like dude the big show we put him on the big show it's a naturally televised show you have to subscribe to it it's public executions of pedophiles on TV and it's pay-per-view you subscribe to it for 20 bucks every single time we steal Dana White's model we make it a little cheaper Dana could be on the board bro he could fucking help us organize it we we put these motherfuckers on TV we throw them in the wood shipper however much money that we get goes to the victims every single time here's John doe John doe molested 17 kids the thing makes 40 million dollars you take the 40 million dollars you divide it up by 17 you give it to him bro it's justice it helps the no big show baby it's a win-win-win 2028 vote for me for real bro it'd be the greatest thing ever I watch no shit I watch like where where where's this kind of leadership man this is what the people what guys this gets right final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck I think you really like this one Andy try down your who's this seven foot seven guy
