It's Monday when we're recording this. So let's get into some cruising. I found something though. I thought we would find interesting. You know, for some reason we've been running into like some lightsaber people. Right? Yeah. And the comments and shit. You know, and I found this video. And I have second thoughts now. Okay. Let's see it about these people. Let's check this out. Yeah. You have seconds. Oh, listen. Okay. That's pretty impressive. That's pretty impressive. Clearly. I mean, you got to be in great shape to do it apparently. I mean, it looks like you're kind of sport there, brother. That's pretty impressive, which part? I mean, like, I mean, it looked like you look like the movies a little bit. You know, I'm saying it. Yeah. Just a little bit. I've never seen the movie. So I imagine you see this video. I found this a couple of days ago. So how long do you how many practice such as? Yeah. You know, he's in his fucking yard doing some that shit. I'm just saying, would any of you be surprised you drove by DJ's house? You see him in the yard doing that. I mean, either. I'm just saying that it's impressive. All right. Okay. That's all I wanted to say. All right. No. So that's not impressive. Okay. Like, I see little kids do that shit. Impressive to who? And for what reason? What part is impressive? I'll tell you this. I can smell the room. I can smell it. It's not that man. I can smell it. Here's what it is. You can smell that room. It's yeah, but pepperoni juice. No, that's got a specific like wrestling room vibe. Like that looks like they're on like some sort of wrestling mats. Yeah. That's got a special. That's a big event, brother. They got some followers and shit. Well, look, dude, lightsaber playing is for children. Yeah. So I don't know. You know, they make a real one though. Like a real lightsaber. Like they made them. Who's they? People on people in the world really? It sounds like bullshit. No, no, it's real. There's some real like it's hurt. There's some real lightsabers out there. What? Yeah. Those guys got them right there. No, no, like they're like they're real. Look, I got a whole fucking thing about real or fake. Those real or fake. They're real if you could fucking touch them. That's true. So those are real. You know what I'm saying? That's a universal principle right? Right. Well, it doesn't come from lightsabers. That might be the real shit I've ever heard. Yeah. That's pretty. Yeah. I got told that one time. Stuck with me. It's good advice. Some real shit. Hit me deep. Oh, fuck, man. Yep. I just thought that was cool. I don't know. Okay. Well, that's why I'm the host and you're the co-host. That's it. Yeah. Okay. Let's do the show. Is this whole show going to be like this? Because I really do got other shit. No, no, no, it's good. It's good. We're fine. Okay. Man, we're good. See belt on. Maybe that's cruise. Guys, remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You guys can find them all linked there for you with that being said, let's get into our first set of headlines. Head on number one. This is a big talk. I mean, everybody's talking about it. We got to address it. World War three on the hands on a foot. Is real and I ran. They've been going back and forth at it. So let's just dive and see some of this. Let's see some more moggers. We'll bring some of them in the show. Let's talk about it. So fast facts. Israel launched Operation Rising Lion last week, destroying top military leaders and nuclear facilities in Iran. Iran's retaliatory air strikes targeting Israel have left at least 24 people dead. The IDF announced Monday that one third of Iran's missile launchers have been destroyed. This is entering day four, day five, when you guys are listening to it now that that has been going on. There's also been some talk allegedly. And again, like we've seen this happen before, right? Like, you know, there's a lot of propaganda that gets pushed out during these. So you don't really know what's real. What's not. We'll try to sift through some of that nonsense. But allegedly, Iran has executed a man convicted of spying for Israel's Mossad Intelligence Agency. One of Iran's semi official Fars News Agency reported. So we got a map here for those of you guys who don't know where these places are because that's always the best thing, right? Like you see the Facebook University degree holders and an Instagram degree, you know, holders on the internet talking about they don't even know where the fuck these places are on a map. So I thought we plugged that in for them real quick. That was nice of you. Yeah. I mean, just be a courteous, just be a courteous. Yeah. You know, so for those of you guys that don't know or you know, your friends that have those degrees, here's a map. This is where they are. They're not bordering countries. But we got some warmongers, right? Because this shit popped off, you know, and I saw a lot of people, you know, trying to quickly, very quickly choosing a side. Okay. And you have people that are on the side of Israel. You have people on the side of Iran. I, I'm sure like you were, I'm not on any of those sides. I'm on the America side. That's right. But you got, you got the warmongers coming out, man. And they're, they're coming out hard. Yeah. So let's, let's look at this first one. Good old Lindsey Graham, bro. What a douchebag. Dude, that guy's a fucking literal piece of shit. Whoa. The amount of call to war and action. He's so quick at it. Yeah, because he makes a bunch of money every time. That's why he's so quick at it. So quick. Yeah. War pig, Lindsey Graham. He's like five, five fucking 250 pound look like a little troll. The guy probably has a hard time tying his shoes. Looks like he smokes meth. He, he fucking his teeth look like shit. He puts like that old pomade shit in his hair and makes it all greasy. I don't even, I couldn't tell you the last time the motherfucker looked like he had a shower. But he has no problem going on TV looking like all of that and calling for your sons and daughters to go over there and fight a war. So he can make money. Yes, he does. How about this? How about that motherfucker goes on a fucking skewer. Yeah, right? Yeah. No need to eat him anyway. This is bad. Be fun to watch him. Yeah. Bad, bad meat. Yeah. War pig, Lindsey Graham demands US dive head first since Israel's war pushes for regime change to help finish the job. Let's, let's check this clip out. This is a clip of him. He's on face the nation. Let's, let's watch this. The worst possible outcome for the world is for the Iranian nuclear program to survive after all this. How do you destroy their program through diplomacy? I prefer that or through military action. If diplomacy is not successful and we live with the option of force, I would urge President Trump to go all in to make sure that when this operation is over, there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program. If that means providing bombs, provide bombs, if that means flying, whatever bombs, if it means flying with Israel, fly with Israel, the worst possible outcome for the world is to take the Iranian nuclear program on and leave it standing. That will be a disaster. Yep. Why? Yeah, right. Why? Does Iran not have any strategic allies? Aren't they strategically aligned with all the muslim nations? Not only that, Russia, China, don't they got nukes? Okay. Well, here's the interesting thing on that, though, but like they don't have any nukes. Iran, the country, they've been saying that for fucking over 30. They've been saying this is 1982. I'm glad you said that I got the fucking list here for you right here. These are all the major headlines that keep coming out with. I mean, going back this, this one goes back to 92. Yeah, they've been saying it since the fucking 80s, man, right? Like 1992, Iran is 35 years from nuclear capability, right? Jump to the same narrative as global warming, by the way. It is 10 years. You can all be dead. Yep. My encounter 40 fucking years 2012. Um, 2003 Iran's nuclear program, a global threat, uh, 2004, I ran aggressively pursuing nuclear weapons. 2009, I ran one of two years from nuclear capability. They've been saying this course. Fucking decade. Yeah, of course. And they have not yet produced one fucking nuclear one. It's no different than weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Where are they? Yeah. And they never existed. And do you know who, uh, do you know who actually told our government in front of Congress who testified that the weapons of mass destruction actually existed? Do you know who that was? Who's Israel? It was Benjamin Netanyahu. Maybe the same guy who's doing this shit now. Mm-hmm. Okay. And let's be real. Israel's not supposed to have me there. And they do. Okay. And on top of that, if you were a Ron and you had, see, I think it's important that everybody just put themselves in both positions because people tend to think that Iran is like some shitty nation. Iran's actually a beautiful country. It's mountainous. It's, I mean, the people are awesome. These are not like savage, uh, I don't know, like desert people. Like, you know what I'm saying? Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. It's, it's a, it's a, these are people just like us. Yeah. Okay. And people tend to forget that. And we've been programmed here in the United States to think that like we're the only civilized people and everybody else is either in Europe with their pinkies out or, uh, they're in Asia eating rice and, you know, not doing shit. Mud shacks. Yeah. And mud shacks through the fucking jungle. Yeah. Or, you know, they're in the Middle East and riding a camel. And like, bro, that's legitimately what most Americans believe about all these places. They think, they think, they think, they think Russia is like, you know, like this 19 fucking 80s communist shit where people are walking up to bread lines and shit like, like people have, because most Americans have never been abroad, there's a lot of them. I'm not saying most, but there is a lot of them that believe those things are actually true because that's what they've been propagated to believe. You know, when, when I was 21, the World Trade Center, uh, attacks happened, right? And they very quickly started villainizing all Muslim people and making them look like they were just savage terrorists, which got the American people on board for the next 20 years. I mean, bro, you could see it in our movies, which by the way, all the movies about soldiers and war and spies, they're all funded propaganda by the CIA. So we've been programmed and people don't realize that. But like, these other places, man, these people are good people. They, they, they, they might live a little bit different than we do, but it's certainly not the way that they make it seem in movies and on the internet. Because what they want to do is they want to dehumanize all these different people so that you don't feel anything about killing them all, right? Okay. And that's not true. And that's not how a critical thinker should be thinking. And what we really have going on there is we have a group of people who live in Israel who were put there in 1948 post World War II, whether they belong there or not belong there or this or that, there's lots of different arguments we can have. But let's talk about the reality. They weren't there and they were put there. Okay. And there's a lot of people that live there. They're very upset about that and all of those people are Muslim. Okay. Most of them. So now we have this Jewish state of Israel, which people argue, that's the argument, right? The argument is we have a right to exist versus you don't have a right to be here. This is not where you belong. We belong. It's a it's a it's a very important piece of land. So geographic graphical fight. Well, and it's also religiously relevant. It's very there's a lot of religious history there, not just from Christianity, but from multiple different religions. They're sure. So these these people were put there at the end of World War II. And there's a conflict. And the conflict now has become. Israel wants to make sure that none of the countries around there that are Muslim Arab countries have the capacity to threaten them. Okay. And so now we have a situation we have a situation where Israel has been the aggressor and pretended to not be the aggressor in all of these little conflicts. They they drew us into going over there for Saddam Hussein with lies. And I'm not saying Saddam Hussein was a good guy. I mean, the fucking guy like, I mean, he was a bad shit. Really bad shit. And like, I don't think anybody shed a tear when they fucking hung him. I watched the video like 30 times. I thought it was great. Okay. That's not what I'm saying. But what I am saying is that we have a bunch of leaders over there. There are a bunch of fuckheads that don't care about their own people and are willing to get their own people killed because they can't sit down at a table and fucking see past whatever differences they may have. And that's bullshit. Okay. And that's what I'm tired of. I'm tired of these people in every single country making decisions that end up hurting the people they're supposed to represent. And instead of sitting down and working it out. These people, if they had to go fight these wars, if they had to go out and do these things, we wouldn't see this kind of stuff happening. And I know a lot of people really don't like Israel right now. But you can really not like Israel's government and still not be a fucking douchebag and say, oh, it's the fucking Jews. Right. Right. Right. You could still fucking not like the way Iran's government is operating. And fucking still have empathy and care for Iranian people. Like, dude, some of my best friends are from Iran. And the reason I connect with them is because they tell the truth. They're honorable. They have standards. They care about right and wrong. They're good fucking people. And I have a big problem with what is happening here, you know, in our country right now because people are picking aside completely unfamiliar with the actual history of what's going on here. And I'm not saying I'm a historical expert, but I've at least looked into it. What I would consider pretty in depth. For sure. And we can argue nuances. I'm sure there's things that Iran's done that are very bad. And I'm sure that and I know there's things Israel's done that are very bad. And I know there's things that Iraq and Saudi Arabia and all these countries do that aren't good. We say, if I ever fun country in the world, but what I don't like is how everybody here in this country after all of the things that happen with COVID, after all of the things that happen with George Floyd, after all of the things that happen with Ukraine, after all of the things with the vaccine and all these things were where, you know, we got manipulated into taking a side. And then later on we figured out it was total manipulation. And people are still falling, falling for it. It's like dude, if we can't get smarter than that as a whole, we can't make any progress. And I think they know that. I think they know all we've got to do is keep hitting them with more divisive, more divisive, more divisive shit. And they'll never be able to come together. And I really think that's what we live in. We live in a state which this is, this is super fucked up when you really break it down. We live in a, in our country, in a state that literally weaponizes fear every single day. Every single day they want us afraid. They want us divided. They want us hating each other. That is not how we're supposed to be living. That is not what we pay taxes for. That is not what we're supposed to get. And we don't get it. It's not for our benefit. It's for their benefit. So let's like break this situation down to what it really is. We go out, we work, we pay half our money to them. A lot of people pay more than half. They use that money to then propagate against us, fear tactics, division, hate. And all of this negativity that causes us to have high anxiety. And then by the way, on top of that, they propagate unhealthy habits such as being 400 pounds is healthy. And you know, gender dysmorphia and they confuse like, dude, this mental warfare and propaganda that happens in this country has to fucking stop dude. It drives people fucking insane. And it's, it's probably over the course of human history. And people will never think of it this way, but it really is. It's probably the biggest crime against humanity ever because it takes away your whole life. It takes away your ability to make money. It takes away your ability to have friends. It takes away your ability to know what's real and what's not real. And that brings up a whole another subject. Okay, we've got all this AI shit now. Now, I mean like bro, I can't tell what's real or not on the internet. Like, so, you know, I become more and more convinced every single day that they put AI out there in public for the purpose of covering their own tracks because they can just say, well, that was fake or that wasn't true because there's so much shit coming out about them. What about what if all of this, what if all of this shit about Jeffrey Epstein and all these kids and all this shit like we all of us believe actually ends up being true. And they have like Pam Bondi said on hidden camera, tens of thousands of hours of video. Okay, and what if that actually makes it out? What do you think their defense is going to be? Their defense is very clearly going to be. That's AI. Somebody may that up. That's not real. And they're going to deny it. And I think that we've gotten so close to the truth coming out that they intentionally put this technology out so they could cover their tracks. And bro, you know, this situation, I've seen so many arguments about it about Israel and Iran and like, yeah, we got to get a new regime in there this that whatever. Fine. But America's soldiers and Americans have no fucking business participating in it at all. Yeah, I do like that. Because Trump made that made that he talked about it. I think put it in like a just social here's what it is. Okay. When I was growing up, I was usually the biggest guy. Okay. And I was usually the toughest guy. All right. And I have friends that were much smaller than me. And those friends always started shit when I was around. Because they knew you got it. Because they knew that they wouldn't get fucked up because they knew that I would fucking handle it. And that is the exact same thing that Israel does to us. Israel can't fight their own fucking shit. So they black male and and fuck with the US. And they either pay people huge amounts of money to get into office or they blackmail and threaten them. And I think even worse, that's my own opinion. To get the big friend to fucking kick people's asses when needed. That's how I see. Yeah. Yeah. And it has nothing to do with Jews. Okay. It has to do with their corrupt government. And our corrupt government. 100%. I mean, I've looked at it a couple of different ways. I did like what Trump put out saying like, hey, we had nothing to do with this. Don't fuck with any of our shit that's over there. And y'all do your thing. And they try to work through a piece deal. Iran would be smart to do that. They'd be very smart. Because they would be smart. But here's what will happen. Where do you think will happen? IDF is going to bomb that's right. Israel sent a fucking missile and said, oh, it was Iran. Wait, how do I Andy DJ? That sounds like they've done it before. Fucking did the USS Cole. They've done it before. A lot of people believe they were behind 911 or at least involved in it. And that's not spewing conspiracy. That's an actual debate. It's a common narrative. That's very common. More and more and more and more talking about. You know, but but here's the thing. Do you remember a couple of what was a couple of? And it's funny because that's become an a common narrative that you can't ask questions about. I can't even talk about weird, huh? They're super weird, super weird. If it dude anything that's actually true, like true, true, you should be able to ask questions about. Very simple. Because the truth will always be the truth. But you do you remember a couple of I think was like a month ago, whatever when Zalinsky came. By the way, nobody's talking about Raju. You can't still going on. That's irrelevant, right? But do you remember when he came to the White House and he kind of made that? Yeah, but DJ remember when COVID, when all the COVID shit fucking burned out the next day, Ukraine started. Now you cranes getting burned out. And what happens? Oh, it's this. And oh, again, we're forced to choose aside against our neighbors or our friends or our buddy who happens to be Jewish who's, you know, feels a certain way about it. Yeah. Yeah. But do you remember when Zalinsky came, uh, sat down with Trump and the overlawed his and he kind of made that like undertone fucking threat. Yeah. Okay. You remember that? Yeah. Well, Beebe just did the same thing. I don't know if you saw this. So did that publicly. Oh, yeah. So Trump, I mean to the United States now. No, I mean, I mean, I'll leave this up for a second. I'll tell you what, bro. That guy's highly unlikable. And most of the fucking people in Israel like it. He was about to be, he was about to be kicked out right before October 7th, bro. And it's funny because when you really backtrack all this shit, that was the mother fucker who fucking told us that tsunami saying had the weapons and he came here and testified and kind of that they did it. Okay. Now track that back. A lot of people think that that was a false flag. And they think that he did it. Right. Okay. And now here we are in 2022 or 23. I don't know when October 7th happened, but two years ago, I think we have the same situation, very similar situation happened again where you know, these strategies by their account flew over the fucking iron dome. Undetected. Right. And now they have a reason to attack. It's the same thing. And this around thing is the same fucking thing again. So like, well, you know, there's a comment. There's a comment theme with this motherfucker. And it's, he's the guy who, you know, punches someone. And then, you know, he's a hundred and fucking 30 pounds. And he goes over and punches the fucking 280 pounds, six foot four fucking MMA fighter in the face. And then the guy smacks him as hard as he can. And he flies 10 feet across the room. And then he stands up in front. Everybody says, did you see what they just did to me? Hit me. Yeah. And like, dude, that's, that's what this dude's about. I don't even necessarily think it's Israel. I think it's fucking him. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think this is how he fucking operates. Well, we're gonna say, but you know why they keep doing it. Cause it works. It works. It works. It works. Well, bro, because people don't like seeing people bullied. And if you can present yourself as being bullied all the time, people get behind it. Yeah. Yeah. But you, but like, dude, we don't, we don't hear about these things, you know, like, or you get to the point where you get, you know, where they're forced to get behind because again, you know, you paid for the campaigns campaigns. Yeah. Listen, dude, every, every fucking dollar that is spent from any foreign agency on behalf of any foreign country or foreign costs should be eliminated for my government completely. No, no dual citizens. They don't even allow you, they don't even report who the dual citizens are. Like, bro, we're, we're, we're occupied by foreign interests, dude. This is not, you know, it's, if it ain't China, it's Israel or, you know, it's this or it's that. We're the only country on earth that fucking allows that. And then the crazy thing is like, that's how you know, we are, we are truly fucking occupied, right? Because like, it reminds me like, you know, you go back to fucking Germany, right? During the Holocaust, you could not criticize the German government. You go to Soviet Union, you could not criticize. So who can't we criticize in the, in the United States? Well, yeah, I know. You know, people, well, yeah, I know. It's like, it's like, there's a proof. Well, I mean, dude, but that's what causes like, dude, look, let's talk about anti-Semitism. There is real anti-Semitism being stirred up for sure. Real shit. There are innocent people who are happy to be Jewish who are being looked at and treated a different way because of what these people are doing on a global scale. Thousands of miles away. Okay. But the reason it's happening is because the people who are mad at quote unquote, the Jews, every time they've tried to ask or talk or say anything about it, they've gotten destroyed. You're not allowed to ask that that that that does not cover people's tracks that sends up a red flag. You know what I mean? Like, oh, we can talk about this. We can talk about like, when you say something like I say this all the time, and like, I get a lot of heat from it. But like, okay, well, if all of the if most of the world economic forum people are of Jewish descent or claim it. Well, they claim it. They're not. They're not. They claim it for protection claim it. That's a good point. And they say that every country should be multicultural and diverse and diversity is the strength. Then why the fuck don't they do the same shit in Israel? And if you point that out, you're fucking anti-Semitism. Right. It's like, dude, what are you talking about? I mean, it's dude. It's just like this, you know, this this worship going on, right? So, you know, there was this it's called the nuclear non-proliferation tree. And it's signed by pretty much every single country that has nukes. I ran also signed it even though they don't have nukes. You know, and the punishment of like this was put down by the fucking UN, but you know, any country that does not go along with it, they get their asses sanctioned. And they're removed from the fucking economy. You know, who didn't sign the MPT Israel Israel. It's yet to sign it, right? And they have a bunch of fucking UN resolutions against them forcing them to tell them, hey, urging them to sign this to have inside it. They haven't opened up their country to one single fucking inspection, right? But never, never hear nor less. I want to show this video because I think this is I believe I took this as a threat to America from BBs mouth. I will love your your interpretation on this. You guys watching or listening. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think. Let's check this clip out. It's Tel Aviv tomorrow. It's New York. I look I understand America first. I don't understand America dead. That's what these people want. They chant death to America. So we're doing something that is in the service of mankind of humanity. And it's a battle of good against evil. America does should and does stand with the good. That's what President Trump is doing. And I deeply appreciate his support. That's not true. There are people that chant death to America. The people don't chant death to America. Right. In fact, lots of people of Persian culture and from Iran and that area, they want to come here. Why the fuck do they want to come here so bad if it's death to America? You can find people five minutes down the road, a minute down the road that'll say death to Israel. Does that mean in all Americans think that? Okay. So first of all, this motherfucker is the biggest liar on the face of the fucking earth. Okay. Second of all, I don't understand America dead. No, it's not going to happen, motherfucker. Like they keep trying to fear them on grusse into this fucking shit. Okay. You're a little speck of fucking shit over in the middle of nowhere. And here's what's happening, bro. This is what people don't understand. Okay. Now, I'm objectively going to say what I see happening. And this is going to piss some people off. But I think that that man is willing to sacrifice as many regular Jewish people as necessary to continue to hold his victim card, which allows him to hold on to power. And I think that he is intentionally setting up a scenario through the genocide that he fucking did. This isn't the Jews. He fucking did it. Jewish citizens and fucking Israel protest this motherfucker every single fucking day. He did it. And what I think he's doing now is I think he's intentionally stirring all of the Muslim nations around to create a scenario where his country gets fucking blasted. And then he could say, everybody's anti-Semitic. And then he gets a lot of sympathy and it restores him back into his position of power because, dude, the reality is, and this is fucking, you can be mad about it, but this is the truth. There's lots of people questioning lots of things in history right now because of some of the things that have happened over the last five or six years. We've had a lot of lies told to us. And the only reason that we've been able to expose those lies is because the internet is existing. And so now we have a situation where people are starting to question all of the narratives from before the internet, including the desert storm war, including Vietnam, and you go back to Korea, World War II, World War I, how we got like people are going back and they're saying, well, that doesn't even make sense. Okay. And if you look at how they leveraged World War II, and they completely ignore many other genocides that have happened, and by the way, genocides against Christians, they ignore them. They don't talk about them. There was more Christians genocided in the 1900s than any other fucking race by quite a bit. All right. No one talks about it. No one talks about Pol Pot. No one talks about Mao. No one talks about Bolshevism. No one talks about the Holy Demores, the intentional salvation of people of Ukraine. No one talks about any of them. They only talk about one of them. They talk about Holocaust. We have to people are asking why? Okay. So if you look at how that's been leveraged, and I'm not saying it didn't fucking happen, I'm saying if you look at how it's been leveraged, it's been leveraged to say that you cannot criticize anything that has to do with Israel fucking anywhere anytime. Otherwise, you are a supremely massive piece of shit and you deserve to be sued and have everything taken from you. Who's your business? Who's your bank? So name me another name me one other situation where that happens. I can't. It doesn't. Okay. So when people observe that, like when Kanye comes out and says, here's what it is. And the next day he gets debanked and loses all his shit and blah. They're not proving a point. Kanye made the point. And everybody's saying, oh my God, like the people persecuting him think, oh, we'll show him. But really, he just played those people because they exposed what they actually do, which is what he was saying they did. And so and dude, again, I'm going to clarify this. This is not fucking regular Jewish people. This is Netanyahu and his fucking CIA over there, just like it's our president or our leaders here. Like so when we think about all of this shit and we think about all these people waking up to all of this, you know, let's say when I say waking up, I'm going to say asking questions. Okay. I think that's a fair way to say making observations. I don't think it's observations. I think it's just curiosity. Yes, there are people that are making assumptions and they're saying this never happened. Motherfucker, like, look, were you there? Yeah. You know, you don't know. But that's the point. I wasn't there either. And neither was anybody else. Okay. So, you know, no one talks about the fucking 10 million German soldiers that were killed after the fucking war. No one says shit about that. Okay. There's a lot of things that people don't talk about. But it's interesting. They talk about this one thing. Incessantly. And you can't talk about it. And you can't ask about it. And so, dude, that causes red flags. That cause that doesn't cause people to say, oh, you're right. Most of happen just like they said, they cause this people to say, wait a minute. Why are you getting so upset about this? What the fuck? I'm just asking a fucking question, right? And then they turn around and say, oh, just asking questions. It's like, it's like, dude, shut the fuck up. Okay. It doesn't even work anymore. But the point of it is, is that I think Netanyahu is aware of this. I think he understands that the narrative is losing power. And I think he's willing to create a new narrative if necessary at the expense of his own people because how he's behaving is not making Jewish people safer. It's making them way, way, way more at risk. And then everybody else is getting blamed. You know, like they're saying, well, I have to have some autism is okay, but why? Why is that happening? It's not happening because Jewish people are running around acting a fool. It's just organically coming up. No, it's because the leaders of Israel are doing some nasty ass shit that people are like, hey, I'm not down with that. It's not cool. Yeah. And then when you say anything about it, they're saying, you're fucked up. No, I'm not fucked up because I don't want to see people piecing their children back together. That doesn't make me fucked up. So I'm fucked up, but you're good with it. You know, like, make it make sense. No, but that's, here's what I'm saying, dude. I'm using this as an example as to why people have a problem with all of this shit. And so like, dude, when I look at this, and I'm like, what, you know, like I like to think, you know, what's actually going on here? It almost seems like he's putting everybody at risk so he can restore narrative of protection for the next 80 years. Yes, because that's what these guys do. Just like you said, there's a lot of these guys that claim to be Jewish that are not Jewish. There's leaders in Israel that are not Jewish, but claim to be Jewish. And the reason they claim to be Jewish is so that they can hide behind the narrative of Jewish persecution, which by the way is true. Okay. So that they can get away with some fucking very evil shit at the expense of all the normal Jews. And like, bro, it's it's pretty fucking nasty dirty shit. And, you know, people aren't dissecting it properly. They're just generalizing, you know, like, dude, even even when I see clips of mine posts on the internet, I'll see all these people just go, yeah. And no one's credit. It's one side or the other side. And like, dude, we can't have that can't be the discussion of the narrative for us to like get anywhere. You see what I'm saying? 100% man. We'll be stuck right there. Yeah. So like, dude, you know, we have to remove this one and need to be on the right side. And instead, think about what the right thing actually is. You know what I mean? And like, remember, like, dude, these people getting missled, these are not these are normal fucking people, bro, with families. And they're like, getting up, you know, I'm talking about the people in Israel and the people in fucking Iran. No. That's not fucking cool, man. So I don't know, dude, like, you know, I know there's going to be people that have a problem with what I just said. But that's what I see happening. And that that. And honestly, I don't want the United States involved in any of it. It's not our fucking business. Like if if Israel's really operating that way and all the citizens fucking hate what this guy's doing, then they should do something about it. You know, 100% man guys, jump down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think about this, this topic, this conversation. Let us know your opinions, man. Love to hear it. Do you notice how like, even from a lot of successful, you know, regular, what I would say, right? People who live here, but are Jewish. How upset they get when you even talk about this shit. It's like, bro, I'm not fucking criticizing you. You're right, right. You know what I'm saying? Like, you don't think that's kind of fucked up, like at all. And then they're like, no, fuck, they deserve it. Kill them all. And then you're, then you're like, well, fuck. Is it all of them? You know what I'm saying? So like, it's, it's, like dude, we, it doesn't help. No, dude, none of it helps. None of it helps. It doesn't help to have these people on the internet saying it's the Jews. It doesn't help to have actual Jewish people standing up for the actions of what's been happening. Like, there's right and there's fucking wrong, bro. And that comes above like your, like I'm your group. Yeah, people getting mad at me because, like, dude, we had that guy right in about fuck you. You criticize Republicans. Why can't I criticize Republicans? It should criticize Republicans. I criticize everybody for doing whatever the fuck I think isn't right or wrong. You see what I'm saying? Like, it doesn't matter if they're Democrat Republican or if it's Biden or Trump. That's called keeping it real, bro. That's called calling balls and strikes. All right. That's my job. That's why the fuck you listen. I'm not over here planting a flag. My flag is fucking America, bro. My flag is a peaceful, civilized, prosperous, excellent society, which we are not any of those things right now. That's where my flags planted. You know what I mean? So, yeah, we'll see you guys. Let us know. Let me say you want to go cruise some comments. We got some wild people out there today. We got any corn suckers. We got some wild people, bro. Like, I don't know. I don't know.

Well, I thought about him this weekend. Yeah. Yeah. I saw some people eating corn. And I was like, man, I bet Paul would really like that. Paul be happy right now. Yeah. That's what I thought. Yeah. Who Paul's all right? Paul's, I'm sure Paul's fine. Yeah. Paul, I Paul the corn sucker. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Man. That's still one of the greatest comments ever. Yeah. He's a good dude. I like him. Let's keep the cruise cruising. Yeah. Shall we head on to? We make a shirt just for Paul. Yeah. Paul the corn sucker puts face on it. That'd be nice. I bet people will buy him. I'm sure they would. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go up to Minnesota. This is an interesting story that came out of the Minnesota man. It's wild. Minnesota state rep husband assassinated state senator wife also shot. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. This was wild. Yeah. This was wild. Let's dive into this a little bit. A Minnesota state representative and her husband were shot and killed in the brutal attack at their home on Saturday morning. A state senator and his wife were also attacked and shot multiple times in their home about an hour before the attack on the representative. Democrat state representative Melissa Hortman is dead after a person allegedly wearing a police uniform shot her and her husband. The man believed to be a police impersonator fired on police officers who arrived at the home to conduct a safety check. CNN reported the gunman ran back into the house and fled the scene. Police say the vehicle was a black SUV made up to look like a real police vehicle. So Hortman, she served as the speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives. So state legislature, the attack on Hortman followed a similar attack on Democrat state senator John Hoffman about an hour and a half earlier. Now government governor Tim Pantem called the attacks a politically motivated assassination. So let's check this clip out. This is from the oppressed conference that was held where governor Waltz spoke. Let's check this clip. We're here today because an unspeakable tragedy has unfolded in Minnesota. My good friend and colleague speaker Melissa Hennan-Hurrah has been marked. We're shot and killed early this morning in what appears to be a politically motivated assassination. Our state lost a great leader and I lost a dearest of friends. Speaker Hortman was someone who served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, humor and a sense of service. She was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota. She woke up every day determined to make this state a better place. She is irreplaceable and we've been missed by so many. Minnesota's thoughts and prayers are with her family, her loved ones, her children and her parents. My prayer is he's lying. Yeah. That does not come off right. Well you know what's interesting. Did you get that vibe? Yeah. That feels like total bullshit. My first gut feeling is if let's say you lose a good friend of yours, do you really need to read from a paper? Not only that dude, not only that. Didn't the guy that fucking shot him used to work for him or some shit? Well that's the thing man. So this came out because this story gets a little deep okay. So Governor Walls appointed the dude that killed these people to a workforce board. So this was like I said all of the stuff the guy now did he do that personally or did his one of his teams do that and they say he did it. No, I mean it was a board that was put together by Governor Walls. I fucking surely am not a Tim Walls fan for sure, but like let's not make something sound like it's not for sure. We're not going to play the guilty by association. So the identity of this guy's name's Vance Luther Bolter. He's the suspect in the assassination of Speaker of the House Melissa Hortman and her husband. But reports indicate that Governor Tim Walls appointed the man to the state's workforce development board in 2019. Here's the actual appointment that was put together. So this is a common thing that happens. Different states, a lot of governors do these things. They put together these little panels and boards and commissions and they appoint people to these positions. It's highly likely. I'm not saying that Walls knew this guy personally. He was probably recommended while signing off on them. There was definitely a handshake. There are some press conferences, right? But that doesn't say that doesn't mean that they were best buddies and hung out together and drink beers on the fucking weekend, which is what they're trying to make it sound. It's how they're trying to make you see up. You know, there was also some reports. It could be true. It could be, but I mean just because just because you wanted to be true doesn't mean it's true. And just because he appointed some guy doesn't mean to read it. 100%. Let's see the pictures. Let's see him fucking. For sure. You know, for sure. Yeah, sir. At this time, there's none of those correlations yet. But this piece is should also, killed the fucking family dog, which I think that alone, I mean fucking, whichever, put them away. Don't fuck with that. I mean, look, dude, she did what she thought was right. Well, that's the thing. You have a, yeah, a telephone story. Yeah. So, that was the weird thing. So there was a bill that went through the house of representatives for Minnesota, right? Which had to deal with illegal aliens getting healthcare in the state of Minnesota. Okay. Now she with a hand few of Democrats voted no on this bill out of party line. Right? They came out of the party aisle and voted against it. And this was the day before. I mean, that vote happened on Friday. She was killed on Saturday. And she, you know, as the bill, I think they got done voting. She came out and talked on camera about it. Yes, she was crying. I got the clip. Yeah, dude, she was, she was emotional. Check this out. I know that people will be hurt by that vote. And I'm, uh, we worked very hard to try to get a budget deal. That wouldn't include that provision. I mean, she did not seem like she like dude, like there's a, there's a sense like she, she knew something bad was going to happen because of that dude. Not saying she knew she was going to die or anything like that. But no, here's, look, there's a lot of things here. Number one, these people encourage violence all the time and they get away with it all the time. So let's just say there's no other connection besides that. You know, I'm sure they're going to figure out a way to try to blame Trump or blame domestic terrorism on like conservatives or this or that. But who's causing the violence in the country? It's the left. It's the fucking left. It has been the left for a number of years. It's highly disproportionate to violence that comes from conservatives. And the reason that it's allowed is because typically it is against the conservative quote unquote bigotry or hatred or whatever the fuck they say, which is all bullshit too. But now one of them has killed one of their own. And there's only two things. Okay, look, there's three possibilities here. One, she did what she thought was right, which is what you're supposed to do. And this guy is a loony whack job who's encouraged by the calls to violence, the Maxine Waters, the Madonna's, all these people that all of them. Yeah. Okay. All that. So that's one. Second, it's she was threatened ahead of time and I vote that way and they fucking killed her. I think that's it. I don't think it's three. I think it's two. I think it's either unrelated and it was encouraged by their consistent calls to violence. But the way that she's reacting there and the way that Tim Walls read that, I'm here to give my opinions. It feels like they warned her ahead of time and she did it anyway. And I don't think like you said, I don't think she thought that they would probably kill her. Yeah, but Tim Walls didn't seem like he was that remorseful. Do you really think that any of these people who are on the left feel remorseful about this woman being killed? No. I haven't seen anything that really makes me believe that they're sorry that she got killed. I think just like culture reflects the minute that you speak against the left, you are fucking, you are the enemy. Okay. If you don't go along with everything they say, if you don't go along with every social initiative, every single quote, talking point. And you have a problem with any of it with any of these things that they they collectively decide are the viewpoints of the mob. You're out. And you know, we've seen so many Democrats move over to voting, either not voting or voting for Trump. Because of that, you know, they're in their family and they say, well, I don't really disagree agree with kids cutting off their dicks and all of a sudden, dude, they're out. Right. And so and usually it could be some simple shit, right? Like no more campaign funding or like, yeah, David Har what are you talking about? And that comes from that comes from the and by the way, there was we covered a story on here a few weeks ago. I can't remember which one it was. But how that person was saying that there is a belief on the left inside the White House. There was a belief that it was their duty to break the law if necessary. That is a common belief amongst the far left people. They truly believe the countries they believe that if they don't do this that they're going to be killed by Donald Trump. Right. That's what the media has made them believe. Or that they're going to be killed by the conservatives or they're going to be something potential. The country's going to burn to the ground. Right. They believe that shit, which is why they do the fuck is shit they do. And the reason they believe that ironically is because they take our tax dollars. Most of those people don't even fucking work. They take our tax dollars and by our tax dollars, I mean the fucking 80% of people that contribute, they put it into funds like the USAID and then they propagate those people with an anti us message on our own dollar. It's pretty fucked up. I mean, and here's the thing. To your point, you know, about those two options, you know, they're the crazier thing too. Like they searched this guy's car, they found a manifesto, right, which they have yet to publicly release. But they also found these no king flyers in this fucking car. And for those again, we've been covering the no king's protest. How did that? Did you did you watch the protests? Yeah. Like half of the fucking footage on the internet looks like it's fucking AI. And the footage that I saw of people who were actually there, it was very small. Oh, very small, very small. I drove through Kirkwood the other day. I think they might have been Saturday. I think I drove through Kirkwood right in front of Kirkwood City Hall. There was like fucking maybe 12 people. Yeah, all the fucking, you know, they're all the tip of Yom San, but like very small. I was a decent group. Bro, I had dudes who were at the, I had people reach out to me that were many of the ones. And they said there was nothing like what they're shown on TV. Nothing, nothing. So now instead of using plots to create the perception on the internet, which we've talked about, the Twitter files talked about, it's become, I don't think NPCs understand it yet, but I think most people who are a little bit aware understand that people, the media, social media companies have been shaping the narrative with the use of fake accounts that we call bots that they control within their headquarters or network to attack people who post narratives of different things. This is why people are like, holy fuck, look at Twitter now. It's no Twitter represents the actual sediment because they're not using the bot networks to attack anymore like they were before. Okay, so if you want to know what people are really thinking, yeah, that's the truth, man. We're not only that, but like, but, but hold on. So I think they've switched. I think they've switched tactics. I think they've realized that the bot thing doesn't work the way that they wanted it to. And so now they're switching to AI and they're like, look what happened in fucking this city because we're not in that city. One more importantly, like, that's what I was gonna get to more importantly too, you know, these social media companies they can have it set to where, you know, the stuff that's happening in around you, you won't even see that on your your your your static feeds or anything like that. Meaning, so some shit's happening here. We're not really seeing it until one of our buddies calls, hey, man, you good with the fuck you talking about everything's fine. Yeah, they're able to to geographically, you know, intentionally show that to everywhere else. It's just like target of that. I mean, it's a real thing and it happens. Yeah. And so I mean, it makes sense, man. It makes sense. But yeah, I mean, this guy had no, no Kings protests, flyers in his fucking car, which we all again, there goes to the illegal immigration, the same thing she was voting against. I mean, well, that's another thing that I've been seeing that's been completely propagated to represent something that it's not. Yeah. You know, like they're trying to legitimately make it as if people saying, like me, that these illegal migrants that have come here for the last four years shouldn't be here and they should be deported and they should be rounded up and sent back home. The media is taking that and turning that into those people hate fucking Mexicans, right? And that's not what's being said at all. In fact, most of the people that want deportation are, which by the way, at the election at the time of election, remember this. It was 80 fucking percent of people. It wasn't, it wasn't a Democrat or Republican issue. It was 80% of the total population at the time of the election. That's why Trump won. Okay. So you're telling me that within four months, all these people flip flop and now they want this shit here. They don't. That's all fucking propaganda. And so now they've, they've, you know, intelligently stirred the pot between Mexicans and everybody else. And I don't fucking know one person that wants deportations that wants to deport Mexicans. But I really don't. I haven't talked to anybody. I talked to a lot of people that don't want, you know, all the Somalis and all the, you know, African criminals and all of the Chinese military age males and all of these people that came here with no families, no wives, no jobs, who are now shoved into the urban communities all over across the country. In order to redistrict the voting districts, you know what I'm saying? And by the way, they're getting all the resources that the black communities in these inner cities were promised. And so it's interesting how now we have a, like I see this, like it's all the internet, like influencers again. It's like these people fucking can't wait for their chance to be relevant about something. They don't talk about fucking anything other than, you know, their only fans page for fucking years. And then the minute something like this happens, they're like, oh, we stand with the Mexicans, the saying about Mexicans. It never was. You're making it about Mexicans because you don't want to fuck you talking about or you do know what you're talking about and you're intentionally trying to cover it or you're an influencer and you're getting paid. Right. So like dude, it's just it's there's a lot of bullshit going on. And like this is, this all of this kind of shit should be illegal. Like we're not allowed to live our lives without being manipulated in every way, shape or form. Like dude, what the fuck? You see what I'm saying? Fucked up, man. That's fucked up. Dude, influencers shouldn't be able to get paid by NGOs or to represent a public narrative. Like like all of these podcasters who are clearly part of one regime or the other, that should be illegal. Like podcasters shouldn't be able to take money. Harry Sisson shouldn't be able to take money from Joe Biden. Right. Fucking Tim Poole or any of these other guys, I'm not saying they are, but you know, any of them DC, Drain O or any of these guys, I don't even know fucking I'm just I'm not accusing, but I'm saying they shouldn't be able to take money from from those either. Nobody should. You know what I'm saying? No. Under the illusion that it's actually. Yeah, that's right. Well, yeah, you can't do that as a fucking marketer. Like if you're if you the FCC will fucking crush you for that, right? But but you could do it for for a politician in the time. That's bullshit. Yeah. No, I agree. We don't know who's actually holding opinions or who's not. You know, it's dangerous, man. But yeah, man, guys, they got this guy by the way. So I mean, we'll keep you guys updated. And as more more unfolds, I'm sure let us them down the. Dude, I had a person. I had a person who I know. And you all know too, because they've been on the show. And I'm not going to fucking say who it is. And I don't want you guessing. But I found out that that person has received money from the Trump campaign. So how can I trust anything that person says anymore? Yeah, right. Let's know. Let's know. Let's know. That's not you no longer unbiased at that point. That's what I'm saying. I paid. Right. So do you think that it should be legal for someone to pretend to be unbiased, but being paid? Yeah, that's not cool. Is it legal for companies to pretend that a person to pay a person, then for them to pretend they're doing an unbiased review that they're getting paid for? That's illegal. Yeah, they can't do it anywhere else. Right. So you run its fucking TV at this this ad has been paid. Yeah, you got to say that. Yeah. But they'll put so they'll put you in jail as a business person for that. But they'll do it all day long for their own cause. And it's fine. That's fine. Yeah. Bullshit, man. Guys, let us know what you guys think down in the comments. Let me say let's get to our third and final headline, man. Headline number three, Andy. Do you believe in luck? Not the way most people believe in it. Well, this guy's pretty lucky. We got to go to India. Do you see that fucking airplane crash? Yeah. I mean, I don't know if he got lucky. He fucking had the balls to jump out. That was it was. Yeah, read it. Yeah. Miracle passenger survives air India plane crash that killed over 200 people. There were bodies all around me. So a British passenger appears to have miraculously survived the deadly air India plane crash that killed more than 200 people Thursday, according to the local officials and video of him walking away relatively unscathed. This wash, kumash, ramaosh, who was in seat 11A when the Boeing 787-8 crashed into a residential neighborhood Thursday afternoon as recovering in the hospital. All my bad police commissioner, G.S. Malik told A&I News. He was found limping in the street amid the carnage after the passenger plane went down just moments after taking out from the all my bad airport. He says, quote, when I got up, the bodies all around me, I was scared. I stood up and ran. There were pieces of the plane all around me. The 40 year old said from a hospital bed. Someone grabbed a hole to me and put me an ambulance and brought me to the hospital. This is a picture of him in the hospital again, relatively unscathed. But this this this shit was crazy. So this is a clip of the plane taking off and crashing. I always find that interesting to like how they like do people just plain spot out there? Like to get Vietnam sand that plane. Yes, it crashed after takeoff, but it wasn't like right after takeoff. It was like that plane was abnormally low in a place that it shouldn't have been. I mean, when you see a plane that's very low in a place that it shouldn't be that low, I'm probably going to video it. Yeah, I probably start recording. I got a lot of phones over that too. The you know, just start recording. Where? In India. So anyway, I'm going to need one of those trophies back. Every time you make a bad joke, I'm taking trophy. I'm giving it to Z-Shine. Oh, that's pretty. Can't grab Z-Shine. That was good. Come on, man. Congratulations. Okay, that was good. By who standard? Mine. Okay. Let's check this clip off. Oh shit. Something. So look at all those phones. Fuck. Yeah, this is a clip of him walking, walking away from it right after it happened. Yeah, that's great. But I mean, there's now like an actual conspiracy here because there was another plane crash a few years ago on the same plane, same like no trim or whatever. 787. Yeah. That crash and there was one survivor and he was sitting in the exact same seat. No way. Oh, yeah. So that's what I'm saying, bro. So the seat 11A, is it the safest on the plane? Experts are saying no, but now we have two examples of that happening and they both come out completely unscathed. Do you have the other story? Yeah, there was, I think we talked about it in and no, I had to clip that out. Well, how do we know it's true? Listen, how do we know you're not just making shit up? Because it's right there by the escape door. I know that. Yeah. But you you just said that there was another crash and you have no perfect. I pull it up for you. I'll pull it up for you. I got you. Hold on. Yeah, here we go. Three decades apart. Both seats. Same plane. Yeah. Two plane crash survivors seated in 11A walked away alive nearly three decades apart. No. Oh, one was the air bus. Yeah. So they're just saying it's a lucky number. Is that okay? That's possible. People are going to fighting for that seat from now on. Yeah. Not me. That's like private bitch. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know, man. I mean, people are talking about it though. I mean, look, dude, there's definitely things that people can't explain. I mean, I think there's, you know, that question was, do you believe in luck? I mean, of course, there's things that you can't explain that happen that work out your benefit. Yeah. But typically, when I am talking about luck, I'm talking about it in the context of success, which people love to blame. They're a lack of luck on their lack of success, which is total bullshit. Okay. There's lots of people who came from places way worse than you who had it way harder than you who have still won. That's a fact. And, you know, the minute you talk about luck, like the minute I tell a story that, and I'm like, fuck, we got really lucky there. See? See? I'm fucking new at dude. I fucking knew it. That forget the fucking 26 years of grinding. That one thing. Right? So, I mean, I see it as, you know, like the saying goes, you know, it's, it's, when you're prepared, and opportunities present themselves, the people who are prepared are able to capitalize. And it appears to be luck. You know, when you win the lottery twice, that's fucking luck. That's luck. You know what I'm saying? When you're in it, when it wants, it's luck. I mean, there's, no, there's, but, but dude, I just don't like the way that people hang on to luck when it comes to the circumstances of their own lives and blaming their own lives for a series of bad luck. I don't think that your life sucks because you had bad luck. Your life sucks because you make bad decisions. And then you refuse to take accountability for them and you call it luck. And ironically, your refusal to take accountability is what creates what you think is bad luck. More bad luck. Right. But, you know, people don't like that shit because they don't like to be told, hey, you're a dumbass for making these stupid ass decisions. Yeah. But when they go to bed at night, they know they did it. You know, so it's, I try to stay away from the discussion. I was on stage one time many years ago and the guy having the event. He's like, so I heard you don't believe in luck. I'm the luckiest guy in the world. Blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, okay, well, you know that everybody here just decided that you don't know what the fuck you're talking about, right? Like, and that's what I said in front of everybody. I said, you know, everybody here, or that you just, that you just said that in front of they don't believe anything about your story anymore because you just said it with luck. You know, that's not inspiring to people. Yeah. They can't just catch that. No. Well, you can, but it's called working your balls off, fucking all the time. Momentum. Yeah. Dude, you know, many times I read on the internet, people were like, oh, dude, he got lucky in supplements. Okay. First of all, that's not all I do. Second of all, I don't even get paid from supplements. That's what people don't know. I don't take a fuck a paycheck from this company. And I don't take a paycheck from the other nutritional supplement companies. I could pay off of the other things that I do, which are in all different spaces. So I get lucky there too. Yeah, you're super lucky. You know what I'm saying? Like, fuck, you know what else I think is lucky too. I mean, they must have some really good engineers. It is India. Notice how that building still stayed there. Oh my god. I was just going to say, you know what I'm saying? Bro, I was just going to say that. I'm just saying. It's not weird. They got, they got, you know, over there, the jet fuel doesn't burn as hot. That's what it is. Yeah. Maybe it was because the building was not made up of steel. Maybe it, maybe it's, maybe it's because they didn't wire it with explosives. And then blow it up and then say it was an airplane. I mean, look at that. Bro, come on, man. The building's still standing. Some sort of special cement or something. No, man. It's that eco-friendly jet. You know what it was? That was a Tesla plane. There was no jet fuel. It was electric. Yeah. That's what it was. Yeah. Fuck, man. They ran out of batteries. That's what happened, bro. That's why the building still up. Oh, man. I love how that little building has the big tail section of the plane on it. And then like, you know, that's like a fucking little tiny building that's still standing. Bro, that's so sad. It was actually the cafeteria of some medical school. Was it? Yeah. Was this India? Yeah. It's an eastern part of India. Is that, eastern state? Is that where you from? No. No. No. Sorry. This is the western part. I'm so sorry. Are you from the northern part, right? Northern East. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. There you go. Hold on. Hold on. So go back to the little map there. Mm-hmm. Oh, so it did crash right off the takeoff. Yeah. Yeah. It was probably like 30 seconds after flight. Mm. Bro, I always get nervous when you're on the plane. Like, you know how like when they go full thrust and you take off and then they like pull the thrust back. Like and you're like, you feel and I'm like, oh, fuck. You feel it slowing down. Fuck. Oh, yeah. We're stuck. I hate it, dude. Yeah, fuck me. I hate it. It's even more scary when you fly into national. I look at the statistics since like negative 76 degrees outside. Yeah. And I'm 50,000 feet above. But I can't do anything. From done. I'm done. Well, this guy, I mean, you got your carpet. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He's on roll that month. Yeah. Always in my car. That's how that guy got out. That is how he got out. We got enough time to get his carpet. He rubbed that gene, baby. Fuck. We're going to hell. Yeah. Yeah. Guys, jump down to the comments.
