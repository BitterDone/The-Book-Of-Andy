You know, I'm going to say it again, I said this before we started taping, but my favorite comment last time I was here, thanks for having me back, was good to see somebody who's not really an alpha male with you guys, so thanks so much for all the comments out there. I'm trying my bet, I lift weights now, it's a new thing. Yeah, bro, you look tough. I'm very tough. I don't know, yeah, I mean, I'm just saying, you look hard, dude, it's the jacket.

I'll do my shout out, it's Joe and Tammy out there, they own iron den, and I've got a trainer Kyle that's amazing, and I have been in the gym almost every day since February. Yeah, woke up one day, realized how fat I was, and I was like, hey, I should stop being fat. Yeah, I know you've been getting after it, bro. How's that going? It's amazing. Yeah. And by the way, you know, people always say with the 75 hard that the drinking a gallon of water is the hardest part, one of the hardest parts, it's not. No, because when you're working out, when you're actually like kicking your own ass, you drink a gallon of water day. Bro, it's all about priorities. It's not really that hard. Yeah. Okay, it's hard because you're not making a priority. Yeah. Did you guys see that guy? It was a hiker that went, he got lost for like 10 days, you know, you know, and they found him. You know what he said, how he survived. He drank a gallon of water a day. Really? It's so dangerous, but there's what it is. Well, what's going on, dude? What's going on other than that? The world's going to hell. It's all getting ripped. The world's going hell. That's about it. I'm literally, I'm getting, see, look, that's my old face up there. It's from here. And it's a little, it's a little thinner. But, you know, I gotta tell you, I, you're watching everything go to shit has really encouraged me to like get myself together. I think it's one of the, one of the principles that you guys teach is, you know, personal responsibility. And I'm all about that too. Not to, not to like sell all your stuff. Like you said, you don't do the advertising here. I will do the advertising for you. These energy drinks are amazing. Your meat sticks, the protein. I do 200 grams of protein a day. Those meat sticks are part of my regular diet. There you go. I'm a team barzer regular part of my diet. Dude, I am like, I could sell your stuff. You need a guy running commercials for you. You'd be like, hey, you want to be less fat? Get this. Get your ass in the gym. That's about all you can say to people. And his meat sticks are good. Yeah, that's what, that's what I heard. So, so I've been told the cheddar, the cheddar breakfast, jalapeno, original, I know your products now, man. Because I'm about to tell you in one. That's how zits, that's the best release. Yeah. Seriously, I came in here last time and I made the joke and I'll apologize that I was the second. We don't apologize for jokes. Okay, that's right. Against policy. Good to see DJ still unless, unless good shape as I am. But I made that joke. I came in and I look around this building and I'm like, God damn, this whole place is full of athletes. Yeah. And I felt like a schlub. And then I was like, I got to get it together. You really, you inspired me. No bullshit. You inspired me to get my act together. Well, good man. And that's the last time I'll kiss your ass. That's how it's not kissing us. That's how it works when certain, when people set an example, other people follow. That's how it works, bro. I'm just doing that. Yeah. Now you're good at it. I should have been on like the prices right. If they only accepted trans models back in the day, you know, I have to know. Otherwise, they're bigots. Yeah. You have to get not only do you have to guess the price, the price you guess how big their dick is. Yeah. And then you win. It's a double win. Yeah. DJ be good at guessing. I could see it. He does this. He does this. Yeah. He goes like this. Fuck y'all, man. All right. I see how the show is going. All right. So what's up, dude? Oh, you know, listen, you'll be proud of me today. Because I'm telling you guys right now, this show, we are going to be dropping some bombs in here. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. We listen against all of all of the government's advice we did. I did my own research today. And I've covered some some pretty interesting shit. We'll cover in a couple of headlines here. But yeah, everything else is good, man. We got we got some interesting shit to get covered. So let's do some cruising. Cool. Yeah. Before we do that, Tim, I know you are an avid collector of everything. Everything. Well, like, you like the games and the Marvel, and all of that. And were you ever a gamer? You were a gamer for a little bit, right? I mean, when I was, I played like Call of Duty and Madden. I got into those two games. I would wipe you. I would wipe the floor with you. And what in any of it? Okay. I'm just, I'm just making a statement. Okay. Well, my wallet is fucking me. Yeah. I mean, he has a real black card. Yeah, I don't know if the fucking, I don't know if the fucking video games is where I want to hang my hat. No, but, okay. Okay. All right. Fair enough. Yeah. But you, but you didn't use play, right? Like, I mean, you know, video games is the thing. Okay. So, first headline before we even get to our main headlines, I wanted to bring this up because some of these people take this shit too far. Hey, speaking of hanging hats on, to the point of this headline reads, man takes flight to another state to attack rival online gamer with hammer. If it can happen in Nancy Pelosi's husband, you know, it can happen to anybody. Apparently. Yeah. So a man took a flight to another state to attack his online rival with a hammer. So according to the Nassau County Sheriff's Office, 20 year old Edward Kang was arrested after he took an overnight flight from Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey to Jacksonville International Airport in Florida to attack his rival. Quote, this is a weird one. Nassau County Sheriff Bill Leaper said at a briefing held on Monday, some things make you say, hmm. So per Sheriff Bill Leaper, Kang booked a hotel room before he showed up at his rival house at around 2 a.m. on Sunday. According to Leaper, the suspect told his mother that he was going to visit a friend in Florida after he allegedly became angry at the victim while playing the multiplayer online game Archage, which I'm not sure what that is. But he checked into a hotel in Florida and approximately 2 a.m. Friday and went to the Ace Hardware location the next day to pick up a hammer and a flashlight authority stated. And then snuck in the early hours of Sunday morning, he snuck into the victim's home and for and what's that for and Dina for and Dina for an and Dina beach. Florida dressed in black and wearing gloves and a mask. Lisa Kang attacked the victim with the hammer once inside. The victim's okay. He'll be fine. I'm like a recovery. So when the when the suspect was asked why he did what he did the suspect stated that he is a bad person online talking about the victim in addition, the suspect asked our deputy, how much jail, how much time in jail do you get for breaking and entering an assault? Sheriff Leaper said during the conference news conference quote, I would say Mr. Kang is going to be a long time before you play video games again. So here's Mr. Kang. It does look like Dave. This David what's Dave's old Mullins. Okay, it's different Andy. What? I don't know if those are like math equations. I'm not even trying to I swear to God. Listen, I'm being I don't know what the two X is on the shirt for. I don't know if that's the jail shirts. You know, it looks like you wrote it on there himself, which means it probably paid like a thousand dollars for the shirt. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, fuck, if you just book and flights overnight, what's important is that you know the other guy lives at home with his parents because it says it says it's yeah, their parents, his stepfather said he was okay. There's a reason you're at home with mom and dad when he showed up to attack. What? I've never been that angry. No. Why would I have? I have to play call the duty. No, I'm just I'm just saying there's people that I would like to get on a plane and go hit him. But I just don't want to go to jail. I like to I like regular food too much. Yeah, it's true. Could he have at least gotten like a novelty hammer like a or like the show or like the the you know, maybe like a prop tool from the game or some shit. Oh, it's big tiddy anime girls. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that'll get you. I don't grand the best kind. Yeah. Yeah. What? The best kind. It's the truth. Look, I don't I don't know man. I don't get it. It's just I just saw I just saw this. I mean, this is an interesting time we live in. Interesting. Do you think that guy talks with a really thick accent? I've guarantee you he has a list. Guaranteed. Yeah. I know comment. I really want to know what the shirt is, man. It's probably something like Gucci shirt that's worth like like like any say like a thousand bucks. Yeah. Well, interesting, interestingly enough, we got some some good headlines for you guys. We got some interesting stuff. Remember, if you guys want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller.com. You guys can find them linked there. With that being said, let's get into our first headline, headline number one. Now, this is an interesting update. This just came down the chain. We got to we got to address it. Social media and Supreme Court. All right. So have on reads. Supreme Court dismisses social media censorship case for lack of standing, Alito issues blistering descent. So this is a big deal. This is, you know, we've been covering this topic. We got some really, really awesome Patriots Adam Missouri that have been leading this way, fighting this case, taking them all the way up to the Supreme Court. And it just got it just got turned down. So social media companies like Facebook are free to continue censoring conservatives according to a divided Supreme Court over a vigorous conservative descent. Quote during the 2020 election season and the COVID-19 pandemic, social media platforms frequently removed, demoted or fact checked posts containing allegedly false or misleading information, justice, Amy Comet Barrett began for the majority. Quote at the same time, federal officials concerned about the spread of misinformation on social media communicated extensively with the platforms about their content moderation efforts. Barrett recounted the facts of various officials in the White House Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Surgeon General, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. She continued saying, quote, though the platforms restricted the plaintiff's content, the plaintiffs maintained that the federal government was behind it, Barrett explained, quote, acting on that behalf, the plaintiffs sued dozens of executive branch officials and agencies, alleging that they pressured the platforms to censor the plaintiff's speech and violation of the First Amendment. She continued saying, we begin an end with standing. She declared at this stage, neither the individual nor the state plaintiffs have established standing to seek an injunction against any defendant. We therefore lacked jurisdiction to reach the merits of the dispute. So she turned it down. And it was a majority ruling of six to four. Majority six three, the majority held that the plaintiffs failed to show that they had suffered legal injuries that were traceable to Facebook and the company, formerly called Twitter, that resulted from Biden administration coercion and that a court could fix by issuing an order. So it wasn't really denying that any of the censorship actually happened, right? Like there's absolute proof of that. But the court decided there was no real injury or damage done by the censorship. Well, how do you prove that? That's one of the things. How do you prove the damage of something that is said that nobody sees? Right. How can you prove that damage? So I think now with monetization, you might be able to say that you lost money, even if it's like a penny, that you lost money from the government. They're also saying here that like because the FBI, there are lists like California made a list of posts they didn't like and people they didn't like and sent it to Facebook and Twitter and said, hey, censor these people. Literally had a spreadsheet that they sent. Well, yeah. So did the federal government? Yeah. The FBI calls you and says, hey, can you can you censor these people? What are you going to do? Well, that's what Zuckerberg said when he was on Rogan. He said straight up. He's like the FBI called us and told us to do this and we had to do it. When you guys think about free speech in the first amendment in this country and you say, okay, well, the government's not allowed to censor free speech. Well, that's what that is. Yeah. And what they're saying, obviously the fear mongers and the conservative media, which is really no better than the media on the left, they blow this up and act like, oh, well, these people are bought off. No, actually, they just weren't able to show what they were trying to show and they're revamping the case right now to take it back. So and you know, I know that because I fucking asked the guy that has the lawsuit. So I called him up myself. I said, hey, what's this mean? He said nothing. He said, we got to go back and we got to do a better job of showing the proof of standing and damages and we're going to win when we go back. Yeah, because the proof is there. No shit. Yeah. And so what I do like here though, so conservative justice Samuel Alito wrote a blistering dissenting opinion, joined by fellow conservatives, clearance, Thomas and also Neil Gorsuch, who leans libertarian. He said, quote, victims of the campaign perceived by the lower courts brought this action to ensure that the government did not continue to core social media platforms to suppress speech. Alito began. All these victims simply wanted to speak out on a question of the utmost public importance. Our country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic was and remains a matter of enormous medical, social, political, geopolitical and economic importance. Not dedication to a free marketplace of ideas demands that dissenting views on such matters be allowed, you know, I assume that a fair portion of what social media users had to say about COVID-19 and the pandemic was of little lasting value. Some was undoubtedly untrue or misleading and some may have been downright dangerous Alito noted, but we now know that valuable speech was also suppressed. This is what inevitably happens when entry to the marketplace of ideas is restricted. He concluded by saying for months, high-raking government officials placed unrelenting pressure on Facebook to suppress Americans free speech. Alito concluded, because the court unjustifiably refuses to address this serious threat to the first amendment, I respectfully dissent. Yeah, so I hope they do bring it back. Well, I think that's a fair point. I mean, look, it's not about the damages. No one's saying, hey, we need to be compensated. They're saying, hey, stop censoring so that people can know what's going on because clearly the censorship that was done during COVID ended up costing people a lot more than what it would have had it not happen, right? And we all know why. We all know that the whole entire reason was not just for quote unquote misinformation. The entire reason they were censoring everything was because they needed to get Trump out of office. They needed to make sure that they could keep a state of emergency. They needed to make sure they could push the vaccines. And if had this information come out, then none of those things would have happened and they would have missed out on trillions of fucking dollars in one way or another in the global marketplace. So that's what that was about. Everybody knows it. The court knows it too. And these liberal Supreme court, we have this problem now where people have picked sides. People have abandoned common sense. They have abandoned the priority, which is the betterment and the progress of this country to stand on the side of their team. And these people at the Supreme Court are no different. You can't convince me that these people don't know exactly the point of why they were brought this case. You can't convince me that all of those people understand completely what is happening in this country. They understand it perfectly. And you know, it's a shame, dude, because we're now dealing with a situation where because of the nature of technology and the way that our public square, so to speak, works, most of the relevant conversation that happens in the world is on these social media platforms and these big-tap companies hide behind section 230 to do whatever the fuck they want. And when you look back at Facebook and how it came about, it's interesting that life log, a CIA operation ended literally one day. And the very next day, Facebook was founded. And if you guys think about it like that and you think about what the purpose of the internet is, the purpose of social media is not for you and I to be social. It's so the fucking government can see every single fucking thing that you say, think or do right there in your DMs. If you don't think that every single person has their DMs read, you're insane. They read everything. They look at everything. This is all about control. Social media is about control. It's about the destruction of free speech in this country so that we can have a communist revolution. And that's what's happening right now. The good thing about it is it's blown up in their faces. They can't control all of it because how much of the population is now awake because of the people who were continuing to post even if their traffic was throttled. Because what's happened is people have started to seek out this information as opposed to having it flow down through their timeline. So now they've created a scenario where people don't believe what they're saying and people are willing to go out and search for the actual truth or at least the other perspective which would have never happened had they not invented this technology. People would have continued to watch the news. They would have watched, you know, Sunday night, special 60 minutes and they would have believed everything that ever they could have stayed exactly in their place. They would have maintained control because do they've been doing this a lot longer than the last four years been going on forever. The news is propaganda. It has been for who knows how long we just thought it wasn't because we weren't able to see the other sides of the story. Now we have a scenario where people have lost trust and everything. They don't believe the media. They don't believe what's on social media. They don't believe the government. And I don't think that they're going to I don't think they're going to come back to it. I don't think people I don't see how people could come back to trusting the media and social media after what's happened without a ton of accountability and a ton of declassification of what the secrets actually are. Yeah, no, two things. One, when they talk about misinformation in this case, who lied more during COVID than the government? Well, that's a point. Literally, it was all bullshit from them the entire time. Every conspiracy theorist conspiracy theorist that was blocked, they were right. I can't think of one that was like a total lie during the I'm trying to think of like something that was actually false that was labeled false. Everything came true. Literally everything came true. But the other big point and it's the only thing you didn't say in all of that was the other ring of your neighbors during COVID. That was the game. That was showing that you can separate people and get them to turn on each other. Just like what Hitler did with Jewish people back in the day. It was the, you know, you have to have your vaccine. Well, bro, this is a play of communism across the globe. This is not just a Nazi play. This is a, this has been done with now. This has been done with Stalin. This has been done in every single communist revolution that's ever happened. It was done in Poland. It was done everywhere. For communism has ever existed. This is what they did. They got the people separated and it turned on each other. And it was easy. Yeah. I mean, it was so easy. One day, I mean, even like people who I used to consider conservative and free market people and those free like actual like pro liberty people were going crazy with the vaccine and like for your health and your grandma and how dare you do XYZ and what I can't believe how quick people shifted. Yeah. It was amazing to me. Yeah. It was definitely orchestrated. And I think a lot. I mean, I think the whole grand scheme of thing, you know, I think a lot of it was going to lose because of what they did. I mean, it's crimes against humanity. We talk about all of the time. Yeah. There's a lot of people that are affected. And I think a lot of those effects. We are still five, 10 years away from even seeing the beginning of those effects. You know, but I don't know. We're seeing it. I mean, the we're seeing it. It's mortality rate is up almost 40%. Globally, we're seeing it, but like the effects on the kids, the effects on you know, I'm saying like there's a lot of education kids. You couldn't go. Yeah. You know, I'm saying it's like I feel like, you know, we're we have an even seen the tip of that iceberg yet, you know, and that's that's going to be the scary thing. I think at the end of the day, and I mean, this is whole, this is like, I mean, it's really like a ruler mentality that they have over the country right now. It's like, you know, we get to decide what's best for you. And no, you don't get to decide what's best for me, right? Like, and that comes down to the food I eat that comes down to where I want to go that comes down to what I want to think and what opinions I'm going to value. Right. That like, that should be left up to the individual to decide. Right. And this, this idea that they get to just decide all of these things, man, like that should, that alone should piss off a lot of people. By the way, going back to the whole premise of the case, so say the government is guilty. They violated the first amendment. What happens? Nothing. They go, the Supreme Court goes, Oh, hey, you did a bad thing. And then they just keep doing it. Yeah. Well, the, the most disappointing part about this is that we're four months out from an election. And these people have now given permission to the government to do it again. Go for it. And that's the problem. So now we're going to see all the same shit that we've been seeing. Listen, dude, it should be 100% illegal for the internet, any social media platform to delete any fucking post outside of pedophilia or criminal activity. Yep. Legitimate. They get caught doing it. It should be like a billion dollar fine every single time. That's the only way free speech is going to be protected. They've been, look, the internet came around. The social media came around. Nobody was prepared for it. All right. So they formed section 230. And it's, it's protected these people. And what happened was the adoption of social media was so quick. And the money came in so quick before anybody really realized how, what mistake had been made about giving these guys too much power? They had already started to funnel the money back into lobbies and bribes and paying the politicians and it created an installation for them way back in the day. These bigger companies online on the internet did this with tax dollars. All right. How did the biggest companies, the biggest e-commerce sites in the world get to become the biggest e-commerce sites in the world? Well, they didn't pay fucking tax for the first 15 years of their life. So when you have a company that employs less people because they're an e-com company versus the rest of the marketplace, which is mom and pop, all right. And then you give the e-com company who employs less people and eight to 10% price advantage because they don't have to collect tax. You're killing the economy because you're creating a 10% competitive advantage for the company that actually does less for the fucking community. And that's what people, people can't even calculate that. And that's why you have some of these companies that are so fucking big that treat their employees like shit that, you know, and we've seen this complete decline of, you know, mom and pop and mid-size companies and all this. And they tried to put the hammer in the coffin when COVID happened. That was what that was about. That was like, all right, we damaged them for the last 20 years. We made it hard for people to compete. We created monopolies with tech and e-com. And now we're going to put the fucking nails in the coffin and bury them. We're just going to shut them down for two years. And we're going to say all of you guys can stay open. That's what this is about. All right. And I don't understand how people can't put all that together. It's like, bro, I don't know. I mean, I guess I just have a unique perspective because I've been in the game for that long and I've watched it happen. But guys, it's very fucking sinister what they've been doing. And it's not something they just started doing. I think that's cool. Why would you give companies that employ less people that pay less tax, tax immunity for 15 years over all the companies that employ the middle class of America? Why would you do that? You would only do that if it was benefiting you directly and you were willing to look the other way and say, I don't really give a fuck about those people. Yeah. And then you look at those, those, those same companies are the same ones that are first on the trends, the first on the whatever narrative, whatever way the wind blows today. Right. Like here's this hashtag. We're going to stand for today. Yeah, you want to talk about fucking reparations. They should do, they should do commerce reparations and they should make the Amazon's of the world pay tax for the next fucking 20 years and collect tax and let every fucking small mom and pop medium business have sales tax immunity for the next decade and a half. And we'll see where the fuck it evens out to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments. What do you guys think? But that being said, let's go check out some of these comments. Guys, we got crews of comments coming up. Here we go. First one from at Keenan Fitzpatrick, 904. He says, I don't remember seeing these hats on the drop last night. What do you tell him about? What do you tell him about? No, no, no. This hat, we had hats on their drop. I just got this one. That is a bad ass hat though. Yeah. I like the all black guy. Why do I have to, I like to think I'm a VIP around this place. I'm not. But why do I have to get it? I'm begging you for a free hat. And I had to get in on one of the, I have missed out trying to get these hats. No, fucker. This is capitalism. This is America. I bought them all last time. I bought them all. This is America. I just hit the button. You get in there when this drop happens. You just hit the button and you just, you throw the, you have your card ready to go and you just, it's meritocracy, bro. You gotta be fast. This is America. Again, I believe it's some products here. You know what's funny, dude? Real talk. That by the way. But, but the thing is, it's so funny. Like, people will criticize people for charging for things. Like, you know, like, you know, like, you know, like, I had someone like, fucking get, get upset with me because like, we charge for RIT. I'm like, bro, I'm showing you how to make like literally millions and millions and millions of dollars. Like, I'm not giving that away for free. Right. That was fucking my entire life. You know what I paid to know that knowledge and you're fucking in so entitled, you think I owe it to you? You know what I'm saying? Like, fuck you. This is fucking America, bitch. Give up your fucking pizza and your bullshit for a month to get better. Fat motherfucker. I took that personally. Well, I'm just saying, like, you know what I'm saying? Like, oh, you can't give up some social. You want to get better, but you don't want to get better. Right. You know what I mean? Right. So, fuck off. All right. This next comment comes from Alex Realttox. I can't take this serious. The motherfucking ass. Bro, I have to be really like that. I have to be real, dude. I was watching some of the clips and it did look pretty pretty ridiculous. Like, we're over here trying to be serious. Like, we got these big dishes. The whole intro. Great. No, I know, but like, I lay down some real knowledge. Yeah. Those minutes, but it's never going to go anywhere because the fucking hat. Anyway. Yeah. It's all good. Last go. I want good one for you. This is the last comment comes from Kyle Isom 9645 Andy. What if it's found out that Biden's performance enhancing drugs are actually three scoops of megawatt before he walks out? What we do? You should do it. All the other companies do. What? Don't use our products. I don't stand for this. I, I, I mean, if he was smart, that's what he would do. It works. That's what I will say. It should work. The worst. Yeah. The worst of the worst. By the way, my favorite, my favorite don't use us product or the, my favorite denouncing of everything. Remember what the, the Trump grabber by the pussy thing back in the day. You know, the follow up was I always keep tick-tax in my mouth to kiss women. Is that what he said? And tick-tax to announce that. That was my favorite one. Like that. That was always, that's overlooked. I thought that was the bigger thing. What did they say? They denounced him. They were like, it's, you know, whatever sexist or whatever the hell away. It was one of those generic. The whole fucking point of your product is so you could fucking kiss people. You know, stinky breath. Not the orange ones though. That doesn't actually like the fruit ones. Like the fruit tick-tax. Of course you do. You know what? Fuck you, tick-tax. No. All right. I'm using mentos. Mentos, pretty good. Mentos are good. And they're the jingle. They got like the little ch- they're like chewy. I miss, you know what I miss bro? The orbits commercials. With the dang. With the, with the, with that girl, the bridge girl. Yeah. Yeah. Like a kudikween you lit liquor like those. Yeah. That was back when people had a sense of humor for sure. Can't do that now. No, we can do that now. We do it out of fuck we want now. Mentos was the one where you could like commit burglary and then just show the mentos. And they'd be like, cool, thumbs up. Yeah. Yeah. You just walk in his mouth. Those mentos commercials were cheesy, dude. Yeah. Like where they were like with the music and their what? Yeah, pretty good. Pretty white. Pretty white. Yeah. The fuck it was very white. Now that's white is grape-oupon. No. Well guys, we appreciate you for being a real ass fan. Thank you guys for liking and commenting. Make sure you guys are subscribed. Hit that bell notification icon on YouTube. So you guys stay up to date with the latest episodes. And with that being said, let's get to headline number two. Now this is where the research was being was was done here. Okay. And I'm actually pretty happy for myself here. I think this is going to be pretty good. Hope so. Let's dive into this. Headline number two reads. Congressional report. CIA interfered in 2020 election. Colluted with Biden campaign to discredit Hunter Biden laptop story. Everybody knew that right? Shocking. Right. We've talked about this. But there's more here. There's more here. Let's dive into this a little bit. Um, so the CIA interfered in the 2020 election by colluding with the Biden campaign to discredit the Hunter Biden laptop story. A congressional report found Tuesday. So this just came out quote, it's inappropriate for a currently serving staff officer or contractor to be involved in the political process. Former CIA deputy director Michael Moro acknowledged to Congress during its investigation of the incident. So this report found three, three major things here. The first thing they found. And this is all a reference to that that letter of the 51 intelligence officials that signed that letter saying that the laptop story was just Russian disinformation. Right. This is referring to that. So this congressional report that just came out. They found three major things here. The first thing was they found that high ranking CIA officials up to and including then CIA director Gina Haspel were made aware of the Hunter Biden statement prior to its approval and publication. So they had an inside knowledge. They knew this letter was something that was being created. They knew that they wanted to get it out. And they were all on board with it. All right. Several former senior intelligence officials signed the statement. The PCRB sent the draft statement to the CIA's then chief operating officer Andrew McCritis who said he subsequently informed then director Haspel or then deputy director Vaughn Frederick Bishop that the statement would be published soon. So they all knew about this. They all knew that this letter was bullshit. They all knew it was going to be pushed out. The second thing they found was that some of the statements, signatories, including Michael Morel were on active contract with the CIA at the time of the Hunter Biden statements publication. Well, what's that mean? That means our own CIA who are not supposed to be operating inside of the United States, right? This was be focused on Oconous operations. They had active duty contractors, active contractors. People were actively working with the CIA sign that letter at that time. Michael Morel was just one of them. And furthermore, they knew that it was fucked up. This is the third point that they found in this report was that after the publication of the Hunter Biden statement, CIA employees internally expressed concern about the statements politicized content, acknowledging it was quote, not helpful to the agency in the long run. At least one employee found it interquote interesting to see what was submitted and approved when discussing media talking points at the statement's co-author former senior intelligence service officer Mark Pollyamorous. Mark Pollyamorous submitted it related to the statement. When they were talking to Mark, when discussing his talking points, another CIA official stated quote, it appears Mark is actively involved in a pro-Biden campaign and may be disclosing classified information in his efforts. The CIA's internal review board known as the pre-publication classification review board or PCRB determined that Mark's talking points contain classified information that he had to be removed, that had to be removed prior to the publication. And it wasn't just that. They knew that they were put together and we have an email and they knew they had a short amount of time to get it out. Okay. Judicial review, judicial watch. They are the ones that, you know, through a foyer lawsuit found these emails that explicitly show that the CIA operators knew the sense of urgency surrounding this and they actually have the email where, you know, it shows, you know, quote, this is a rush drop as it needs to get out as soon as possible talking about that letter being signed from Michael Morel, the guy that's on contract with the CIA. Correct. Now who is Michael Morel? This is where the research starts to get good here. Okay. Some dots are about to get connected. So per his own bio, okay, he has over 33 years inside the intelligence committee community. He was the former acting director and deputy director of the CIA. He's been a part of many things. One of the two of his biggest accomplishments that he notes in his history was that he has witnessed the two major historical events. He is the only person, this is his words. He is the only person who was with both with President Bush on September 11th when Al-Qaeda burst into the American consciousness. He was also with Barack Obama on May 1st when Biden laden was brought to justice. He played a major role in the bin Laden operation. Right. Now here's where it gets really interesting. Okay. Stay with me, guys. Let's go back to August 5th of 2016. And then op-ed gets written by who? None other than Michael Morel. This headline that he wrote, this article that he wrote is titled, I ran the CIA, now I'm endorsing Hillary Clinton. Now the article starts off. If you wrote that fucking, if you wrote that headline today, it would be a complete like backfire in your face. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. Sorry. This article, you know, talking about how he's a long life, you know, he served both parties. He served three Republicans, three Democrats. He was with Bush again, talking about September 11th. He talks, you know, those are his claim to fame, right? But he says that he quote, I am neither a registered Democrat nor a registered Republican in my 40 years of voting. I have pulled the lever for candidates of both parties. As a government official, I've always been silent about my preference for President. No longer on November 8th, I will vote for Hillary Clinton between now and then I will do everything I can to ensure that she is elected as our 45th president. Now that's, that's a very interesting statement there. I will do everything I can to ensure that she is elected as our 45th president. Now again, guys, this was written August 5th, 2016. You guys know what happened, not even a couple of weeks before this article was written. Operation Crossfire Hurricane. Was he in charge of that? It not interested. Isn't that weird? No, not really. No. I just, I think it's, I mean, all of this together, the fact that he's like, hey, I was there with the W during 9, 11, I was there when Obama, like that guy is the deep state. Like when you see deep state, that should be, that's what you should see in the dictionary. This little fucking nerd. Yeah. This guy right here running the fucking country. As a former little nerd, I understand his angst and why he would want to take over and be an evil under, under a dictator. But good Lord, these are the guys that go, they run wild and bureaucracy. Nobody votes for these people. Is he related to Crossfire Hurricane? Well, so the thing was is that, you know, he was highly, highly liked during the Obama administration, right? Are you saying, is he officially connected to that? Or you just saying so there was one, I tried to, I tried to pull it up. So there was the initial start of Crossfire Hurricane, right? When it got released and remember, Crossfire Hurricane, this is what the FBI used. They worked with the CIA was that that's what created the still.ca, all of the stuff came out of that. Those of you that aren't read up, it was the made up Russia collusion. It was the shit they cried about for seven years until it finally came out that it was completely false. There was no merit to it. Hillary Clinton initiated the creation of it. And apparently this dude had a pardon it too. 100%. And so that original document that was came out, Michael, Michael, what's his name? Michael Morel here. He was on that original list. He was in that room when when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were debriefed about this whole plan. There were seven people in that room. He was one of them that has been verified. And again, it's interesting that that, you know, Operation Crossfire Hurricane happens and then he releases this crossfire that came out on July 31st of 2016. He writes this article less than a week later saying how he's going to do everything he can to ensure that she's elected. Apparently, including making up shit. Yeah. So bury this dude. I don't think that people realize how what this means. Like when you think back, if you paid any attention at all, Donald Trump was never even really allowed to be president. He was harassed from the get go. It started off as he was a legitimate president, which is what Hillary Clinton said a million gazillion times, which they put people in jail for over here saying this about fucking Biden. Yeah. Okay. And then for the next, for the next four years, he was president and the next three years after that, they still tried to demonize this man and say that he was a quote unquote Putin puppet. All right. None of that is true. It's not even sort of true or a little bit true. And there's so many people out here that hate Trump because they believe he's some sort of anti-American trader. And these people have done irreparable damage to the country and they're walking. Listen, they made shit up like bro, if I were to make something up about you, Tim, and destroy your reputation, destroy your, I would go to fucking jail. These guys just fucking you'd be you'd actually probably get an appointment from the Democrats and yeah, no shit. I'm gonna hire you as a consultant. Like dude, people don't understand that's what's going on here and the disruption. And we look at like where we are economically and where we are with the division in this country and where we are with the frustration that's going on and where we are with all of this chaos that's happening, this all started with that. All of it. So to me, dude, it's insane that these, all of these people who were involved in this are not being held accountable at all. Like they're just, we could just do whatever the fuck we want. And again, it's the same thing, like I said with the first amendment case in the Supreme Court, say we find them guilty. Yeah. What's going to happen? Yeah. Nothing. Do you have the, is the next topic have to do with the debates? Okay. So did you see the fucking restriction on the debates today that they put in? So no crowd, right? We knew that. Yeah. Mutant microphones. We knew that. CNN moderators. We knew that. So we know like this is completely Biden refused to take a drug test today, said he won't do it. So we all know all of that, right? So you know what they said today? They said today we're not going to air the debate live. There's a two minute delay. What? Hold on. There is a two minute delay to allow them to edit the fucking video and audio. Yes. Fuck out of you. Yes. How the fuck are we fucking tolerating any of this dude? You could AI Biden. You could fix what's coming out of his mouth. These people are completely corrupt. They're making up rules as they go. And the real problem here is is the Democrat voter who is okay with that. Like how can you say you're okay with that and then say you're an American or believe in this country or love this country or love freedom? How can you be okay with the amount of manipulation that's happening? How can you stand over there on that side and say, well, I know they're doing it, but fuck it's still better than that. It goes against everything this country is about. Everything. And dude, that's the problem. It's not these people doing it. It's the people who are still standing on the side of the line with those people. And dude, here's the thing. At some point in time, we're going to have to say, all right, well, you guys are a fucking loss cause. We're going to do what we got to do. And that's what's going to happen here because I could tell you right now, dude, if they're reporting the polls at 60 something percent for Trump, what do you think it really is? What do you think it really is? Okay, you think they're telling you the truth when they say, oh, it's 60% Trump 40% Biden and they're saying that shit on an MSNBC. What do you really think it? Bro, that means it's like 90, 10. Well, they're trying to say Trump has 48% or 49% in Texas and by now it's a 41% in Texas. That's what they're trying to say right now. That poll just came out today. No, I don't believe that either. No. No, then this whole edit. Bro, how many fucking people real talk? Do we see out in public the fucking support Biden? Zero. Dude, anywhere you go, you can just count the mass squares. Yeah. I mean, anyone even calls it it. Bro, listen, anywhere you go, it doesn't matter who you talk to. Like if you talk to him for three seconds, they're still a lot of people who are like, they'll say it quietly. You're like, fuck dude, I'm fucking vote for Trump. They'll say it like, they'll look around. And dude, but see, you know why they look around? Because they lied about Trump for seven fucking years, man. You know what I'm saying? We shouldn't have to hide what we want to, what we believe in. Yeah. It's gonna be a shame, but do you think? No, and that's what they've done. They're not only editing all the rules to fit them, but they're also shaming anybody and punishing anyone that's not on their side. And bro, these people are the tiny minority of people. Yeah, I don't think people realize that, again, if you realize that you're in the majority and that's one of the big things of otherizing people is that they have made it feel, they've made people feel like if they express their opinions, they're gonna get stomped out. But that's not true. No, it's not. It's so important. And I talk about this all the time when I go and do political talks. It's so important to just talk to your neighbors, to just have communication with the people who live around you so that you know that you're not alone. Because everybody's like everybody's on the same page now. Yeah, man. It is really, and by the way, before we get too far down the rabbit hole, that Mueller report, my favorite part is the Mueller report that everybody always glances over. There's a footnote in the middle of it. If you read it, that says that actually Putin's office was frustrated that they couldn't find a contact for the Trump campaign at one point. That's how distant they are. Yeah. Like, Putin's people are like, this campaign is disorganized. We can't find anybody even talk to when we're trying to bribe them over there. Yeah. So like, that was, that was a thing. And talking about people failing, I loathe the House GOP. If anybody follows me on social media, I talk about how shitty they are every day. Because they should be in a position to actually do something and they won't because they're on the same page. People say, you know, party, they're on the same page as Democrats. They just want to fund themselves. Listen, bro, they won't because the biggest lobby in the world, which is A-PAC, is fucking funding everybody on both sides. That's what the fucking deal is. Yeah. So A-PAC is the unit party. That's who's fucking causing it. They don't want to fucking say anything that goes against anything that those people believe. It's not even a Jewish thing. Like people are trying to make it into this Jewish thing. No. Guys are spending so much fucking money that the people, whether they agree or disagree, they just don't want to fucking go against it because they're going to lose their campaign financing and their kickbacks. They're not going to be able to go to the club or the fucking golf course or the fucking island of these dudes or wherever, right? And be a celebrity like this. Bro, did you see AOC jumping around? Yeah. She thinks she's a fucking rock star. These people think they are fucking rock stars. They are public servants and we have lost that in this country, dude. It's a shame, man. Yeah. No, I was going to say so they're all worthless. But Judicial Watch, who brought up the, who did the FOIA earlier, you know, they're who uncovered Hillary's private email server by accident when they were doing a FOIA request. They're like, what's like Clinton male.com or whatever it was work came from? Like they have done all of their FOIA requests. I wrote for them for like six years, by the way. I was like a ghost writer for them. I've seen all of their stuff. They do incredible work. You guys can send me a check for that, by the way. But they send so many FOIAs out there. Like the number one FOIA organization, the, the, the, the most FOIAs of any organization. And they uncover the stuff. They do the shit that our checks and balances are supposed to be doing in the house of representatives. They do nothing. Like Judicial Watch is literally the, I mean, they're not conservative because they, they do checks and balances on everybody, but they lean right. But they are what the conservatives should be in Congress doing the checks and balances, doing the job of these elected officials and public servants. It's unbelievable to me that like the stuff that they've uncovered, they uncovered everything from like Fauci funding the, the bat research, the, the, the, the, the, the, all of that. Yeah. Literally everything came from Judicial Watch and, and our house, GOP, a sleep at the wheel, just collecting their paychecks, making sure they keep their job. Yeah. Yeah. Now, I want to, I should mention this because CNN has since come out about that whole two-minute delay trying to deny it. I'm an official statement. They said, quote, this is false. The debate will begin live at 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Um, but again, like, I mean, are they going to, I hope that is false? Uh, but because I saw that reported by like four different agencies today. Yeah. So CNN's, so CNN, CNN communications on Twitter. I hope that's true. The reality is is we shouldn't be standing for any of it. We should make a live debate. We should see who, we should allow 50% of the tickets to be available for Biden supporters. Yep. 50% of the tickets available for Trump supporters. See who fucking shows up. There should be no control over the microphones. There should be an actual debate. And the moderators should be, there should be two moderators, one from one side and one from the other side. And if those guys start arguing, then they can argue. I mean, dude, this is bullshit. No. Like, oh, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, Joe Biden's going to go meet with Putin. Putin's going to politely not debate with him because he's fucking a moron. Yeah. Or he didn't take his fucking cocktail. You know what I'm saying? Like, are you going to mute Putin's microphone? Yeah. I think it should be noted too. I mean, even just, I think it should be noted that Putin's showing an exceptional amount of restraint by not fucking nook in Washington DC. 100%. I'm just going to say that. But I think, I think one thing too that should be noted, man, because I just, that was this clip that came out just the other day, a couple of days ago, that Trump interview with Barbara Shrizin, and it's a side by side comparison of the video that was released and then an unedited copy of that video, of that interview. And they cut out a shitson of that. No, where he was like, you know, his response? You mean when he was like, Barbara, we know each other blah, blah, blah, exactly. Right. Right. And so I don't put the, the, the, the, the, the, I would not be surprised if it comes out the CNN's fucking this clip. Look, they are, they are in charge of the entire production. I mean, on top of it, you've got two people who hate Trump who are, have already studied, right? They go up and he's Biden. You have two moderators who hate Trump who have done their research. They, they were already embarrassed with Caitlin Collins a couple of months ago when they did that town hall and they cut it early 15 minutes because Trump was stomping all over and the crowd was against her. That's why there's no crowd there too, because the crowd was cheering for Trump. They don't want to have that again. Tim, there's no fucking crowd for Biden. There wasn't no crowd for Biden in 2020. Yeah. You know, do we remember what they did? They kept the circles. Pro. Yes. They kept them in his basement. They didn't do a, any sort of traveling campaign. They did his, town halls at a fucking gym with literally eight to 12 people in circles for COVID. Then they, they did a car one, right? Like what? It was like driving. Yeah. And like, dude, and then all the while Trump's doing 100,000 people rally. Like, dude, Trump did 100,000 people for 30 days straight leading up to the election to and I know I did it. He did it to show America the truth and people been picked up on it. Like they didn't pick up like these guys can't draw a crowd. Oh, that makes sense. And then Trump's saying, look, this is, you know what I'm saying? Like dude, and I think if they do this again, like this November, because everybody knows I was talking to one of my buddies this morning actually, who's not really a, he's not like a never-trumper, but he doesn't like Trump. And he didn't vote for Trump. And I was, I was joking with him. He got a haircut and I fucking was like, hey, you finally look like a fucking human again, bro. I'm like, hey, you vote for Trump this time and he fucking sent back a laugh face. He goes, dude, I have to. And I'm like, no shit. Like people are what, and this guy was like, this guy has like, we've gotten some heated arguments where he's motherfucked me up and down. He's like, dude, you're fucking a Trump. Colt guy, no, I'm not. I'm not at all. You know what I'm saying? Those people were waking up. Bro, and they cheat again. What do we think's going to happen here? And then we talk about like, okay, because I think they're going to, I think they are going to intentionally instigate violence. Oh, yeah. And I think they're going to blatantly steal the election right in front of a face of everybody, instigate violence. And I think when that violence happens, we're going to have major fucking conflict with other countries on the ground here because they've been sending their operatives across the fucking border for the last three years. So it's possible that we could have terrorist cells, we could have conflict with China on the ground here. All it's going to take is the first shot. And like, dude, this is, this is very dangerous of what could happen. And I'm, I think people should really prepare themselves. I don't like that. I think you're right. Yeah. I really, like, I like, you know, two years ago, if you would have told me that, I would have like, come on, man. But now I'm like, you see it getting set up. Yeah. You literally can watch the pieces and it's not conspiracy. You can see the legitimate pieces coming down. Yeah, man. And dude, and when you think about that, it makes a lot of sense of why they keep coming through like just yesterday, the United States turn general said that guns are the biggest fucking killer of children, which is not true. No, that's a complete lie. They're manipulating the data points. And they're also including suicides in gun violence. They add 18 to 21, I think, and that is, yeah. Something else they like. By the way, DJ, I think you dropped it when that car rally for Biden. Yeah. It was all brand new jeeps. Wasn't all brand new jeep patriots or something that was there. Yeah. Like, it was all bullshit. They just pulled out like some like lot of jeeps. Yeah. And told the workers to go sit down. Yeah. Hulk the horns. Yeah. That's fucking insane, man. But dude, like, it's all fake and everybody knows it. But nothing's happening. So it's like, at what point do these powerless people lose their power? And it's at the point where the rest of the people say no. And it's not about violence. It's about non-compliance. It's about saying no, fuck you. We're not doing any of that. Like we're not doing that. And dude, that's what has to come down to. You know, I think that we're going to end up in a very, very, very bad situation. Regardless of what happens, I'm not optimistic that this is going to go smooth. I think the military, I don't know. I just, I don't feel good about it. I'll say this. I think it's going to get much worse than it gets better. You know, I don't think we've seen the depth. I'm not trying to fear longer people, dude. I just, my logical brain of breaking down step one, two, three, that's what I see. Yeah. Because like, dude, they're, they're pushing. They're not, they're not, they're not gracefully saying, hey, we're getting beat on our policy. They're not, they're not saying, hey, we're losing because he's popular. They're trying to criminalize this, dude. They're trying to put him in prison. They're trying to censor anybody that's for him. They're trying to, you know, create a situation where people are intimidated to support this man. You know, dude, this is, this is all earmarks of communist tactics. And the people who are on the side of Biden, they're like, oh, that's crazy. That's not communist shit. No, it is. And guess what? You're the useful idiots that these people write about. And the useful idiots are the people to get killed first. It's very simple. It's just like the vaccine. Remember, remember all the Atlantic article? Vaccines are safe. Vaccines are safe. Then when it comes out, comes out that they're not safe. Vaccinated people. Why didn't the rest of you tell us? What are you talking about? Yeah. You guys wanted to put us in camps. You wanted to find us hundreds of thousands of dollars that own companies for not forcing vaccinations. We were grandma killers. We were to stay home from society. You had Leanna went on TV. Leanna went or whatever on TV saying that we need to be excommunicated from society. Like, dude, what are you talking about? We fucking told you and we're telling you now. And the same motherfuckers that went for this shit the first time are going for it again. And they're supporting this dude because they hate Trump. And what they don't realize is that if communist getting power, bro, the first people they kill are the useful idiots that support them into power. They don't want people in society that can't produce or can't work or can't contribute. And using all these fucking purple hair weirdos are going to put gloves on and get the fucking work. It's not happening, dude. We all don't need lattes. Yeah. Fuck they're not even going to do that, bro. That's why those people vote for higher taxes because they think that means higher income to them. They want to take your shit and give it to themselves. That's why people who don't pay tax shouldn't be able to vote. Shouldn't be able to vote. Shouldn't be able to vote if you're not paying in. By the way, it's going to be really interesting. The typical shock troops that Democrats have and the left has are the people who are out that are pro-Hamas, pro-Palestine right now and they don't like button. So like they're kind of lost in the mix right now. It's going to be interesting to see. They're surely not going to go vote for Biden. No. So they're going to lose that vote. Yeah. But dude, I don't think that's going to stop from cheating. No. They've already, I'm sure the plans are already in place to correct for that. But those are the ones that burned DC because remember, the insurrection didn't just happen in 2020. In 2016 when Trump won, they were burned in DC to the ground. And we don't talk about that at all. But those are those people that are out. Which was way worse. Way worse. Like actual violence, destruction everywhere. There was actually a run on glass when that happened. They couldn't replace the glass fast enough in DC and they had boards up forever because they were in enough companies making the large pains a glass to replace storefronts. Well, all it takes is for these people to experience a little bit of violence and they stop. Yeah. They don't, these are kids that never got their ass beat. It's all it is. Yeah. Yeah. It magically goes away. Guys, jumping on this conversation down in the comments, let us know what you guys think. With that being said, let's get to our third and final headline headline number three. Got to talk about it. This has not been one of more favorite stories that covered, but got to cover it nonetheless. This is actually coming from CNN, which I thought was interesting and they're reporting on this. So let's dive into it. Head on number three, reads what we know about the two Venezuelan men accused of killing 12 year old Jocelyn Nagare sitting in the article here. Let's dive into it. So 12 year old Jocelyn Nagare was walking to a convenience store in Houston when she disappeared to police say she was found dead in a creek earlier this month. Two undocumented men, I'm going to fact check that two illegal aliens, two illegal migrants, two illegal people who should not be in this country from Venezuela are accused of killing the girl and both are facing charges of capital murder in her death, according to the Houston Police Department, both are being held on a $10 million bond this week, what record show? Jocelyn's death shocked her family, leaving them heartbroken and wondering what her life would have been like. As they lay her to rest Thursday today when the show is being recorded. And it is also the latest case to bring immigration to the forefront as a critical issue. This election year is the two men were in the country illegally. Oh, finally, there's some truth from CNN, according to the US Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Here's what we know so far about the cases around Jocelyn's death. So against surveillance footage of the area obtained by detective showed the suspects at the restaurant together the evening of June 16th, Lieutenant Stephen Hope of the Houston Police Department said at a news conference after their arrest and then left on foot and were later seen meeting and talking with Jocelyn Hope said before all three walked to a convenience store. Now, what do we know about the accused men? By the way, they brutally raped, strangled and then dumped her body in a creek, seen and left that part out. So what we know about the accused men, Johan Jose Martinez Wrangle, who's 22 years old and Franklin, and Franklin Jose, Pinyaramos, who's 26, were arrested June 20. Three days after Jocelyn's strungled body was found in the creek, according to Houston Police Department, both men are from Venezuela and into the US illegally. That's been confirmed where and when they entered the country is unclear. The spokesperson said, but each had been apprehended near El Paso by US Border Patrol. Martinez Wrangle on March 14th of this year in Pinyaramos on May 28th and released with a notice to appear in court in the future. An attorney for Pinyaramos declined to comment and attorney for Martinez Wrangle did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Now what's been the reaction? Right? I feel like this is a nonpartisan case. It doesn't matter what side you're on. This is obviously fucked up and wrong. What is the knee-jerk reaction from these communist far left people? Let's see. First you got Mallorca, who is the Department of Homeland Security Secretary. He says that only the criminals are to blame for this. Not the Biden administration who lacks policies allows these cyber people to come in. Not his failure as a secretary. He says, quote, the individual who is responsible for heinous criminal act is the criminal. So that's his take on this. He said that a press conference from a Border Patrol aircraft hangar in Tucson, Arizona, 70 miles from the nearest border crossing, by the way. And then you got people in Texas, and this lady is a judge. Harris County judge, Lena Hildago, she blamed Trump for the brutal killing and rape of this 12 year old. Corrupt Harris County judge, Lena Hildago, Hildago completely brushed off the brutal killing and rape of a 12 year old girl by two early aliens. And put the blame on Trump. Here's the clip. It hurts even more that they're being used as pawns in this fight over immigration. That doesn't even exist because Biden and McConnell agree it's just that Trump won't let him move it forward. I'll do respect, Judge. You said this issue shouldn't be politicized, but by pointing the finger at former President Trump and Republicans in Congress, aren't you politicizing it? I think I answered the question. So yeah, I mean, this is about Jocelyn. This is about her family. And if we want to, as I said, talk about immigration. You didn't answer the question. Are you politicizing this by pointing the finger at Republicans and saying it's their fault, not the fault of the Biden administration that lifted the remain in Mexico policies? Again, the Biden administration reached an agreement with leader McConnell to address this, but this is not about immigration. I'm not going to feed into that. What? Yeah, she looks like she's on drugs or alcohol or in the Broadway cast of hairspray. Yeah, no, that too. Yeah, that's a, that's an end. Not anymore. Yeah, but it wasn't just her. It wasn't just her. Let's let's check in with this politician. This is you got summer Lee from Pittsburgh. This is representative summer Lee from Pittsburgh. Let's watch this clip. I'm not talking about the 12 year old girl in Houston that was on torture. I'm not even know who you are. I don't know who she is. I live in Pittsburgh. Okay, but there was a child who was killed. You don't know about the child that was killed by illegal immigrants. Did you see her face? Uh, yeah, like the face of disgust. Yeah, that's because she's a fucking terrible human being. Hey, you know, if she doesn't know about her because she's from Pittsburgh, how does she know about George Floyd? I don't know. How would you know anything outside of Pittsburgh? That's yeah, I'm not, I'm not a, I'm not a biologist. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know you. Why don't talk to strangers? This is your national Fox News reporter. She knows exactly who that. I mean, how do these people get elected other than cheating? Listen, dude. Uh, I, I don't even, I listen. I think we all know what needs to fucking happen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How though and, and, uh, Judge Harris County judge means that's the basically, these people have lost all respect for the citizens of this country. Correct. And they are, they are fucking terrible people. And also for some reason, they think that they're smarter when they're not like, of course they do. That's the same reason why people who go to Cornell or fucking Harvard think they're smarter than everybody. They're, you're fucking indoctrinated to a system. The, the, the amount of smarts you have is relevant to the amount of results that you produce in life. And these people, because they are congressmen and senators, they believe they have achieved the pinnacle of importance in their life. I went to Yale. Now I'm a senator. Right. I went to Harvard. Now I'm a, I'm a community activist, but I'm a, they're champions in their own fucking mind. Okay. That was a server. And now I represent my dish. Look how smart I am. Well, if you went from fucking bartender to, to congressman international celebrity, what would you think about yourself? You would think you're pretty fucking smart. You think you could hop around on stage and just yell a bunch of shit. That's right. That's right. That's right. But look at Corey Bush who's getting a blister right now. But like look at Corey Bush, bro, who was she before she was Corey? A piece of shit. Yeah. Broke fucking civil rights activists who are being evicted. Who fucking, the only reason she got any sort of notoriety is because of what happened with George, or I'm sorry, Michael Brown here. And she had a megaphone screamed into it like a crazy fucking dumbass. Mm-hm. And now she's making policy. Have you guys covered my favorite politician right now, Tiffany Hanyard? Have you seen Tiffany Hanyard? Oh, fuck. Are we covered? Which one is that? The mayor of Dalton, Illinois. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, she's my favorite of them all. Like she's the war and she'll probably end up in Congress. She'll represent, you know, like, uh, she's going to jail. She's going to, or Congress, one or the other. She should be in jail, but we'll see what happens. That lady fuck that. Oh, I'm not allowed to watch Tiffany Hanyard. Look dude, here's what's happened. Okay. They. This has been going on for a long time. All right. For the last up until 2020, for the last 10 years or so, we had the best economic situation that's ever existed in our lifetimes. People like me, the smartest people, the people who go out and build shit, create shit. We all went into business. We made a lot of money. All right. We didn't worry about the government. And during that time, they used all this, they did this on purpose. They used all of our, our us looking over here into our own lives, which is what we're supposed to do. And they filled the government and they filled society and culture with these ridiculous standards, you know, political correctness, cancel culture, the silent majority. Everybody gets a trophy, you know, tolerance. All of this shit while we're all doing this. And then, you know, before we know it, it's created this mountain of shit. And while we were off doing our lives, they filled the government with people who are literally the lowest IQ people on the planet and made them feel like they're very smart. And Soros came in and funded all these fucking people to go, like most of these people that are crazy, you do go back and look who their biggest donors are. It's fucking Soros, dude. So you have one guy pulling the strings in our entire country by putting people who are literally dumb as fuck who have nothing going on for them who will listen to someone who says, Hey, if you go do this job, I'll give you a whole bunch of money. So they're like, fuck it. I'll go do it. So they go do it. And now we end up with a bunch of dumbasses in our government who are either totally ignorant or totally corrupt, who don't give any shits about us. And there's, there needs to be a correction. Those fucking migrants should be put to death immediately. They don't deserve due process. I think they do processes for fucking citizens. They need to have, they need to have done to them what they did to the girl. I think I don't understand why every state doesn't have the death penalty for pedophiles. Period. Well, they're starting to do it. Yeah, they're starting to. Yeah. Yeah, I say, yeah, whatever exactly what happened, I heard these happen to them. No, correct. Worse. Yeah, worse. They raped her. They need to rape them with like a fucking baseball bat has spikes on it shit. Get a big black guy in there. No, dude. Man, I'm the guy for this. I'm sick as fuck. I will come up with the most painful, disgusting shit that people can't even watch so that it sets an example for people to not do these things. I know everybody doesn't have the stomach for that, but I assure you that I do. And it's probably a real, you know what, it's probably a really good thing that Trump is running and not someone like me. No real talk. Yeah. Cause like I'm fucking that guy. Like I am that dude. And he's not and people are making this guy seem like he's going to be that dude when he ain't going to be that dude. And what's going to end up happening is they're going to cause the rise of a whole bunch of the motherfuckers that they're afraid of because I'm going to tell you right now, dude, if I went in there, it would be cutting people's heads off like in a legitimate way on television. We would not have this shit happening. We would not have this crime. We would not have this corruption. We would have nothing. Like you know what the dudes doing down there in El Salvador. Okay. You know, like you built that mega prison. It's like 14 miles long and shit makes all the bro. I would line them fucking up. We put them in a guillotine and I'd fucking live stream it for as long as it takes every minute on the fucking minute for however many hours. No, seeing them delay. Yeah. It would just be all fucking day long, dude. And you know what would happen? Nobody would fuck around. Yeah. If they knew that was the consequence. Yes. Yeah. Public execution really is the only way to curb crime at this point. Like severe violent crime stuff like that. Yeah. It's the only way because we're happening for a long time up until like what 100 years ago. The problem is that it hasn't happened. It's so long people forgot. That's why this is what happens when people forget the act like they're acting now. You go to Singapore, bro. They can you for littering in public. They put that on TV. Yes. Okay. But if you go to Singapore, guess what? Streets are beautiful. No fucking crime. Perfect fucking streets. No litter. People have respect. Same thing in the Middle East. People will say, Oh, in the Middle East, they fucking cut your hand off. Yes. Don't steal. Yeah. That's why the shopkeepers can keep fucking gold and all that's right. That's right. That's right. In the market, I don't have to worry about that. That's right. Oh, they throw gay people off the tops of buildings. No, actually, they don't. They throw fucking pedophiles off the tops of buildings, which we should do here. Should do it here. Should actually I think we should build a building just for that. I think I'm plenty, man. Like that's the building. Pedophile tower. You're going to the tower. That's it. Yeah, man. Guys, jump in on their conversation. Let us know down in the comments. What you guys think? Would that be, let's get to our final segment of the show. As always, we have Thumbs Up. We're dumbest fuck this. We'll bring a headline and we talk about it. We'll get one of those two options. So with that big set, Thumbs Up or dumbest Fuck Headlined reads, Viral Hawk to a girl sells more than $65,000 in merch and a wake of not safe for work, social media fame. Capitalism. Capitalism, baby. Did you get one of those hats? No, I did not get one of those hats. I don't have the, I'm not allowed to. I'm sorry. And that's, I'm not sure what this meme is. It's my, yeah. So sex sales. If you watch the whole fucking interview, the whole interview, I've yet to fucking fun. She has like three more fucking like one last. Yes, it's pretty good. She's, she's our kind of people. She's the kind of people that has a couple of drinks, starts talking shit. She's cool. Yeah. So the young woman who shot to fame as the Hawk to a girl, thanks to an x-rated interview, it went even x-rated. It went on, man. It was a fucking joke. It wasn't even that bad. Yeah. She sold $65,000 worth of merchandise. Haley Welch went viral earlier this month when she shared her explicit thoughts on the oral sex during a woman on the street spot with Tim and DTV. And is now selling branded hatch through the Tennessee-based apparel company Fat Head Threads, according to the company's social media. The brand has already sold more than 2,000 Hawk to a 24 hats on a Jason Poteedy told Rolling Stone. At $37.78 per hat or $50 for a sold out signed version, the total comes to at least $65,000. Of course she hasn't gotten a dime from the first viral video that went out. Fatote said of Welch whom he claimed he has known for years. Quote nobody was asking permission for her to do nothing neither. I just wanted her to get some profit off of this deal. He said, come on, you were talking shit on the fucking, you know, this isn't, okay, you're not obligated to trade Mark fucking hot to a, right? People been doing that for years. Yeah. You know, the first person that's ever done that, that's why it was fucking funny. Right. But Welch is overwhelmed by her new founded fame and requested that Poteau not divulge any personal information about her or feature her face on the merch, the owner said, quote, a largest orders are usually 100 hats, maybe 150 to 250 shirts. This is way out of the normal for us, Poteau. He said, this is a small family on shop. We're all hands on deck right now. Here's a, here's the hat comes in many different variations and colors. There's a signature sign by, by, by, by, by Haley and, uh, she, I think she'll go down in the history books. I love her friend, her friends reaction. She's like, you didn't just say that shit. And then it's Haley with, uh, with, uh, Mr. Poteau. That's Santa. Hey, I love this shit. Yeah. I think she's fucking hilarious. I, these are the kind of people that I'm friends with, people who fucking talk major shit. I thought it was funny as fuck. I didn't even think it was like, like, X rated. No. Fuck you. No. I don't know. Nobody really, like, if you think that's X rated, right? Fuck. That's why I quit to really have to bark. Yeah, that's why I quit drinking. Yeah. Capitalism, man. Capitalism. I like it. I'm glad she's getting money off it because there are so many people selling those hats right now. Oh, really? There's actually, there isn't this jenky conservative company that started selling these hats and sent me. They were like, Hey, do you want to be an influencer to help us, uh, promote our new brand? And like, that was the hat they were selling. It's not even, they're not even giving her a cut of it. That's good. So like, if you're gonna buy the hat, make sure you get the hat from what is it put in the right things. Yeah. You're the right thing, man. Yeah. If you want to support that thing. Yeah. That's right. This is where you go. That's good. You know, she, she didn't turn it into an only fans, but she could have done very easily. Yeah. Yeah. But not that I would know what only fans has either. I'm sorry. Uh, but, uh, but, uh, it's, I mean, she's doing a lot of things. I'm not a very wholesome thing with it. Honestly, I, I'm for this. I thought it was wholesome too, bro, but I, I'm fucked up. I'd be compared to the shit we see today. It was wholesome. It was like old school, two year 2000 fucking fun. If you were back to like 2013 with the fucking cell phone, you would have caught me. No, motherfucker. You know, listen, you don't even know, dude. You don't even, Joe, you know what I'm talking about. You don't even know. You fucking people do not know how awesome life was with, when nobody had a camera. Yeah. People fucking party, bro. People had fun. Nobody gave a fuck. There was none of this shit. If you acted like an asshole, you got punched in the fucking mouth. If you were cool, we all laughed and we didn't care how crazy it was. Bro, it was 10,000 times more fun. And I feel sorry for you guys who have never lived in that life. Honestly, dude, if I'm going to president after I'm cutting heads off, I'm making fucking smartphones fucking go away. No cameras in the phone, no listening device. You could talk to people, you could text people. That's fucking it. Fuck you. You want to see the real world girls going wild on VHS and that's it. Dude, I don't know what that is either. Dude, listen, that was real shit. Like you'd be party and dude and like you'd see some titties. All I remember was a cinematics after dark. I had to hurry up and get to the end. Now all these kids drink coffee. Like they're 70. Oh, what's up the coffee shop? Also, I really like that I'm pretending that I had a wildlife like Andy at some point. No, not that I don't like coffee shops. Okay, I got good friends that have some really great coffee shops. And I'm just saying, man, go on, have a little fun. You fucking wild. Experience life. You're coffee in the morning. You're some shit that you're going to be ashamed of later. Like, for real. And don't videotape. Or if you do just own it and be like, yeah, fuck you. It was fun. Yep. Let me be political for a second. What she did a thousand times cleaner and more wholesome than anything I've seen from Pride stuff at the White House underbiting. Oh, that's a fact. Bro, did you see what they fucking did today? Yeah. Did you see that shit? They fucking painted the columns. The color of the rainbow. Probably not paint. It's probably fucking rap. It's a condom. Yeah. Dude, they took the cop. Like that's like total desecration of our culture. Also, that's like a little Lizzo play the fucking crystal flute. You know, like for real, man, it sounds like something she made her staff do on tour. Oh shit. Come here. I need to see you after the show. Yeah. Play this for me to play the crystal flute. I'm not a pro on the flag or whatever they have for these people, but I didn't realize that persons of color were separate, but equal on the pride flag. Did you know that? What? They have their own colors on there. So you have brown, black on there. The fucking flag. Listen, bro, the flag is everybody what white people? Yes. That's the fucking flag. Yeah. It's trans people. It's gay people. It's lesbian people. It's bisexual people. It's fucking black people. It's black people. It's people of color. And then it's no white people. That's it. Yeah. That's it. That's what the fucking flag is. The flag is no white people flag. Unless you're fucking gay. Yeah, right. Or you just don't exist because you're not binary. If we, bro, we got America flag. That's it. This shit, this shit here, like it's disgusting. Yeah. And by the way, all you gay people, you want to know why people are starting to fucking get pissed off at you? That's why. That's why. That's why. Okay. That's why. You wonder why the, you guys are feeling less safe. That's why. 10 years ago, your mother fuckers had it made. You had it made. You had all the rights of everybody else. Nobody gave a fuck. Everybody was cool. Everybody got along. You didn't, and now all of a sudden, you know, you're, you're persecuted everywhere. Well, maybe you're persecuted because you shove your shit down. You throw it every fucking place that we look at. Hold on, they're persecuted because I'm wearing a ranger's hat. This is the only team that doesn't have a pride day. Yeah. And they're very upset that how dare one major league team not have a pride day. The worst. That's that's suppression. Only 29 teams have a pride day. But not the rangers. Now, I, here's the thing I grew up in Baltimore. I spent time. You've been around the world too. New York, LA, all those places. I knew trans people. Bro, no one cared. Nobody cared. We lived our lives. We all just coexisted. It was a crazy thing. I still don't care. But I'm tired of the shit. I did when I spoke at, not to, not to do my own horn here, Andy, but I spoke at the Yale political union. I was very drunk when I showed up to that. And a trans kid there told me that my words were violence. And I went off. Well, that's another thing. There was a words. First of all, words are not violence. No. Okay. Violence is violence. And if you think words are violence, then we need to show you what violence is so that you understand the difference. Right. All right. Secondly, I saw this video of this woman who got kicked off the plane. Did you guys see that video? It came across it because she used the wrong approach. She had a little kid. Her mom was with her. Okay. And her elderly mom. And she got kicked off a United Airlines flight from misgendering one of the fucking, uh, them. What do they call them? She misgendered with them. The days. Okay. And they told her she might be banned from United. Well, I think the rest of us shouldn't fly United. Fuck United. Okay. And fuck any place that does that shit. All right. They told her she committed a hate crime. Why? Yes. I'm so tired of hearing this hate crime shit. You know what hate crime is? Hate crime is like almost like is like attacking someone. Yes. Physically for a reason. Like that's stabbing that happened in St. Louis last week. Did nobody talk about. Okay. That nobody talked about because why? Why didn't anyone talk about it? Didn't fit the narrative. Why didn't it fit the narrative? Because it was a black guy stabbing the stat of a white guy. Yeah. And fucking I go on the internet here locally and people are cheering it. It's disgusting. That's a hate crime. Can I just say well? That's a hate crime. But that's not being charged as a hate crime. But see it. No, motherfucker. Hate crimes. You can't commit a hate crime against a white person. No. You can only commit hate crimes against other people. You see what I'm saying? Like, brawmsick of this shit. It's fucked up. First of all, hate crime isn't words. You could be able to say, hey, fuck you. You fucking gay piece of shit. I fucking hate you. I hope you burn at the fucking stake. That is still not a hate crime. That's just bad fucking manners. That's just fucking you're a shitty person for saying that. Okay. That's not a hate crime. A hate crime would be them grabbing you saying the same thing while stabbing you in the fucking throat. Right. That's a fucking hate crime. Okay. Let's get straight on what a fucking hate crime is. A hate crime is not, you're a this or that. Those are sticks and stones break my bones. But words will never hurt me. See, that's something a lot of these pussy's never fucking heard in their life before. That's what I grew up as. Okay. I came to zones do hurt. I came home. I came home. And I said, hey, fuck, I'm getting picked on by people, you know, and, you know, well, tough shit. Yeah, grab a stick. Yeah. They surely didn't say, well, they didn't go to school and talk to the principal and say, hey, there's a fucking hate crime because they're calling my son fat. Right. They're fat phobic. Right. No, I was fat. I got made fun of. And guess what? Now I'm jacked and tan and juicy. You know why? Because they call me fat. You know why? Because shaming works. And he's got incredible meat sticks. Um, I just got the last time I'm going to hear that. I'm going to say that. While you have that picture pulled up, hit the, hit the button. Pull the picture up there. Um, that is, uh, that is straight pride for straight pride month. Hock tour. That's straight pride. Straight pride. You want to celebrate straight pride? You get a hot to us hat. Okay. Yeah, I got. I'm, I can dig it. I guess gay people could do that too. But yeah, that's true. I'll figure some, some, some gay to do. Yeah. Hock tour. Fuckin' ruin in it. Hey, if gay people could do it, maybe we could find something common. Maybe we could fucking unite. Everybody gives blow jobs. That's right. Or get some. Or get some. Well, no, no. Actually, Lesbian's don't give blow jobs. I just thought about that. Sorry, I, I don't know about these. Maybe not everybody can unite. But yeah, we'll figure it out. But bro, look, man, this shit's ridiculous. And like I, I like that gay people are speaking up against it. Like you know, many gay people I see that are like, do fuck this rainbow shit. I ain't with these motherfuckers. Yeah. Like that one club I sent you. Yeah, they're all, bro, all the normal gay people. I hate that fucking gay. Yeah. Bro, all the gay people I personally know in real life, like when they see me, they're like, bro, thank you for speaking the fuck up. Like this is ridiculous shit. We are not part of this crazy shit. We don't believe in this shit either. We don't want to be around kids. I don't know why these motherfuckers want to be around kids. They're ruining it for all of us. That's what I hear from every gay person I know. Like for real. Yeah. Yeah, well thumbs up to Haley. Yeah. Spit on that thing. You keep doing that. Yeah. All right. Well, guys, any team, that's all I got. Well, Tim, thanks for stopping in, bro. Thanks for having me. What are you guys coming up that you need to tell people about? Nothing. I'm doing a, no, I'm sorry. I look great, Britain news. You can go follow me on social media. But look, I just love, look, I'm all about the healthy lifestyle now. I've been, I've lost 35 pounds of fat. Yeah. Stop weighing myself because I've gained so much muscle. I'm not used to it and I still have that body just more of a thing. We all go through. It was a way. It's hard to get rid of the worst. I still look in the mirror and I'm like, God, you fat fuck. That's me. No, and like, and I'm down from when I was here. But look, I just want to thank my trainer, Kyle Skroggins and Joe and Tammy Selensky, who I run in there. Iron Dan, yeah. I'm going to tell you what, bro, you can't, you can't look like a bitch wearing some iron den shit. That's a fact. And, and look, they have the gym. They have Lou Ferigno's old equipment. Really? They literally have all his equipment from when he was the hawk. And so like, I work out on like collectibles, which you know, make sense. That's why you look like the hawk. Wow. I look like I'm in between there. I'm a little movie still, but we're going to get, and we're going to take care of that problem. You're in a mini hawk. I am. I'm getting there. One day, I hope to look like you and have my own meat stick products. You've been giving out the meat stick on your own, right? Right. It smells like cheddar. And it's great. Don't worry, bro. Hey, man. I've seen you. Thanks for coming in. Thanks, man. Guys, EJ, don't be a hawk. Sure, sure. We're from sleeping on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck up, bro. Fuck up, stole.
