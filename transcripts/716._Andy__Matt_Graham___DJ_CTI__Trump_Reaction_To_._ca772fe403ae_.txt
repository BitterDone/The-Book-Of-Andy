He's a strong healthy healthy happy baby, and you know, we're chilling So it's awesome, man. I love it. Well congratulations on that appreciate it. Yeah So what's up, dude? Yeah, man, you know, it's it is memorial day. Yeah, today is the memorial day where the show is recorded and you know It never ceases to amaze me man, you know that you know the days that you know you think would be you know major You know laser to focus You know and what you would think would be the normal reaction I guess from medium what they would want you to focus and see about It's not really it, you know, so we're not I'm not even I don't even want to go into it You know you search memorial day celebrations. These are the top headlines that pop up You know nothing about what it's supposed to be about right and it's what they want you to think and what they want you to hear These are headlines about Donald Trump of course top three headlines when you search memorial day on Google This is what they want to talk about yeah Eric Trump slam for particularly disgusting memorial day weekend post What was that nothing what he post a shitty hotdog When I'm chilly dogs like a fucking I think he posted a meme which he didn't even post on Memorial Day It's like it's just dumb stuff Trump attacks Biden hush money judge and Memorial Day post human scum Well, he's not wrong. It's not You know, like that's what they want you to focus on not not on what the what we really should be focusing on Um, you know my Memorial Day. I know more of the hits close for you Andy um You know with with your grandfather served Served our country, you know, and I understand too like the the the layout I guess and and the narrative on You know these generational wars we've had you know it's changed. I guess in recent years, right? But um You're still yet there you know, there's a reason for this day. We did we take time to to appreciate those Who have gave it made the ultimate sacrifice? I mean, I think it's just disgusting that you still haven't met him that decides to try to go off of low hanging fruit You know, but Yeah, you know, I don't just kind of annoy him, but um Well, I mean, it's gotten worse and worse as the years have gone by you know when you have Kamala Harris saying enjoy the long weekend Right, you know, and you know people I saw a story today where some uh The director of the Alaska national parks made the construction crew that was working inside the park remove their American flags off of their equipment And like you know, we got all these people in here that are so fucking woke They don't understand like bro, if you really feel that way about this country get the fuck out of here. Yeah, that's how I feel fuck you and On another note, you know, it's frustrating. You know as I've gotten older You know as DJ mentioned, you know my dad's biological dad was killed He fought on Utah Beach on D day and then six months later. He was killed to the day. So December 6th um and As I learn more about our history and both sides of history and Some of the narratives they've used to bring us to war it it really you know It really makes me fucking angry Like it makes me angry to see these Cemetery's like Arlington and Jefferson barracks here in St. Louis That are just miles of dead young men and women Who were sent to wars Under false pretenses, you know about freedom and democracy when in reality It's about money and it's about greed and The older I get The the matter I get about that, you know what I mean? Um And it doesn't mean I respect what happened any less or respect the people who made those sacrifices any less I mean those are the bravest people of this country and I have real sacrifice that's right They were fighting for the right reason correct. That's right and and we all believe that you know We believed it I grew up believing it. They believed it and we were willing to fight As a country for those ideals but When you start to realize that those ideals weren't the actually those ideals It's it's infuriating dude and to look at like you know thousands of headstones of young men that had futures and families and To know that it was just some disgusting politicians that decided they wanted to you know get the war machine go on or they wanted to Make some money or there was backdoor deals about who would get this and that to send these you know young men and women to die It's infuriating to me. It's sick me. Yeah, and uh You know, I don't want that to sound the wrong way like Because like dude, you know the whole reason I do what I do and speak out the way I speak It would be much easier for me to just talk about business and success like I did before we had real AF You know a lot of people that are real AF listeners you guys didn't know that I had a number one podcast on business before real AF called MFCO project And it would have been easy for me to continue to talk about that and talk about making money I like those things. I like business. I like making money. I like kicking ass. I like people improving their lives I like people creating lives, but the main reason that I ever started speaking out About what I saw going on was because of What happened to my grandfather, you know Dian as a young man Leak never meeting my dad, you know what I'm saying never never growing up and seeing my dad grow up or seeing what you know, Sal and I have done and It's just uh, you know if he can if he can go over there and die for at 20 years old We could fucking speak up, you know what I'm saying and like dude. I just I don't know man like The older I get the more the more The more pissed off I get about what what has been done to our generations of men in this country to be honest That's real shit man. Yeah, jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. Let us know What you guys? What you guys think we shouldn't be fighting these wars for these fucking tyrants. That's basically the bottom line Yep, we should they should be thrown in the fucking in a fucking pit And fuck you, you know if we didn't have There's about two thousand people globally that fuck it up for everybody else And and those people honestly the minute we all figure that out We can fucking deal with those people and we have peace and harmony in this fucking and not even even just here in this country But globally and the fucking world. Yeah. Yeah Yeah, let us know guys with that being said man We do got a we do got some interesting stuff to talk about we got some trolling we got a handle Oh, dude, and uh, all right And uh, we get to see some trolling too, which is always fun. Yeah, um guys remember if you want to see any of these headlines videos articles Links go to any for sell at a comedy we link them all therefore you guys with that being said. Let's give it to our first headline Um, let's see some trolling Uh Orange man He I think he has perfected the art of trolling. I think he just tells what he thinks is the truth Yeah, and like it's impressive. I know is this store is this the libertarian? It is okay. I love that it is the libertarian thing. So yeah, so and then I love how MSM and left leaning news to try to spin it But uh, this is CNN's headline watch Trump react to getting booed at libertarian convention Uh, which doesn't paint the whole picture, but I do got the clip of this interaction. Let's let's check this out That's nice Oh Only if you want to win Only if you want to win. Maybe you don't want to win Maybe you don't want to win Thank you, DeRoy Thank you. No, only do that if you want to win if you want to lose don't do that Keep getting your 3% every four years The reasons for doing so So he was talking about you. He was telling him like you guys need to vote Republican vote for me put me on the ballot You know, I'm saying now about birds. All right, you know do that if you want to win Otherwise, just stick with your 3% or 4% like He's not wrong. I'll give you that. He's not wrong. It's statistical fact. Yeah, he's not wrong They don't and you know why they only get 3 or 4% every year. I do yeah, it's because they do shit like this Who they just chose as their libertarian party presidential nominee? Is openly gave former Obama support to chase Oliver This guy Who they just they just selected you know, and it's like and it's not the main reason right there's a lot of listen I like libertarians Dave Smith we've had him on the show great guy super smart day super smart guy The my issue with libertarians and why I feel like they don't succeed is because It's too much one. I think the whole thing is all it's just a big contrarian movement. I'll be honest with you Well, like there's nothing you can do that's kind of 100% satisfy anything and this like well, we need zero government Well, that's not really realistic But there's a lot of just very unrealistic things that I feel like needle like they just need a couple of whiteboard sessions to really like Figure some shit out and it might be all right You know, but I know this doesn't help right, but yes, so they they just selected this guy Chase Oliver who's an openly gay farmer supporter of former president Barack Obama Now they picked him to be the libertarian party's presidential nominee For this upcoming election and he won the vote by like a 60% I believe he got um You know, I don't know. I mean Looks a little weird, but I mean look dude. I don't give a shit that he's gay. That doesn't bother me I don't fucking care about that. You don't like the Obama part. I don't like that um a lot of people though for being honest You know like in 2008 You know, I I wanted Obama to do well. It was very inspiring. He ran an inspiring campaign. I fucking knew it What no, I didn't vote for him. Yeah. No, fuck no. I actually broke we mean this girl. I was dating broke up over it Oh really? Yeah, oh shit. Yeah, but uh, because she loved Obama and I fucking couldn't stand how fucking stupid she was You know, so about it. She wasn't stupid other ways, but I was definitely questioning it. Yeah for sure um but Here's the problem I have with the libertarians is they are a contrary movement at the base like they're very hard to get They they lack organization and they lack the ability to get cohesively aligned because they all want to pretend and compete About who's smarter and who's more intellectual and who can make better points Which is actually a fucking progressive or a liberal way to kind of operate Um, they lack strong leadership dude. They know this guy's not a fucking leader like this guy might be smart He might have good policy, but he's not gonna cohesively be able to to unify people and get him going He's not strong. I can tell I seem to speak. I've seen him talk. It's just it's just reality and yes some of their Some of the way they think is unreasonable and it wouldn't work some realistic and even if it would work Okay, let's say they're right The idea is so far out there that not enough people like Trump said only three percent of people can accept or even understand how it could work So if you can't present an idea For the average American to understand how it will work How can you win at all you can't win. It's basic marketing like You know if you can't sell the American people on why you know having Virtually no government will work which they can't How do you gonna get people to vote for you ever if you don't have a strong leadership that makes people feel inspired about the future of the country That paints a picture of what things could be and how things could be and how things should be How are you going to get people aligned and that's the problem I see with the libertarian party? I actually identify with most of the things they talk about um Not everything obviously, but this is freedom. That's what freedoms about. I don't agree with everything And I think that's another problem with the libertarian party is that they understand That freedom means you're not going to Accept everybody else's way of life and I think that's a good thing But that's a very hard thing to Sort of corral and move forward as a collective movement in this time in this day and age In any day age like that that's like it's it's it's it's like okay Here's first form right for I just use this company for an example We have a lot of people who are aligned right they train they're healthy. They're in a personal development They're good people they care about the community They they are trying to move forward in a coach a specific cultural direction Now if all of those people had different viewpoints Okay, and one some of the people wanted to go play video games and eat Doritos and drink alcohol every day And some of the people wanted to go smoke crack But they all believed in you know Something like we want the world to be better. How do I create a movement out of that? You can't because there's not any unifying core values And that's the problem with the libertarian party At its base that none of them have been able to identify quite honestly Because none of them have led anybody to do fucking anything and they haven't built anything So they need someone who's built shit whose led people who understands culture and understands direction To strategically create a movement inside of their movement Otherwise, they are gonna only get 3% because you're gonna get all the people who are like yeah no government chaos and arki And you know like the country and shit where it's like well actually Literally yeah, you know and that's the problems I see with it. What do you think? Yeah, I mean people mistake Trump for being Unintelligent because he's simple But the reason that he's popular and has a lot of momentum is because he's simple Like most people the average person reads at a sixth grade level And like you can't have a movement that requires a lot of intelligence or a lot of like forward thinking in order to Build a mass movement But libertarianism is a is a flawed way of thinking because it's really just a precursor to liberalism It's really just like you know liberal liberalism with without a few steps like you just do whatever you want It's the same messaging. It's just me. It's just like Instead of we can only do what we want meaning like the LGBTQ people and the the right wing people They can't do what they want that's liberalism. We can do what we want you can't whereas libertarianism is just Everybody can do whatever they want and I fundamentally don't believe that you can build a civilization on you can do whatever you want or anybody can do whatever Without a very without some sort of cultural values if you are everything you are nothing right and so you need to have You need to have a structure you need to have Guidelines and parameters in order to exist and be anything that's different than just complete chaos Well, there's got to be some lines right like 100% like where do you got do you libertarians agree that um Drag queens should be showing their balls to kids and strip teases and they're spending their preschools Oh, well people are free to do what they want well No, because you can't have a functioning society with certain boundaries crossed. Yeah. Yeah, so now that's what I agree with you Dude, I think that's correct. This is why the whole religion Debate like as as it pertains to its influence on politics is is hard to discuss because People will argue while you can't you can't legislate morality Well to a certain degree we do because we all agree murders wrong Why do we agree murders wrong but not other things are wrong because that's just where we decide the draw the line So for people that say that you can't have religion or or certain conservative-ish values Uh, influence politics or or the way we live our lives here in America lawfully It's it's it's it's false logic because we already do that we just draw the line somewhere else Then you would prefer that we draw it mm-hmm. So You know, we do need a structure. We need definitely more of a structure than we have what does that look like? I don't know. I'm not a legislator, but what I do know is that We do need to I hate to use the word enforce morality, but we do need to We do need to set a standard for morality and set a standard for what behaviors are okay and what behaviors aren't And both liberalism and libertarianism. I think get it wrong Yeah, I think that that's that's like the fundamental like foundation of any civilized society Is where the people get together We all see something that we don't like right like I mean fuck back in horse and you know buggy days, right? Like I mean you can't just go speeding through on your fucking horse people like hey that's dangerous We got to have something in place to where we don't get ran over by fucking John in this cart You know, I'm sorry we we agree on certain things in society and those things As society moves forward they evolve with society right now we have stop signs and red lights so people don't just run through those And hey, guess what if you violate that there are repercussions you get tickets or you got a you know I'm saying like there's things in place and so you can't just say you know Living let live and have a laissez faire society because it's that's how we got here That's how we're here, right? We we all of us who have a certain agreeable Moral standard and core values what we call common sense We have allowed the the current environment to manifest by Taking the high road and turning the other cheek and saying well as long as you're not bothered me Do whatever you want But now we've seen what that creates and so there does have to be some agreed upon common sense Civilized value system in place and I never thought about it like what you just said dude That's a that's a very very strong point well, and it's it's interesting too because America's really an interesting experiment because Throughout history Countries were divided along religious lines, you know, you'd have Israel, you know Jewish country you have this one. It's a Muslim country Christian country whatever now you have kind of a melting pot as we've been told you know Growing up that America's the melting pot. It's like well That's never happened before and so when you when you mix a bunch of people together In in a place where we all don't agree on morality. What do you expect to happen conflict? And so how do we rectify that? How do we reconcile the fact that that we Don't agree on what morality is like We're never going to fully agree because everyone subscribes to a different thing You know, morality is largely subjective in this country. You have Christians that believe the Christian that you even have Christians that believe totally different things within Christianity and Muslims and believe different things Jewish people believe different things and then atheist believe different things So it's like how do you how do you choose what America buys by because it has to abide by something? Well, we have two choices. There's two there's two choices one choice is all of us get together and say this is allowed This is not allowed how it should be this is okay This is not okay, and I'm talking about Muslims Christians Jews You know, whatever all of us that are going to inhabit this country. We say okay murder is wrong molesting kids is wrong pedophilia is wrong Taxes are wrong, okay, we're gonna throw that in there too. All right And we can do that or We can have violence and the majority of the people can kill the rest of the people Which is what has happened throughout history over and over again? And that's where we're headed right now We're headed there right now because we're unable to have a civilized conversation Or get anything agreed upon and what's scary and what what is interesting to me is that it's the people who are least equipped to deal with violence Who are leading us down the road of violence? Okay, it is people who cannot fight they are weak. They are sickly. They are not socially Normal, okay, and we're allowing the tail to wag the dog and lead us down this path of chaotic violence That you know at this point may or may not be avoidable You know if we can create some sort of unity this year I think which I think is happening. I think that's starting to happen. We're starting to see people Who are Muslim and black and and white and all these different cultures sort of figure out like oh, yeah We're remembering hey, we're America and that's beautiful, dude. That's what the fuck. It's all about That's what I love calling something gay is coming back like we can talk about whatever we want now like yeah I saw Elon Musk make make some joke that five years ago. Yeah, not do people are worn out by the fuck 100% like walking around on egg shells like no and that I think it's almost the point that's unifying everybody People are tired of walking around on egg shells. They're tired of being screamed at by little nerds who couldn't do that in person Right, they're tired of being told by middle class You know middle upper class white women that their oppressors and colonizers shut the fuck up And that's where everybody's at shut the fuck up about to press you and yeah, and that's and dude It's great because that's where you need to be America cannot be America without fuck you That is the truth because to have freedom you have to have fuck you All right, you have to be able to Say I don't like what you do and then say fuck you That's what fucking freedom is so you can't have it without that You know what I'm saying you cannot do it without that and we're starting to get back to that and that's a healthy thing Hey, you don't like what I'm doing. Huh, I don't give a shit And that's that that feels good that feels a lot better than saying oh, man If I tell them if I tell a joke that you know The happens to involve gay people or black people or I make fun of white people for not seasoning their food like bro Fuck off. We don't care anymore. No one cares. No one cares We're all out here in the real world. We're getting along. You're on the internet. You're in a fantasy land You don't even leave your fucking mom's basement. You've everything paid for your whole life You're an Ivy League school, which we've all figured out the dumbest mother fuckers in the world come from So fuck off. Yeah, well, I think one of the things through to your point any that's helping move this uh move this this uh movement of of unity further Um is the the blatant hypocrisy that we're seeing in the world right like in this country specifically right and like you know Just here's one. I mean we've showed countless of examples of this stuff Um, but here's an update for you guys Um, this is pertaining to the to the trump trump trial run on a new york city not sure if you guys saw this um, but in a very wild unprecedented ruling um the judge Just instructed the jury that they do not have to unanimously agree on what crime trump actually Committed allegedly. This is like listen You talk about I think you know the the the scales of justice everybody seeing that that little statue right you got lady Just is holding the two scales bro. She dropped them bitches be like it like our legal system bro Well, this is this is this is what happens in communism bro. It is does it well it is or it isn't It is or it isn't it depends on what happens here, but this is what communism does communism finds The man and then finds the crime not has the crime and then Cuses of the appropriate person. So that's what they're doing with trump. There's this guy Find something on him and they haven't found anything on him So now the judge is taking a step further and said You guys can victim on anything. We need a conviction whatever you want yeah, and like there There was a total of like four charges or four possible charges that you know They presented them where the judge did throw out one so there's three right so you got a room a full of jurors And and basically what the what the judge just told them is that hey if you believe he's guilty of crime a You can believe he's guilty of crime be you can believe he's guilty of crime see you know out of all of you guys As long as you guys think he's guilty of one of those that's it Like in what world in this one And what world yeah, but this come this comes from us This is our fault We're the ones for the last 15 years 20 years we fucking said oh that's okay whatever man Like oh your kid gets a 15th place trophy. Oh whatever man Oh, we're gonna remove the pledge of allegiance. Uh whatever Oh, you know can't say this or that even though it's true uh And that's what's gotten us here bro We did it to ourselves and now we're in a situation where we are at a tipping point We're at a point where we're going to find out which direction the country is gonna go I at this point the way I see it I don't think there's any way that there's anything they can do besides flip the game table over and cause mass cash And what I mean by that is turn the power off turn the internet off for an extended period of time Have some sort of mass violence which I like I said Months ago is gonna be between the migrants and the citizens this summer that's coming um I I don't think they can win anymore. I don't I don't I think the momentum is too strong And it's only gaining for Trump like it's every single day we see more and more and more and more and more people who even four years ago We're like fuck down on Trump coming out and saying I'm trying to go saying fuck that's what I'm saying dude 100,000 people in the box bro And did you see the diversity of the group bro it was black white Hispanic Porta-Rican like it was fucking everybody. It was awesome even on CNN. They said Uh one of the women was said well, you know It really looked like America Well, that's cuz it is mother fucker you guys living this fucking white liberal nonsense bubble with all the pc black people who are racist as fuck And there's like two groups of people that live up there in the fucking tower and they hate everybody else and there Here's what I can't understand How do they not see what they're doing to themselves? Because dude that judge if he if this dude gets back in power, which he probably will unless they do something crazy That judge is gonna fucking go to jail forever Is he should yeah, he should now. Yeah, I mean he shouldn't you should now he should go to the gallows But the only concern that I have with all this Trump stuff and I really try not to focus too much on this Yes, I like Trump. Yes, I will vote for Trump But there's too much stock in Trump Like the very same the very same way that the liberals are obsessed with Donald Trump So are the Republicans? Well, I think there's a segment of the Republicans I think I think it I would I would push back on that a little bit I think there are people that look at him like the Messiah and then I think there's a whole bunch of more people They're like fuck he's the best we got right here's the best option true. I agree with it true But okay, Trump then what You will find an argument for me there, right? Like like people aren't activated people have no agency like there's nobody There's nobody after Trump like let's say they convict him then what where we at Well, I mean, I think that's a fair that's a fair question, right? You have to we have to put our eggs in well That's why people we need to be gearing up for 2028 right now. Yes, you know the leaders the the next round of leaders In my opinion should be guys in their mid to mid 40s to mid 50s not fucking 80 years old And I we see those people coming around you know I'm saying but No, I agree and nobody should be worship like that like nobody not Obama not not Trump not anybody like these are politicians Do they're here to serve and and I actually think the group that worships Trump gives the entire Trump base A stigma that that is hard to shake You know because if you say like what you just said like You know, I'm gonna vote for Trump people like oh you fucking Trump dick sucker like no, dude I don't want to fucking lose our mother fucking country There's plenty of things that Donald Trump was done. I don't agree with plenty But if you think I'm voting for this fucking idiot you're crazy, right Right dude and most of the people owners like like if you go up to him and you ask him You know who you're gonna vote for and and they say I'm gonna vote I hate Joe Biden. I'm a vote for him because he's better in the alternative Those people don't understand what we're dealing with this is not politics is usual this is not And this in this case here this court case is a prime example of that. This is not that's not normal No, that's nothing about that is yeah like dude and and more and more people are waking up to this like Democrats are waking up They're like fuck dude. This actually is communism And this is this is a communist revolution that we are living through right now And it's undetermined who's gonna come out on top But if we as American citizens do not stand up and do not unite and do not say fuck you They will win and we will become a communist country and we will be in deep shit right now The way the country is right today. It already is communist because That shit couldn't happen in America. What's happening down Trump? And this is happening. It's not going to happen. This is happening Right when the FBI raids marlago and it comes out that they Staged the photographs and they put tap secret file on top of shit that wasn't tap secret And then they posted to the internet that is communism bro That is hey, that's it that's political persecution Okay, and the reason that Trump keeps saying Presence need immunity presence need immunity is not for whom no that's right It isn't for him. They don't people are not understanding this They think it's for him But it's not for him He's saying this to be on record so that when he gets back in power He could say I told you and now you're fucked And dude if you read Trump like there's this book by by Trump You and by the way, I don't care what you think of Trump You should read every book that you have a wrote because they're fucking great For especially for business But he wrote this book called Think Big and Kick Ass An entire chapter and think big and kick ass is about when people fuck with you You fucking back ten times harder like there's a whole chapter on it. So like He writes a book about how he does things So like if you think he's gonna get back in power and just like let these dudes do whatever bro There's no way he's gonna bury him 100% man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments Let us know what you guys think of that being said.

You know how strong it is. You know whether or not it's gonna You know generally speaking whether or not it's gonna hit you with a tornado. It's just like I'm here motherfucker Yeah, yeah, they just come out of nowhere y'all Yeah, dude, the shit's been crazy man. We we have we lost our power to you man It's just been like and it was like just crazy It is crazy. What do y'all do when there's no power What do we what do we do? Yeah, I don't know where I didn't sleep. I stopped like shit. I did too because it was hot hot right and It's just fucking hot. I got to sleep with a fan on yeah, you know, I'm saying we got like a big big boy stuff Yeah, bro, I know what that's about fan put put the AC on me bro I still I still do the big boy stuff when I say but it's only where I can you know I'm saying and It was hot, you know, I'm saying my balls are sticking to my thighs. Yeah bring your back doesn't it To what Never mind He listened if anybody I ain't having no bad jokes. I'm passing them a back day Why don't think you've told in me. I think you're I'm alright. Yeah, I mean listen We still got a lot of show left, but uh quick. Don't we gonna try but uh Now I've been like I mean these storms have been fucking insane. They have been insane I don't know what that is about, but we appreciate that RPM freak will uh Try to try to stay safe and trust the science of tornadoes Um We got another comment here. Let's uh, I promise a little trolling action. I see it. So this comment comes from at Jamie Gill Blah blah blah clown don't worry rich people don't pay taxes Republicans have made sure of that So apparently people are not understanding your your stance on tag and I've seen a few comments like this They're like oh, but I don't pay 40% of the income taxes. Yeah, nobody you know, that's that's not it's not just income taxes You're talking about um, but mr. Jamie Gill here um this guy Uh, this is him All right, I'm not even playing this nice cleavage bro Nice douche stash. I actually think his mustache all right mustache. It's got a little swag. I give credit I I would not let him around my kids Well Would you like him a magic? You're saying I wouldn't let anybody around me period. I don't I saw why people I don't mind the mustache the cleavage it's really not the mustache is doing for me. It's the earring Yeah, they're doing it's a cleavage Anyway Well, I'm gonna we can address this rich people don't pay taxes. Well, what's your definition of rich people? Okay, because the way that they want you to believe is they want you to believe people like me are the rich people that don't pay taxes You know, the ones that come up in the community and build companies and employ their communities, you know with hundreds of jobs locally Those people pay taxes the ones that sponsor your fucking tea ball team and your kids football team and they you know rebuild the neighborhoods and you know all the shit We do they clean them up, you know those people pay a lot of tax a fucking lot Taxes even do that. Yeah The rich people you're referring to Jamie are people like Jeff Bezos and people like at the very very top who are worth 50 plus billion dollars whose tax liability is literally zero because they grease the palms of the politicians in Washington DC All right, they they make sure they don't pay taxes They use every loophole possible So when the Democrats say rich people they want you to think about people like me or other entrepreneurs that you see driving a nice car up And down the street that you're like looking at rich motherfucker, which is a fault of your own Which is probably why you're not rich, but Ah That's the trick there the trick is when they talk about rich people They make you think they're talking about your local entrepreneur when in reality It's the people at the very very very very top that don't pay any tax at all Um, so that's you know That's cool blah blah blah Like I don't know that's You know Republicans made sure of that What that's not a Republican that's not even a republic. Why do all those people? I think why does every person that's worth fucking 20 billion dollars or more vote Democrat right? Why is that you think that's because the Republicans Bro, brother when chump caught it out when he was doing the debate with Hillary, huh? You remember when chump caught it called that out when he was doing the debate with Hillary he He was like, you know, she talks about these taxes, you know, all these taxes like she's not doing it for the same reason I wouldn't do is because all of her donors use the exact same tax flu polls that I do You know, I'm saying like they all use it like I mean there like this this idea that it's a one-sided like you know only one side Like bro Nancy Pelosi Do you know how much she's fucking worth you know, I mean taxes she pays yeah, well the hold on none So so the other thing is you said we got other comments saying what I don't pay 40% tax no people was like Yeah, people saying that they didn't pay for the fuck you don't right you don't know how to do math What do you pay when you go to the store? What do you pay at the end of the year on your house? What do you pay fucking when you get gas? What do you pay whenever you buy alcohol or cigarettes? Okay, add all that shit up Add all that all of that up And then tell me you don't pay 40% because every fucking American in this fucking country that pays tax pays more than that In fact most of them pay more than 50% in their income. So we we have no problem if you're too dumb to do math Or understand what I'm saying. I can't help you bro I can I can fucking lead you to the well. I can't force you to drink But you are paying more than that and the and the people who do create the jobs the people who do sponsor your kids fucking teams and all this shit and build the neighborhoods and you know Give charity and fucking feed the homeless and all this shit the shit that we do I do our company does our companies do Those people pay the most tax Amazon ain't fucking sponsoring your team. They're not they're not on the street cleaning it up They're not out here fucking taking care of the community those people don't pay shit. No So yeah, so Jamie I can I can appreciate your attempt to troll but You know if you you could call me a clown all you want especially if I'm wearing a fucking wrestling singlet in my fucking burp while big Fucking nerd Oh fuck I mean dude you're just uninformed, bro. That's all it is. Yeah, and then I think that's the other part of it You mean like it's so intentional. That shit is left out of our school system left out and so people are like Like well, listen this guy's just repeating shit that his fucking union buddies are repeating for his whole life I would bet that guy works a union job has been told this entire life that Republicans are shit and Democrat why are all the union guys voting for Trump this year? Because they're starting to figure out they've been lied to the Democrat is not the party of the working class It is not it hasn't been ever they just pretend to be Yeah, that's real shit man. Yeah, Jamie I mean who's fucking spells Jamie like that. It's fucking weird I had to give something I look man. I mean It didn't bother me. I'm getting called a clown by a dude literally literally wearing a fucking wrestling singer Okay, so it is what it is guys. We appreciate you man. We appreciate you guys for being real-ass fans. It's gotta be hard to be celibate We appreciate you guys keep locking keep commenting and keep sharing the show on a more interestingly serious note. We got headline number two headline number two reads mysterious shooting outside army special forces residents in North Carolina Raises questions now. This is a very very very weird topic Weird story come out of North Carolina But apparently it's one that's been happening quite often And we might even have some personal knowledge of this. Oh dude. That's that this is that thing. Yeah, dude. This is crazy All right cool. Yeah, so let's dive into this So the Fox News article reading a mysterious shooting in North Carolina north of Fort Liberty formerly Fort Bragg Not far from where some of America's most elite US special operation forces live and train Is under investigation by the army criminal investigation division as well as local police The shooting in Carthage North Carolina occurred May 3 at 815 p.m. Following a phone call about a suspected trust passer Near a special forces soldiers property To Chachin men who spoke broken English were found near the soldiers home The family alleges the suspected intruder 35-year-old Ramzan derave of Chicago was taking photos of their children When confronted near a power line and they would it part of the property An altercation in suit and derave was shot several times at close range a second man The Josh the two five Also of Chicago also of Chicago Yeah, because there's lots of the dodgy coughs Asselands and fucking Chicago. I know like 12 of them. Yeah, it's a second time Named AK-47 Oh, you thought that was funny. Oh god did yeah, that was a go Was in a was in a vehicle some distance from the incident And what's questioned by authorities and then released the more county sheriff's office is leading the investigation the FBI Had told Fox News quote a law enforcement partners at the more county sheriff's office contacted the FBI after a shooting death in Carthage I special agent met with investigators and provided a linguist to assist with a language barrier for interviews sheriff Ronnie Fields said in the statement quote The caller indicated that an individual was observed taking photographs on the property and had become aggressive towards a resident outside their home The deceased was found approximately 250 yards from the roadway along a power line on the residential property Denification was not initially found on the rise however His identity was later confirmed through family members and an international identification Located in his vehicle the shooter has been identified as a colonel with the US Army who resided at the location of the shooting US special operation soldiers around the country have experienced strange interactions in recent years That they say Involves the spacious surveillance of them and their families many believe that US military bases may have become an increasing target Um a foreign probes Um now again, this is this has been going on now in a separate incident this happened about 18 months ago um in more county Um, there was another mysterious shooting attack uh that targeted two electrical distribution substations that left about 40,000 residents most of whom are in military or special operations communities without power for almost two weeks um and uh There was an investigation that You did nothing very very suspicious um, you know, and this also comes right at the end before we get into discussions about this This comes right right before a US Navy commander Has just come out and uh and said that Russian and Chinese nationals are trying to enter US Navy bases in America every single week Um, he just did an interview on Fox News. Here's the clip some of them just crossed the border. What's going on? Well, you know, this thing of our military bases getting penetrated by foreign nationals It's happening more and more Yeah, this is something we see probably two or three times a week where we're stopping these folks at the gate Uh with a week Yeah, a week at least and this is just Navy alone Where we're seeing folks try to come in and usually the cover story is and uh, I'm a student you know I'm here. I'm an enthusiast. I want to see the ships that type of thing we have to turn them around and typically we get NCIS involved with those and we get biometrics when possible But yes, there's been enough taking that do they have passports? Do they have a lot of times? I have a papers they have papers. Yes, uh, but there in no way shape or form authorized to be on our base And it's really hard for us to tell the underlying motor for these type of cases. Wow. That's that's stunning It is it's got to be a concern. This is Russian Chinese It's comes from all all these different nations. We're seeing an uptick in it In addition to that there's been some reporting in this over the last six months. You're getting too worth Yes, so that comes from Admiral Darrell Coddle who is a commander for US fleet forces command Um, so you got all of this stuff happening man Do we get anything on this guys? I do I do they're missing the mark on what this actually is Hmm, what do you think? Well I'm no uh, I'm no chess master, but you know just looking at the board as being played out the biggest threat to The people in power would be those in special forces. No, um, so So Targeting them would probably be a good idea No Um, that's just what I'm inferring from this I mean if I was If I got them taking pictures of the kids that's leverage. Yeah. Hey, we'll kill you fucking family If I'm the bad guy that does bad things I'm going to target our most capable and strong and most skill that violence individuals and uh You know do as many bad things to them as I possibly can yeah Yeah All right, so uh, I have experience with this just gonna say that um As you guys know we've talked about this a number of times on the show. I have full security detail Um Because I deal with crazy fucking people all the time And usually it's harmless stuff usually it's People who are having some sort of manic episode or the They think I'm talking to them through the podcast personally or some shit And They show up and you know We got to turn away and then they don't go away. So they end up going to Psych evaluation stuff like that However, there have been a few instances where there was real threats and There was a time Uh, what would you say about a year and a half ago, right? June 2022. Yeah, so almost two years So two years ago June 2022 um We had a guy who Pulled up to my gate. I live in a gated community and there's two gates I have a gate to get into my community have a gate to get to my house Somehow he had made it into the gate to my community and was at the gate in the front gate at my house And he was driving a van and it was a shitty van He was dressed in a full cable Outfit as a cable guy I Started walking up my driveway Parked his van at the bottom of the hill couldn't get in the gate started walking up my driveway Clearly didn't know that we had security on the property Runs into the security on the property They obviously are like they take this very seriously like if you come to my house Bro, you're probably gonna get something shoved in your face. You don't like an an a dick, okay It's after yeah, yeah, that's after uh That's a picture for you. Yeah, so pulls up in this van here Um comes on the property meets the security team We started taking pictures. Yeah, he was taking pictures of the property taking pictures of the property Security team says hey, what are you doing? He says in a Russian accent or Ukrainian accent Very broken English. He says oh, I'm here to fix the cable They're like you have any ID. He's like no, and they're like okay, well you gotta go and he didn't want to go No, you got real real like very Like it was calmly assertive, but like he wasn't leaving he wasn't he didn't want to leave yeah even with the security team there right so things happened and he ended up leaving and uh With our Capabilities without saying too much we have the ability to know Who came from where and where they came from By just getting a picture of their license plate which we were able to do And we were able to figure out that this guy had driven directly from California To a cash-only motel in North St. Louis to my house After he was turned away he drove back to California directly So he came from California to my house for a specific reason and then once he didn't get to do whatever he was there to do He went back there and What you guys need to understand is that you watch these movies and you think That the FBI or the the fucking whoever the three-letter agencies are when the government wants to fuck with you You think that they send like their operatives to fuck with you. That's not what they do they hire criminals To come fuck with you and we've had a number of those as well And that wasn't the only one we've had a fireball we've had other ones But this story that happened to me is almost identical to what happened there very identical. Yeah I broke it English some you know, so um It was weird because I had those guys here from the censorship coalition. Yeah, so you guys know my page got deleted There's these guys that have a a censorship coalition that they've put together which we're gonna talk more about I'm probably gonna have them on the show But they were aware of my page got deleted and they understood that it was political targeting And they actually flew here last week to meet with me to get all the details so that it could be Given to representative Jim Jordan and Eric Schmidt and the guys that are fighting censorship in Washington And there's a very good chance that I might actually go to Capitol Hill on this but They flew here and I was telling it were you there when I told him the story? I think I was out the room So DJ was in the most of the meeting But I told him this story and I could tell one of the guys would like just met these guys one of the guys was like Like I could tell he thought I was full of shit And was so funny because this story came out that night and I texted to him and I said this is exactly what the fuck they did to me And so like dude, this is how these people operate they don't operate like you think they do they don't come in with their suits and ties Like it's the fucking matrix and say mr. Anderson you're fucking don't do this. That's not what they do they hire criminals To harass you and fuck with you and probably murder you in some case. I said that's where it starts. Yeah, yeah, and So that's what I see this as I see this as them gathering intel or intentionally Looking to harm that person's family and um Yeah, so that's what it is. It's not some random Chechens fucking with these dudes. It's not some foreign government fucking with these dudes either It's our government fucking with our own fucking special forces and American patriots Uh, in our country. That's what's happening 100% yeah, I see it the same way like I mean, you know I'm I like to be a very practical person when it comes to stuff like this, you know But it's like you know and we've had like you said a few situations where it's like well like that other one where we got the fucking gate jammed Yeah, yeah, and you backlogged and see where I want you know, I'm saying it's what's like you know But like you know typically, you know, you like to believe that the simple answer is always the like that's always what it is Whatever the simple is decision like that. That's it right. That's the answer You know, and like I try to abide by that for the most part, but like dude like a lot of times man the shit just doesn't it makes Zero sense and there is no simple answer and so then you start opening doors and this door leads you down to the hallway Then there's three more doors and you open up that door and there's five more doors, right? It's just this never ending Web of bullshit man, and it all leads back to one place, you know, and so Could they be doing this to get leverage 100% right 100% you're you're a strong your special forces operator You know, next thing, you know, you get a manela envelopes into you picture your kids, right? You know, I'm saying you you're probably a little cautious about what you want to say or do yeah, you know I'm saying like how do we know that you know this kernel? How do we know he wasn't you know a grassroots? You know, Patriot. Patriot. I'm sure he is a patriot. That's you know Most of the people that are in the military join because they're patriots and up until 2021 when they kicked them all the fuck out over this vaccine shit, right Right, you know, I'm saying so maybe he was having too many, you know, what do you thought were closed to a conversation There is a closed door conversation. There's no such thing, you know, and this this veil of Pobbacy that we think we have as Americans it doesn't exist. Well, that's a whole another problem It's a whole another problem you guys are being monitored in your own home. You don't even realize it. Yeah, they're recording everything You have an Alexa system in your house that recording everything you say if you have a cell phone within fucking distance of hearing your voice They're recording everything you say if you have a television with a camera or a computer with a camera They're recording everything you fucking say and not just when they want to all the time That's what people don't understand right and it all goes on a data stream Which is stored and fucking Germany that is real shit There is an entire backup of the internet that is stored in Germany that has every email every phone call every picture Every text conversation every voice conversation that has ever been fucking had ever Is stored how do you think they come out with this shit Randomly years with these clips of incriminating audio This isn't like oh they decided to record the conversation no they go find it So like dude, this is how they leverage the world. This is how they blackmail the world Into doing what the fuck they get it to do well you guys saw that ditty video right Him abusing that girl. Yeah, that happened what eight years ago. Yeah, where was that this entire time? Well, that's because he was useful to them exactly and he's no longer useful to them Yeah, but they don't need you no more that would just they got you Yeah, because then if he comes out That's their way of preventing him to come out and say hey, this is what these fuckers did to me No, and they discredit him by making it you know, and by the way obviously he's a shitbag But they discredit him first before he has a chance to say anything Yeah, I mean so this very well could be an example That's why you have that's why we do this the truth is this This is why we have to get over cancel culture because at any fucking time in any situation Every single fucking human in the history of earth that is currently alive These motherfuckers you have done something that you don't want people to know you have a pain point You have a pressure point there's something that you did or said or that you're not proud of that you don't want people to know And they know that and so we have to get over that as society and get to the realization of we're all compromised We're all fucking compromised by these people so like It is what the fuck it is you're not perfect. I'm not perfect You're not perfect you guys aren't perfect listen. They're unifying too. Dude. That's what I'm saying Hey fuck if we all see each other's dicks and ain't no big deal, right? You know, I'm saying like this is a little small Yeah, you don't have to say it like that's where we got to get to we got to get to the point where it's like well Fuck it. You know as long as it's not like crazy shit like you're fucking molesting kids or some shit, right? You know, but I think that's a dangerous part of it too, man Well, and I and I to your point too like you know, even if you feel like you don't have something do you have kids? Do you know I'm saying everybody is gonna have a pressure point, but I think this also lends to you know to the it to to this next phase of I think You know this turn humanity's taken in with all this AI shit You know, I'm saying so now we're at a point now where it's like they're blurring the lines of what's even real Bro, I've seen a ton or a rett dude. I've seen legitimate Voice mixes of myself for motivation that are on the internet that shit No shit that I did not say that they took my voice They made a motivational real out of it and I watched it. I'm like, when did I say that? And I'm like wait, that sounds a little bit off. I'm like holy fuck damn They're doing that already dude. There's a million and rotate videos that are AI. Yeah. Yeah Yeah, and it's improved a lot in the last year. Well imagine five years down the road A year ago was choppy you could tell now it's like it sounds real dude. There's real Rogan there's fake Rogan clips No, this is the part is gonna get you. That's what we have access to right imagine what imagine what they've had access to the last 20 years Exactly, that's my point man. That's my point You know, sorry dude, it's Gary shit dude listen a lot of it I don't know how you fuck it's like putting toothpaste back in the tube How do you fucking fix it? How do you go backwards after the shit's already out? You know, it's well, I think that's that's an unrealistic expectation I think everybody needs to just get on the same page with as well. There is no going back Yeah, what do we do now? How do we move past this? How do we remedy whatever we we're not we're not going 20-20 We're never going back to We're not well. We could if we killed all those people it would never it would still never be the same man because you're Society is going to win when when When the repercussions of it would still be better if we did that it's gonna be better for sure But it won't be the same. You know, I'm saying like we like bro. No, it'll be better It would be much better, but you know, I'm saying like but there's going like the damages that there's gonna like bro There's to get this shit back together. It's gonna be some dark days and a lot There's gonna be people that won't be okay with that. That's fine But nobody's gonna be able to forget it either you don't seem like it's gonna be some real shit that happens to move this Shifford, you know, so it'll be interesting to see how that goes man guys jump in on this conversation Down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think About the situation over in North Carolina with that being said Let's get to our third and final headline we're gonna have on number three Um surprise surprise Joe Biden Joe Biden makes surprise nighttime visit to hunters X Hayley Biden Days before she testifies and first son's gun trial Now this is this is interesting This is interesting. All right, so so we got we got uh this is a new york post article reading uh President Biden made a surprise nighttime visit to the Delaware home of Hayley Biden on Sunday Just before she's due to serve one of the most important witnesses Um at first son hunter Biden's federal trial for alleged gun gun crimes Biden stopped by Hayley's home around 8 p.m. For a brief private talk eight days before the 54-year-old first son's trial Is scheduled to stand trial Beginning June 3rd Hayley dated hunter at the time of his alleged gun crimes and is one of a dozen expected witnesses prosecutors the ledge Uh, how to lie about his drug use on gun purchase forms and then briefly illegally possessed at least one weapon Which Hayley disposed of in a public dumpster in 2018 the White House did not disclose the reason for the president's brief visit around 8 p.m Although many commentators noted that uh noted the awkward optics due to the looming trial the visit came Four days before the anniversary of Bose death now that's what they're trying to say because Hayley also dated the other son who passed away um back in 2016 I believe um So he's facing the possibility of of prison time um in his first two scheduled criminal trials He's also on trial for another case uh in in Los Angeles um the starts in September for allegedly failing to pay more than 1.4 million dollars in federal taxes Uh from 2016 to 2019 um now this Obviously, I think I'll just even look at it. It sounds a little fishy, right? It's a little I mean This is witness tampering very minimal. Okay. Um, it's out of the it's out of the norm. Shouldn't happen and not to mention He doesn't visit her at all You know what I'm saying? So you just magically want to show up to To go see your estranged extra order in law days before okay weird um, but here But here's the bigger story that nobody's talking about um that's not the only Off the book visits that Biden has been having there's another one that just came out this headline reads Joe and Hunter Biden Used a visit to Sandy Hook Memorial service To set up secret meat with Chinese over 10 million a year deal new emails reveal Uh, so Hunter Biden used Joe Biden's appearance at a Sandy Hook Memorial service. You know the school Yeah, that was shot up there. They have Memorial Services every year Hunter Biden used that event Just arrange a secret meeting between his dad and his Chinese business partners as new text reveal the message Uh comes uh from a fresh tranch of documents released by congress on Wednesday given to them by IRS agents who investigated the first son On December 12th, 2017 hunter wrote on the Chinese messaging app we check to Lou Yadong a top executive at Chinese oil giant cfc to arrange a meeting with his father Um, where's the proof? Here's the proof Uh quote can you meet this evening early my father will be in New York also and he wants to Me to attend the Sandy Hook Memorial service with him and I would like him to meet you along with my uncle And then you and I can talk let me know if that works I'm sorry for the late notice I got off the red eye in Baltimore from LA and take a little nap before I got this message uh to which the response from Lou was quote no problem Please let me know where and when to meet Thanks so you know all this stuff about gun violence the sons has a gun charge and these motherfuckers use Memorial service That they they love to use the tau gun safety. I mean the irony in all of us um, but they use the memorial service to set up an Arrangement for these uh these off the book quid pro quo bribes Andy guys, what do we got on this? Well I mean, it's just more evidence that these people are obviously compromised By China, you know, and I know that meeting. I think we all know what happened at that meeting with The X is basically she probably was threatened Then if you say this is what's gonna happen to you. That's how these people operate that you know Joe Biden's you know these people are don't fuck with the Biden's like that's how they operate they operate like a They think they're a mafia family. Yeah, they do and there are a bunch of fucking pussies. That's the problem the co-kids Yeah, surprise that it and send a little chetchen person to handle it Dude, I'm sick of them acting like there's some badass mother fuckers bro You guys are much fucking nerds. Your dad can't even talk. He's stupid as fuck Okay, you guys fucking rape the United States as hard as possible You're probably the biggest reason this pieces of shit that have lived in our country in the last fucking hundred years With Obama, okay, like you're nobody likes you nobody respects you. You've cheated to get in an office You ruin You've ruined the country like bro people hate you guys like Your dad it is what it is. I mean People that voted for you hate you So I you know this is more evidence and they're stupid like why would you send the president of the United States to handle this when Witness tampering situation like as if his every move is not tracked and it wouldn't get up to the public like yeah Well, it shows you how important it is to him. Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna go myself. I'm the guys of Like here's the thing like I mean like I said that you know people try to oh well He went there to comfort her on the anniversary of her ex-husband's death. Listen bro. I have to she wouldn't fuck your other son I don't think she really you know, I'm saying like I'm not buying it. Well, I'm not buying it Nobody's buying it nobody's buying nobody's buying it people are going along with it because he's the president Okay, but like do look their times coming Their times coming dude. There's too many people that know what's going on There's too many people to recognize what's going on There's too many people that understand that these people have taken tons of money from different interest groups especially China to make decisions that are not the interests of the American people people are waking up to that they understand that and You know, I think these people are gonna try to cheat again Or they're gonna try to flip the game table over because they believe that they're still fooling people Like they believe that when they go up there and say the shit that they say like when Joe Biden goes on stage and says By nobics is working They believe people are believing that and then they act confused as to why their poll numbers are going down like They're prosecuting Trump for all this crazy shit. They they have Joe Biden's authorizing the use of deadly force on a more loggerade for fucking what for papers, right? Like Do these people are out of control? They're out of fucking control and they need to be fucking dealt with and really do if we had a military that was totally intact That was honoring the fucking oath that they take these people would already be in jail You guys would have already arrested them. That's the truth and everybody I've talked to in the military Personally, they all agree and you know what they say well my heart the higher ups the higher ups Well, eventually, you know what the higher ups are part of it So as certain point in time the the common person the common people the sheriff's departments the police departments the military The the fucking good people in the three letter agencies you guys all got to get together and say this is fucking crazy Like uphold your oath because they're not doing it. They're just not And the evidence is overwhelming man bro. I hate the smother fucker like I hate seen as fucking face Like that crooked-ass smile that he always does and like dude the guy shitness pants everywhere he goes I mean look at this picture like dude. He's just an angry old fucking douchebag. Do you hear him? He spoke at West Point graduation When he said did you see that video? Oh, okay, shall I play it real quick? Give me one second. I mean the fact that this dude has has even like it's an embarrassment to our country dude like legit I mean he's the really only person that can be controlled and puppeteer the way that he is do know every single thing that he does Every single talk that he does every single question and answer session every single public appearance is completely controlled environment. Yeah, he said pause dude. There's a hand selected crowd hand selected Questions he is prepped on the questions. He is prepped on the answers like this guy is a complete figurehead for I think Obama the entire of 100% the entire thing is theater. It's just all made out everything's fake all the journalists in there are there for a reason Yeah, and you got Trump going around you know in front of crowds that are booing them own in the whole crowd Right, you know what in the making like dumb yeah, this is what Biden does when he gets into a front of a crowd This is a man West Pointes graduation President Joe Biden Nobody's Sounds like there's like five things. Thank you. Never forget America's the strongest when we lead not only by our example of our power But by the power of our example Dude, well if you guys hate him so bad and you don't believe what he's saying and you know these committing all these crimes Why the fuck are you not doing anything about it? That is the point of the military in this fucking country bro That is the point you protect us from outside and inside right now we're fucked inside Well We'll see. Yeah, I was jumping on this conversation think of all think of all the damage That's been done in the last four years that could have been avoided had people just taken the election integrity issue Seriously and weren't allowed to be bullied in the line. You know, I'm saying yeah like bro That remember remember oh, so you're an election deny? Yes 100% Yes, they fucking cheated like how hard is that to say but these pussy's out here won't fucking say it Oh those those are unfounded if that's unfounded then why is all this information coming out in Georgia right? Why is all this information coming out in Arizona? Why is all this shit About dominion being connected to fucking Canada being connected to a back of stand fucking coming out These motherfuckers were cheating. They cheated. That's why the fuck nobody shows up for them They knew they were gonna cheat. They cheated. They didn't parade Biden around and do tours They had him in his fucking basement for two years like I don't understand how like it was because it's because this you know CNN headline says it was no There was there was no evidence because it mess in BC says there was no evidence just like they said the you know Mask work and vaccines were safe and to trust the science. It's people It's it's low-occupied people that just don't repast the headlines and they take that on the surface value and keep it moving I think a big part of it is people Would rather not know than know because if you actually Live than a reality where you were completely lied to all the time and you basically everything that you looked at on the news was just fake and they were stealing elections and Basically everything's made up That's a much harder reality to face than just like Living your life is normal like imagine imagine everyone like I forget who said it on the podcast, but like Imagine everyone knowing like that's For a normal NPC person like that's hard to deal with like You know us here. We've gone down the rabbit holes and like we've over time figured it out But imagine if the if the if the curtain was just brought up It's like hey everything that you believe is fake. It's like that's mind-breaking for people So it's just easier to instead of figure out if that's true. Just be like nah you guys are crazy Yeah, you're crazy. Yeah, yeah, there's no chance. There's no chance That's too ridiculous. They're stealing elections. No way. No way not here in America. Right of course I think there's also some fear too because it's like you know that that unveils the the truth that you have to do something about 100% exactly The fucking bench there. That's what they're afraid of man. I get like dude It is scary to think that like you know we are the 1776 you know 23 24 30 year olds that are changing and leading you know drastic global change like that I don't know. I think that's exciting. I think there's an excitement to that Thousand percent why why how the fuck would you be afraid of that? Bro Do you know how many people have lived in their life never had a chance to be relevant? Like here we are on Memorial Day talking about this. Okay Most people live their entire lives without any chance to be historically relevant And we have a chance here in America as young men and women to make a real difference in the future of this country That's not something to be afraid of that is something to get excited about our decisions our actions The way we live the way we handle what's going on right now matters and it matters a lot And we shouldn't be afraid of that we should be excited about that and say dude I have the ability through my actions through my words through my example to make a change in this country and its future Nobody gets to do that That is a very rare opportunity and we have it right now and if we instead of looking at this and saying man That's scary. We said dude. This is awesome We could actually create the best America that's ever ever existed if we stand up right now And do what we know to be the right thing and the true thing and stand for what we believe To me that's exciting as fuck. We're the most important generation of men and women in this country since the founding days correct And there's all this talk of purpose in like the personal development space like everyone asked like how do I find my purpose? It's like It's literally right in front of you like you Don't get to just pick your purpose Sometimes the purpose is imposed upon you based on your environment like here We are in a situation where the country's burning Civilization is on the verge of collapse and you have the opportunity to do something about it Are you gonna do it? Are you gonna fulfill that purpose? There's a whole lot of purpose there just waiting for you to to embark on it And it's just whether or not you choose to do it There's never been a bigger purpose ever Then right now for everybody like when these people say this well, how do I find my purpose? What are you talking about dude The world is on fire There is mass Criminal behavior happening mass oppression and not the way they tell you it's happening And not just the black people Dude, we have more of an opportunity to make a change than our parents did Than our grandparents did then our great-grandparents did and yes I'm including the people who fought World War II What we have the ability to do now matters more than that because if we don't stop what's happening now There is no coming back We will have a world government of communist countries that they call you know a global Unity which isn't global at all There's no there's no national identity. There's no national pride. There's no real Cultural race anymore because they're trying to create a one race Like dude, it's it's it's fucking scary and dude that's gonna lead that's gonna lead to wars with countries like Russia and China and Iran and the Middle Eastern countries which are Which are not going to accept Globalization at all. They're not gonna give up their national identity. You see what I'm saying So we're in a situation where what we do here in this country because what we do here in this country is going to dictate the outcome for many of the other countries because we're the only country that's actually armed yep So so people say well why does it matter what we do? Well, fuck bro if we don't win Australia is gonna die Fucking Canada is gonna die fucking Europe's gonna die and if we win none of that will happen So it's very important what happens here and people who live here you guys listen to this show You have to get engaged in this you have to get involved in this you have to use your voice You have to speak truth and if you don't your kids will grow up and be fucking slaves.

That's been around for 25 years I'm really that bitch and I show y'all how to not give a fuck and I'm gonna keep on showing you how to not give a fuck oh Lizzo bitch No Here's the interesting thing so Lizzo has become Publicly become one of the most everybody knows how who you are nobody can you block out the fucking sun bro We all see you we see everywhere we look yeah, but here's the thing so she's you know supposedly supposed to be leading this body body positivity movement um However last year former backup dancers for the singer filed a lawsuit that accused her of fat shaving them Along with allegations of sexual harassment and creating a hostile work environment dude didn't they accuse her of like making them put bananas in their pussy Yeah, yeah Yeah, wouldn't that the thing yeah, yeah, yeah, that was definitely well You know she'll be dead they didn't complain about that listen wrote she listen people like this don't live long They just don't they don't they don't you how many people do you see that they're that big that are fucking 50 years old No, you don't she's like grimace It's a fuck listen, hold on You People don't understand she's made she was selected She was made for a reason In the reason that she has made is exactly What they're making fun of on South Park Okay, they are trying to get you to not give a fuck about How healthy you are because when you're not healthy and you get fat you got to consume more of their drugs You're consuming more of their food you're consuming more of their subscription data You're making them money. Oh, and by the way you don't live very long, which is what they want All right, so she thinks that she's doing something and that she was selected She's good enough to be a star and blah blah blah blah blah You wouldn't a bit of star 20 years ago You want nobody would have because you are fucking huge and you're not attractive look at and that's fine I'm just being honest and her music sucks. Yeah, well dude And then they let her play the fucking crystal flute to demoralize and defile the country's history She is a part of the demoralization process and she is too stupid to understand that you are a puppet You are a clown and she's thinking like oh, I'm fucking I'm the best there is and I'm that bitch doesn't give a fuck no, dude You were installed you were selected by the people who run all this shit to be a figurehead for demoralization Okay, and this is why when we talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion it actually is Okay, you have to be fit you have to be intelligent you have to make money you have to be good to your neighbor You have to set a good example these are requirements That we have as American citizens this is the reason that other people died and other people sacrifice their lives So that you would live a life worthy of that sacrifice and everything that America stands for is based upon upon that principle so when we have Lizzo out there in front of the world claiming body positivity and we have 400 pound fitness models on the cover of healthy living or whatever or cosmopolitan or whatever they put them on Saying this is healthy and we all know it's not healthy and then you have fat activists on tick-tock dying by the dozens all right Baker's does Bro this listen this is part of the agenda that is it All right, and she doesn't understand that because she wants to believe that she's a superstar And I showed all these people no dude you're hurting people You're teaching people to be fat fucks and lazy fucks You're teaching people to be exactly what the fuck they want people to be which is fat stupid lazy sick Unintelligent poor so that they're easy to control and that's what she's teaching people how to do Yeah, I mean the entire world's on Lizzo basically, you know just Lowering their standards in every way shape and form it's like you can either Bend reality to fit your choices or bend your choices to fit reality and a lot of people choose to bend reality to fit Their choices they would rather get fat and say that fat's being okay And name name your thing all the people that say that that are broke say Money is not everything they change the rules of the game to fit Their choices to justify them rather than saying I fucked up. Yeah, it's much harder to have the humility to say I made the wrong choice This is actually the way it should be this is where the bar should be and I'm falling short of that but instead they say Fuck that bar. This is where it should be yeah, and That's what Lizzo is yeah Yeah, man, so we'll be giving this guys I think it should went harder on her. I think so too. Yeah, they could they could have definitely I just think her reaction was so cheesy, dude Oh, and that bitch like bro stop with this bad bitch. She's all of them.
