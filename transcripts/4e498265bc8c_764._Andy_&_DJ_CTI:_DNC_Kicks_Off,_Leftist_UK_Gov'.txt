Good job. Yeah We're doing live. Yeah, oh no, man. Let's jump into these. We'll try to cover as much as we possibly can With the day with that being said man. I wanted to bring up an icon. I think this is this is cool to see I guess back on the books Mike Tyson Mike Tyson and Jake Paul they're back at it right so there was some I guess there was like a health scare that happened with Mike and Apparently he's back at it. So Mike Tyson is 58 years old and coming off of a health scare Of course the postponement of his return to the ring the boxer once considered the most dangerous man in the world Could be putting himself in danger by putting the gloves on again. I think that's I think that's a little much there I think he's putting other people in danger. I've agreed. I got to think I think he's fine Yeah, he was quick to respond Sunday when asked why he was going through with his bout against shake Paul quote because I can Who else can do it but me who else is is he going to fight to make this happen Tyson said Emotions toward the crowd at a packed press conference where fans cheered the former heavyweight champion and booed Paul Quote we've just got to listen to the facts. We've got a youtuber fighting the greatest fighter that ever lived You're a youtuber That's right. I am but they had a little square up man. I got a little clip here. Check this out Michelle They can't even make it serious Mike Tyson's too friendly, man Oh How do you not love Mike Tyson? There's such a good guy Such a good guy. I mean, how do you not love the dude like the guys going through his life? He's made all the mistakes you could fucking make all of them and here he is a 60 years old Smiling having a good time. You know what I'm saying moving. Yeah, man. It's just hard not to like him The crowd did have an issue with the Jake Paul though And there was a very interesting reaction that Jake had to the crowd Where he called New York dumbass democratic city at the press conference. Yeah, while he was getting booed check this out Hey, man, I'm a kid from Ohio. Hey, New York shut the fuck up New York. Hey boo yourselves New York New York New York New York You're just like Mike Tyson you were good 20 years ago. Fuck you New York dumbass democratic city Bro, that's awesome great. He ain't wrong. I mean fact check it now I will say I think in Mike Tyson game full gas you're gonna have his hands full bro For sure, but Jake do Jackson solid guy man bro. Listen. I tell people this all the time I tell you guys this all the time Jake's a real athlete. He's a real fucking boxer He trains harder than fucking anybody and if you're somebody who has basic athletic ability which he's not a good athlete He's a great athlete if you have somebody who's intelligent which he's hyper intelligent and you have somebody who's willing to put in the work There's gonna be no stop in him So people can hate on him all they want but the dude's gonna continue to go up and up and up and up and up and up and up and eventually He's gonna leverage all of this you know exhibition about into the real thing He's gonna be the biggest fucking fighter in the face of the fucking earth and I I Guarantee you that happens a guarantee that happens. I know Jake I've known since he was fucking 17 years old the guy is relentless. He's fucking relentless and people don't give him enough credit No, they don't man, but then on the other hand and he's a good fucking dude. Yeah, that's a that's a character Yeah, and I'm not trying to fucking fuck up your game Jake, but like I people deserve to know he's a great fucking dude Yeah, yeah, but on the other hand man, you got you got this fucking legend here, bro Mm-hmm, and like I don't I don't know if like you know the king of the jungle is ready to submit to the new the new cub You know I'm saying you know, I don't think it's gonna happen. That's why they fight to fight I don't think it's gonna happen, man. I think I think I think it'll win in a draw. You think so? Is that the only reasonable ending here? Because of my Tyson loses Jake Paul that fucks up his whole legacy. That's fuck up a lot if Jake Paul loses to my Tyson You lost it's what my Tyson bro. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? It's yeah, it's a lose lose for Jake. It's a win win for Jake Yeah, and not a win for Mike now so like I and dude I think he's having a good time with it. I'm sure they're gonna make a lot of money a lot of people are gonna be entertained You know it'll give everybody a reason to get together and fucking hang out watch fights like we used to back in the day I Think it's awesome and I think it's awesome what Jake's doing a lot of you fuckers give him a bunch of shit for this young man for going out and creating his own lane Doing what I think is you know, it's entertaining as fuck you everybody said oh he's fucking this or that bro go fight him then Right go fucking get a ring with him then you fucking fat motherfucker You're fucking 45 years old your fat as fucking you're talking about you whoop jet calls that Jake Paul kill you right right?

We got headline number one Got a cover. Let's head up to Chicago. I'm just saying our new graphics on the show are fucking money who made us My dad didn't make them. No, it wasn't my dad probably one of our interns. I think it was like a new kid or something. Yeah That's way above my my dad's fucking standards bruh skills standards I'm about to get choked out Let's head up to Chicago though. We got to check in we got the DNC happening right now as we speak today recording It's day two. Oh, let's come to the DNC man. So it's day two while we recorded and You know, we just had day one yesterday Let's just give a little 10,000 for view what's been happening Got a shit ton of businesses are boarding themselves up Because of the protest has been estimated about a hundred thousand people have shown up just the protest There's more people outside protesting than they are inside watching Well, hold on how much okay? Are we gonna talk about that the crowd and stuff? Mm-hmm, or am I gonna talk about that whenever it's my turn to talk do you have that in there which part? Well the part where every conservative influencer is on TV and on the internet the last fucking two days making fun of their interior crowd because they watch some fucking knucklehead On on the internet take a picture of the event an hour before it fucking started and they're saying yeah They're saying do you have that in the show? No, I'm okay because I want to address that real quick for you into this Yeah, a lot of you guys are fucking dumb as shit Okay, I watched it and I didn't watch it on Fox News I watched it on the other networks on their networks. It was fucking packed It not only was it packed it was highly energetic a thousand times more energy than the fucking RNC And if you want to know the truth the speeches that they gave were a thousand times better now they might have been lying We all know they're fucking lying through their fucking faces But the quality of speakers and the quality of speeches and the quality of energy that we're in that room Fucking destroyed what they had at Trump's RNC and I see all the fucking Trump, you know Dick suckers on the internet which bro. I'm voting for Trump. There's no secret about that. But all the cultists Putting out information saying Ha ha ha look how empty it was bro. It wasn't empty you guys are full of shit And the reason that that you guys lose elections over and over and over again is because your message is Look how stupid the left is look how fucking look how shitty they are and you want to dunk on them instead of getting your shit together To figure out how to actually win an election, okay? It was packed It was fucking good and you mother fuckers should be scared and you should be scared enough to go out and get Every single person that you know to go to the voting booth with you and if you do not do that you will fucking lose You will lose America will lose that is the fucking truth these people are organized They have energy they have fucking commitment from their people and if we don't fucking stand up and do What we know how to do they will fucking win all right and I'm telling you these people are overconfident They're full shit and they're gonna get their face fucking smacked whenever the election comes around because they're underestimating who who who who were against that's the truth No, that's real shit man That's real shit they put that information out you think that's helpful You think that's helpful information to say to people hey look how fucking shitty they are and then and then people don't go vote They don't get engaged. They don't want to fucking participate. Yeah, what do you guys fucking morons? Like dude the conservatives are not for the conservative side of the aisle is just as bad as the fucking left It's real bro. That's real You know, but there are having some issues at the DNC protest being one of those there's been like last yesterday day one they were behind schedule about like an hour and a half Like Biden it didn't get all that get dealt with the speech until like well after midnight Eastern time But there's definitely been some issues. There's been protests nonstop protests was organized by the Freedom Road Socialist Organization Saying quote we're going to send a strong message to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden that we will not allow genocide in Palestine We stand with the Palestinian people and we're proud to be here today to march on the DNC a member of the group said earlier in the day Here's a quick clip from those protests I Wasn't the only weird thing that was going on. I guess I mean real talk that didn't they wasn't violent They were just marching down the street and that clip. Yeah, they give violent. They did a little bit Yeah, they were they were busing down some of the barrier fences they put up you should like that people pulling out I don't mind people protests. They don't fuck shit up. Yeah, that's American It's sure right to do. Yeah, but if you start fucking shit up, you should get fucked up That's a little bit different I agree Now here was something that I did see that I was that was definitely weird. I mean this is like Leftist are fucking weird these progressives are weird. Oh shit to the point Did you see that they brought in mobile abortion trucks, giving out IUDs abortions and free vasectomies. Mm-hmm. Yeah, did you see Hillary Clinton speech? About fucking Kamala. No, so Hillary Clinton stood up and I washed them all I washed them top to bottom AOC gave a fucking great speech. Mm-hmm. Totally wrong and misaligned with her back like these people are Great fucking their great-lilers. They're great activists. They are great activists. They're full of shit AOC gave a tremendous speech Hillary Clinton gave a great speech if she wasn't full of shit Mm-hmm, right and her like it was laughable What I'm talking about is the delivery of the speech like I'm a speaker so I notice that thing Those people are skilled at speaking their RNC does not have many people like that No, they got a bunch of old crusty fuxx Manate you you dumbasses need to get some people like me up on the stage to rally these motherfuckers about America You won't do it though because I don't wear your fucking white pants and kiss the fucking ring Okay, but you need to get some enthusiasm in your side of the table because they have it I promise you that it's one thing you can everybody they get Hillary Clinton got up there and said Kamala cares about the family. She cares about children. She cares about the family unit and then right outside They got abortion bus bisectomy bus like dude in real talk like let's just be real Why do we give a fuck if they get abortions? Why do we give a fuck if they sterilize themselves and and two generations? They'll be gone. We want to deal with it So like why are we fucking you know what I'm saying? I mean look dude. I'm They don't understand that that's part of the agenda for for getting rid of the useful idiots in a communist plot Their plot is to use these people to push communist agenda into play because they are useless These people do not have jobs. They do not they want to take Successful people or people who work for a living taxes and they want that to go to them These people don't contribute to the economy. They don't contribute to society. They don't do good things and You the right Fucking pins their flag on fucking abortion right and Like they don't stop and think like Okay, we're getting our asses beat by these people. We're having all of their views forced on us We're having society total totally Decintegrated by their beliefs and then you know these people want to vote on fucking abortion like anybody that votes on abortion As the number one thing in their life. You're a fucking idiot Fucking idiot. Yeah, and we have a big part of Of this whole entire system that has programmed people to vote on that like you're a moron if that's what you vote on Legitimate moron, but who's the biggest moron is these people who go to war for the progressive left And then get encouraged to have abortions and fucking vasectomies and don't realize that all that is his communist influence Trying to remove them from society down the road just like they've done to the 60 million black babies that haven't been born because of this They did that because they don't want more black people and then they convinced black people that this is a huge right for them And we're taking something from them from being able to kill their own children like dude It's fucked up. It's fucking it's like if you really think about it and you really because like dude I'll be real. I don't give a fuck if people want to have abortions I don't care. I don't fucking care. I care about things that are above the line. I care about Economy I care about crime. I care about quality of life for the American citizens That's a below the line issue. I have different viewpoints for different situations like most Americans do But these people don't understand that they are being programmed to fight for their own destruction Literally, yeah, bro, and then they stand on stage your front everybody and say we care about your family We hope you kill them, but we care about it. You know what I mean This is custom. Yeah, it really is So you got that going on now another interesting thing that happened this past monday was that the democrat party released their Party platform Okay, which was this long document laid out all of these different policies and plans that they plan to introduce in the next Administration Because you know, they were not able to do it in the last four years or you know, they can't do it in the next five months They still have release the plan But it's interesting Because the plan you know and Biden has been out of the race for literally over a month now But it refers to Joe Biden And specifically his second term 19 times inside of that plan Um, and I mean here it is The small the sba sba's initiative community navigators program helped I mean, we'll help 350,000 small businesses tap into resources that have helped them grow And a second Biden term will make that navigator program permanent and include new lenders new markets and fair taxes And president Biden's second term like I mean 19 times it does this Well, you make it that it's weird. I think it's just they cut and paste the the policy without editing it No, what they said was is that you know because of the switch then this is from one of the DNC leaders Because of the switch and what happened and because they were not they didn't know what Harris's policies were going to be That you know, they just decided to leave it because they didn't want to have any cross, but this is supposed to represent what the democrat party wants Hmm Still weird Um, but you have that you know A lot of speakers happening like you said there's been some good stuff. Go back to that The headline is Democrats and men day two convention plans after mondays logistical nightwear push Biden out of prime time Bullshit they intentionally push bride not a prime time. They wanted Biden to be on when everybody else was like Fuck it. I'm going to bed. Nobody could see it. Yeah, bro. That's what that was about 100% and if you think anything else you're a liar. Mm-hmm I mean the dude finished his speech at like fucking like well after midnight. Oh, I was Listen, I was doing research for the show. That's what that is for me when I watch that And I got to the point where I'm like fuck this. I'm going to bed You know what I'm saying? Yeah real shit And I mean obviously his speech he pushed a bunch of you know Normal lives he brought up, you know a bunch of I heard it was angry speech. Yeah You got to see it. I mean, it was a typical like dementia Biden. Yeah, you know, yeah We're getting a ice cream who whispers a little bit the yells again. Yeah, it's that weird stuff um But a lot of speakers coming up today But I want to show up pouring out of Obama speaking tonight. I'm joined by first lady. Yeah, uh Mike And uh, did you see that picture her going around for me yesterday? Which one the one where she looked like a fucking dude the old one No, she's wearing like a green thing. Oh Oh, man, it was I don't know if it was real or not I thought it might be fake. Did you see it? It's a blue dress was a blue. Yeah, did I miss this? How did I miss this? It's a big corner on the I don't know if it was fake or real but man No, look at that helper cause But I want to I want to I want to put some attention to this this one speaker in in particular Um, her name is Mallory McCormick or something like that. She's a senator Let's check in and see what she had to say Yes, I'm so glad you put her in the show. I got so much to say about her. It is great Okay, play the clip Donald Trump would be able to weaponize the Department of Justice to go after his political opponents stop Oh so That we didn't just watch this for a whole fucking two years. Okay, keep going Then we're gonna watch the clip in its entirety And Donald Trump would be able to weaponize the Department of Justice to go after his political opponents He could even turn the FBI into his own personal police force stop You mean like the FBI going to potential people's houses who that Were outside of January 6th who didn't enter any of the the grounds or anything and interview them to the point where they've killed a couple of these people You mean like that mm-hmm. Okay That is not how it works in America That's how it works in dictatorships So you're saying we're in a dictatorship is what you're saying because that's exactly what they've been doing yeah Here we go, right you gotta listen people listen to this show you gotta tell them what the fucking thing is on the screen So it's like the 94 different fucking indictments. They were like the the search warrant on Mar-a-Lago that Uh the Biden administration literally signed and approved like like like that Oh, and then it came out later that they arranged the fucking evidence to look a certain way We go on and on it's there this picture here. You didn't see that Oh good guy. Yeah, is that real is that from last night And go that doesn't help all right look let's keep it on track here. We'll go back to that All right, go back to this now play the whole equipment fucking and I want to see if you pick up what I'm picking up on okay Oh god damn it why the fuck you gotta ruin it watch the thing Watch the thing watch your fucking mouth would be able to weaponize the department of justice To go after his political opponents He could even turn the FBI into his own personal police force That is not how it works in America Who does that that's how it works in dictatorships Bro Look at this ladies Well, I'm so glad you put this clip in here. I watched this did you see this whole thing what she did She walks out did you see what she came out with the project she walks out with this fucking look dude When I say their speeches were good I don't mean that like what they were saying was true right but they were sent it in a convincing way very convincing Which is the mark of true sociopathic behavior Look this lady Brings out this fucking book and it's huge bro. It looks like the book of spells And she's like what we have here is project 2025 and like she's acting like it's in this book she's like they've done They've wrote it all down for us and we have it right here and where I'm like me. I know this will be interesting What the fuck she got So she opens up the book and she's like right here on page 571 it says Trump will be a dictator on day one. Yeah, that's the context of the remark that he made what he was saying was He was going to reverse under executive order things that Joe Biden put in executive orders on like uh the wall not being built or The keystone pipeline or drilling for energy so that shit doesn't cost a gazillion fucking dollars Which everybody wants okay and this woman starts reading project 2025 when project 2025 isn't even a real fucking thing that is part of Trump's agenda It's a complete lie. It's already been debunked and this these people's platform is We hate Donald Trump and project 2025 if you listen to learn every speech is I hate Donald Trump project 2025 Now they say it real nice. But the point is Like they're basing their they're all their enthusiasm on made up shit completely made up shit And this woman is so coked out of her fucking mind Dude if you're if you're listening on fucking on audio you have to go at least watch this clip Of her licking her face. Let's cocaine watch. Yes. What's called cocaine jaw cocaine lip bro Yeah, bro. I've seen it bro. It's real. That's it. Yeah I've never seen anyone who's not fucking coked up speak like that. No, that's co-hosts sticks their tongue out all the way to their fucking mouth Like who who speaks like that? She's got that hog to uh. Oh fuck. No, she got cotton mouth. I don't know what the fuck she got She's got mental disorder bro. You're gonna you're gonna come out with the Harry Potter book make some shit up Hold on and then lick your face like you're a fucking like you just got out of a Tony Montana fucking office Right and and fucking like talk about how You're not using the FBI weaponized and you're not weaponizing the DOJ bro Have nobody clapped by the way nobody nobody clapped nobody gave a response because they knew how absurd what she was saying Like these people are very comfortable looking the other way, but when you present it to them They're like, oh Everybody in there was like Fuck bro and then she's coming back tonight apparently to do a chapter each night like this is their fucking Mary poppin I mean even with that though like I mean if I got to wait until page 571 to get to the bad shit like Probably not that bad of a book bro Listen, not first of all if you go through project 2025 it all makes sense I mean, it's not but the reality like I wish Trump was doing that. Mm-hmm, but he's not He's doing a much softer policy than what I think he needs okay, and that's coming from someone who criticizes Trump often for being fucking too soft Okay, so you full they're full of shit. She definitely was snorting coke Fucking I don't know what right off the urinal bro. What do you think? Oh, she's about a fucking two minutes before she walked out of stage She's about to eat ball deep right there Shit, man, he is Look at that face bro. Look look dude. Look remember they say these people are lizards Oh, man. Yeah, where's my 10 for row? Give me the aluminum listen man. She fucking looks like a lizard. Yeah Lot lizard No, man, but I'll say this to about the speeches, you know like because all it was was you know, Trump bad Trump bad Trump bad You know 25 project 25 Trump bad and straight up lies, bro. Sturdy blight like they're they're they're tough Here's the problem They the media doesn't tell the truth about Trump at all and the people only watch the media they watch right okay? So they're not getting any of the truth outside of you know What Trump says and then the media just say Trump's crazy, right? So then Trump comes out and he starts bragging because that's the only way that he can get his information I say I did this I did that I did this which then Makes him less appealing to those people to even listen to so they figured out how to make him the perfect system Yeah, for sure dude, it's a perfect system um, you know, but the the issue too like I mean They did not address not one From what I was able to see Not one real issue that Americans are facing right now, right? Like they didn't address the economy They did like none of that and obviously it's day two night still young um, you know, but They didn't address any of that, you know, I'm saying and I think I mean even like from a Democrat perspective Like you could address that without you know putting the blame on yourself. Yeah, blame on Trump shit from you know eight years ago Yeah, it's like I mean, but you know they didn't do that um, but here was an interesting thing So so Kamala and uh and her VP uh elect um nominee um, they started uh, you know, they started from my belief Pennsylvania And then they uh took this little road Road to Chicago is what they called it and they've been doing some bullshit fucking press on and like these fucking weird videos Them in a gas station picking Doritos and it's just weird bro. I saw that and she goes Oh here they here they were Dougie. It's like like about the bag of Doritos. Yeah, it's so fucking Bro, she's like do you have the clip? No, I don't know. She's like she's like look I found when I was looking for Dougie there they are because he was holding the Doritos It's like bitch. There's 400 dribags Doritos right behind you right behind you. Yeah, right behind you Um and I was so corny dude is fake it's cringe. It's like that picture or video of uh Hillary walking in that apartment. Oh, yeah, like she couldn't believe how fucking small it was Yeah, bitch, that's what you did Is that your cat? No, that's a rat But You know Kamala has not tried to address the media at all no questions, right? And they were finally able to get her on camera Answering and responding to a reporter that asked her a very uh What I wouldn't even call it a softball question, but just a very like you know, here's a real question Um, let's check her response out Sure, well, I mean you just look at it in terms of what we are Talking about for example pause real quick So he asked her can she explain how she's going to pay for her policies Um and give a sense of what her other policies that she's going to be unveiling this is her we are Talking about for example around share And the child tax credit and extending the EITC that is it's at $6,000 for the first year of a child's life The return on that investment in terms of what that will do and what it will pay for will be tremendous We've seen it when we did it The first year of our administration we reduced the child policy by over 50 percent So that's a lot of the work and then what we're doing in terms of the tax credits We know that there's a great return on an investment in when we increase whole ownership in America What that means in terms of increasing the tax base not to measure property tax base What that does to fund schools again return on investment I think it's a mistake for any person who talks about public policy to not critically evaluate how you measure the return on investment You are strengthening neighborhood strengthening communities and in particular the economy of those communities and investing in a broad-based economy Everybody benefits and it pays for itself That was a whole lot of nothing Yeah, so if I go to the store and I load my shopping card up and I get to the to the cash register And they ask me how I'm going to go cash or debit I'm just going to save a turn on investment I'm making investment into my children That's going to return many times over in the future and what you're not seeing is the return on that investment Well, that's paying you how do you get a return on investment when they give $6,000 to families that spend it on fucking video games and fucking You know buckets bullshit. Yeah for real. Mm-hmm. You know new fucking Jordans and fucking a higher car payment Yep, that shit ain't making it to the kids because you fuckers Anyway, yeah bro Also, why why doesn't she talk about how the biggest funds in the world are buying up all the middle class properties across the United States including foreign governments who are Not called or enforced to pay property tax like the regular citizen for owning that property. Why don't we look into that? So she's talking about owner on home ownership amongst the citizens is gonna increase the tax pay But you allow the biggest companies in the world to buy up all the homes and they don't pay the property tax that everybody pays To the homes are supposed to be buying right now. Well hold on I mean, you know, I know here in Missouri and I know a lot of places. They're listening a lot of the homes between You know 200 to 800,000 dollars are fucking not even on the market Why aren't they on the market? Why if the economy is so bad? Why does there why does there no inventory on the house? Oh because they're artificially Keeping the supply low to make it appear as if the economy's booming when it isn't and they're allowing the biggest companies in the world to buy up these properties And these people are not regulated by the same taxation codes that you are so when she says oh We increase home ownership. They don't have any intention of increasing home ownership They want to make renters out of everybody. They want it. They want to provide Free home ownership to people who don't do shit that comes out of your tax dollars and you guys who are working You know 40 60 hours a week working ass off To even pay your bills. They want to take your fucking money and by the way When they talk about rich people they're not talking about fucking you on musk bro They're talking about the guy that makes 200 grand in his fucking neighborhood Okay, who's worked his whole life to become at that level of fucking income and still barely making it and then they want to say that's the rich guy All right, so let's get clear on what they mean what they mean is we're gonna take from the middle class We're gonna give to the fucking people who don't do shit and if you don't like it, you're a fucking racist big it You Did it Kamala. Yeah, you know listen. She's straight up hardcore communist and that's real And I'm Trump's been calling their comrade Kamala. Yeah, well, that's an appropriate name And a lot like a lot of these people like I said earlier in the show who are You know saying oh look how absurd it is that you know their crowd size blah blah blah blah blah blah you motherfuckers are gonna cost them the election There should be level 20 urgency here about getting organized making a plan and getting out to fucking make sure this happens You fucking idiots who keep saying oh look at look at their crowd size. This is embarrassing. Yeah, I mean that you're gonna cost us the whole fucking country So you could tell it sell a couple more t-shirts Fucking douchebag shit dude. I can't say any of these fucking influencers. They're all full of shit There's very few people that are real that actually have something to lose that are actually putting their dicks on the line Who aren't just there to make some money very few That's what shit man guys jumping on this conversation.

Um headlight number two Uh, let's let's go uh, let's go to the UK. I know you've been hitting on them a little bit. Yeah Most of the interesting things happening over there. I just look bro. I just get I'm just you know for the last 15 years on social media These fucking people from Australia and England talk shit about our guns. No, you need guns for I mean, he guns for you Americans in your guns. You like to blow there's something wrong with you. Oh really? What's wrong with us is we don't like motherfuckers fucking with us Come get some But let's go check on them Uh, this headline reads leftist UK government to treat extreme misogyny like terrorism Okay, so So at first they were gonna come get up. They're gonna come get us. Uh-huh. So they're gonna. Oh, I got that. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm Now if what is extreme misogyny corning them? Yeah, well, let's let's talk about it So the new Labour Party government in Britain is reportedly planning on treating quote extreme misogyny in the same manner as terrorism amid a supposed rise of radicalization of young men on the internet Teachers health care professionals and local officials in Britain may become legally obligated to report young men to the government's prevent counterterror program in the same manner as Islamic terrorism or far right radicalism if they are suspected of extreme misogyny under the program those referred to prevent Are assessed by police and their local authority to determine if they are in need of de-radicalization training? Are they gonna de-radicalize the you know all the Muslims they brought in there? Oh, well, we'll get to that in a second Home Secretary of that Cooper has launched a review of the government's counter extremism stance that is expected to be completed by the autumn uh Cooper told the paper quote for too long Governments have failed to address the rise and extremism both online and in our streets and we've seen the number of young people radicalized online grow hateful incitement of all kinds fractures and phrase the very fabric of our communities and our democracy. I thought they were in the monarchy Right it's a constitutional monarchy. I don't fucking know. No, okay sucks over there Quote action against extreme is fucking rains all the time bro. Everybody's got fucked up teeth the food's terrible Food's dirt. What the fuck would you want to live there the only thing good to do over there is a drink beer and getting this fights Which just sounds awesome. Yeah, I mean I forget who it was I think it was like Robert Irvine and that guy from bar rescue. Yeah, he's like fucking UK food sucks He's like you know where all the the top three best fucking restaurants in the world are in the UK And he's like yeah, what do they serve like French? That's right Um action against extremism has been there's some cool English people bro. There's I mean I'm not saying they're they're all bad I think they're Gordon Ramsay's the fucking man. Okay. He's an exception. Yeah He's the fucking man. Yeah, he's an exception to the rule. Yeah, I don't think he's the yeah He got so pissed off about their food. He became the world's best chef. Mm-hmm. See that's how you turn adversity into a success story sick of this shit. Yeah, that's right. He got so pissed off. He's like fucking I'll make my own So that's how all greatness happens. Okay. Yeah Um But as you continue saying action against extremism has been badly hollowed out in recent years just when it should have been needed most Uh, continuing saying that's why I have directed the home office to conduct a rapid analytical sprint on extremism To map and monitor extremist trends to understand the evidence about what works to disrupt and divert people Away from extremist views and to identify any gaps in existing policy Which need to be addressed to crack down on those pushing harmful and hateful beliefs and violence That work will underpin a new strategic approach to countering extremism from government Working closely with communities to build consensus and impetus for our plans Now I believe what a lot of this was actually alluding to Because they actually brought up Indutate in this a lot saying that he's radicalizing youth in the UK because they're all you know Calling themselves top Gs in classrooms and shit apparently And so that pissing them off um You know, but this isn't this is interesting because you know just even uh a week ago The UK police commission because fucking encouraging young men to stand up be something make money Treat people right but like bro, it's not simple to girl. Yeah, not fucking be pushed over or stomped on their whole life Like calling the shit. Yeah, that's that's a fucking threat That is a threat because they want these men to be fucking worthless They want these men to be fat. They want these men to make no money They want these men bowing down To abusive women that treat them like shit their entire lives and dude that doesn't go along with the agenda because the agenda counts on men Being weak so that they don't revolt and change what's going on with the agenda So yes, it's a threat is actually that's it that's a hundred percent accurate. That's why they don't like what he does mm-hmm Yeah, and then just you know just over a week ago you had a UK police commission of threatens to extra In jail us citizens over online post will come after you come get it. Yeah, that's interesting I can't wait till some British motherfucker show up my fucking house. It feel like a fucking no guns No, it'll feel like a real fantasy in life like I'm gonna feel like it's gonna be like the paint the movie the patriot You know only I'm gonna have the guns right you know, I'm saying hello governor. Yeah, and us You've had some not worth things to say like what Well, what do you say he say here? You say Uh men shouldn't simp to women That's a crime in it Not that actually said It's not the man's place to make the sandwich Oh I get me deported fucking England Oh, that's it lock it up Uh But in another move this just came out today last little piece on this. This is a wild to me With all of that happening Uh the UK government to release some 5500 prisoners early to free space amid sentencing of rioters Um the rioters who are rioting and protesting Because of this mass flux of migrants that are coming through illegally that are pillaging and raping and killing their women and children correct We got a free space in the prisons for those people by releasing those people by releasing those people Who are pillaging? Oh yeah What's going on? You you you define it perfectly and this is the this is where You know people like to talk about tolerance and they like to express There's so much value and tolerance Um, there's actually a lot of cowardice and tolerance as well Okay, and you people in England who turned the cheek who were afraid to say anything Who wouldn't speak up who who got home and they had their conversation with their wives like god I can't believe this is actually like I went to the grocery store and there was this and that and this and this This but you won't say shit in public because you're afraid of your neighbor or your fucking boss or whatever You created this. This is your fault and You know, I can't understand how you know, we would reduce extremism um You know, that that's really hard to do you know like it would it would you know probably require like not letting third world Fucking migrants come in destroy society that would probably reduce extremism, you know, uh I really think that's pretty much it. Yeah, you know, like don't let people who don't belong in their country come in it get all the benefits and Fuck all the people up and all the shit. I mean like real talk Those people need to go back where the fuck they came from and they need to go back where the fuck they came from here too Okay, I'm talking about illegals. I'm not talking about You know, this is like a lot of these guys. This is a white Christian nation. I don't give a fuck, bro I care about if you're an American I care about if you contribute positively I care about that you don't hurt people I care about that you set an example for what it means to be an America to take pride and understand that you have an obligation Based upon the sacrifices that have been made for generation upon generation upon generation before you were ever even a sperm Okay, that's what I care about. I don't give a fuck if you're black or your white or your this or your That when I care about is that people from fucking you know third world countries who are causing problems and third world Countries don't come here by the millions which is exactly what we have what's going on in England will happen here It will become reality here These people will fuck yeah bro like that's the guy that's the guy who's coming to get you in yeah who thinks that he's doing the morally correct thing by locking up his own Countrymen For the rights of people that shouldn't even be in his country He makes sandwiches That guy does more than make sandwiches What do you do Andy? Butt stuff you back Yeah, see would you say pack fudge He guys butt stuff Do that to my butt again Say it in English you think English actually do that to my buddy again you do that to my butt again Yeah, the question is the the paninis do the paninis count the sandwiches that women make yeah Oh fuck man Yep, that's the guy man, yep, he's coming to get you don't be too misogynistic Bro every time these people riot and shit they stop too early Yeah, they stop too early I gotta go fool Canada stop too early fucking Brazil stop too early Venezuela stop too early like bro you can't riot for a revolution and not finish the fucking job Are they're just gonna crap down harder on you like When it's time to do it. It's time to do it Okay, and he's all the country you guys better figure that out yeah It's funny that's also the slogan of the Democrat party right now Their campaign finished the job well their new campaign is if we fight we win Hmm is that they change that up? Hmm Which is a way better slogan than what the fuck mag has yeah, I mean look dude they listen Well, I should be if we don't fight release Listen dude the the conservative side is filled with people that don't actually care who people who might think they care but their actions say otherwise and You know people are gonna have to be mobilized and this is gonna have to require some uncomfortable fucking truce And it's not just reporting the news and be like oh you shit can you believe this is happening Yes, it's happening What the fuck are you doing about it? Oh? All you're doing is saying look how weak these people are look at look at their crowd size look at their this look at their that That might be true. They might be inflating shit Okay, and also it is hard It's not hard to fill up a venue the size that they're filling up from the most rabid people across the country Because that's who's there okay the earliest adopters the mega influencers for the Democrat party so Yes, I agree this crowd size You know, you could say things like oh well, you know, they wouldn't be able to do this all over the cut no shit But like to sit here and push this out like the fake news and say oh look how empty it is an hour before People even show up. That's irresponsible shit and any of these influencers putting that shit out like You know giving us overconfidence giving people You know making them think this is in the bag those people are the enemy. I hope you understand that They they might be getting paid by the Democrats to push this shit out to make people complacent That's a fucking rally point. Yeah And people fall for it and then they don't go vote and then they're like oh They cheated no you didn't fucking vote now. I do believe they cheated But if everybody went and voted they wouldn't be able to cheat that gap no And and all that's doing all these people are doing is discouraging people from voting by making it seem like This is in the bag. This is far from in the bag bro. They're gonna fucking cheat 30 40 fucking, you know Million fucking votes. You know I'm saying no No, we guys any let's get to our third and final headline headline number three um This is an interesting topic. I need you guys to stay with us while we connect these dots here Uh headline number three reads DC council member Trayon white senior arrested on federal bribery charges The council member allegedly agreed to accept $156,000 in cash payments and exchange for a pressure campaign to extend contracts in the district So let's dive into this. This is interesting. Now I mean we've covered stuff like this before we've covered the uh What was named Bob Mendez We had gold bars of you know Gold and his fucking closets and cash stuff in the shoes right like we we cover that stuff like this is interesting um, so But there's something deeper here. There is So DC council member Trayon white senior was arrested on Sunday on federal bribery charges the justice department announced Monday a criminal complaint alleges that starting in June Now what month is in Andy? It's August. Okay, so it's two months. This is a two month investigation That starting in June white agreed to accept 156,000 dollars in cash payments and exchange for leveraging his role as a DC council member To pressure government employees at the office of neighborhood safety and engagement and d. Y. R. S Which is the juvenile detention facilities to extend several contracts in the district white he's 40 Made his initial appearance in a packed federal courtroom shortly afternoon on Monday and was released pending further proceedings in this case white did not enter a plea during this initial appearance Was largely silent during the proceedings only speaking to answer questions from magistrate judge G Michael Harvey he appeared wearing a gray sweatshirt black pants and gray sneakers Uh, now the charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison So a couple of conditions on its release yet to surrender his passport any guns at the owned Plus a requirement note that he notified pretrial services when traveling outside the DC region Um, and seek the court's permission for any international travel Um, he's also forbidden from speaking to witnesses about the case except in the presence of council A requirement that he will have to be careful to abide by because several of the witnesses in the case are DC government employees He interacts with s part of his position So he's the chairman on the city council's committee on the recreation uh libraries and youth affairs which oversees several different agencies Um, including the city's department of youth rehabilitation services So the contracts that white allegedly sought to pressure government employees into extending were valued at 5.2 million dollars and they were designated for two companies But the intent of providing violence intervention services in the district according to the complaint Um, now the the money was paid out in four separate payments Um, that money is about 3% of the total contract value that was in question um, and uh You know he's been pretty silent about all of this um, but You know i saw this and i'm like fuck man like two months two month investigation. That's pretty fucking quick Like our government does not do anything quick. They don't do fucking anything in two months No, but they have this guy like this is this twitter you guys can go check him out um, you know, he's been in office for seven years All right now You talk about a close like case closed fucking case like evidence is all there I mean they got the guy on undercover cops fucking body cams Um, literally inside the vehicles There was uh these undercover uh federal agents that were doing the cash exchange They got them i mean they got all of those pictures. They got them taking the envelopes multiple different times This was a $5,000 payment Um, he left his sons birthday party at one time to take another $10,000. I mean they got them like You got them But again, it's just there's stuff that just didn't make sense and so i started looking into this a little bit I mean they even got the text messages of him asking no, hey, I need another 10. I'm in a bad spot like i need you to pull up Um, you know, it's it's a very yeah, all right cool case closed. They got them But two months I can't I can't like hang get caught up on that like nothing happens like there's no investigation That goes that fucking quick with just super like tight evidence like that like didn't make sense And so I started doing some dives. I looked on no, that's being fast track for some reason it's super fast track Like I mean super fast track dude anybody who's got a speeding ticket knows that it's fast track And speeding ticket takes six months Like this is weird. Yeah, it just didn't make sense and um, you know, he's been in office for seven years Why wait seven years to do such like this that didn't make sense to me, you know, but things happen Money's tight by dynamics. I get it um, you know, but I did one little quick dive on twitter I started going through his account and seeing who was commenting and um, I started seeing some things that started Got started to appear. I should say Um, look at this comment. This was from Harold Catlin Um, he says DC councilman known for anti-Semitic conspiracy theories arrested on robbery charge So that was put out Um, apparently notice notice the hashtag above that project 2025 is trump vance. Mm-hmm, okay, right Um, so so I'm assuming that guy's Jewish Who the hell yeah, I can use in the anti-Semitic right? Okay. Um, here's another one Um, Deanna hotson. I think he is the guy who said Jews control the weather Mm-hmm And then and uh, Andy Nego he said washing the DC council member known for promoting BLM and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories What's federally arrested for allegedly accepting over a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in primes? Um, and I mean it goes on and on trade on white is a holocaust denier and all around idiot his whole base Are uninformed under educated folks who get their news from facebook never like that guy Um, and it may be think So I tried to do a leave more deep diving and from what I could tell is that this anti-Semitic narrative that they believe Trayon white was on Guess when it started. I mean get just take a random guess when it's done Two months ago two and a half months ago two and a half months ago and then We get a case closed shut of federal by recharges In under a hundred days and under a hundred days and then that made me think man That's what kind of shit you've been saying Juice control the weather holocaust wasn't real Um juice control the banks So this is a shit that fucking everybody saying everybody saying And uh, and soons fucking Bolzerian, mm-hmm fucking Uh, pretty much anybody who's uh, it's picking up some steam. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah Look man, I look dude. I stick by my my story with this you keep going. Yeah, you know, and but maybe think man like We've been knowing for years now the Joe Biden You know this guy's only taking three percent of the cut this motherfucker took tens of millions of dollars And it's not even allegedly anymore after years of denial hunter Biden finally acknowledged Joe was the big guy in $5 million dollar China deal no shit 10% for the big guy no shit Well, I'm been talking about it for four and a half fucking years Where's his but until until he acknowledges it is not true. What are we What are we what kind of a fucking bullshit do we live in here like So until the criminal admits that he did the crime it didn't happen right right Right, um, and then you know you got this the house gop. They just released a 292 page uh report um With very irrefutable proof and evidence But yes These motherfuckers Joe Biden Is absolutely getting paid by China He is throwing our country under the policy decisions for policy decisions for policy decisions They're not just giving him the money. It's not just hey Like you buy million bucks. Yeah, no Bro This is what I'm telling you these people are compromised their traders if you go dig into Kamala's fucking history you're gonna find the same kind of shit If you go dig into fucking gabanusum shit, you're gonna find the same kind of shit These people are legitimately fucking traders to the country They are taking money for policy decisions and then making policy decisions that are not in the interest of Americans But are in the interest of foreign adversaries that makes them a fucking traitor But where is his Where is his undercover body cams and where is his You know two month quick turnaround and fettel indictment where is where is his well? I mean we know that fucking these people are legit racist Legitimately They want to remove anybody that talks about fucking that's that and that's that's the point man Yeah, you know, and like and here's the thing and I'll say this too Like it's not just Democrats that are doing this shit ever It's Republicans are in this shit too. They're all playing the same little game up there Yeah, 100% and the thing is is that you know This cabal the deep state whatever you want to call it they will allow you to continue to play that game Until you step out of fucking mind. Yeah until you start telling people the insights the moment you start to step in on a line They will bury you. Yeah, they will bury you and you know, they can do it apparently in less than two months Did you uh, did you see that tweet from canis Owens? Yeah, I did see that So canis Owens tweeted uh, I have it right here actually because I thought it was so good I wanted to I wanted to keep it. I'll throw it up. Oh, you got it. Okay Yeah, this uh this tweet right here from canis. Yeah, so canis Owens tweets So I don't know who needs to hear this But demanding I get censored mass reporting my youtube account harassing family members and work college plus launching smears is sort of kind of maybe proving my exact point It's hard to argue with that it is hard right hard I still stand by my statement that it is not all Jewish people Uh, but there are elite people who claim to be Jews who are not actually Semitic in any way shape or form. They're not actually Jewish people. They are Jewish converts that Are all at the top of the fucking game most of them are Jewish converts all at the top of the game They're all working together and This is why when people talk about it they get fucking destroyed Okay, and and everybody sees it people see it Gen Z sees it. It's all over tiktok bro You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube anymore So this is gonna be a major problem for the quote-unquote cabal because people see the truth and what are you gonna do? You fucking blow up everybody and that is they're fucking that is their mentality. Yeah, so You know These people hide behind regular Jewish people your neighbor who's a Jewish person they don't fucking know this shit They all they hear is that and they're like fuck you hate me. No, bro. We don't hate you We don't fucking hate you We hate the people who are pretending to be you so that they can fuck the entire fucking world And then use you as a shield so that when people get mad about it you take the heat of it those Jewish people should be against this more than anyone Mm-hmm Listen, this is no like you know, I don't buy by no means am I trying to say that this guy the train on white seniors innocent or you know Need some type of fucking no, but you're allowed to steal you're allowed to rob you're allowed to extort You're allowed to fucking play the game you're allowed to inside or trade You're allowed to commit all these fucking crimes as part of the fucking as part of the gang Until you start talking about who's calling the fucking play right then the play fucking flips on you immediately right? That's what that's my issue. That's what's the issue man as we can burn down fucking cities in communities It is what it is we do all of this shit You know, I got the fucking Jewish friends who called me up on the phone and been like We're talking that crazy shit bro. Hold on. It's reasonable to ask questions It's reasonable to fucking point at things that are blatantly obvious It is unreasonable to deny things that are blatantly obvious and then to justify things that are blatantly obvious Oh, well Jewish people are just better at fucking money. No That is not true Okay, you guys say it's true. They say it's true. Oh, well, where did you and then you have to reflect on what the Talmud actually says the thing that these people believe in go read it Yeah, man people won't read it and the average Jewish person that is fucking you know Just like us an American Jewish person who these people get mobilized in the defending these people thinking that you know when people You know this anti-Semitic label gets thrown on them They they think that you know and by the way There's a lot of poor communication from people who are trying to have this conversation You know they use generalized terms like you know It's the Jews shit like that the bro. That's not helpful. That doesn't solve anything No, doesn't matter if someone's black white Jewish fucking Indian fucking Arab doesn't matter Let's call them out by name. Let's make a list of the people by name Let's not generalize these people into groups because the generalization is where we get these huge conflicts That never allow for any accountability whatsoever they hide in it. Yeah, they get lost in the group. Yes Yeah, man, and I'm like again, this is the same play that we've covered when they even look at the LGBT movement Right, it's the same thing that pedophiles are doing with the LGBT Right, they're hiding under this protected fucking group 100% same thing. It's the same thing. It's the same as that thing man. So You know, I'm not saying this guy's innocent But I'm saying it's kind of fucked up how they how they choose and what what's allowed and not allowed and people should look into it man Guys jump in on this conversation and let us know what you guys think down in the comments With that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show As always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck This is what we're bringing headline in we talk about it to get one of those two options So with that being my butt looks nice in that because I know it's not my butt, but thanks for that You're also skinny A thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads Parking lot full of self-driving cars turns into nightmare situation for neighbors. Sir Hmm, this is interesting. All right, so in movies the attack of autonomous creation Instead of story humanity comes with spectacular drama in Sanford like her later It does what's got to happen with that one move. What was that one movie that came out that Michelle Obama produced We're like the Tesla's were fucking driving and like crashing into each other and blocking up It just came out not to go you know I'm talking about yeah, I forget the name of it The way it ends or something. Yeah, I can who knows Bernstein bears or something. Yeah I mean it's a decent movie Yeah, but in San Francisco is it is just a beeping endless string of sleepless nights Over the past two weeks. I've been walking up more times overnight than I have combined over 20 years San Francisco resident russell popski said according to KGOTV Quote It's just really really it's tough that affects the way you feel popski said the culprit is a parking lot Where the waymo autonomous vehicles are parked waymo advertises itself as an autonomous driving technology That it claims helps people navigate the streets of San Francisco safely But at night waymo vehicles hawk at one another Beginning for a reason known only to them and ending on similar grounds according to KGOT I ran to white call to discovery of the problem quote I was like where is that coming from and I looked down and I was like I think it's coming from the waymo cars White said first came at 4 a.m. session But then it happened again and again and I started thinking well, this is an issue white said So here's a clip of what's happening at this waymo parking lot where the vehicles return after their long days of being autonomous Here's a clip I None of those cars have people in them none They got a traffic jam go into their own parking lot Well, I can get each other that's not what's happening here Here's what's happening They are intentionally honking their horns and middle of night because they they know that human beings are You know daytime creatures right and so they know if they keep humans up Over the course of the middle of the night that eventually when they Become you know terminators We're all tired and they can kill us easier or Or because you were up all night because of the honking when you get up You don't even you're so tired you can't even drive you have to take awaymo. I mean that's That's probably a multi-step process That's probably the initial step and then they use that to fund their terminator development right and then eventually You know we're gonna be fighting terminator. We are gonna be fighting terminator for sure Like you guys are you guys who celebrate this AI and all you fucking nerds who were like oh, dude I could just AI this shit. I could just I could just chat gpt my whole fucking life You're you're the dumbest people of society Literally you can't fucking think and then you got these people online selling courses about it I'm gonna teach you the fucking hacks of this and that but AI taught them the core the most fucker You're gonna be broke your whole life Okay, because you don't understand that the core competency of a human being to critically think is the most valuable asset On earth. It's also the rarest all right, and I'm telling you because I'm a good critical thinker that this is bad fucking news Right this is this is the end of time Manifesting in front of our eyes. We're gonna be fighting fucking terminators, bro I'm dead serious. What do you think's gonna happen when they start making fucking robotic soldiers when AI meets Robotics, bro. We are done. We are done our jobs are done our purpose is done And it's only gonna take these machines a little bit of time to figure out that we're just fucking infesting their world And we're gonna be done. Yeah, and dude.
