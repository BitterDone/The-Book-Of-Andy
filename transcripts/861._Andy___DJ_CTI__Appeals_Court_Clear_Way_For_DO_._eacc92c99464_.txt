What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate about the lies, the thickness and delusion to monitor society and welcome to motherfucking reality. Guys today we have Andy and DJ crews the motherfucking them. That's what we're going to do. That's what CTI stands for stands for crews the internet. This is where we put topics of the day up on the screen. We speculate on what's true and what's not true. And then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on in the world. Now if you're familiar with the show, you know we have shows within the show. Okay, it's not always CTI. Sometimes we have Q and A F. That's where you submit questions. And we give you the answers. Now you can submit your questions a couple different ways. The first way is guys email those questions into ask Andy at Andy for salad.com. Don't forget to include your phone number. All right, so I can call you. That's right. Many times in the middle of the night we also have real talk. Real talk is five to 20 minutes of me giving you some real talk. Otherwise known as a rent. And then we have 75 hard versus that's where people who have completed the 75 hard program come on the show. They talk about how their life sucked and how they got it back in line with 75 hard. And they talk about how you can do the same. You can get the entire 75 hard program at episode 208 on the audio feed. That includes the live hard program. If you're unfamiliar with both the live hard program and 75 hard program are intertwined. The 75 hard program is the initial phase of the live hard program, which is the world's most popular mental toughness program ever. Okay, again, you get that for free. At episode 208 on the audio feed only there's a book on my website called the book on mental toughness. That's Andy for salad.com for those of you that like the ins and outs and all the details. That's the better route. Just being honest, I'm somebody who likes to dig in and know everything about everything before I do something. That's you. The book is probably a better route, but you don't need the book and get it for free. It episode 208 on audio feed. All right. We do have a fee for the show. Okay, I don't run ads on the show. You're going to notice that this is the biggest show in the world that does not run ads. And the reason I don't is because I don't want to list some pencil neck. Tell me what I can and can't say about what I think. So we keep it real here. We keep it authentic. And I pass up real talk guys on eight figures of income a year on ads. Okay. So I ask very simply that you help us out, man. You guys do a great job of supporting us of sharing the show. All of our shares are organic. Do us a favor, man. If the show makes you think, if it makes you laugh, it gives you a new perspective. If it's something that you think it's important to make known or heard. Do us a salad, man. And don't be a help. Share the show. All right. What's up, man? Hi. How's it going? Greetings. How about joining you today? Yeah, what you got there? Well, a little dream of berries over here. Yeah. Well, berry dream. Very dream. That's a good one. Yeah. I haven't had this one in a while. Yeah. You probably drank that one. I gave it the other day. Didn't you? No. No, I didn't. Thank you, though. No, that was cool. No, man. A lot of stuff going on today, guys. A lot of interesting stuff. We got a new segment. We'll be showing you guys a little bit later. So stick around for that. But I wanted to get to a serious topic real quick. Well, I want to talk about a serious topic real quick. To don't forget that the MFCO project is getting ready and launch. If you're wanting to hear the MFCO project that is going to be on my own app, it's not going to be on YouTube. It's not going to be on the audio platforms. So you're going to need to go to my email list at antipersonnel.com. Sign up for the Andy Graham. We'll send you an email every morning telling you it basically not be a lazy piece of shit. And we'll notify you when you want to listen to the MFCO project. So just keep me updated on that. That's coming down the pipe real quick. All right, that was my pitch. Yeah, it was good. You know, but I wanted to be here. You're you're fucking stupid if you don't do it too. Yeah, you're you're let's be like some of these other influencers. You're on the internet 14 times a day and be like, what are you guys doing? We're not buying my shit. You're stupid. Successful. Bro, it's a photo like dude, real talk. Like I cannot be the only one that's tired of seeing all these people on the internet talking about how they can make you fucking money. Like, am I? No, I don't think you are. I think I mean, do you get do you get bombarded with that shit? No, I ask because I'm I'm like, what's the word? I'm like numb to it. You know, I'm saying because I know what it is. It's like, you know, do you guys get bombarded with that? In your fucking Instagram? Man, I fucking do. I just see them laugh at it. Bro, there's like all these dude, I mean, we're gonna into it. Now, there's a lot of kids out here trying to learn how to win and are being misled by people who have never actually won. And the only thing they've won at is selling people the idea of how to win. And we're gonna fucking change that. I'm excited to get back to it, dude. It's also honestly, it's my favorite thing to talk about. Besides tyrants. Yeah, well, we got we got some of the hosts too. Good. No, but I wanted to bring this in. This is a more serious topic. For those of you guys who don't know, you know, I do Andy security, right? I take care of you. Yeah, you know, I'm saying my job's a little, you know, a little involved. And I try to always look out for for certain things. And I think we have a breach. I think we almost had a breach, bro. Really? We almost had a breach. Urgent warning is 1.5 million private photos are leaked from BDSM dating apps. Fuck. Can't have that. I thought I told you to take care of that. You know, what's got you, bro? Fuck. Fuck you. No, man. No, I thought you said you had that handle. So all these weird ass people now, they're like freaking the fuck out because their shit got leaked. Well, fuck dude, it's 2025 brother, but he's weird. Yeah, well, no, I mean, this is like some weird weird shit. Yeah, I mean, look, dude, here's the deal. We got out. We got a quit laughing about it. Well, how weird? I mean, look, dude, they got the whole world black mailed. Everybody's got weird shit. I don't give a fuck. Just let it out. But it does depend on how weird. Yeah, well, I mean, I thought I mean, what's the rule? Like over 40, nothing's weird at that time. I mean, the rule of life. I don't know. Did I tell you that? She learned that from me. What? Anyway, there's certain things that are still weird. Like dude's dressed up as girls. That's weird. Yeah, that's fucking weird. We got some of that too a little bit later. Like people that poop on each other. Now that's some weird shit. That's weird bro. Two girls and one cup. Do you remember that? Yeah, I mean, yeah, that was dude, that was out before you were born. Oh, no, no, it wasn't. I was fucking wasn't. I was born. I was born. What was your level? What circle was that? You were five. Probably. Yeah. Well, it's been around for a while. That's it. Yeah, because I remember being in college and being like, what the fuck is this? 2007. Yeah, well, maybe I wasn't in college. I was in seventh grade. Yeah, I was, I still thought I was. I still think I am. Yeah, so there's some weird stuff like pooping and, you know, people that poop on each other. That's weird. There's some lines for sure. Yeah, for sure. I think once you hit 50 that that comes on the side. No, man. No, no, yeah. Oh, I just thought that was interesting, but I do want to bring up another topic that's important to you on some, on some serious stuff. You know, we talk about winning on the show. I think the scoreboard shows itself. You know how to win. I know, I know something about it. You know, a finger too. The finger because I seen a finger too. Right. I mean, you know, you see the finger too. And you know, we talk about this idea of armchair quarterbacks, right? Oh, yeah. And I want you to talk about it. I want you to rate something. And you tell me your honest opinion on this matter. Are you familiar with Kim Mulkey? So she is the LSU women's basketball coach. Okay. And she's getting some heat right now from fans calling her a sore loser. Okay. Because of an interaction that she had with the LSU student reporting. First of all, I don't think there's anything wrong with sore losers. You're supposed to be pissed off when you lose. Oh, okay. Yeah, I like that. Yeah, I mean, that is real. I listen, bro. I'm the most fucking sore loser on the face of the fucking planet. And if you beat me at something, I fucking hate you. I might shake your hand and give you a hug. But trust me, when I walk three feet away, I'm figuring out a beat. You're already. It's real. So like, bro, you know, it is what it is. I don't think you can be a real competitor without fucking being that way. Oh, I can be happy with it. I don't know any fucking high level athlete or entrepreneur that I'm talking high level, bro. Like talking, I'm not talking, you know, they do okay. I'm talking about like fucking superstars of what they do. They're all sore losers tremendously sore losers. So anyway, let's see. Yeah, let's see. Let's dive into it. So yes, I mean, there's a limit, right? You don't want to embarrass yourself. Yeah, but sometimes it happens because you're pissed off. I get it. I get it. But, uh, yeah, so coach, uh, Mokey, uh, she did a press conference and she was asked about, uh, how the LSU Tigers, um, this is their second straight elite eight exit, um, losing in this NCAA tournament. Um, so let's check out the interview. Yeah. So just to be clear, uh, most people would say, oh, man, we made it to lead a twice, right? Those people are fucking losers. Okay. All right, I'm just being real out. Dude, listen, I'm with you. Yeah, let's check out this interview guys. Here it is. Jayden Smith, K. LSU Sports, coach, just the second straight you, you guys could eliminate it in the elite eight. Just, yeah. Terrible. How many final fours you play in? Okay. Uh, none. So it's probably pretty good, huh? Yeah. All right. Uh, just curious how you would sum up the journey to the elite this year and how does it differ from last year? Different team, different players, uh, role players from last year played bigger roles this year. Um, transfers. I had five in that locker room that had never been to a sweet 16, never been to an elite eight and the amount of experience that they got will be valuable. That was it. What about it? And she's getting smoke on that. Why? I would have been way worse. No way worse. Well, I thought that was super classy. I thought I mean, I loved it. What was wrong with that? I don't know. That was classy compared to how I'd be. That's terrible, isn't it? How many fuck you think? Yeah, that's terrible. We're here to fucking win. Yeah. Why don't you ask me the shit that they're asking her? Yeah, you want the question? Yeah, let's do it. All right, Andy. So this is the second year in a row of losing in the elite eight. What's your thoughts on that? Well, you think I don't know. We fucking lost? I'm very aware. What would change? That's terrible, isn't it? That's pretty bad. Yeah. The fuck you think? She did handle it. I don't know. You got to ask me the differences. What was the differences between the differences? We won last year and we fucking lost this year. The fuck you think, man? The game plays good. We have worse players. I pride in coaches good. The shit didn't turn out. And that's what the fuck it is. Did I'm happy about it? Yeah, right. I mean, that's what I fucking say. Yeah, I don't know. Listen, they try to get on the run. Why? I don't know. I thought that was a great comeback. Bro, I think she, honestly, I thought she was polite. Yeah. Apparently she's a pretty fiery coach. Good. So I mean, but I don't know, man. I thought I thought it was fine. I like that. I like that. How many final four years? You mean that's what I'm, it's the armchair quarter. Yeah, I'm a fucking man. I get that shit all the time. We didn't, we don't come to your Instagram, see your cars. But then fucking go somewhere else. I like cars, okay? You know, if you had cars, you'd fucking like them too. You're probably watching your shit. Yeah. I mean, we don't, you know, I think you should do, well, you think so, huh? The fuck do you do for a living? Yeah, I like it, man. I don't know where like that. I mean, she may be a terrible coach. I don't know. I don't know if she coaches fucking a team that consistently, that is considered a disappointment for losing in the fucking elite H. She's probably pretty good. Probably pretty good. Yeah, I mean, she's, I mean, she got some swag too. Look at that jacket. And then she get low too. Yeah. Yeah, I bet she's pretty vicious, bro. She's like 62. Yeah. Well, good. So what's the heat? What's this have to do with the BDSM and all this? Oh, no, absolutely nothing. Oh, really? No. She was just shit that was going on. Didn't really fit in with that. Oh, man. Yeah, no, it's shit. I'm sitting here thinking she's in this fricking ass shit. I think I'm elite. Oh, I can fucking see what she's talking. It's like her with like a fucking gagging her mouth. You know, getting canoes stripped on her face or some shit. She's probably didn't win. Yeah. She didn't get her serving. I love her, dude. I thought she was polite. I want to win a lot harder. I would like to see her go harder next time. Yeah, she should. Bro, remember that did we met at the fucking barbecue place in Texas? Oh, yeah. Oh, guy. Yeah, well, the guy came up and he said, are you Andy for sale? Perhaps the time I'm like, fuck, at the pants. You know, it's been a long time asking. So he's like, all right, go, yeah. And he goes, I watch you every day on YouTube. And he looks at DJ goes, you too. And he goes, you guys are way too fucking easy on these people. It's like 80 years old. And then he goes, this next slide out of his mouth. You want some bread pudding? It's on me. That shit was good, too. That was good. That was good. Yeah, man. All right, well, let's get. That was so awesome. That was just good people. Yeah. Good people. But yeah, let's get into some of these cruises, man. We got a lot of stuff to cover today. Guys, remember if you want to see any of these articles, links, pictures, videos, go to Andy forseller.com. You guys can find them, link there. We'll come check us out on YouTube. And you guys can follow along with us with the show. With that being said, let's get into our first set of headlines. Sweet. This is a pretty big update. I guess we can call it an update. Pills court. Clear is the way for Musk Doge to resume cuts to USAID. Good. Yeah, right. I mean, it wasn't really shocking that it came out, but it is good that it's moving forward, right? So a judge blocked it. And then it went to the appeals court where a three-judge panel for the fourth circuit court of appeals, they all ruled unanimously to overturn the injunction there. I think one was a Trump appointee. One was a Clinton appointee. One was a George Bush appointee. So I mean, pretty, pretty diverse. But for all three, unanimously agree that, no, that was the where they appointed by? So you got Joe Bush and who? Clinton Bush and let me double check. Clinton Bush. I want to say it was Clinton Bush and Clinton Bush and Trump. Okay. Well, yeah, you know what I think that really is? What it sounds like to me, it sounds like the lower court probably was financed by George Soros and the upper court probably wasn't. I don't know. They just haven't gotten to him. That's my speculation. What kind of judge would block? This is what we're talking about when we talk consistently about why things are so hard to change in Washington DC. It's because they're all lawyers and they want to protect their lifeblood, which is milking the money out of all of us for basically very little work. All right. And these people consistently communicate behind the scenes, make decisions together that are going to cost us the most money and make them the most money. And so when you think about things like that, it makes sense as to why a judge would block all of these cuts that are coming down the way because the likelihood is money is either making his pocket or his buddy's pocket. 100% right? Or he's a straight communist that's trying to destroy the country. It's one of the out there's nothing. There's no like there's no good reason for trying to stop the shit. You know, and that's actually what one of the judges wrote. Judge Marvin Quattobom, a Trump appointee on the appeals court wrote that musk actions are not unconstitutional because he is a valid presidential advisor in his effort to cut out USID were approved by officials with direct authority over the agency. And I think that's important too because like they're laying it down like no like president Trump can do this through executive action. He can tell anybody to go fucking make it happen and it's fucking it's constitutional. It's fine. Yeah. Very simple. And I mean, within hours of that coming out, Marco Rubio, he made a statement on this saying that it will completely be done in any like lingering pieces of USID which are I guess technically you could sit are important. That by July 1st of this year, it will be fully assumed by the State Department. So USID is done. It's completely done. I thought that was cool. And now musk is heading over to the CIA. Let's go check out CIA assets and then things going on over there. Elon Musk is visiting the CIA for the first time at the invitation of John Ratcliffe. According to a person familiar with the plans in the US official. Ratcliffe told House Intelligence Committee last week that the impact of musk's doge is zero on the CIA. Doge representatives have not been to either the CIA or the office of the Director of National Intelligence. Ratcliffe and the nation's spy chief Tulsi Gabbard said. So that's changing got that going on. But there's a new target on Elon Musk is watchless now. Which I think is important because it's one of my issues that I've had with this whole thing. Okay, like we're recovering all the fraud. Fraud means somebody's doing something that's illegal. So where the arrest. All the waste if people are intentionally wiping, moving millions of billions of dollars. Like somebody's doing I want fucking names and I want people arrested. Well, there may be a turn. Because Elon Musk, he just revealed that they have a new target. All the members of Congress who got strangely wealthy. He said this publicly. He said it publicly and these people are going to go fucking crazy, dude. By name. Are you called him out? Like Elizabeth Warren, Nancy Pelosi. Nancy Pelosi. Yeah. He called him out. And so I mean, this is going to be interesting. So this was at a town hall in Wisconsin, Sunday night. Elon Musk suggested that his team at the doge will investigate how certain members of Congress have achieved generational wealth. One attendee at the town hall had asked Musk if doge had uncovered evidence of funds wired from the USAID to representatives of Maxine water. Waters Adam shift. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. And this was his response. And I got a short clip after this. But this was Elon Musk's response. He said, quote, they all meaning the government. Send the money overseas to one NGO. Then they'll go through a bunch of them. And then I'm highly confident that a bunch of that money then comes back to the United States and lands in the pockets of the people you just mentioned. Musk replied, but it is a secured it's route. It doesn't go directly. But let's just say that there's a lot of strangely wealthy members of Congress where I'm trying to connect the dots. How do they become rich? So we know that the annual salary for these people is $174,000 a year. Okay. Now we know Musk is worth way more than that. But he's earned that money. There's a difference. Some of these lawmakers, a lot of these lawmakers are fucking millionaires off of less than $200,000 salary. It doesn't make sense. They're not millionaires, bro. They're worth tens and tens and tens, even hundreds of millions of dollars. Yeah, Nancy Pelosi is at a quarter billion right now. That's right. But this was Elon Musk's direct response to them. Check this out. A lot of strangely wealthy members of Congress, where I'm just trying to connect the dots of how do they become rich while earning, how do they get 20 million if they're earning 200,000 a year? Sounds like that's how to, nobody can explain that. So something's, yeah, we're going to try to figure it out. And certainly stop it from happening. This is, yeah. What about taking her money away? I think fucking stole from us. What do they call it redistribute the wealth? Yeah. You know, like they all fucking claim that they should do to people like us. It's fucking crazy, man. But with all of that going on, there's still some heat. Feds on alert for Tesla. Global day of action after nationwide violence leads to arrest. These people have been fucking losing their minds, bro. It's insane. I never thought that I see a bunch of Tesla owners and green new deal pushers and environmentalists turn on the rest of the Tesla owners. It's like a Tesla war going on. I'm thinking about getting a Tesla just for the fuck's up. Bro, there was a meme about that. You know, dude, they listen, man. These people are insane. Bro. Yeah. They're one. They don't realize they are the Nazis. They are. They are the people who are forcing all this crazy shit into the world who root for legitimate authoritarian fascism, who attack people that don't see things the same way that they do, who want to remove people from society who don't see things the same way they do. These people have been completely brainwashed and completely manipulated and they've gone down the river into the insane world and bro, they ain't coming back. It's not they don't even think that they did anything wrong. I saw a video of this guy today. First of all, how stupid are these motherfuckers? Every Tesla has a fucking camera all the way at 360 around it. Right. Okay. Like you wouldn't watch two or three videos on the internet and figure that to fuck out. And be like, oh, well, this is not a good idea. Like it just keeps happening. You're realizing it's an holiday shit, man. Bro, I saw a dude, I saw two videos. I saw a dude who was in his like 30s, get out of his car, beat the fuck out of a lady who was like 61. I saw that. Okay. Then I saw a dude who on camera got out of his car, squatted down, drew a sauce of swastika in the side of a Tesla. Then they Facebook caught him and they confronted him and he's like, I have nothing against you. It's against Elon Musk. Musk and he like starts like a apologize. Like do some mom sorry that you're upset? Yes. It goes, I'm sorry that you're so upset about this. This is not personal against you. And the guy's like, well, this Elon Musk owned the car and he goes, well, no, but I have something against Elon Musk. And like dude, the guy like completely thought it was okay to do. Like even when he was caught and then the guy goes, he goes, well, where's your car? I'll come fix it for free or something. He says something like that. And the guy's like, it's down at the police station, getting fingerprints and you could tell the guys demeanor was like, oh, fuck. And he goes, what's it getting fingerprints for? Because that's a crime that you come and he's like, and the guy go, the victim goes, your business, your personal name, everything, it's going to be ruined because of this. And the guy goes, well, you know, I'm sorry that you're so upset. Obviously, that's not what I intended to do. And it's like, bro, listen, you motherfuckers are insane. And you're, you're treading on very, very, very delicate space right now because everybody's tired of these people's shit. Everybody's tired of being fucked with by these fucking quote unquote dogooters who think that they are morally superior to everybody else. And then they think they have the right to, to, to destroy private property or public property and face no repercussions, dude. Personally, I love what Trump is saying about these things being acts of terror because they aren't. Okay. These are organized acts of disruption and destruction and intimidation by a group just like we're talking here, global day of action. That is an organized effort. Okay. To intimidate, destroy the property of and hurt private citizens. Okay. That these people should go to jail for a long time. Not a week, not like that guy who drew the swastika in the, in the guy we're talking about, got caught. Bro, 20 years, dude. 20 years. Fuck you. Like people have to know that you cannot do that. Like I'm so sick of people thinking they can just fuck with everybody, bro. It's insane. It's insane. I mean, let's check one of these clip out from one of these global day of action. Let's check this out. I don't actually know what that looks like to me, bro. That looks like it. Look, Medicaid cuts killed me. No, you're laying in the street. You're not dead. Just get up. By the way, you're a fat ass. You eat shit. You drink alcohol. You tell by looking at you. You're killing you. It won't be better. Okay. And by the way, if you got a problem with that, like why don't you, like these people, these are just people that want to suck off the system every way that they possibly can. And the mere suggestion that there might be some changes, just, you know, sends them into the outer space because they feel completely entitled to everybody else's money. Yeah. Must reply to this video. You said, first of all, there are no cuts to Medicaid, social security or other entitlements, unless stopping fraud is considered a cut. Second, second, organizing a campaign to call for the death of someone is illegal. The organizers and funders will be found and prosecuted. Good. They should be. They should be. And by the way, dude, he's right. Okay. With these stupid people do not understand. And I'm talking to all you stupid motherfuckers. You don't understand what he's doing is actually cutting out the corruption of these situations that these systems and situations that we have to deal with all the time, the hospital situation, insurance situation, social security waste, the theft of our tax dollars to the government. What he's doing will eventually make all of these things that you want easier and more affordable to everybody. And you fucking smooth brains are too stupid to even understand it because you get hyped up by I don't do these or NPC people or they're being paid. There's no organizers. Do they have to be? There's no way. There's no way that this many people are this fucking stupid. No, you know how I know they're paid off advertisers because they got they're so pissed and so upset, but they still had time for a dance break. I noticed hold on hold on. What is the one thing that every single one of those people hasn't common right there? Terrible dance moves. Okay, besides that. Why is that? Why do they have terrible dance moves? I think you should have something else in common. What is it? You should answer it. Oh, they're white, middle class, upper middle class, virtue signaling women who fucking have to have some sort of purpose because they don't have a purpose. They sit at home and drink fucking wine and live off everybody else and they've made everybody else's shit their purpose. With God zero testosterone anywhere. There's not even a dude there. There's one dude right there. We're in the back with the red on. Oh, this guy. Yeah, well, he's probably on the estrogen. Okay, well, that's one guy. That looks like a fed. All right, making sure everybody got their checks. The rest. The rest. Yeah, the rest. These people are fucking drags on society, bro. Good Lord, man. Good Lord. Look at Tesla. Got security on the roof. Oh, yeah. Oh, bro, they don't fuck around. Yeah. They don't fuck around. But yeah, I mean, you know, so that's going on. I thought this was perfect timing because, you know, with all these protests going on, you know, today's also a very important day. And you today is international transgender day of visibility. So I, what? Huh? It's international trans day of visibility. So we see you because it's hard. It's hard not to fucking see you. Yeah. Pretty all pre easy spot. Every day is pretty much visibility day. It's fucking true. What's every day? It's every yelling blended in. I don't get it. Bro, come on, man. What? Like dude, you know, it's funny and not funny at the same time. Like there's always been trans people. They've existed for fucking thousand years, bro. 2000 years forever. All right. But the reason that everybody's busted and they're fucking literal balls now is because they want us to, they want to shame us and force us into admitting things that just aren't true. Okay. That a man can be a woman or woman can be a man. A man can have a baby. Fucking, uh, I look like a woman. No, you fucking know. Yeah, I'm sorry. And like you forcing me to call you something. It's not happening, man. No, well, you know who else is. By the way, like, just don't talk to me. I want, then you won't be offended. I'm sorry. I mean, yeah, I mean, isn't that the fucking way? Like, dude, if I knew someone who like was gonna piss me off, I would tell my talk to him. Say no. I just quit talking to him. Just quit talking to us. Yeah. It's very, it's very simple, man. It's very simple. But you know who else is in that same line of belief? We got to go to the trick trick. Oh, trick trick. We're gonna go into the fucking show. Let's miss the trick trick. He's actually, I mean, listen, he's with the shit too. Hey, he's with the shit, but he had interesting little trick. Trick keeps it real. Hey, it keeps it real, bro. He had a little interesting exchange on, I think this was like a radio show, morning show, something like that. Let's check this out. We got me and beaten the shit out of women and women sports. And it was perfectly goddamn legal. We got transgender's or trans sisters or whatever the fuck they are coming in schools talking to children. What the fuck is you doing talking to these babies about what? What the fuck? How the fuck did we get here? At this point, America, we got a goddamn problem. I'm a little bit thrown back by all the extreme transphobia. I don't give a fuck about all that because that's it. He asked you a question about some milk. You didn't got to come back in with the fuck. I just found it. Well, I find it pretty interesting that you talked about you just got asked the question. And you still talking to me, bro. I don't answer my question to him. You just asked, I'm talking to Charlie, bro. You got any answer with motherfucker? You ain't got a response. You talk to Charlie. Well, that's fine. He asked you a question. He asked you a shit, bro. You voted for him. He's still fucking talk. That's it. That's it. Oh, dude. Yeah. Bro, did you see the whole video of this? If you said somebody trans these nets, did you not have the whole video? It was like three slides. Oh, bro, it's so good. Definitely go watch this. This is so good. It's fucking great. Transistors. Transistors. No, bro. Listen, can you put the whole fucking thing in there? Because there's some good points. Bro, this is new. Any thing, bro? I'm not here to talk to him, bro. I'm here to talk to you. I'm only here. Shit. No, you say he started off wrong. I don't know. Tell me about you. Well, sir, I was like, sir, but now that was so you can even get back. Well, they were in person. This would be exact. Why are you? Okay, let's see. Well, how am I supposed to sit here and deal with the extreme transphobia that you're doing? Why are you so, why your verbal language? Why? Why? You're a rough shit here. How the fuck you don't get the fucking tell me how to think? All right, talk. Niggas, do your fucking job. You got a f**k up. Niggas, keep talking to me. I didn't ask you about the other thing. Well, you're so angry. You can't find some interesting stuff. I'm a good man. You're a little boy. Stop control. Hold it. Wow. Wow. Wow. This is so interesting. You're just lukewarm. Okay, it's niggas like that. You like so much, my folks. No, no, no, no, motherfucker. Body, how the f**k? Who the fuck you? I'm working to say anything. I'm just saying that I'm a f**k. I'm just talking to you about the trick. Who the f**k made you the moral authority over how any f**king body talk? Who? Well, I'm not interested in niggas. Who made you the moral authority to tell anybody how to talk? Where the f**k do you get your positioning to tell anybody how to talk? I'll wait nine. Oh, I didn't f**king think something. No, if you will, ask Charlie the deaf f**king question. That's please stop talking to me. I ain't even talking to you home. Transphobia, would you be? I don't give a f**k about what you're talking about. Trans these lips niggas. That's f**king funny. I make you so angry. F**king to me. Because you are the place, dawg. You're talking to me and this man asked you a question. You are the place. You don't get to tell me how to think. You don't get to tell me how to talk. You don't know nothing about me. You stated that from the beginning. So at this point, me, you had no doubt. You started it wrong. You started it wrong. When he told you about, said something earlier, no, I don't trick trick. Tell me who are you? And I thought you that I would jump in. Okay, say it, my man. You're gonna throw a word. That's cool. I don't expect you to know who I am. But the way you came at me like that. Wow. The way you were talking about how I talk. But when you get this, yeah, it makes sense here in Ukraine. Yeah. That's a turn of events. For everybody, my new favorite person in 2025, bro. I mean, look, you could say whatever you want, the guy makes a lot of great points. This is how those people like to talk to everybody. Everybody over there on the far left in the LGBTQ RSWC duty, like every fucking one of the motherfuckers, bro, likes to tell us that we're wrong and like they try to play this moral, fucking educated, high ground. They don't even know that they're propagating legitimate communist fucking ideology. They're too stupid to understand because they think that the school they went to or the letters after their name make up some sort of fucking genius. Okay. And the smug attitude that these people have like that dude has is what irritates the fuck out of everybody. Wow. What? Wow. I was holding this cup. Look at, yeah, I got my fancy coffee here. I'm gonna sit back here and listen to the Neanderthal talk. Meanwhile, I can't wait until, you know, like I can suck my next dip. You know, like bro, I'm just fucking over it. No. Like dude, don't talk to people like that. Like that's, they, dude, I get it. I think trick, trick, right? Trick, trick is 100% right. Yeah. I saw that video on World Star, bro. Every single comment agreed that he was right. 100%. People are tired of that shit. We're tired of these quote unquote educated fucking people trying to top down everybody. You know what I'm saying? Like, dude, I'm sick of it. I stand with trick trick. I do too. 100%. 100%. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. That being said, let's go check some of these comments. Everybody's sick of that shit, bro. Like they'll always tell you in private too. Like it's amazing how much shit people tell you in private, but they won't say in public. They won't do with trick trick. No, no, or they won't do what we do. Or they won't say fucking anything. But the minute you get them in private, they're like, band-ood. This shit's fun. Crazy. Look at this, this, this, this, this, this. Right? Like, do you guys understand that the reason that it's like this and this and this and this, is because you motherfuckers won't speak up. Like, do you understand that? Like, do you understand that like, your private beliefs that you hold inside? Those are the things that are actually keeping things all fucked up. Like, you can't allow just a few people on the internet to do the water carrying for this. Because then it looks like there's just a few people out there that are propagating this view when in reality most people have it. Most people are tired of being talked down to. Most people are tired of being told they're a racist or a bigot or a homo-fulb or a trans-fulb when they just want to have a regular fucking life and be left to fuck alone. These people judge us and shove their shit in our face. Oh, everywhere we look, bro. And then they're surprised when we eventually say, dude, shut the fuck up. Wow. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? Like, bro, that's manipulation. Okay. And just because you shit, I think people are done being shamed. I think people are done being shamed. I think people are to the point where like, yeah, okay, man, I don't give a fuck what you think. Just like he said, I don't care. You know, and dude, they did it to themselves. I remember that. They did it to themselves, bro. You know, it's, it's, it's, it's not even a gay people thing. Like I feel bad that gay people get wrapped up in it. Because dude, there's a lot of gay people. They're like, fuck, these people are making us look real bad. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's just, it fucking gets old, bro. Super old, man. Super old, guys, jumping on this conversation. I just know what you guys think down in the comments. Let's keep this cruise cruise. And let's go check out some of the comments real quick. Oh, we got some good ones here. This first one is from at Ronaldo Delgado. R9Z. It's at almost lost my shit when you said this was the last relay F. Still here. Yep. I can't stop. How can we stop? Yeah, I ain't a quitter. Yeah, not only that. I mean, you know, why would I stop? Bro, I love half the internet fucking harassing me every day. Well, you got a few people, man. There's other person. Anthony Archaleta, R5B says, your show is part of my daily routine. So I wasn't happy with that joke. Haha, my panties got in the ruffle. Oh, I'm sorry, bro. Yeah, do looks a little yoke, though. Yeah. Well, our people are yoke because they give a fuck. They take care of themselves. They work hard. They try to be something. That's not surprising. 100%. Nice yokeness. Nice yokeness. Yeah, one more from, I got another one from, at unfiltered WV, Andy and DJ, I'm begging you to host a live show just once. It'd be amazing to interact with you both in real time. Yeah, we'd have to put that, that Pope screen. Who? That bulletproof Pope screen. Haha. Haha. We'd be up there like the Pope. Yeah. We drove out on stage and the Pope will be, oh, fucking, bubble, I'm down with it. Yeah, I'm down with it. I want to interact with you guys too. Yeah. Lots of interactions. Yes. Interactions galore. Last one, last one came at the show, get away without just a little bit of ism. Antonio Abbott, Y8P, DJ didn't watch Indiana Jones because he gets triggered by the whip. All jokes aside, love you guys. Andy, thank you for giving me the blueprint to change my life. Hashtag, stay hard, hashtag, don't be a hoe. Is it true? I don't know if that's the reason I just haven't seen it. Yeah, listen, I was not on that BDSM like listen, listen, listen, racism, racism is funny. Racism can cure. It is, it's funny. It can cure stuff. There we should be all laughing at racism. We should. The funniest jokes are racist. I think the best ones are. That's what I meant. Yeah. I mean, a joke supposed to be funny, so that would equate to the best jokes being the funniest. So we said the same thing. Same thing. Yeah, but I agree. I don't know like, I don't know like how people get offended by raciogues. What the problem is, it'd be yo people that be offended for my people. That is the problem. That is the problem. That's the problem. That is the fucking problem. See black people sticking to the list. No, they laugh. Talk about. Yeah, and then they make fun of fucking us. That's how it's supposed to be. It's supposed to be, man, but yo people, they always want to, you know, that's because they got nothing else to do, bro. That's it. It's gonna be, it's gonna, don't try to do that shit with me because I'm gonna find a job on your ass too. Why don't you people find something else to do? Yeah, you know, you know, like, finish, go back to brunch and finish building, you know, you've been building the world, you know, whatever. All I know is that I think race jokes are the funniest ones. I agree. And if you can't laugh at them or something wrong with you, your race is if you don't, that's right. That's right. It's what it is, man, guys, we appreciate you for being the real-assed Isom fans. Let's keep this cruise moving. Yeah, you got to head on to. This is an interesting topic. So this is, I'm seeing more and more of this. Curious to see if you've seen any of this. But everybody now, for whatever reason, they're all jumping on this bandwagon. How Trump could snatch a third term, despite the 22nd amendment. Four ways Trump could stay in power beyond 2028. Like, it's so stupid. Bro, what's stupid is the fixation of one man. Dude, it's crazy. Like, how is the fixation so heavy on one dude as opposed to zero fixation on what's going on like in the country for real? Any of the other problems? Yeah, like these people protest them making the government more efficient. You're not saying right Nazis. Dude, I just don't believe these are real people. Like, I believe some of them are. Well, let's check into some of these ways that they're talking about. They said this is a political article, you know, shocking. But if Trump decided he wanted to hold on to power paths 2028, there are at least four paths he could try. He could generate a movement to repeal the 22nd amendment directly. He could exploit a little notice loophole in the amendment that might allow him to run for vice president and then immediately ascend back into the presidency. He could run for president again on the bet that a client Supreme Court won't stop him. Oh yeah, I'm so sure. Or he could simply refuse to leave and put a formal end to America's democratic experiment. Okay. It's so crazy. It's so honestly, I mean personally, I mean, look dude, this is obviously just another way to just rage bait. Yes, just strum up people's fucking insanity. Trump said he's going to stay in office. It seems like they're trying to really can like instigate some sort of like civil unrest. For sure. Well, it's not just here. It's a global movement. I'm glad you brought that up because all the same shit that we've seen them put this man through for the last eight years really. They're doing it to Bolsonaro in Brazil. They're doing it to fucking La Palme in France. Did you see this shit? French far right leader, Marine Le Pen, barred from seeking office for five years of political earthquake. So this lady, the one who wanted a lecture, who want like, I mean, dude, it's the exact same plain, exact same play. The only difference is like they're actually putting their ass in jail and then they're barring her from competing. Wait, they're putting her in jail. She's apparently from what everything is saying, she's facing about two years right now. She got convicted of her. What? Apparently it was like some some embezzlement that didn't even happen in France, allegedly. But yeah, French court on Monday convicted Marine Le Pen, then bezzlement and barred her from seeking public office for five years. A hammer blow to the far right leader's presidential hopes and an earthquake for French politics. The pens lawyers said she would appeal the verdict, but she will remain ineligible when she does. And so could be ruled out of the 2027 presidential race. She was also sentenced to four years in prison with two to be served under house arrest and two suspended. So she's under house arrest for the next two years for the next two years. And she can't run for, you know, dude, it's the exact same shit. Yeah, except France's way further down the road than the United States is for sure. For sure. Yeah, and the shit's keeping it started. I mean, dude, it's just weird shit. I don't know, but I want to I want to bring in, you know, we talk a lot about something else, a little side track on this convo real quick. Kanye West is back in the news. Have you seen his latest shurades? Oh, wearing the black KKK outfit. Bro, no, no, I mean, listen, I've learned my lesson with Kanye. Everything he does, there's a reason behind it. He's very strategic in that in that sense. Look, I got I got a theory on Kanye. Okay. But go ahead. Yeah, I mean, disturbing truth behind Kanye West unhinged and offensive interview with DJ academics. So Kanye West, West specifically picked internet personality DJ academics for his wildly offensive interview because he knew speaking to a man who was recently accused of acting inappropriately towards a teenage gamer with ruffle feathers. It's interesting thing, but either way, Kanye, who's 47, was dressed in a black KKK outfit and brandishing a giant swastika as he made a slew of shocking claims about his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian. Let's check. I got this short clip. Let's check it out. Where the fuck are they? I don't know. This is like a fucking crack house. I mean, the fuck looks like it looks like a trap house. Kanye West, this is a clip. The thing that I forgot to say was when my daughter was put on stone, that's when I realized that I didn't own their name and likeness. So watch this. All the brands that I've made. I don't get the name and likeness ownership or at least 50-50 with my kids. So how's it joint custody? My kids are celebrities and I don't have to say so. So watch this one. So there's white woman and this white family have the control of these highly influential black kids that are half the children of yay. And that's just an everybody face. And they was playing in my face like that. I try to go to the champion and keep it calm. And my dad would call me say, yeah, don't go in on that woman because it's going to affect the children. But now it's like it's warrior. Y'all know they think they're too powerful. The Jews think they're too powerful. They think they can get Cardi to play with me. They think they're too powerful. They think they can get Kim to play with me. Is that it? Yep. What's your thoughts on him? I think there's a lot more going on than what people realize. It is. Now, now it's very... I think he is. I think he's definitely working with a very clear intention. He's very strategic. He's very strategic. Look, man, how do you get everybody to pay attention to you? What's the game of the internet? What is the game of the internet? I come on here for fucking 10 years straight and put out information that legitimately fucking helps people make money and improve their fucking lives. Where's that shit all over the internet? Right? But the minute I say something, that is offensive at all. It gets fucking 50 million motherfucking views. Okay. So we have to understand that the game of the internet is about attention. That's what the game of the internet is. The game of the internet supersedes the game of the media. There's no trust in the media anymore. Okay? So to get attention, the most amount of attention, you have to say the most outrageous shit. We have to understand that this man has been very, very successful at harnessing the attention that he's been able to create. All right. And so what this is about is this is about him having a beef with people who run the record labels, people who handle his celebrity. I don't know what you want to call it, progress or whatever. His quote unquote, handlers, you know, he talks about this being put in to fucking hospitals and drugged up and shit and made it look crazy. Okay. So how I see what's going on here is this dude's acting as crazy as he possibly can to get the most attention he can because he knows that the media and social media influencers won't touch him. So the only way that he can get attention and get people to listen to him is by doing the craziest shit. And by doing the craziest shit, he is drawing attention to things that are not okay. Such as people of influence and power, fucking forcing him to do certain things because they don't like what he did. All right. So whether or not there's truth or untruth or whether or not it's reality or it's not reality, that's not what I'm here to say. What I am here to say though is that he's not a dumbass. I don't think he's going crazy. And I'm pretty sure he's intentionally doing this to draw attention to certain things. Okay. Certain things such as I don't know. Argentina declassifying. Oh, you have this. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, speaking of not secret documents on the Nazis who fled Argentina after World War 2 being declassified. The documents will likely include Nazis linked bank accounts and records documenting the use of Nazi rat lines. Okay. And in this release, allegedly, now this is a German headline. In this release, allegedly, it will be told, not sure if it's true or not, but there's always been theories about this that Hitler actually escaped and did not die in Germany at the end of the war, but escaped to Argentina via U-Boats and lived his life until the 60s. In fact, they said that he fathered two daughters in Argentina. This has been a theory for many, many years that has been always told to be crazy conspiracy luni shit. Right. Okay. The skull that is supposed to be Hitler's skull that Russia claims to have is actually a female skull. And that is, yeah, that was the bug. That was the bug. Okay. A lot with, they're, listen. And this is not Holocaust denial. This is not fucking any of the shit. This is actual things that allegedly happened that are now being released. I got the files. And so this goes right along with what Kanye is doing. He's trying to draw attention to things that are not as they appear to be. That's that and like dude. And I think there's a way to address these things and I think there's a way to not address these things. I think to say it's the Jews is not a responsible thing to say. I think saying that certain members of governments and certain highly corrupt people that are very powerful that you know, don't just exist in Israel but exist in other places who may not even always be Jewish have come and collaborating together for a long time to create certain things. Okay. Certain things that are bad for most of humanity. So, you know, personally that that's what my take is on the Kanye thing. Yeah, I mean, I mean, these documents are crazy. We haven't here for you guys. These are declassified documents. These are the ones I have came from R CIA who were doing, you know, ops in Argentina to verify this stuff. And it's crazy when you dive into it, man. It is it is wild. This first one. Now it's important to realize who's releasing this. Right. It's you guys know the crazy looking dude with the fucking chainsaw? That's who's doing it. Okay. Me lay. Me lay from Argentina. Yeah. Okay. The guy who basically appears to be a populist. Yeah. Okay. Now this this this this document here. This is this was released and it basically shows it talks about this woman whose name is kind of been scratched out. But saying that she was she owns a hotel. Okay. She somehow inherited this hotel in Argentina called La Fala da in Argentina. It's a largest spa hotel in in Argentina. And they met with her and she basically, you know, said 100% that she had support for the Nazi party that she made a deal with Hitler. If you look at part D down here says that if quote if Hitler should at any time get into difficulty wearing it was necessary for him to find a safe retreat. He would find such safe retreat at her hotel La Fala where they had already made the necessary preparations. Now this is where it gets crazy because there's new document that just came out. I mean we'll read through this shortly but says on September 29th on September 1955, Chimalti III reported the following. Neither Chimalti nor his station is in a position to give an intelligent evaluation of the information and it is being forwarded as of possible interest. Chimalti was contacted on 29th September 1955 by a trusted friend who served under his command in Europe and who was presently residing in Marraqabo. Chimalti preferred not to reveal the identity of his friend. Chimalti's friend stated that during the later part of September 1955, a Philip Ultrichen, former German SS troopers stated to him confidently that Adolf Hitler is still alive. Citrion claimed to have contacted Hitler about once a month in Colombia on his trip from Marraqabo to that country as an employee of the KEN SM or the Royal Dutch shipping company in Marraqabo. Citrion indicated to Chimalti's friend that he took a picture with Hitler not too long ago but did not show the photograph. He also stated that Hitler left Colombia for Argentina around January 1955. Citrion commented that in as much as 10 years have passed since the end of World War II, the Allies could no longer prosecute Hitler as a criminal of war. Then on 28th September 1955, Chimalti's friend, Seren Dipidously, obtained the photograph with Citrion referred to. On 29th September, the photo was shown to Chimalti for purposes of getting his reaction to the possible veracity of this fantastic story. Obviously, Chimalti was not in any position to make any comments. Nonetheless, he borrowed the photograph long enough so that this station could take any action deemed advisable. Photo stats of the picture were taken and are being forwarded. The photograph was to be returned to its owner the following day. The person on the left is the alleged to be Citrion and the person on the right is undoubtedly the person with Citrion claims is Hitler. The backside of the photograph can contain the following data. Adolf, Strykelmeier, Tonga, Colombia 1954. Check this picture out, bro. Yeah, well, I mean, that's fucking Hitler. I mean, look, dude, it's wild shit, bro. Just to be clear, these are official documents that Argentina is releasing. I mean, can you talk about that? Okay. Now, now, if the other countries in the world start releasing classified documents about certain things, this is going to pop open into a real story. And the reason this was on Fox News last night, by the way, this was on CNN. Okay. The reason that mainstream media is having to pick it up is probably because it's true. Okay. Because do you think that mainstream media would pick up a narrative like this and publish it on their site if for any reason it furthered any sort of quote unquote anti-semitism? Right. They wouldn't do it now. Okay. So they have to report it because these are official documents that are coming out of Argentina. They can't ignore it. They can't say it's fake. They can't say it's conspiracy. And, you know, it's going to open up a lot of questions that have a lid of the of the official narrative of World War II, which is in which nobody wants. Okay. World War II and what happened in World War II in many places in Europe and other places around the world, you can't even question it without going to jail. All right. It's a crime to question it. Why is it a crime to question that? Reality. Why is it a crime to question that, but not a crime to question any other war or any other genocide or any other, you know, human tragedy in the history of Earth. But only that. You can't cannot fucking question it. I know why. What, dude, yes, because you're not being told the entire truth. I learned history repeats it so. That's right. And so when we consider it, you know, people, so many people, this is such an offensive thing to even say, but the truth of the matter is, is there's lots of evidence that says this. All right. So we have to be open enough and smart enough to be able to question really anything, especially after all of us witnessing how they just lie to us during COVID straight up lie to us. You know, that was an eye opener for everybody. So like, dude, we're, you know, and people will twist conversations like this and say, oh, you're denying the Holocaust or your, your, your anti-Semitic listen, it's not anti-Semitic to question things about history just because you're afraid of what might be found out. Okay. It is okay to ask questions. Perfect. And that's not a dog whistle for anti-Semitism. That is a logical thing for anybody who's witnessed what's happened here in the last five, six, seven years to say, well, fuck, dude, if the whole media was coordinated in this big lie, what did they lie to us about before the, before the internet and all these things came out? You know, because dude, the internet sort of forces transparency, which is by, you know, a parent by what happened over the last, you know, five years or so. And look how they've tried to control that. I know, but they can't control it. Yeah. So like, I think Kanye is trying to draw attention to corrupt powerful people that he deems is the Jews, which I disagree with. Now, many of them may be Jewish, but the average Jew is not a part of that. But at the end of the day, man, I think he's, I think he's drawing, I think he's intentionally drawing attention to himself to point out things that he believes that we have been lied to. And some of which it appears that we have been lied to, like Hitler, not getting killed in World War II, which has been talked about for that story. That's the story. That's the case. Yeah. So it's interesting, man. We'll see. Yeah. We'll definitely see, because the more and more is going to come out. Yeah. And, but the more they try to suppress it, dude, and the more they call this dude crazy and the more evidence that emerges. And that just makes it look more true. Like they are lying. You know what I'm saying? So like, if they really aren't lying, then they should say, okay, well, here's our argument. And here's the facts. And here's what we have, not just call a name. Right. Because in my opinion, when you just call a name, that's the end of a constructive discussion or argument. And that's what we see on the internet, right? Like the minute that someone brings up any of these things and just says, Hey, what about this? What about that? What about this? You're this. You're a racist. You're a transphobia. You're an anti-Semite. Well, the minute they call you that, you know, you're you're you're over target of something. Because why not just give you back a logical discussion that shuts that down. And that goes for not just this situation, but it goes for racism. It goes for transphobia. It goes for, you know, all of the shit that, you know, they shame us about. And so, you know, I, you know, I the real thing, what I think is the more they, the more they fucking attack this dude, the more he's going to try to be this way. And, you know, it, there's a lot of people that are like, there's a lot of fucking people that are starting to question. I just don't buy into the idea of collectivism or collective responsibility. I don't generalization. I don't like it, bro. I think it's, I think the way I see the world is very simple. It's good people and bad people. It's very simple. There's good people and bad people of every race, every religion, every ethnicity, every country of what, whatever you want to fucking call it. There's, there's good black people. There's good white people. There's bad black people. There's bad white people. There's good Jewish people. There's bad Jewish people. This is, this is not something that we can define by making generalities. That's just running right into their playbook, dude. You know what I'm saying? Just as bad as they say. Yeah. So like, dude, when we identify corrupt individuals at the top of power structures and, you know, let's say, let's say fucking 80% of them are Jewish or 90% or let's say 100%. That's doing out all the fucking Jews, bro. You know what I'm saying? And like, dude, most Jewish people that are like, just regular, they're just like everybody else, bro. Most black people are just like everybody else. Most white, they're trying to fucking get by, man, they're doing their fucking best. They're trying hard. They're trying to get by in life. They're pretty decent people. You know, maybe they fuck up sometimes, but like we all do and, you know, like, bro, this, this, this generalization is such a dangerous way to view the world. And they've propagated us to see it that way, right? And I don't think it's right. I don't think it's fair. I don't think it's correct. And I think it's what drives what they want, which is ultimately the division between, you know, every possible point of contention that we can have race, socioeconomic, you know, religion, like all of the things, right? gender. Yeah. I mean, fuck, dude. You know, now you see it with the Muslims, too. They're trying to say that because the Muslims, you know, there's a sect of Muslims that killed a bunch of Christians. They're trying to make it seem like all of Muslims want to fucking kill Christians. That's not true, dude. This is not true. I mean, I have friends with a lot of Muslim dudes, bro, and that some of them are some of my best friends. I don't know. Maybe I'm naive, but I don't think they're trying to fucking kill me. You know, I'm saying they don't seem like it. Like, you know, I've turned my back to them plenty of times. I still have my head, you know, saying like fuck, dude, you know, like this generalization, like, it gets us nowhere. Yeah. And that's where I, that's where I don't like what Kanye is doing, right? Because it's creating a dangerous, there's a lot of people look up to him, bro. He's a very smart dude. He's very talented, dude. But by doing it the way he's doing it, I understand that that's the only way to get attention on it because they'll ignore him. It's the same thing that Andrew Tate does. Andrew Tate says a lot of very useful shit, but he also says a lot of shit that makes people say, what the fuck was that? Well, that's because dude, they won't give you attention unless you say that shit, right? How many times have I gotten credit for the good shit that I say? Yeah, no. Very little. No, never, never, no one ever runs a story and says, this motherfucker's helped all these people fucking get their lives together. That doesn't even happen. That's never happened. Right? Like real talk with 75 hard. I probably impacted more fucking individuals success of personal success of individuals than just about anybody else. Real talk going right now. How many good articles about that? Are you killing people? That's right. I make people drink too much water and they fucking die. Right? Like, so we live in a world where negativity is rewarded with attention. All right? And and and dude, when we, but when we generalize entire groups of people, it gets to be very fucking dangerous. I don't think it's right. I wasn't raised to see the world that way. My mom and dad didn't raise me to see the world that way. No. Like I was raised to see good people and bad people. And I, I think, I mean, I think you can attest that that's how I truly see the world. 100%. That's why I can laugh at racial jokes. You know, say it. That's why I can have a good time. That's rude. Like I don't fucking, I just think we should all see it that way. I think that's how we should see it, man. I think there's good people. There's bad people. There's of every fucking category you can come up with. However, you want to slice it. 100%. Do you do not agree? I 100% agree. I want it. That's why I want to test it out real quick. We need to check the pie. We got brand new segment. Oh, all right. Who did it? Oh, oh, so we're gonna go right into it. Oh my god. Now this is gonna work. We're gonna take turns. Okay. You'll read a headline and you'll make a you'll make an assumption. Well, you already know all the answers. Huh? What? Yeah. I mean, it's fine. Okay. All right. So you're gonna expose my houses work. So you're gonna read a headline. You're gonna tell me if it's your people, if it's my people. What's my people? Good people? Sure. I don't remember the good people. Well, let's just give it a try. Are you ready? You got the first one. You got to read it. I'm lucky to be alive after sustaining car crash injuries, tripping over my cat. It's a tough one. Man, it is a tough one. I would say, I'd say that's why people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Once you got a cap, one of the perilous cats, looks like a fucking rat. Anyway, damn dude. What the heck? I'm sure he's got a story about it. Shit. He's got a story about this. Here we go. We got sweet treat loving man granted dying wish to be buried in a Snickers inspired coffin. All right. That's show people. Yeah. That's show people. Yeah. There's show people. Yeah. There he is. Yep. All right. There's show people. I mean, I guess it's cool. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Here you go. Oh, Beast woman with five lovers ordered them to abduct and torture six man who displeased her. I'm gonna go with both. Who go half right on the split? I'm gonna go with there's some white and black people involved. Oh, your people. Bro, it is. Holy shit. All the dudes look the same. Bro, she went out fucking fucking all the clones. Bro. What's that Star Wars one with the clones? Yeah, this is a tack of the clones. Yeah, fucking fans should not be cloning. I want I want five clones to rate me. Wait, did she? So, so so one of these dudes is her husband. Uh-huh. And then the other four are her lovers. And then I guess they try to bring it a fifth one. He displeased her. So she sent all five to go get him and torture him. Like, bro, this are people. Shit. Man. Wait, how how does this woman have power over those dudes? Do you even see the woman in there? I mean, the one without the beard apparently. Yeah. I mean, that just looks like it. One of them without a beard. That's true. I mean, even the guy up on the right, he's got a little beard. Yeah, you got some peach. He's working on it. Why they all look the same man? These people did it. Why they all look fucking same. Where where was this? This has to be hold on. Let me guess. I don't know. I don't know. It wasn't down south. I don't think I think it was actually somewhere in northeast. No way. Yeah, I think so. This looks like this looks like East Kentucky. Let me now I got to see real quick. Hold on. Wait, let's see. Where? Ohio. Okay. Fucking close. Ohio. Yeah. Close. All right. I had it down to the region. Yeah. All right. Here we go. Next one. Chicago. Alright. I got that one. All right. We'll go next. That was too easy. New Hampshire woman arrested for urinating and grocery store food and filming it after cops find trove of similar videos dating back four years. I don't know, man. Oh, come on. What? That's your people, bro. Yeah. I mean, come on, man. Pissing on the floor. Have you seen the way y'all people act in grocery store? No, okay. All right. Brazen women skipped out of restaurants with worth $200 check. Okay. All right. I'll take we got this one. We got this one. Yeah. For sure. It's us. But you know the dumbest part, but they posted it on fucking Instagram. They tagged the fucking restaurant on Instagram. Thanks for the free food. I mean, bro, these are these, this is low IQ behavior. 100%. 100%. Yeah. I'll take you. We'll take that one. No, it's not even will like that. That's you're not a part of that. You're not a part of that. You go to the nicest restaurants to get the nicest shit, bro. And then you tip nice. I tip nice. Yeah. I'm a good tip. You're not them. That's true. That's what I'm trying to say here. You know, I ain't I ain't fucking with those fat fucking dukes. I had you looking motherfuckers. Okay. What about Dalmatian onesies? Florida man dressed in Dalmatian onesie. Outruns, street proof. That's white dude. Yeah, for sure. All right. Yeah. Who did it guys? That's it, man. I think you're a little racist, though, because there was like way more white people that did shit. I had to skip by the one who was just too obvious. Chicago crime. Yeah. Come on. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, man. All right. Well, let's keep our cruise cruising. We got our third set of headlines still. Let's talk about deportations always like giving updates on this. New things are happening. El Salvador accepts more alleged trend around with gang members from Trump administration. Another round of flights. They say fuck the judge. Good. Yeah. Basically what happened? You put the judge on the flight. I should. Yeah. Anybody who's standing in the way of this to get these terrorists back into our country should just be sent on one of those flights down there. I do die. If you want to be around them, we'll send you down there to hang with them. I agree. Yeah, you can go down and you can go into one of the prisons. You can be marched around with no fucking clothes on, but you're underwear. You could sleep in the light 24 hours a day on a fucking bunk with no blanket from the rest of your life. If you want these people here and you're going to stop them from being deported to the places that they deserve to be, and you want our American citizens to be harmed because that's what you're saying by asking them to be here, then put them on the plane with them with it. Yeah. So we transferred another group 17 alleged members of Trin Deo Bagua to El Salvador from Guadalupe. It's really easy to make those decisions, bro, when you're not being affected by them, you know, when you're a judge and you're sitting in your nice fucking house, you know, you got police security not signed in front of your house all the time and, you know, nice and safe. Yeah, you're nice. It's really easy to fucking make these decisions. You know, I'd ask Lake and Riley's family what they think about you stopping these people from being deported. That dude, it's crazy. That's crazy. They post a new video. I guess it's like a new trailer for these transports. Let's check this out. This is the president of El Salvador, by the way, yeah, he makes these. Yeah, they're awesome. It's fucking great. They're badass. Yeah, let's check this one. This newest one out. Oh, it's fucking awesome. Oh, it's fucking great. I love how they perp walk them real fast. So they have to like jog with the chains on their feet. That's great. Yeah, dude, those white women that were protesting outside of Tesla, they'll be like, look at the human rights violation. But what about the human rights violation? They've already committed on everybody else. They violated what did they killed or raped or fucking stole from or beat the fuck out of or stabbed. Okay, let's talk about let's put priority of human rights with that, not with, oh, they shaved their head and they put them in a van. Bro, they shouldn't even do that. They should throw these motherfuckers in a wood shipper and be done with it. They shouldn't even be paid. The only reason that I like this is because it has to really suck. I think it'd be easier to be put through wood. If I had to choose and I got to choose the wood shipper or sitting in a in that place for the rest of my life with in my fucking underwear with no shoes, no clothes, no blanket, no pillow, the lights on 24 hours a day with all these other fucking dudes around. I'm fucking choosing the wood shipper. Real talk. Prison should be that way. It should be so fucking bad that you don't want to go there. You know, and now you have people out here who think like, oh, well, it's not that bad. I get my food pay for. I get to watch TV and get to play video games. I get to send this. No, none of that shit should exist. If you go to prison, it should be fucking miserable. And then people don't want to go. Well, you've never been to prison. It is. Well, apparently it's not that bad because we have people talking about it all the time. Yeah, no shit. You know, yeah, no shit. Somebody else is on their way out though. I thought this was this was we recovered this guy while ago. Migrant influencer turned swatter ring leader deported advocating taking over his homes. This guy. Yeah, this guy right here. Lionel Marano. He is out. Remember how cocky he was. Dude, it was fucking disgusting. Yeah, it was disgusting. Yeah, they're gonna take your house. It's fucking disgusting. They're showing all the money he's getting showing them going to fucking you can't even get the gun. Yeah. Yeah, and he's out. They put him in jail or he's just out. No, he's deported. Yeah, he's out. That's too bad. Yeah, I mean, I should be going to see side, but it's fucking ass white, bro. Well, that's what you get for coming here and fucking around, man. Fucking idiot. And then he cried. You remember? Hmm, heard you cry. No, no, no, no. I heard you cry on the airplane the whole way down there too and caused big disruption. Did he? Yeah, it was I read this. Yeah, I read in the article that I read that he fucking freaked out on the airplane with like a cry fit, which is, you know, part for the course. Usually the people that act the hardest like this motherfucker is the biggest pusseys. That's a big guy. Yeah, bro. Didn't he grow his hair out of something like that? Yeah, it needs to grow bullet hole in his head. Oh, Jesus. What? What can we not say? You guys all fucking scoped like that's the baddest thing I ever said. So we were. Yeah. I mean, look, dude, you're going to come to another country threatening all the people. Fucking talk about how you're going to take their shit. That's what you deserve. That's the American way. Bro, the craziest thing. So like, well, I remember like us having this combo a couple of months ago, we just sum up like the numbers, like the numbers, the amount of people that are in this country illegally. Then I'm not supposed to be here. No, I think we used to say what was the number? You said like 21 million. Yeah. Do you know the new estimates? What they're saying now? So this guy, um, yeah, 35 to 40 million, 35 to 40 million people. Yeah, residents. But remember, when when I went when you and I first started saying it was 15 to 20 and people like, it's only like six. Yeah, right. Right. Right. Right. That's what CNN is telling you. Take that and multiply it by 10. Well, this guy, Matt O'Brien, he's a farmer immigration judge, um, lead investigative farmer immigration judge. Yeah, he's estimating that 35 to 40 million. So many people in the stadium is very seven million people somewhere around there. I mean, he said he equated seven eight million. I think he equated it to there was more more legal rates six and a half. Yeah. He said there's more illegal people in this country that are going to work in the state of New York. So this fucking, this fucking, this is five times five to six times the amount of the entire population of our state in the last four fucking years. It's fucking crazy. Man, bro, that's treason. That's treason. That's crazy. I also love to like all those flights that are going back right with all these, you know, residents, you don't see families. There's no families. No, it's just these fucking dudes. Dude, these guys are on camera. If you search the internet, dude, you'll find videos of these people on camera talking about how they're going to culturally take over the United States by raping the women. It's sick. It's sick, man. Yeah. Well, have a good flight. Good trip. Fucking ass. That guy's jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. With that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show as always. We have thumbs up or dumbest fuck. This is where we're bringing headline in. We talk about it. It gets one of those two options. Andy, are you a golfer? I used to play golf to play golf. Yeah, right? Yeah. I mean, were you decent? No, not really. Yeah. I listened, dude. I played golf from the time I was probably like eight or nine into my mid 20s. No, into my early 20s, then I stopped for like two years. And then I went back and I was really bad. And you know, not that I was ever any good, but I was really bad. I'm trying. Dude, it's a hard sport. It's listen, golf is, I mean, golf's difficult, I think. And unless you practice it and dedicate it takes a lot of time, dude. Unless you play and hit balls every single day, you're not going to be very good at golf. Yeah. You'll be decent. No, I don't even think he'd be that. I think for an average athlete, for people like you and me to be decent at golf, we hit balls every single day. A guy who's gotten great at golf, they might be able to hit balls not every day, but they better hit them consistently. Super perishable. Yeah, for sure. It goes away real quick. That's for sure. I like golf, though. I do too. I got a golf trip later this year. I'm supposed to be good ones to you. Where? Uh, Colorado actually to play golf. Yeah. Yeah. We're hitting like three of the main places out there. Oh, really? Yeah. You going with, uh, you're buddy? Mm-hmm. You're really? Yep. Big Donovan. Yeah. Donovan. He was such a good dude. Oh, Donovan's good. Yeah. Um, yeah, this is about golf, though. Uh, this is about golf. Let's check this out. Uh, golfers, caddy picked up a turtle at the Houston Open and what happened next left fans horrified. Yeah. Little mysterious headline there. Um, so golfer Taylor Pindrith, uh, would have paid his caddy around 25 G's, where his help at the Houston Open this week after a viral moment with a turtle. He earned every dollar. A video emerged on Sunday from the Texas tournament, appearing to show Mitchell, Thorey picking up a turtle to move it safely out of harm's way as Pindrith battled his way up the leaderboard. But as Thorey, uh, carefully held the turtle up, it urinated so much that viewers were left amazed at how much water turtles can hold. Let's check this clip. All right. Who's going to pick up the turtle? This caddy is, uh, oh, no. Oh my god. Oh, no. I mean, he had to go. That is a lot of piss, though. I mean, for a little bit of guy like that. Well, I mean, bro, what would you do if some fucking giant came out of fucking nowhere and just picked you up in the fucking air? And then he holds you up a hundred feet in the fucking air because that's what it would be like. It's not important. You know what I'm saying? Like you'd be like, oh, man, I got a p real bad. I'm trying to get home. I'm trying to go. Yeah. I got trying to get over here to my grass in my spot that I like to pee at. Whoa. And they're up in the fucking air. I mean, bro, let's scare the shit out of you. That's true. This is true. Somebody said they said this turtle might have had one too many at the bar before the round today. He doesn't know he's a turtle, bro. He's just like living in this fucking big ass thing comes and picks you up like that. It's true. Yeah, that's scary, man. I care to you. That was a lot of pee, though. Oh, that was a shit, tunnel. He must have really had to go. No turtles could hold that much. I really didn't. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this 2026 screen, I think was this final payout 23 gram. Yeah. So so pinjith won $336,000 for his finish. And Caddy's are usually paid around 7% of their players' winnings for a top five. Not bad. That's not bad at all. Yeah, but remember, that's not a day's work. Oh, yeah, that's multiple fucking rounds. No, it's not a day's due. It's practice. It's hitting balls. It's they're with them all the time. Like, just remember that people like so fucking. No, but they for me to cut it must be nice. You know, like motherfucker say that to me when I pull up the gas station, right? You know, nice, nice fucking car must be nice. All right, bro. You know, saying like go work for the last 25 years, 24 fucking hours a day and then get rewarded with a motherfucker car. Let me talk about how fuck it. Yeah, it's it's not terrible. But yeah, but you know, it's not like I didn't fucking like it must be noise to fucking land in my fucking lap. That's what people think, dude. They look at athletes. They think that too, bro. Look at all the pro guys that come in here and train. They're in here every mother fucking day. They're busing their ass for four or five hours of fucking day. Every day. And people see him go out and get, you know, this big contractor, whatever, most be known as bro. Go out there and hit a hundred mile of our fastball. Let's see you. Let's fucking catch that, bro. You can't even see it. I tried to like the fuck you do. If you stand in the box, if somebody throws you a fucking 95 plus mile an hour fastball, you cannot fucking see it. It looks this fucking big. You can't see it. But I tried to throw a fucking Trevor, bro. There's no way. And he wasn't even fucking throwing it. Listen, I'm aware I've played enough baseball in my life. I know. There's no way. Dude, you got to kind of guess. And those dudes at the top, they're not guessing. They're placing the ball where they want to hit it. Like dude, there's so much. There's so much practice and so much work and so much skill that nobody ever sees into anything great, anything great. And then people only judge the end result. And they assume like, oh man, it must be nice. Oh, he must have got lucky. Where the fuck were you to last fucking 20 years? This motherfucker was putting in that work. Oh, you were eating ding-dongs. Watch your fucking Netflix. You know what I'm saying? That must have been nice. Yeah. And then you expect to get paid like a motherfucker who just grinds for 20 years to be good at something. The fuck out of here. Don't work like that. Yeah, don't worry about that. Where are we giving this caddy, man? I mean, he looks like he's doing his job there, buddy. Like, you know, that's a healthy stream. That is. That must be a young turtle with no prostate problems. And he had trickle in yet when he gets old. It comes out a little trickle. Is that it? Sometimes. Hey, man, you can't help it. It's what happens. You see, you come crying to me one day being like, the trickles, Andy. Bro, you're gonna go to the fucking drippy drips. Is that what's I call? No. You all fucking laughing because you're old enough to fucking have it. You motherfucker over there too. I know you're funny. So you guys have issues on both ends. Huh? No. Just wait till you get older, motherfucker. I'm gonna make funny you so bad. You're dude, he's gonna be coming in, Joe, and be like, bro, you're never gonna Gus. What the fuck? What the fuck? Yeah, you're fucking. It's called being 40. Is that what it is? Yeah. Oh, gosh. You shit's just different. Yeah. I mean, you can still look good though. Hey, I'm a casing point. Well, guys, Andy, that is all I got, man. All right, guys. Don't be a hoe. Sure, this is your own.
