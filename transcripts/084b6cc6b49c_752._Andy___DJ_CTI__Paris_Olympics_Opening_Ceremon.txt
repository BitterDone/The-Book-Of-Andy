seller.com guys can find them all linked there for you with that being said let's get into our first headline let's travel the world and let's let's go check in on France um France seems to be the talk of the town um let's head on reads Paris Olympics drag queen torchbearer ripped criticism of opening ceremony we ain't going nowhere we ain't going nowhere Nancy Nancy doll we'll see we'll see uh so a drag queen who is one of the many torchbearers for the Paris Olympics had a message for the critics amid uproar over the opening ceremony which appeared to mock the last supper. Nikki doll was among the drag queens to carry the torch of the Olympic flame but also performed during one segment of the ceremony doll reposted an image of his Instagram stories claiming the image depicted was not of the last supper uh but the feast of Dionysus um as I quote the opening ceremony did ruffle some feathers and I love it doll wrote on his Instagram stories on Monday morning you know why because the Olympics are the biggest stage in the world and us queer people have always been the audience of other people's lives and achievement and it is time that we are welcome in the space on sunday doll called it an honor to perform at the opening ceremony so what what's doll talking about let's look into this a little so there's doll right there i It certainly ain't some of those people's last supper. It should be, but it ain't. They ate twice after that. I'm still hungry. You hungry? Yeah. Oh, man. But, um, and listen, they've been getting a lot of black backlash. Organizers of Paris Olympics apologize for parody of last supper. They've even had a sponsor. Pull out their advertisement because of this. All their sponsors should. A lot of them are starting to, uh, we were shocked. Olympic sponsors ceasefire. Pulls ads after mockery of last supper. What are they talking about? Performing the song. King costumes. I don't know if they need to leave this song behind. You know, it's not me, but I'm about to sing the song. Oh, we weren't with knocking the last supper. It was something else. Something really. There's exactly the same amount of people sitting at the table in the exact same position. Everybody knows what the fuck they just did. Yeah. And so C-Spy put out a tweet saying quote, we were shocked by the mockery of the last supper during the opening ceremonies of the Paris Olympics. C-Spy will be pulling our advertising from the Olympics. That tweet alone has garnered over 9 million views on that, on that post. Yeah. And that normally super anti-cancel culture, but this is way over the line. Yeah, I mean, I don't even know if you consider this cancer culture. There's a company that's standing for their right. That's right. At the end of the day, like, listen, like Christians all over the country. All over the world. This is a world issue, bro. Yeah. This is a world issue. This is not just here in America. That's we have to understand. Right. Yeah. I think I said country, but it's global. I mean, Christians all over should be pissed at this because it is a mockery. We're not, you know, if this was had been any other religion, it would have been a problem. You know, and the fact that Christianity gets to get mocked like this, it's disgusting. But here's the thing, you know, that drag queen, Nicky Dawg said, we're not growing anywhere. That's funny because they've, you two, they started pulling that opening ceremony from everywhere on the internet. Yeah. That's right. They deleted it off the internet. Isn't that weird? Yeah. That's weird. Truly thought provoking there. Metro UK reports that the Paris 2024 Olympic Games kicked off with the grand opening ceremony along the river Sian on Friday showcasing a blend of French culture, artistry and athletic athleticism. Did you see any athletics? I mean, if they were considering like the fourth joy hot dog you got guys, an athletic event, that girl they got in the Jesus position should be eating some fucking food holy shit. Like bro, listen, I know what it's like to be a fat fuck, but I mean, there is like limits, there is limits. And she has far past the limits. Yeah, for sure. But yeah, so they pulled it off of their YouTube account, the official YouTube account, they pulled it off of there. And, you know, it's always interesting because behind these things, there's always, there's somebody behind these decisions. Yeah. Somebody made that decision to put that up. Right. Who, who, who in their right mind would be pushing something like that? Well, let's find out. Let's meet the French theater director behind the Olympics drag queen, same sex, four play, queer, last supper opening ceremony. By the way, did you notice the slip up there? Oh, Jesus. But yeah, so who was responsible for the unfolding artist for you guys on the rate or on the audio? This dude here shows balls was just hanging out of his pants. You can't show that and you're gonna not put that in the show. That was just for your viewing pleasure. Oh, thank you. It's so thoughtful. I love to open my Mondays looking at gay people's balls. It's just the right one, too. It's like the or any balls. I want to look at straight balls either. That's true. That's their mind. I like your mind every Monday morning. Huh? I look at my every morning. And evening. Brasser, who was behind this? Let's meet Thomas Jolly. This guy right here. Thomas Jolly. He's so brave. He looks brave. Yeah, he's so Thomas looks brave. And by the way, that opening ceremony was viewed by over a billion people globally. Yeah. There's like out of a billion, there's like a hundred thousand thought it was cool. Right. Probably less than that. Yeah. Well, because it's fucking disgusting. But what did he have to say about this? He said, how do you write a show in which everybody at one point feels represented in a part of this bigger thing, this bigger us, he says. It's ambitious, but also complex because one has the broad and one's own imagery, one's own outlook and include everyone. Understand everyone so that no one feels left behind except every straight person and every Christian and every Christian and every normal motherfucker on the face here that isn't Christian and pretty much everybody except the freak show that was up there and the fucking freak show that fucking supports this shit that we're all sick of. Okay. And it's not homophobia or this or that you motherfuckers shove this shit in our faces. We respect our religions and demand respect and demand our tolerance and demand a place in society. Yet you repeatedly disgrace the things that we believe in intentionally to get our attention. You think we don't see you? You're six four to 50 with fucking women's clothes on and balls hanging out. We see you. We think we don't see you and our children's schools. We see you there too. And to the person who said we're not going anywhere, we'll see about this because you're uninformed. This has happened before. This has happened in history before and if you would go study your history, you would probably maybe reconsider shoving this down everybody's throat because what happened in history before when y'all did the same shit wasn't beneficial to you all. You guys are poking the bear and you're poking and you're poking and you're poking and you're poking and when people get upset, you call them bigots. You say they're intolerant. You say they're this, they're that. They're homophobes or transphobes. You're making your own resistance and you're making your own resistance when you are 0.04 percent of the world population. 0.04 percent against everyone else. You just spit in the face of two and a half billion Christians worldwide. Do you think that's going to help or hurt your cause? Right. You see what I'm saying? I move you forward to set you back. No, it did set them back. It set them back a hundred years because people are pissed. Even Iran's pissed. Okay. And Iran is pissed because they viewed Jesus as a prophet and Iran is angry about this. And it's so interesting because I mean, we've seen these type of headlines all the time where it's like, God gets mocked and some really bad shit happens. And it's interesting because shortly after that opening ceremony, there was actually a blackout in Paris. And guess what? The only thing that didn't get didn't blackout. Yeah. It was the fucking Basilica. Right. It's a very, I don't know if you've seen the pictures or if you've got seen the pictures, but I mean, dude, it's spooky. Right. But like, that's the only thing that remained lit. Right. When everything else fell into darkness. You know, and so it's like, you know, we see this time and time again, man, God does not like evil. It does not like ugly. You know, no. No. And we shouldn't be tolerating this. No. Okay. Here. Listen, these people, if given the opportunity, if placed in a position of authority and power, they will kill everybody. Not like them. If you don't celebrate them, if you don't, this is trapped about out. Yes, dude, this is not about being welcome in the space. You're not welcome in the space. You forced yourself into the space. If you wanted to be welcome into the space, then how about being respectful? How about not jamming it down people's throws? How about not trying to force people's kids to watch your fucking pornographic bullshit? How about that? How about don't paint your paint yourself blue? Yeah. It's right there. Listen, man, it's disgusting. And honestly, I'm like equally disgusted at people who talk about their Christianity all the time and talk about how much they love God who don't have anything to say about this. And they don't do anything about it. They just sit there and take it. It's fucking fucked all the part, man. But in another interesting turn here with all these Olympics and stuff going on over in France, apparently the French fiber optic networks, they were sabotaged. And it's been a bunch of coordinated attacks that also paralyzed the entire rail system ahead of that. So a number of fiber optic networks have been sabotaged across France just days after arson attacks, paralyzed high-speed train services during the Olympics opening ceremony according to reports. Cables for several telecom operators were purposely cut in six areas of France earlier Monday, police told the French outlet, Arjun's French press. This is today. This was, yeah. Oh, right. And so you have all of this stuff going on, the cut and cut and lines, setting lines on fire. There's a lot of disruptions going on over France. And there's even more like it's continuing on two days. You got French vandals and major new arson attacks, hit telecommunications, cell phones, fiber optic lines, they keep going, right? And it's interesting because, you know, like who's, like who, who would be doing this? You know, the immediate thought with all the gays should they got going on there, that it would be some far right, you know, people that are pissed off of it, right? But yeah, not them. Guess who it was? Ultra leftist. Isn't it? Was it not gay enough? Like what was the, I don't know. No, bro, these people are fucking terrorists. Okay. They're far left leftist, they're communist and they're terrorists and they're activated. And there is no repercussions because the people who are in office share their beliefs. So if we go out and try to defend against these people, they put us in jail and let these people do whatever destruction they feel like doing. Okay. We see these little, mom's basement. Yeah, we see these little protests of a few hundred people running through the streets with communist flags. You see that shit? Yeah, do you have a little help here? Yeah. And they think they're the, they think they're in the majority. No, they're just willing to leave their house and go fucking make their presence seen. Yeah, man, like the video, this is a video clip from Philadelphia. That's what I was talking about. Like this is insane. Yeah. Yeah, the fuck out of our fucking country, you fat slabs. You fat disgusting lazy, non-contributing, purple hair, fucking fucks. Okay, I'm fucking sick of it, dude. Look at these people. Look at them. If you're on the audio, you should come to this point in the show and go look at these people. These are people that do not contribute. These are people that are not doing anything. And yet they're demanding that they take what the fuck you all work for. They deserve these people deserve what you all work for in their minds. They think that they deserve what it is you go out and work your ass off for for existing. These are the people, bro. None of these people are contributing fucking anything to society. And these people are becoming more and more and more prevalent because they are purposefully tanking the economy so that there's more and more and more quote unquote poor people that appeal to this ideology. You know, kill the rich, fucking feed the poor. Yeah, bro. They're fucking disgusting. Listen, these people don't deserve to be in our country. They're not, these people should not be tolerated at all. This ideology, bro. Like I know we've said it, but like it has literally killed more humans than literally anything. No, in our, the other side, this attitude of let's take the high road and let's pretend it's not happening and let's just, you know, things will work out. That's how these genocides, the whole demours and all these ethnic cleansing of people who are anti-communists have happened. Because eventually these people get so strong that they fucking get power and then they fucking kill you. Okay. You know, when you guys look at these people and you laugh at them and you say, oh, these people, their organization, what they believe in has killed more people in the United States and globally than any war, than any sickness, than anything. In the last hundred years, 124 years combined, these people, these nerdy, fat, disgusting people that do nothing. When they, and people think it's a joke, they think it's a joke. This is not a joke, dude. It's global, too. It's a global problem. These communists are all through the Western culture. They're in every single country. It's, it's globalization slash communism. It's the same principles. And they need, you guys need to take them serious. Yeah. Now guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. I was that being said, let's go check some of these comments out. Let's cruise the comments. Yeah. Dude, that shit makes me mad, dude. Yeah. That fucking, that fucking open communist shit in our country. I don't understand how it's even there. Well, I do because everybody keeps looking the other way and they say, oh, it's not that big of a deal. Oh, it's not that big of a deal. Oh, it's not that big of a deal. Oh, you know, Andy's overblown it. These guys are alarmists. They're overblown it. Really? Have I overblown? You guys have been saying that. A lot of you have been saying that about me for a long time. But what have I said was going to happen that hasn't happened? And I'm telling you, you let these motherfuckers continue to build momentum. They will kill you and they will kill your fucking family because that's what communist do. Yeah. Guys, let's know what you guys think down in the comments. That being said, let's go cruise some of those comments. Andy, I need your defense. Okay. All right. This comment comes from at J Allen, 68, 62. Says 1776 slavery was legal black host. Damn, you were lost. I was a sorry, Maslow. What's the point of that comment? How fucking stupid are people? Like how stupid are you stupid motherfucker? When we say 1776 and we say what this country was founded upon and we talk about those things, we're not talking about going back to slavery dumb fucks. We're talking about the same attitude with the Constitution with all of the shit that we have progressed through during this time. We're not saying, hey, we're going to fucking make black people slaves again back in 1776. Hey, DJ, get out of my field and do some fucking work. That's not the fuck we're talking about. And you guys who are like these leftist dumb fucks dude, they're total morons. They're literal. It's these people in that video with the communist. They're complete morons and they have been taught that because they're educated and because they made their way through school, that they're somehow more intelligence than you. There is a difference between intelligence and education. And in fact, critical thinking intelligence is a much higher level than education. Education is for lost people who need to be indoctrinated into a belief system that they can't determine on their own through their own observation. We got another one. This comment comes from at peace SLP 9. Andy, I'm just wondering when the grape smash in with you drink will be back in stock. My son has a birthday coming up and the neighbor's kid has a pretty sweet bike that I know my son would love. I'm man, we'll try to get it out for you. Try it, you hooked up. We do got to get it back out there, man. Yeah. So stay tuned. Bro, how about this? Why do they always say that? Why is there like, why are like, dude, we got to stop fucking thinking we're going to get through to any of these people. They're not stop stock. Yeah, we're not completely. They're so fucking stupid that you cannot make like bro, they legitimately think Trump's shit was fake. Yeah. They think it was fake. They think J6 was a real insurrection. If that was a real insurrection, you dumb motherfucker, where the fuck were the guns? Do you think that the people who own the most guns of any people in the world are going to have a fucking insurrection not bringing the guns? Number one. Yeah. Okay. And then we say, you know, Trump killed the border, Biden had all this border and he said not to sign it. Yeah, that's because of an omnibus bill with all kinds of shit in it that was talking about sending your fuck well, not your money because you don't have a job, but our money over the fucking Ukraine. Like these people are fucking insane. They're still talking about the very fine people and Trump being a racist. No, bro, you know what's racist? White women telling you how fucking oppressed you are when they're sitting in their little mick mansion and they're voting for policy that actually keeps black people handicapped, which is the democratic policy of the modern day Democrats. Whole platform, bro. Yeah. Oh, but they can't get IDs. Well, do you know how racist you are to think that black people aren't smart enough to get IDs? That's a pretty fucking racist. You can't use a computer. Do you know how racist you are saying that black people don't know how to use a computer? Right? Oh, they can't perform as well at jobs. So we got to we got to give them preference at their jobs. That's not racist. That's not saying that black people are inept and they can't handle their own shit. You know, things to me, they sound racist. That sounds like you have a core belief that black people are less than white people, right? So let's get clear on what the racism is. The racism is not saying, hey, motherfucker, you can do the same thing everybody else can do. The racism is saying, hey, I know, I know that you know, you're not as smart as me and you're not as capable as me. And I'm going to go to battle for you because I'm going to it's white guilt, bro. See you. Yeah. You're heard. Fucking idiots. Yeah, they fucking do total idiots total fucking morons can't fix stupid. No, you can't. Who's over these silver six to reslades? No shit. Yeah. Listen, probably wouldn't that bad back then crime was probably low. Here and he was high. This last one comes from that Laura five seven seven five. Andy, I'm going to be real. My vagina has made some really bad decisions in the past. Now that I'm older and wiser, the last thing I'm going to do is vote with my vagina. Real women know it's all true. I don't know what to say to that. Sounds like you. It sounds like you use a reparenting of your vagina. But dude. I'm sure I mean at least there's some common sense there. I'm grateful. Yeah. Okay. Moving on. Good vagina decisions. Yeah. Oh my gosh, we appreciate you for being a real ass fan. Thank you guys for liking and commenting. Make sure you guys are subscribed on the tube and hit that bell notification. Stay up to date with the latest episodes with that being said, let's keep moving to headline number two. This is an interest when we got to follow up on this on this story, man, because more and more keeps coming out. So let's dive into a Trump assassination attempts. Text reveal officers were aware of Thomas Crooks 90 minutes before shooting. Now this is this is obviously interesting. There's been talks that they were aware. Now we have some concrete evidence, some real proof coming from some subpoena text messages from law enforcement. So let's dive into this. So text messages revealed that law enforcement responsible for monitoring former president Trump's Pennsylvania rally spotted his would be assassin and flagged him two colleagues as suspicious at least 90 minutes before you open fire. The text messages obtained by Fox News Digital from Senator Chuck Graschley who obtained them from Beaver County Emergency Services Unit show that officers flagged 20 year old Thomas Crooks after he was spotted using a range finder but did not approach him. And so let's dive into a couple of these. So this is this is the one this is one screenshot image. And they actually have a picture of Thomas Crooks sitting on this like little concrete stoop thing. And there that's then that's the response team inside the building. It's not the picture. Yeah. Inside the building. And the text message reads kid learning around I believe you meant leaning kid learning around building we are in a gr I believe it a gr is the American glass manufacturer building a gr I believe it is I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage FYI. If you want to notify SS or secret service snipers to look out I lost sight of him also a bike with backpack sitting next to it in the rear of building that was not seen earlier. And then to which another person responded call it in to command and have a uniform check it out. There was another set of text messages this came probably an hour before that text message was sent out for 26. That says quote someone followed our lead and snuck in and parked by our cars just so you know I'm just letting you know because you see me go out with my rifle and put it in my car so he knows you guys are up there he's sitting to the direct right on a picnic table about 50 yards from the exit to which a secret service agent replied with a thumbs up emoji and then another secret service agent replied Roger that and so this is interesting. Now we all know that there's been this FBI investigation that's been going on right the same you know agency that has a very great record of investigating things but Trump has since agreed to be part or be interviewed as part of the investigation. Former president Donald Trump has agreed to be interviewed by the FBI as part of an investigation to it is attempted assassination in Pennsylvania earlier this month a special agent said on Monday and disclosing how the gunman prior to the shooting had researched mass attacks and explosive devices. Agent says quote we want to get his perspective on what he observed and said Kevin Rogik the special agent in charge of the FBI's Pittsburgh field office quote it is a standard victim interview like we would do for any other victim of crime under any other circumstances. Now they have already interviewed 450 people to kind of get a painting of what exactly happened still no motive still no confirmation if he was a lone gunman. There's a lot of kind of say that then I'm going to say it. Well you think they're going to do an investigation and then say oh guess what guys we did it. Right right but here's the thing you know and then it just dawned on me you know Trump's going to be doing this interview about this attempted assassination but what attempted assassination because according to Google it doesn't exist dude dude didn't you see that you know wild did you talk about the AI bro how the AI said that it was a fucking a fictional event fictional event fictional event so let's go you're talking about here yeah it's a bunch Google search and no and then Facebook's doing it oh bro they're censoring it you in Google you can't even Google Trump assassination and you have to type it all the way in and hit enter like this yeah this is crazy the auto feels shit yeah you know and and that's real too dude this is like what I tried to and that's a hundred percent real it's real man and Donald Trump Jr. he actually posted about this on Twitter he says quote big tech is trying to interfere in the election again top common hilarious we all know this is intentional election interference from Google truly the speaker okay yeah we know it's the spicable bro and I like Don Jr. we know it's the spicable but what the fuck are we going to do about it you think it's okay for our fucking big tech companies to censor something as serious as an assassination who the fuck do these people think they are but then they call they say no no ones that want to remove are these people that think that it is okay to do this like think how much of an egomaniac fuck sociopath fucking I'm so much higher than the rest of the world I am untouchable we'll just fucking edit it out of our fucking search we'll just fucking put it in our AI that it was fictional we'll just make it so you get fact check when you post the picture of him right after you got shot who whoever does these things should be in fucking jail I am so sick of the lies I am so and I know you all are too are we not sick of this shit are we not sick of them just lying to our fucking faces and using their tools to change history and change narratives like we're a bunch of second class citizens these people are rich because of us these people exist because of us they the the politicians that allow this they have those positions because of us and they use their power over and over and over again to lie cheat steal manipulate gaslight all of us this is absurd shit bro the people behind this should be in fucking jail today they should be arrested today every time they get caught you know what they say oh it was just a mistake well I'm sure the mistakes all go against our shit and for your shit yeah fuck you that's exactly exactly with Facebook so so so it obviously this was a coordinated effort right I believe a call was sent down to whatever little group comms they have hey I need Google everybody get on the same fucking page no no no let's reverse it back the group call came earlier from in this topic the group call was hey we know that kids there don't do anything about it right and then the group call was let's go ahead and let him go up on stage all these people that made these key decisions it's very key to grow these people should be arrested today they should have been arrested weeks ago okay there is a person who made a decision to not handle that kid there is a person who made a decision to send him up on stage anyway who are those people what are their names why are they not arrested okay this was not some soy boy fucking basement dwelling nerd who did this on his own this was a conspiracy to kill the president of the United States and they've they're almost acting like it didn't fucking happen well that's just trying to make sure it's not fucking good a week later we're celebrating like Kamala is the the savior of the world when she's been a total moron and everybody bro even the left two weeks ago was making fun of her and now she's the savior which by the way all of that shit is fake it's all bots they had fucking 400 people show up at her fucking rally one of her rallies she just did there was like 60 people at so all of you out there saying oh man she goes so much momentum blah blah blah yeah bro it's all fake but but to the right and to the conservatives and to the moderates who are voting for Trump you better remember they fucking stole the election with 12 people and and Biden's rallies in 2020 so you guys you guys laughing about this and say oh my god this is so embarrassing they've already stolen an election with worse yeah yeah yeah so finished enough on this though man so even Facebook finally comes out and says oh a wrongly censored one of their one of the senior senior people executives up at Facebook this one about the name of Danny Leaver she says yes this was an error this fact check was initially applied to a doctorate photo showing a secret service agent smiling and in some cases our systems incorrectly applied that fact check to the real photo this has been fixed and we apologize for the mistake so sure yeah whatever you know who like you ever notice that those mistakes of the censorship are always against the Trump side yeah I can't the fucking other side people are fucking fucks completely man bro I am just so sick of these people thinking that they have the right to impose their will and cheat and lie and steal manipulate to get their way in this country bro that is not a democracy that is not a constitutional republic that is not a free and fair society these people are criminals and we need to stop tolerating their criminal shit guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's go check out this third and final headline we got a we got a head overseas again we're going to go to Venezuela let's go check on Venezuela man this headline reads Venezuela and communist tyrant Maduro learned tricks from US democrats blocked election observers from access to ballot counting rooms where has that that's been done before oh yeah don't you remember that in 2020 when they were putting up paper in the windows oh like this we're kicking them out I think it was eight attorneys and I don't understand why eight attorneys need to evaluate this order I did it all by myself it says we think out later than ten thirty today you're to follow the election code and we mind people my clients representatives are to be within six feet of the process we have read the order they just ignore court orders completely I know and then they say oh it's a conspiracy you guys are crazy that didn't happen they didn't steal an election they put fucking paper up in the window they fucking at ten thirty eleven thirty at night the fucking election was over bro and we all woke up and Biden won and the curve goes straight up you mean to tell me he got a million fucking votes down Trump again one and of course of three hours bro and then they just ignored the orders they just ignored them yep that woman right there should be in fucking prison well 100% and the thing is man it looks like Venezuela just took a playbook around with it man because that's exactly what it looks like it's happened in Venezuela to where you know even Javier Miley the leader of Argentina chimed in on this he put out a tweet saying and this was translated but he says dictator Maduro out Venezuelans chose to end the communist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro the data announces a crushing victory for the opposition and the world is waiting for it to recognize defeat after years of socialism misery decadence and death Argentina is not going to recognize another fraud and hopes that the armed forces this time will defend democracy and the popular freedom advances in Latin America now apparently they you know after he closed the the ball is he closed the the places where the elections the actual election polls themselves Maduro did and used the state police to do it and he's now announcing that it was a 51% in his favor it's like you know but that's not what the exit polls show in fact the exit polls are showing that it was a 66% for Ed Mondo Gonzalez who was the opposition leader and only 30% from Maduro and uh it's super interesting so they cheated 36% of the vote 36% and then just close the polls and everybody here thinks that Trump's got in the bag dude you guys are insane dude these people well these are the same communists that are here by the way they're all globally coordinated yeah yeah and so you know and and he's uh he's took power and called called called victory essentially um and so I'm interested because you know again like it looks very very similar oh what they did here now this is both Wisconsin and Michigan in 2020 yeah bro isn't that infuriating to look at like like looking at this graph and then thinking about what we've had to deal with for the last four years and think like look at the space between Trump and Biden's curve without that spike like Trump was beating his ass and then they just fucking shut off Trump shit and cheated just dump it yeah and then they acted like you're insane for saying something about it dude I'm not gonna I'm not and I haven't ever been but like you guys the rest of you you have to get pissed off you have to give vocal okay they're counting on you to shut up when they say oh you're just a conspiracy theorist what are you talking about you're crazy what do you mean J6 was fake look at what he did what do you mean the election was stolen you're a domestic terrorist like dude that's completely normal yeah that's totally normal totally normal that like if you're listening on audio you need to come to this timestamp and look at the graph and then think about what you've been through the last four years because of this now you know the worst the worst part about all of this Andy you want to know what the ice and on the cake is with this here is the US response to the Venezuelan election didn't fucking come all appraise it US calls on Venezuelan government to release specific data on election saying senior Biden administration officials on Monday said Venezuelan election authorities must release the detailed precinct level results from the election also we can question their elections but anytime anybody questions our elections you're terrorists for domestic terrorists yeah get the fuck out of here yeah it's interesting man because again like same playbooks you know this is them covering to look like see see we hold standards on this we believe in that election integrity what did come I didn't come I'll say something about this I thought I thought she said something about like praising the dude it's an eye-tech group oh yeah I see it I see it what did she say I'm about to pull it up yeah yeah no she did this was this was her tweet from the official VP official Twitter she said quote the United States stands with the people of Venezuela who expressed their voice in today's historic presidential election the will of the Venezuelan people must be respected despite the many challenges we will continue to work toward a more democratic prosperous and secure future for the people of Venezuela yeah so they're apparently they're not on the same thing yeah that's not saying anything yeah that's a that's a no comment comment which she's excellent oh yeah she's great at those yeah United States is great because it states that are united yeah that's basically our entire platform yeah um but and it is interesting because again like you like you mentioned but like this is a global communist effort and they do the same shit everywhere um and I think it's I think it's hilarious I mean remember what just happened in France right right but it's like I mean if we look at yeah with the snap election and shit we're mccron in them right and it's like but even just look at the last week of Kamala Harris like take her for example all of a sudden she's seeing this massive spike in support allegedly right allegedly which is what they want you to believe right her poll you dig into it till you dig into poll she's she's up 10 plus points and like what's happening she's raising 200 million dollars in a week it's complete bullshit it's complete bullshit and they're saying the 66% of her donations from the last week um they come from first-time contributors and white dudes for Kamala Harris white dudes and white women did you see this fucking clip yeah uh aerial photo affectionately known as Mrs. Frazel to her combined audience of over 1.5 million followers is here to help gentle parents us through this election thank you hi everybody wait wait what what is that that's the typical fucking leftist stupid shit wait what is that I don't know what is what is what you do over their head 0.5 million followers is here to help gentle parents us through this election thank you hi everybody I am so honored to speak today I am like shaking to just be among such incredible company um we are here because as if you were here earlier you've heard bipoc women have tapped us in as white women to step up listen and get involved this election season this is a really important they've tapped you in like like a fucking wrestling match they call yeah tag team yeah they they dialed in the carons they found out the brunch keep going this is a really important time and we all need to use our voices and influence for the greater good no matter who you are you are all influencers in some way so tonight I'm gonna share some do's and don'ts forgetting involved in politics online and navigating the toxicity that comes with it and spoiler alert as much as the toxicity can come from the outside it can come from us too so first don't isolate yourself we can do our best work when we're in community together like we are tonight has the toxic feels smaller when we support each other but don't make it about yourself as white women we need to use our privilege to make positive changes if you find yourself talking over or speaking for bipoc individuals or god forbid correcting them just take a beat and instead we can put our listening ears on so do learn from and amplify the voices of those who have been historically marginalized and use the privilege you have in order to push for systemic change as white people we have a lot to learn and unlearn so do check your blind spots you are responsible for your algorithm believe it or not okay these are the women these are the white women who are voting for the party that is going to send your children to war to die for this country these are the women who are going to vote for the party that are going to ruin you economically and ruin this country these women by watching this for 30 seconds you can tell this is a dumbest mother fucker on the face of the earth who doesn't know a god damn thing about what she's talking about and she is on their gushing because she's so anti racist that she could speak for bipoc people okay now these are the people that sit at brunch and talk about the goings on of the world and outliberal each other in every sense of the of the way these are the people this person right here who thinks that black people can't get a fucking computer and black people can't get a fucking ID and black people need special privileges because they aren't smart enough to succeed on their own which is i don't know what's more racist than that okay these people right here inherently believe that they are better smarter and more effective than black people and they are coming to black people's rescue okay and then these people believe that if they vote for this other party and we go to war that you and your fucking kids should go fight the war for them now i want you to think about that just think about it that's what we're dealing with okay we are dealing with people who have no problem being uneducated have no problem saying whatever they think is emotionally correct because these people don't deal with any of the fucking consequences do you know who deals with the consequences you the taxpayer you the regular american family who has to send your kid to fucking war to fight for the policies that these people who don't know shit believe in it's it's fucking infuriating these people this is why i say unless you have a fucking w2 and you have a job and you collect fucking a paycheck and pay taxes you should not be able to vote because that would eliminate half of these people automatically my default yes thank you white women like what happened to you listen dude i don't understand i mean obviously you know i am not a fucking black man but i don't really understand how any black person could look at these people and think man those people are really on my side really for me they really love me dude i want to know who is the black person to call the tap them in like who they that's didn't happen these people insert themselves sick them on them so listen bro these people insert themselves because they grow up in such a soft place in the world that they feel like it's their duty which by the way a soft place in the world that they did nothing to create nothing so so their parents are their situation or where they were born was so kush and so soft they feel guilty and they want to fucking help everybody else and they don't realize that they're actually super racist and they actually hurt these people because they advocate for the party that is victimized inner city black people for 60 fucking years they come in every two years every four years and say hey guys it's the white guys fault we're gonna fix it and then they go and they get all this legislation passed and then they filter the money back to themselves and it doesn't make it to the schools and it doesn't make it to the infrastructure and it doesn't make it to the community and then the same people come back next year and they say yeah we were gonna do it but the fucking Republicans bro and the white men they fucked it up and they do this over and over and over again yes you're the same shit man do you listen to their fucking mind man no they're broke people men and boys go to war because of people like this who will never have to fight anything they'll never have to face anything and we're gonna go to fucking war for this dumb bitch who doesn't know shit who's gushing because she has 1.2 million followers and you know it's our job to you know protect the by-packs the fucking by-packs the fucking by you mean the fucking Americans right they're living the fucking the half the you mean the American people that happen to live in the cities right my like bro we're Americans we're not white we're not black we're not fucking yellow we're not fucking gay we're not straight we're fucking Americans you go anywhere else in earth we're Americans they hate us the same okay yeah and fucking we got dumbasses like this who came up in the liberal fucking indoctrinated system who think they're hyper intelligent bro and like they're like I mean it's even I've seen this one this this lady oh god no but I would like to see it you want to do holy shit yes let's see that let's suck this one I am the bear can't wait to see what comes out of this thing I don't know it's this reminder but apparently a lot of y'all do I am not a man I am not assigned male at birth shock it I am an assigned female at birth fem non-binary person if there is a choice between a man and a bear I'm the one that gets to choose also so it's not a choice stop fucking saying oh my god I would totally choose the bear of you just because I'm standing up for liberation okay you don't get to choose between me and the bear okay I get to choose between a man and a bear and if anything I am the fucking bear that will tear apart the man who hurts you do you understand me like and the fact that men do not understand why we would choose the bear literally just proves everything stop treating me like I'm a man I also I spent the majority of my life being red and treated as a woman and I still do so seriously stop treating me like a man do you understand me well hold on also it doesn't even matter what I was assigned so she just said I spent the majority of my life being treated as a woman and I still do and the next thing out of her mouth was stop treating me like a man so which is a bitch or sir or bear whatever the fuck you are what I was assigned at birth but it does matter how I was socialized as honestly it does matter and I was socialized as female okay I was socialized as a woman and I hold all of those traits all the way through I will never choose the man because I will always choose the fucking bear so I think so definitely not mental illness now apparently there was like a pole that went out and they like pulled women like who would you rather be stuck in the middle of the woods with a man or a bear and I guess she got some some crap from her other from from the other days from that she got some clack you're not supposed to go some crap from them yeah you're not supposed to vote because you're that's what I listen lady but it's interesting you don't want to be looked at as a man take all the shit out of your fucking face and get a fucking femme haircut and shave okay second yeah secondly you might want to check yourself because you sound mentally retarded all right and if that offends you I'm sorry but that is what she sounds like don't be mentally yeah and and third of all again you know I would choose the bear over the man but you know war cracks off and it's these bitches are in the kitchen make a sandwich as a shit not only that well how's that is it work you sure about that bro you know what these people need bro they need violence yeah they need to experience violence if any of these people had experienced a little bit of violence in their life even a fucking fist fight they wouldn't talk like this they wouldn't act like this no that's one of the greatest things about MMA is that it humbles the fuck out you you realize that any this is why men behave differently than women men go through their entire day understanding that if I say the wrong thing or if I do the wrong thing there's a potential that that man standing two feet away for me might punch me in a fucking face I'm not like it so I'm gonna be respectful of that man and I'm going to you know we might have a disagreement and I'm gonna say some shit but I realized that there's a line there's a line that if I step over I am risking violence women do not understand that they do not understand that that's why they get so chirpy that's why they talk so much shit that's why they do shit like this or they get online and advocate for causes that do not fucking benefit their male counterparts at all they don't think about how much harder it's gonna be in the economy they don't think about how much harder their brother or their dad or their husband's gonna have to work to make ends meet they don't think about fuck if we go to war because of this man it might be my dad or it might be my son or it might be this or it might be that they don't think about these things because they've never experienced any violence at all any they haven't seen it you know why they haven't experienced violence because of men because men protecting them but men are shit but men are I'd rather hang out with the bear you know what I'm saying like broke this is fucking bullshit and all you fucking feminists you're full of shit too because you advocate for women and women and women and women and women and then you're gonna say you're gonna vote for fucking Kamala when Kamala won't even fucking tell you what a woman is until she fucking running for president then it's first I'm the first woman that's something I just can't rectify in my brain I think a lot about it like how can you be a woman that claims to care about women to vote for a woman who can't tell you what a woman is how can you do that and then not only can she not tell you what a woman is unless it's about getting the first woman into the presidency they allow men to come into your sports and to come into your locker rooms and to come into your spaces and pretend that they are women while they erase everything that a woman is but you're still wanting to vote for them because they're the first woman now it's important how does this make sense dude how does it make sense where are like where is the fucking critical thinking at all I got more to say but I ain't gonna say it because like it's just really after after dark yeah it's just not like look bro I think most women get it but there's a segment of women that other women who get it need to stand up to and tell them to shut the fuck up I agree you know no I'm being serious bro all you normal women who have normal lives and respect men and love your brother and your dad and your husband and your boyfriend and you know you care about this country even a little bit you better realize that there's a group of women out there that are gonna fucking ruin the goddamn country for real because they don't understand what I'm talking about at all and they feel it's their place to posture and virtue signal and all this virtue signaling by all these privileged fucking women is gonna get your dad or your son or your brother and deep shit and it's gonna make their lives a lot fucking harder and what needs to happen here is regular American women need to tell these women to shut the fuck up forcefully if have to yeah imagine your fucking kids going to fucking war and dying because of that fucking crazy bitch's point of view which doesn't even make sense that she's only talking about because she wants to be popular on social media and accepted with her brunch friends and your fucking kids are gonna have to go fight a fucking war in the middle of fucking sandbox that we shouldn't even be in it's infuriating dude yeah I mean that's a lot of people man they think they're more like they think that they're so entitled to their opinions and that their opinions are so right because you got a few followers or whatever the case is no ladies shut up I think this lady she does like one of those the she's one of those ladies that do like the the kid shows like that's where her influence comes from you know she's like one of those like miss Rachel type girls I don't know who that is I don't care I here's what I care about bro I care about our men not having a country that claims to be free be much harder and not free than it should be and it's happening because of these fucking white middle class upper middle class women who were born into this situation where they feel guilty and they feel like they got a virtue signal all this shit doesn't make any fucking sense they're the useful idiots of the communist party bro that's exactly what they are okay like and it's dangerous because it's gonna get real people fucking killed for them oh we're gonna go over there and fight for democracy for who's democracy anyway yeah guys jumping on this conversation now let's know down in the comments what you guys think I'd like to see how tough these chicks are when the fucking war breaks out and they're told they got to go fight on the front lines we'll see how fucking much you want to be with the bear bitch you see what I'm saying bro these people are full of shit our country and our society has gotten too soft they don't understand what real hardship is they've never had a fight for a meal they've never experienced violence they've never experienced being completely poor they don't understand it and so that they this is where all of this bullshit comes from yeah if you saw someone get shot in the fucking face or stab in the face or fuck killed right in front of you you think differently I've seen those things you see those things fuck dude women real women need to stand up to those women you know guys ladies jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think of that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumbest fuck this is where we bring a headline in we talk about it and it'll get one of those two options and I know you want to go want to go deep sea fishing right you like you'd like to do that shit I like deep sea fishing yeah and I'm genuinely been trying to think about it bro it's awesome yeah I'm not even like a hunter outdoors type guy because I love animals as you guys know but I like sushi too I listen I don't know what it is but like I don't look at fish the same as I look at other animals and I might be wrong and it might be bad
