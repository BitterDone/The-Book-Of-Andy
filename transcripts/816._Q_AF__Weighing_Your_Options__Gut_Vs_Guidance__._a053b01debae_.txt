on mental toughness and has the entire live hard program in a much deeper detail it also has 10 chapters on mental toughness why it's important how to cultivate and how to use it in your life along with a bunch of case studies from people that you know who have used mental toughness to become the people that you know okay so Andy for sell dot com the book on mental toughness now something we do different here on the show you're gonna notice we don't run ads the reason we don't run ads is because I don't have to run ads I'm independently successful and I don't want to listen to what people think I shouldn't say it's called real AF okay so we keep it real here I don't get influenced by people all the opinions you hear are mine and mine alone or DJs and his alone and we ask very simply instead of us making money running ads that you just support us okay and that looks a couple different ways one you can share the show all right we're constantly dealing with censorship issues so we need your help to grow the show to show makes you think if it makes you laugh if it gives you a new perspective if you get some good information do us a solid and share the show around okay it could be a post could be a recommendation could be a story but every show that brings you value the deal is you got to share it okay the other thing you could do is you could go into your local store and support first form you can get an energy drink you can get a protein bar you get a meat stick keep yourself healthy keep yourself moving all right so and it's stored as a carry first form energy ask them why they don't all right so I think that's all yeah yeah so don't be a whole share the show all right what's up man going on man I got a little fancy there I don't know if you noticed no yeah I got a little fancy in the intro I liked it yeah little extra sauce you're the sauce boss the sauce boss you heard it first here boss of the sauce boss of the sauce I talk about that raise later all right so what's up dude what's going on man do we got the winters full of effect right now man bro you ain't kidding it is fucking cold dude it went straight from 80 to 30 bro and I ain't ready for it now I'm sure all these like Milwaukee people are cool you don't know code code is negative a thousand yeah let's start hot there taught in Brazil yeah you know but it's like fuck man it's cold man all right guys it's cold it's fucking cold here why what is it with people with that shit I don't know like they got to always compete for everything oh bro listen you know it's called Tommy topper syndrome Tommy topper yeah you we all know people like this we're sitting there telling a story you know hey man my friend you know he's he's six foot he's 250 he benches five bro bro my friend is 12 foot 500 and he benches a thousand okay there's nobody that big no you don't know he's from my old neighborhood yeah you listen to basement on my grandma yeah fuck man nobody's ever seen him you know like they got this fucking story dude it's like I'm cool but the worst people to hang out with are Tommy topper Steve bro you tell a story and they got a story that goes on top and they go to top it like what is that I don't know man but fuck it's annoying it is fucking annoying just know that if you're one of these people we make fun of you if you are Tommy the minute you walk away you are getting made fun of yeah and not you're not you're not getting invited next time yeah you don't even show my man that last time we had that event man yeah well dude it's Monday it is Monday it's Friday oh yeah but it's Monday I don't even know what day it is yeah that's one of these days of the week but we're here to make people better man so let's let's do this with question number one all right guys handy Andy first off thank you for doing this show and your others I didn't find this until two years ago and now and since then I've hidden multiple weight goals and other gym goals while continuing to compete for more I'm 26 I've been a commercial industrial electrician in Colorado for seven years now I completed a highly-recognized apprenticeship got my state license I've been with the same large company throughout my seven years while working for them I've made multiple personal connections and other job opportunities I have been informed one of my former locations I was at once me to work for them directly and we'll have the opening in the spring I've pretty much been topped out and pay at the company I'm at unless they move me into a higher position which they have expressed they're prepping me into the role that when the opportunity comes up quote unquote I'll be next is what they say and I'm looking to progress my career and it sounds like what I want however the other job opportunity starts with more money and better benefits for myself my wife my one-year-old I guess my question is how should I move forward with seeing both opportunities and not thinking the grass is greener on the other side when it may not be when I've built a good reputation with who I'm employed with currently but seeing the immediate benefits of going to the new opportunity I like the people at each job and I know each side has continued options to further my career as well and is the grass always green on the other side well obviously not the grass is always greener where you water it okay and when we get into a state of comfort in certain scenarios it can seem like the grass is greener on the other side but usually that's just because we're not appreciating we're not appreciating the position that we're in currently so what I would do in this situation if I were you is I would talk to the new company and I would get to the point where they make you an offer all right and then the offer and the decision is in your court then I would go back to the original company and by the way it's very important that you don't lie and I'm gonna explain why in a second okay so go get an offer make sure it's at the point where you can decide yes or no then go to your original company and say hey here's the deal I love you guys I appreciate you guys you guys have been very good to me I've learned a lot here but I want more and I want to progress I need to make more money for myself and my family I think I've been a great asset to the company if you disagree tell me but I think we've been had a really good relationship here now you've expressed that you want me to move into these other positions but even after that I'm gonna want to move into other positions and I'm gonna want to continue to move what does that look like for me to escalate through the the hierarchy here at this company in a very serious way and then they're gonna say well here's what he's to happen and they're gonna go through a bunch of things are probably gonna hit on some things that you need to improve okay and then when they say when when they tell you all that you're gonna say when do you think that's going to happen and they're probably gonna give you some abstract answer and that's where you then position the leverage that you have and you say look I've been presented with this other opportunity this is what it looks like do not lie because there's a very high likelihood that your current manager leader boss supervisor whatever he is is going to call this other company they know he's a they might know each other they might not know each other but he mentioned that that company that he works for did work for them so they probably know each other but that regardless of know each other not your current boss is gonna call to check and see if you're full of shit okay so make sure that you don't just pull some blue sky shit out of you out of you you know and present it to him because he's gonna know your full of shit and then you're really fucked they're offered 400 there and no then then you're fucked because you're not gonna get the position at either place so then I would position you know at that time I would show them the offer I would say this is what I got going on this is what my future looks like here this is what I'm thinking it's not disrespectful to you but you gotta understand I'm looking out for my own family and I have a duty and obligation to progress and I want to progress and I'm willing to do whatever I need to do to progress I would like to stay here because I've built a great rapport I love you guys how can we make that work and then let them talk all right and there there's a very good chance that they're gonna progress you right there because people who run successful businesses understand the investment that you make in employees and they understand what it takes to get an employee from ground zero to effective to a tremendous asset and it sounds like you are an asset so you're if your boss is competent he's gonna understand or she's gonna understand the amount of time and effort and money they have sunk into you and they're not gonna want to throw that out the window so there's a very good chance that you get promoted on the spot because dude a lot of times it just takes some stimulus to get someone to jump right like once this person understands that you actually do have another option over here they're gonna say fuck all right I can't let this go let's make this happen and that's the natural human reaction in that scenario so that's how I would handle it and then if they say well hey you need to go take that other position I would listen to them because a good leader is is is going to tell someone what is best for them right and and a good leader is also gonna know that if they keep you there and you don't progress you're gonna become a problem for the company so that's how I would do this I would go get the offer I would go talk to your current company I would see what that looks like get their actual before you presented to him get their actual feedback get their actual you know plan for you get a timeframe and then once they give you all that then show them the offer and then they will accelerate the path the reason you want to do it in that order is because the minute that that they tell you well that's gonna be four months or this you could say well look dude you just told me this is a path I'm equipped to do this I can do that and you can make a case for yourself so it's not like you know you present the offer and then they they they're gonna be negotiating back on the path that you might have does that make sense so you want them to lay the path out first and then you want to leverage them and that's how it should put the ball in their court correct yeah and if they say no you take the other offer yeah that's fine but you have to be prepared to walk away the person who is prepared to walk away in a negotiation always holds the leverage 100% of the time it's no different in any situation that you're negotiating whether it be a personal situation a business situation fucking friends it doesn't matter whoever is willing to walk away and mean it holds the power at that moment and they have the leverage at that moment so you have to be willing to get what you want you have to be willing to walk away that's the reality so in this scenario you need to have a good place to go so that you're not seeing at home with no income yeah fuck me I feel like I feel like what this comes down to man is people's ability to be comfortable and conflict or what they perceive as conflict you know I'm saying like these difficult situations or like even like even the fear because I feel like maybe it's just current society current culture right where like you know people don't talk about the paychecks with their their co-workers you don't like like there's a like a there's a certain atmosphere I guess in the workforce man it's like nobody's comfortable even just having basic conversations even when it means like it's your like to your advantage yeah but see you should always be comfortable talking about money you should always be comfortable having open dialogue about your career progress and I think most people don't succeed in life because they automatically label conversations that need to be had to progress their life as hard conversations they're not actually hard conversations they're not any harder than any other conversation it's words coming out of your mouth it's the same thing okay you're attaching the label of hard to it which is making you resist but if you look at past the conversation what's going to be past the conversation sure certain conversations in your life are going to be very painful when it comes to your job when it comes to your relationships when it comes to friendships sometimes with your kids the conversation part sucks but what's on the other side of the conversation what's on the other side almost 100% of the time is always a better outcome so the fact that you label the conversation as hard keeps you from having it which then keeps you from getting where you want to go and so most people spend their lives in the purgatory of agonizing over a conversation that would be very easy to have and produce the best possible results in the shortest amount of time but because they label it the wrong way instead of labeling it as a productive conversation they label it as a hard conversation so I would recommend that you guys start to see conversations that you may fear as a productive conversation not as a hard conversation because what happens past that is 99 to 100% always better for everybody involved does it does it easier yeah I mean the older you get it gets easier because you stop I mean look dude when you've been through enough shit and it doesn't kill you you become less afraid of stuff right like I mean you see how I operate right like I don't I don't hesitate at all but but dude also I don't have it will towards people like like even if I yell like let's say I yell at you or I yell at Madagher something I'm pissed at the team I you guys still know I fucking love you that 100% right like there's no there's no it's not like this you know what I'm saying so like if the intense right you know I don't know I just I don't know I think you mature into it I think you get used to it it's reps but I also think you start to understand what I just said is like I'm trying to get to the productive point as quick as possible right so the quicker I have the conversation the quicker we get to the point right and you know unfortunately I think most people rot in purgatory their entire lives and deal with a job they don't want or a marriage they don't want or fucking situation that they don't want in their life because they're afraid to have a conversation when in reality the conversation yeah dude it's gonna be it might be a little painful but past that everybody's happier you see what I'm saying yeah so you gotta start looking at as productive not as hard and you know a way to sit down and have those conversations it's say hey man I need to have a conversation with you it's gonna be a little uncomfortable but look dude it's gonna be good for both of us and we're gonna be better off let's let's tell you know I'm saying like it's easy to frame it's just productive it's not hard you think a lot of that too man is like people always have these like preconceived notions of what the other person is gonna say or feel well yeah because dude we've had I mean how many times have you had a conversation like this and the other person like overreacted or was rude or or reacted emotionally and those things traumatize us to the point where we don't want to have those anymore because we're afraid that that's gonna happen every time but the reality is is sometimes we're just dealing with immature people sometimes we're immature you know but at the end of the day dude we have to as adults be able to communicate in order to push our own lives down the road and if we don't develop the ability to communicate about things that really matter like our careers our relationships our money we're gonna lose you're gonna lose in all those things you're gonna end up broke you're end up in a relationship that you fucking hate you're end up unhappy and the whole reason that you're ended up in this place is because you're afraid to have a fucking hour long conversation you're trading a fucking hour of your life for a better life think about that yeah fuck man I'm not gonna love it man think why would you not trade an hour to two hours or three hours of your life for 50 fucking years to change the whole trajectory exactly yeah fuck me I love it man I love it guys Andy question number two hey Andy I'm 22 years old and I know I'm young and ignorant as fuck that's a good thing you know that good way to start that's right it is there's a lot I have to learn and I'm very eager to learn from others I feel I've always been very teachable I've been around livestock my whole life from my family and they've helped and taught me so much but recently I've started my own operations and I've researched different methods of operations that my family repeatedly tell me won't work and give me other advice I tell them it's an experiment and if it doesn't work I'll try something else my question is how do you determine the difference between being humble and teachable and going with your own ideas thank you for all you do for us well look nobody has all the answers even the people you ask for advice okay and this is very important for everybody to understand you need to be very very very discerning about who you ask for advice from and who you listen to we are bombarded every single day both in life and online by people offering us unsolicited advice they think they can give us advice about everything how to raise your kid how to do your job how to do fitness how to do business their opinions on what you drive how you do this everything is unsolicited advice and so when we're bombarded with especially online all this different advice about how we should do what we should do and this and that you need to realize number one and less that person is an actual expert in that field you should not ask them for advice no matter what their intent is for you because a lot of people will listen to bad advice from their friends because they think their friends have their best interest in mind and they probably do but just because someone has their best interests in mind doesn't mean they're going to give you good advice so it's very important that you learn to detach your emotions and logically evaluate is this person capable of giving me effective advice in the area that I am asking to be better in okay if the answer is no which usually is you got to find someone who's done that all right that your relationship you're gonna find someone who who is a relationship I don't think anybody's a relationship expert yeah I think these people they fucking talk about it online all day long or full of shit they usually end up breaking up making themselves look like fucking idiots on the internet that's a whole nother topic but my point is is we have to get to a point where we are able to discern and evaluate who is qualified to give us effective advice all right so that's point number one point number two how to balance the advice with our own gut feeling okay if you're talking to someone who is the best livestock rancher ever all right and he's telling you something and it's the opposite of what you think and this guy has a hundred thousand ahead of cattle and he's worth a hundred million dollars off of cattle no matter what you think is right you're wrong right he's right okay and so we have to we have to be able to be humble enough to know when our instincts are right or wrong or when we need to roll the dice on what we think because all innovation comes from going outside the norms of regular advice so if you only take advice and you only operate on someone's advice you're probably gonna win but you're not gonna develop anything new all right you're always gonna be in second or third or fourth or fifth place you're never gonna be number one so you have to learn to balance you're creative thinking with other people's experience and when you can do that effectively it creates a pretty good recipe most people can't do that because the minute someone has one good idea or two good ideas that work they lose the ability to learn because they think they know better than everybody else so we have to find the the the middle ground and that's just practice and being aware and being conscious of am I humble am I coachable am do I actually know this or am I just guessing and that can just be hard to determine sometimes so having people that that know better right like go to your rancher buddy the guy who's way more successful than you say hey Pete look man um I know that makes sense but like what about this because this is how I feel and what's likely gonna happen is gonna say dude you know what I thought that same thing back then but here's what I did I did this and this and this and it fucking didn't work and here's why I didn't work so what I would do is find someone and then bounce that gut feeling that you have off of them who has the experience to give you the advice and then you'll start to figure out what's what I love that dude I feel like there's a couple of things here man going out on your own you know you mentioned this a lot right like you you spent a lot of time before you that hockey stick really got into effect right and while you wasn't really you know I guess producing fruits you were still like learning lessons oh yeah you're in that time oh yeah so there is something to be said oh yeah just going out and being a dumbass it doesn't know anything no doubt you know I'm saying like let's talk about that a little bit okay well I'll give you a so so dude it's taking me 26 years of my life to get to this point all right and when I say that there'll be some internet fuck face that'll be like oh I'm fucking 26 years you really want to put that in blah blah blah blah blah okay I get what you're saying but here's the reality you who made a little bit of money and fucking a year or two years if we compete against each other my tool belt is unlimited yours is very small okay so I'm going to crush you a hundred times out of a hundred because all the shit that you think I've already known right so we have to put value in the process and while I tell the story of my own journey where I'm like hey it took me 10 years the for 10 years total I made 58,380 dollars and I tell the story right I lived in the store blah blah I didn't pay the first three years I tell you know the whole thing I am so thankful that it took that long because of what it taught me and that's what makes me effective at coaching and helping entrepreneurs win because I've learned all the lessons from zero to here and I learned them the way in a way that you would have to learn them so I'm teaching from a real experience not fucking theory all right and so you know while I would have liked it to take last time now that I'm here I'm glad it took longer because I learned all the stuff but you should listen to people who have been a dumbass like me and had to beat their head against the wall for 20 plus years because we've been through all the shit you're about to go through and have gone through so there's a big difference between someone who makes a little bit of money quick because due to it's just like that saying goes easy come easy go because dude if you make a little money quick you don't have the skills to maintain it or compound it or keep growing it you don't know what to do because you never did it all right I have yeah I love that man the other part too because I mean he specifically talked about his family and I know like family could definitely bring in you know they want what's best for you and obviously I mean they have some experience but I like for some reason this like this image came up of like okay like you know you got you know you're a logger I'm a logger right and you're using a fucking axe an axe cuts down fucking trees yeah for sure I want to use a chainsaw you know what I'm saying so it's like can we talk about just the dynamic I mean times like what they're maybe using is working for them because that's how they've been doing it but well look bro I mean you got to be able to adapt right well that's my point if you if you just do what someone who has already done says to do you you miss out on creatively finding a new way that could change the way that your company grows that could accelerate it could kill it right it could change the entire fucking landscape of business all right what do you you know the guy who dug ditches right like he digs ditches and then all of a sudden he's like fuck I come up with this machine called a ditch which it digs the ditch for me all right like that that you know where that idea probably came from it probably came from a dude to spend most of his day digging a fucking ditch and he's like this is fucking hard right but if he were to listen to the guys who dug ditches before him and they said hey how do you dig this ditch he's gonna tell you what the fucking shovel but because he was able to dig the ditch with the shovel and then have the perspective of digging the ditch with the shovel and decided fuck this is way too hard they came up with this machine and it does it for you okay and that would have been impossible had he just listened to the person that was giving him the lesson on how to use the shovel see what I'm saying so we have to balance what we can learn from other people with our own ideas and be able to know when to go with our own ideas or to go with what they said when we started first form the entire supplement industry was completely different it was all everybody sold through distributors okay there was like a two or three big distributors you sold to them they sold to the to the stores all right when we came along we said we're not gonna sell to the distributors we're gonna actually sell direct to the consumer from our own warehouse which people didn't do back then all right and everybody who own those distributors when they when I told them we were gonna do that you know what they said you're fucking insane it's not gonna fucking work okay and you know how many of those distributors are still open none and here we are okay now had I listened to them I'd be right where they are too you give them saying so this is a fucking now everybody's telling now everybody does what we do right and I was told the fucking what we were doing was stupid so that's a perfect real example of what I'm talking about I walked out of a meeting one time where one of the owners of one of the big distributors said dude that's not gonna fucking work and I said I think it's gonna work and you know what he said to me well then go do it you know where he is now I don't know I know where you are that's right he knows where I am to again and to it but like bro that's the point had I listened to him we'd be right there wherever the fuck he is I fucking love it man guys we got some young guns man we got a third and final question question number three hey Andy my name is Luke and I am a 20 year old business owner first of all thank you for your work as you would expect you have truly changed my life I used to sell electricity in the back of wall martes and now I own an exterior cleaning business we are two and a half months in and doing 30k a month my question for you is how do you handle stress I have been in a few stressful situations before but I've never gotten to the point where it affects me physically until today as an ultra successful business owner and man what are some experiences of high level stress you have encountered and what are some things you have implemented to handle it thanks Andy and DJ you guys are the highlight of my stressful day well look man you're 20 years old okay you you haven't been stressed is a relative experience okay what's stressful for you I would laugh at but only because I've been doing what you're doing for 25 years all right so just like when you get in a cold plunge the first day and you freaks you the fuck out and you want it like your hyper that's that's you right now okay dealing with base level stress as you progress down the pipe of entrepreneurship you're going to become more acclimated and more acclimated more acclimated to what to where I promise you in three or four years you're going to look back to this right now and you're going to laugh about how stressed you were over what you're doing right now okay now with that being said I'm not minimizing your stress because to you it's a massive problem all right so here's what you got to do and this is very hard when you're young first of all you got to realize that very few mistakes are fatal all right very few mistakes will kill your business now there are some that will but they're very few and the truth of the matter is the only real thing that can kill your business is you stopping your business okay so it's in your control no matter what happens no matter how bad it gets no matter if you get canceled or fucking embarrassed or you have a crisis you can always come back if you start if you if you fix it and do the right thing all right so there's that okay secondly when you are an entrepreneur a lot of times we make excuses to not do things that will naturally make our stress easier to handle like eating properly training with weights running cardio okay being outside we start to tell ourselves things like we'll flip dude I'm an entrepreneur I'm doing this and this and this I can I can be a fat or I can I used to tell myself this like bro when I was 300 plus pounds and and you know we had a business I would tell myself dude I'm too stressed no one knows what I'm doing no one knows what I'm going through the average person that works out all the time they couldn't fucking do what I do every day so it's okay and and here's the truth it's not okay all right and once I started eating properly once I started training properly consistently you know on the live hard program once I made it a part of my lifestyle my ability to handle stress went so far that I can't even tell you change my life and what when it goes up what that actually means is the stress that you feel feels way less intense so that is something that I think every entrepreneur should take seriously I think every person should take it seriously but every entrepreneur should take their discipline and their ability to cultivate discipline and be fit serious that is why the live hard program is a lifestyle it is not a trend it is not a challenge it is a fucking lifestyle that's why it's been around for so long all right so I will go listen to live hard on episode 208 of the podcast or buy the book off the website indepresow.com and start living that lifestyle the live hard program is meant to be replicated every single year of your life forever and I guarantee you if you do you will get better and better and better and better and better and your ability to manage stress will get better and better and better and better with that and that's important because the bigger you get and the more success you have and the more obligations and responsibilities such as many employees the stress is much higher you think your stress now wait until you have hundreds of employees whose all their families depend on you to fucking eat their kids depend on you for Christmas presents their everything depends on you wait till you're there and you think about stress okay and you don't want to get up and you don't want to do the job and you don't want to you don't want to go kick ass and and then you remember fuck dude if I don't do this that guy right there that helped me build this company who has three kids is going to have a problem feeding those fucking kids you see what I'm saying that's real stress okay so it's important that you develop your ability to handle it over the course of time if you plan on growing because it's going to get worse and worse and worse so you know and developing your mental fortitude and your mental discipline is a big part of being able to handle stress okay it doesn't matter if you're stressed it doesn't matter if you're hurt it doesn't matter if you're upset it doesn't matter if you're frustrated if your discipline is on point your mental toughness on point you're going to be able to execute in spite of the situation being that way and you're going to move forward whether you feel good or not and once you can move forward whether you feel good or not nobody can fuck with you okay because everybody else quits when things get hard everybody else quits when they get sick or they have an excuse or they get in a funk or they get you know whatever if you're able to operate even when things are hard you can't be fucked with so I would commit long term long term to the development of your own mental toughness your grit your fortitude your discipline your self belief your confidence all of these things intentionally develop them they're not traits they are skills and they're perishable skills and if you don't intentionally develop them you will not have them when you need them so go listen to live hard program that's exactly what it does it develops all these skills and it sharpens them over and over and people some people are like well if it works why do you got to keep doing it well why do you take a shower every day do it okay because you fucking stink all right why do you fucking why why do you practice guitar every single day because it's a perishable skill why do you practice the piano like why do we do anything more than once because we have to sharpen our skillset with perishable skills and you don't understand that discipline grit fortitude self belief all of these things that encompass mental toughness self esteem these are fucking skills that we have to develop and then maintain and for you to go from where you are 20 years old to where you want to be at 40 years old you're going to have to have those sharpen over and over and over and again so live that lifestyle it's going to make things exponentially easier for you to get where you're going we can either be hard on ourselves we can either train ourselves we can either put ourselves through hell or we can let the world do it it's your choice but I am telling you right now that if you make the commitment to becoming the absolute best version of yourself mentally and physically your ability to handle stress will go through the fucking roof which will allow you to be effective because you will be able to execute at a high level when everybody else freaks the fuck out I love it man now I feel like we should bring this up because you know it's this is really if it's not no fru fru bullshit right but I think it is important because I feel like especially for this guy I mean 20 years old these at a pivotal age where you know you can you can start getting different vices to help handle with stress right like whether that be gambling you go to the fucking casino or drinking or you go to the fucking bar like a weekend you know I'm saying like does that you know relieve that specific stress sure right there maybe instant gratification relief right but it actually makes it worse than the long term right we have that's why like when people say um I'm so depressed I need a drink yeah you're gonna feel good for a couple hours but the next three days you're gonna want to blow your fucking brains out okay we have to be able to look past the instant gratification and by the way I'm glad you brought this up because if you don't know how to do this and you lack the discipline to do this you're gonna spin your wheels because every time you get frustrated you're gonna get a little bit of relief but then you're gonna find yourself in a deeper hole and that process repeats itself over and over and over and over again until it costs you everything all right I don't know I don't really know anybody who lives that I got a drink when I'm stressed lifestyle that doesn't end up at the bottom of the fucking toilet eventually all right so we have to come up with helpful habits that help us manage stress if you can go in a gym stressed and lift for an hour and still come out stressed then you're you're fucked yeah yeah just fucking quit all right but the truth of the matter is is that like you know you really need that you need some sort of physical release you know like I don't train with weights because I want to I mean I like being in shape but that's not why I do it bro I do it so I can mentally be the best that I can be right when we take it from physical like the physical benefit of like hey I want to be jacked I want to look good in the pool or I want to my clothes want to fit and move it over to the mental of hey I want to feel good I want to have confidence I want to know that I have control over my outcome not the out the circumstances to have a control over me when I start looking at it like a competition between me and that fucking beer or me and that fucking food or me and that gambling or whatever your vice is and I start seeing as a competition that's a lot different than saying oh I just want to lose weight to look good hmm fuck that fucking beer that beer doesn't fucking own me it doesn't have any fucking power over me that's a powerful statement a powerful belief if you can back it up with your actions and when you back it up with your actions it boosts your confidence in yourself it boosts your discipline it boosts your belief it boosts your self esteem you are now more worthy because you overcame something that used to have power over you and when you do this intentionally over and over and over and over again throughout the course of your day like we do with live hard intentionally now you're in a situation where you're constantly boosting your stats and your skill sets it's just like madden bro you know you're at you're at a speed of 80 but you want to get to 99 you got a fucking run sprint dude and that'll boost your score and boost your score and boost your score so you got to think of things like discipline and grit and fortitude and self belief and confidence and self esteem all of these things are things that can be improved it's like a rating that you're going to pour into and it's it's going to improve it's no different than you going in the gym and lifting some weights and your muscles getting bigger your brain works the same way when you force it into uncomfortable situations when you force it into intentional adversity it becomes stronger it becomes tougher and then the things that come down on us through our day-to-day lives become that much easier to manage i fucking love it man guys that's a hell of a way to start a Monday yeah guys let's get out there kick some asses week and we'll see you tomorrow for cti
