Let's uh Let's see what our headlines have in store for us. We got quite a bit of interesting things happening Both in the country around the world. So let's some locally. Let's talk about it Guys remember if you want to see any of these Pictures headlines links videos articles go to any for seller.com you guys can find them all link there And so with that being said headline Number one Now this is uh, this is an update on our previous CTI yesterday. There's been some some extra New information that has came out. So let's do another little review on this assassination attempt because Like I said, there's no more information that's come out about this. So I think this stuff is interesting First little weird thing The director of the secret service went to the RNC And I don't understand the point of that. I don't Didn't really make a lot of sense to me. She got caught out by one of our senators, Marsha blackburns She called her out. There was actually a pretty heated video Pretty pretty he exchanged That happened there on on video Uh, that uh, that was actually posted by blackburn But basically they uh, but yes, she was in the RNC Um, and you can hear uh, Senator blackburn or I'm sorry Senator John Barasso saying I've called quote I've called for your resignation the rassoto cheeto for her face Uh, quotes or either you resign tonight to start answering our questions right now about the death threat to president trump and allowing him to go on stage in Pennsylvania at a time when you had already been alerted Um, here's a clip Yeah, and like there's a longer video and like I mean there's there's actually one point Uh, where they like usher her into a room and then like they black it off And it's like is this how this is gonna be in the secret service agent responded. This is how it's gonna be So I mean, just very interesting stuff that video was about four minutes long You guys can find that on uh, Senator blackburn's uh, Twitter account as well But what they're referring to uh, there was a briefing call that happened Yes today there uh, there was it was about a 30 minute briefing call Between the FBI director Christopher ray and the secret service director cheeto Um, it was a 30 minute long conversation that happened uh, that was uh opened up to both Representatives from the house and senators and congress um But there was a problem with this there was only 30 minutes is one of the shortest briefings that they said they've ever received from an intel agency or um, government agency Um, and there were only four questions that were allowed to be asked during that um, so that pissed off quite a people Uh, quite a few people john senator jambarassah who was in that clip as well. Uh, he said quote This was a 100% cover your ass briefing. I mean told hill reporters after the short briefing on Wednesday Quote the head of the secret service needs to go he added Quote brief briefing was awful not enough time for questions. He can another representative continued um Yeah, so so that's what they're all pissed off of uh, Senator Mike Lee he said secret service director kumballey cheeto needs to step down immediately Today's mostly information free briefing only confirmed that uh, what little information she gave us was at once deeply troubling and glaringly and complete Uh, you then continue saying quote at least three of us senator blackburns and of their crews and me had sought Recognition to ask questions and we're in the queue when they arbitrarily cut the call short So they just stopped answering questions um, and so it was it was definitely interesting Now one of the things one one piece of information that came from this briefing that i thought was interesting And yeah, I love to get your take on this political report at this um, but this is apparently one of those uh, a piece of information that came from the briefing uh quote on july 6th the shooter searched for information on where trump would speak On july 13th as well as for information on where the democratic national convention would be His phone This is what's interesting his phone used encrypted platforms linked to germany New Zealand and belgium The bureau and fbi has sought information from 30 companies and is waiting all responses from more than a dozen Now I thought that was just interesting that that is weird to me and i'm not like currently aware of any you know Special encrypted apps that are gonna be linked to those three countries that that is interesting not sure what that means Um, but in light of other news man, did you see the guy that uh that uh Tracus before we get into that I thought they couldn't get into his phone right I thought they said that how do you first of all They reported immediately that he acted alone Okay, and then they reported literally in this next breath that the the quanico and the pentagon and Everybody couldn't get into his phone can access so how do you know he's working alone if can access his phone He doesn't have any social media at all. Yeah, how do you know you don't okay? You don't but he's working along. Yeah, yeah, no Yeah, bullshit Um now I thought these people are very sloppy dude It bro and that's the thing and like this is why I said yesterday they were banking on Trump being dead right? I agree because there would have been so much chaos that nobody would have cared about these little intricate details of the situation It would have got brushed over there would nobody would have nobody would have thought about it too much too much chaos Yeah, yeah, you know, but you know and by act of God or whatever you guys want to call it, you know Trump is still here, which means that these questions People are asking yeah, you because we're not in chaos right now Um, and so that's interesting. I thought this was also funny too um, you know the guy uh the trato sassanae Reagan the famous Reagan Yeah, John he clinkly he tweeted this out violence is not the way to go give peace to chance Haha If you'd be in sarcastic. I don't know man. I don't listen. I don't know now though. I think he is out Yeah, he's like planned, you know, you can lay leasing shit now I don't but like I just thought that was interesting. Yeah, like Of all people yeah, all right cool, you know that he did that Because he was obsessed with Jamie Lee Curtis the actress you know trying to impress her Yeah, is that what it was? Yeah, he thought he if he killed Reagan she would like him Jamie Lee Curtis though like well back then bro. She was like a thing. What's she? Oh, yeah Dude back in the like 70 she was like it really oh yeah dude huh Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's weird. Yeah, oh bro. She was like the thing really oh yeah her and John Travolta and all like that era That was it. Oh, yeah, pushing all huh. Yeah. Oh, yeah full bush Yeah, wish heavy Yeah, yeah Right right. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I mean, it's interesting now now this is where this this is where I had to put my my Investigator goggles on right and I did some so much beer goggles huh Huh like your beer goggles a bush light goggles. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but You got that bush heavy goggles No, but I had to do some digging and you know, I should uh, you know put an actress to hear that was definitely an actress What is it called gonna put an actress there? What's it called an asterik? What did I say you said you're gonna put an actress over there? Is that what I said? Well, let's play it back and see what he said is that really what I'm fine, you know put an actress to hear all right We'll put one of those things an actress. I'm gonna put an access here. Okay Because you know this computer thing I'm still having some challenges. I know it's like reading. It's hard. It's difficult. It's difficult and um You know, but we covered a little bit yesterday on yesterday's episode about this shortage that this put on these stocks that happened on Donald Donald Trump's bro And we like we know because we didn't know who did it. No, we by the time I think yesterday when we were recording it hadn't really come out yet. No, yeah, there's new information Um, but we got some stuff here. Yeah, and uh the company uh, the the company that did it Um, is a company that's based here in America based in Austin, Texas um, called Austin private wealth LLC Now I should I should we I guess we should lead first the company has put out a statement. Mm-hmm. This is their official statement. They put this out um Today, or I'm sorry. Yeah, yesterday Uh, July 17th Uh, the statement reads quote the SEC filing Which showed that Austin private wealth shorted a large number of shares of Trump media and technology group court or DJT Was incorrect and we immediately amended it as soon as we learned of the error No client of APW holds or has ever held a put on DJT in the quantity Initially reported the correct holding amount was 12 contracts or 1200 shares not 12 million shares As was filed in error then submitting the required report for the second quarter of 2024 A multiplier was added by a third party vendor that increased the number of the shares by a multiple of 10,000 For all option contracts not just DJT. We did not catch the error before proving the filing We filed the report on July 12th to reflect our positions on June 28th. We amended it on July 16th Uh, then they continue to say we were uh, quote we deeply regret this error and the concern at his calls Especially at such a fraught moment for our nation We are committed to full transparency and maintaining the trust of our clients as such We are reviewing our internal procedures and our processes with the third party vendor that assist with SEC filings to better understand how this happened and avoid similar issues moving forward now. I'm not a calculator But 1200 versus 12,000 and they're like a extra zero and a 12 Oh, yeah 1212 contracts 1200 shares to 12 million right now I mean yeah, well in the in the contract since it's 12 1200 versus 10,000 like that was the And then it had a different to numbers or something like the place of the decimal point, you know You subtract the two and multiply. Yeah, when I'm trying to figure out is did they actually file this? So so this is actually filed so and then they're saying oh, we made a mistake and they amended it. Okay, so We accidentally executed that guy Right sorry, we weren't supposed to we it's we attempt we we tried to we thought it was gonna, you know be successful Yeah, and it wasn't yeah, so so do they got it do they lose all that money that they bet Yeah, I don't know I mean, I think there's still there's gonna be some SEC repercussions here, right because I mean the That money's gone. Well, who who third party? Well, no, who owns this company? Well, that's interesting. You say that Andy So I did a little digging Austin private wealth and this this is where the shit gets really really deep and I know we try to be careful You know, these are all this I got candy. This is not speculation. These are real facts We'll link all of this stuff here for you. These are it's important state that the show the show is the show is speculation show is speculation But these like these are the most verified sources you can get these are straight from government websites These are government filings everything I'm about to show you these are real things. There is no bullshit in this all right But I looked into this so so APW they they manage about a billion dollars of Market share essentially of stocks portfolios for about 1200 almost 1300 clients Now there's this form. It's called a 13 f That kind of puts together a lot of stuff that kind of shows you know who they're heavily Who heavily invest who they're managing what clients they're managing who's the main shareholders and stakeholders in this company And you know you look and there's some common ones you know the ones that I don't you know really has tribute to much There's Googles on there They have quite a few and if you look here you can kind of see the the amount This is the number we want to focus on here. This is so this is apples, you know They got a couple of different ones 20,000 28,000 right like not a big contributor But they're in there apples in there um Of course, uh, oh, I don't know of course matters in there right Um, again, you look at matters meta's number. I mean, it's nothing too crazy 4400 you know 12 like these are equivalent to 12 shares 4 shares right like small numbers nothing too crazy there um JP Morgan Chase is in there again, you know eight shares half of one share like these are nothing too crazy But then it gets interesting you get Black rock I've heard that name before. Have you heard that name before Andy? Yep. Let's look at the difference on these numbers That would be the equivalent of about 800 shares of this. That's a big number. That's a big percentage It's a big percentage Uh, who else is in there? Man vanguard Vanguard that's a that's Vanguard and it shows them divided up because vanguard breaks themselves off into trust and all these different You know entities all under the same thing But a shit ton of shares by band by vanguard too I'm like man, that's interesting Um now who who's behind Vanguard What's that guys rhymes with uh oros? What's his name? I think it's the same guy said yesterday was responsible for this most likely the Georgie Yeah, Georgie's soros man. Yeah, and then and then do we remember what his son tweeted? With the glass breaking with the glass breaking and the and the 47 dollars And then the play a hole through the glass and the place that the shooter was on was a glass place Like they made that's right. That's right. The building that the shooter uh The who can't shoot um was a glass manufacturer manufacturer and that interesting hmm And then black rock had a commercial where you have it so you have George soros who's heavily invested in vanguard and then you have vanguard owning the most shares of this fund then you have Alex soros tweeting a picture with the bullet hole through the glass and 47 dollars um When the shooter was standing on a glass factory Hmm sure it's nothing sure sure it's nothing black rock black rocks heavily invested in this uh I mean who are the people that have really turned against trump over the last four years in 2020 and and through i mean you got meta you got alphabet You got black rock and you got vanguard All of those guys owning the company that supposedly Shorted trump stock the day after or the day before he was assassinated It's almost like i said that yesterday. It's weird Now i get to even it gets even deeper So there's a um Like said jp morgan chase are also in there a little bit right jp morgan chase For those of you guys who forgot they're affiliated with Epstein Yeah, they are the the money bank that was facilitating all of these payments For Epstein yeah, and remember when the governor of the us virgin islands tried to uh subpoena them George or i'm sorry Biden flew down there that day that day fired her and that weird yeah, that's interesting Now let's get a little deeper the same day the same day that she filed that she was gonna do this I don't expect a trip for no reason yeah like there was not it was not even like scheduled like a emergency trip down there Now i get it gets a little deeper man. So On the secs website you can again link all this stuff for you Austin private wealth. This is their company snapshot. This is a list of Their six approved managing members Um for this company right these are the brokers who are making these traits right now Most of these people have been there, you know, there's a few from 2019. That's the majority of these guys Now i want to say these all of these guys came from one other company called a meriprise Which is another institution that does stock trading they actually manage like almost half a trillion dollars And assets is insane Um, and you'll see the same Similarities there, but one guy in particular stood out to me Um, and it's this last guy here this Joshua Charles Dove rack okay, I'm like man, you know, he's fairly new to that company He's fairly new and into their their their ranks there and i'm like, well, who is this guy? So i went and i found this uh iapd report which is what the sec puts together on every single broker again This is all public information you guys can can find this here Um, and this is a report and so a couple of pages the shows, you know, his history as a broker where he bent to any negative marks They get like he was terminated from funging some stuff when he was with fidelity um Shows that he's a current registered uh member for allston private wealth I'm like man, where did this guy come from? Who is this guy that's interesting and guess what Guess what came up jp morgan securities Mm-hmm and guess when he was there Andy During the same time Epstein was moving the money Now that may be nothing Might just be a big coincidence. I don't know. Oh, yeah sure it is, but that's fucking weird. Yeah. Well, that's fucking weird Now another interesting thing that i should point out here when you go to austin private wealth calm You know you you find this and they put that notice that statement right up front and center on the homepage This is a screenshot of their homepage um, but i check yeah because they know they're caught you're fucking caught But on the top, you know, they have all these these different tabs and there's this like in the community tab Right i'm like man like you know austin's a pretty liberal place most people know that about texas like that's where a lot of the sellers went Let's let's see what they're doing in the community, right? I thought that was interesting So I went to the community page and scrolling down. I was I was surprised not surprised to see you know They contribute to a number of organizations the American Cancer Society The Austin Symphony Boy Scouts of America The Jewish Community Center Shalom Austin ACLU ADL Congregation Beth Israel the Austin Jewish Academy Or my personal favorite the LDF which is basically BLM on steroids for Austin They helped get off a lot of those protesters that were charged with destroying our country now they defended these people for free Andy Where do we make of all of this what do you what do you what do you got on all of this? I Mean look anybody who can't connect the dots here refuses to connect the dots Is being willfully ignorant because they don't want to accept the reality You know, there's a lot of people out here right now who were saying That this was a false flag dude you can watch the video From the multiple angles and this wasn't like trump throwing a ketchup packet on his fucking ear like some of these morons are trying to Trying to say Also like I said yesterday there's nobody in the world good enough to shoot someone's ear off a moving target from 150 yards away All right nobody not a single person could do it And it shows the ignorance these people have a firearms and what can be done and what can't be done and then you see the other angle where the Spectators were in the range of fire and taking fire and you see the one guy the one guy in the stands get shot um This was this it is what it is dude. I mean we've watched for the last Eight years then villainize this man demonize this man attack this man destroy his reputation try to paint him as a criminal criminal Try to cancel him try to impeach him try to ruin his reputation um, they've literally brainwashed a percentage of the country I think that percentage is small at this point. I think most people see through the BS But they brainwashed people based around things that were completely made up like the russia collusion um, and we could go on and on and And they haven't been able to stop this guy and the more they push to stop him the more he grows and That's because people can more clearly see what we're dealing with we're dealing with tyrants and it's good for us that we're dealing with incompetent Sloppy happy tyrants, okay, because we could see what they're doing and I think the game is up for these people I think everybody pretty much understands what happened. They're just trying to figure out who But I think breaking down who is behind that SEC filing and that short on djt stock Is pretty fucking accurate to who's been attacking him the entire time, okay? So who would benefit? I mean we're talking about half a billion dollars. There's no reason to skirt around it These motherfuckers did this they were planning on fucking getting this dude assassinated They wanted to try to make a bunch of money and because they were sloppy It's now being exposed and it's being exposed in real time You know when they did this stuff with JFK 50 years ago 60 years ago, whatever that was There was no internet there was only one narrative that could be presented now we have You know thousands of cameras that were on that scene we have The ability to communicate information instantly. It's just not the same environment and they're trying to run the same play And it's it's exposing them at every chance and like I said dude. I think you know Yesterday, I said I think they might be trying to Create a retaliatory, you know action against Biden, but I don't think that's what they're gonna do After kind of observing what's happening here My opinion is obviously they're gonna try again. They cannot have this guy win you guys have to understand that like at any cost Yes, this isn't over they're not gonna stop this is They're not going to allow this guy to win. He's not going to win it like there Whatever happens here patriots and Americans that want this guy in office are gonna be called to the line Of action for him to get into office. That is a reality that everybody has to accept It's not gonna be peaceful. They're gonna cheat I think you know the the minute after this thing happened and they said oh this guy was a lone shooter We don't know that you don't know that either and you actually know he's not because you guys are part you guys are ones It allowed it to happen. So a minute after the shooting They have this you know Iran issued a assassination plot It's unrelated to this guy who acted alone Like we said already you don't know if he acted alone because you can't get in his phone Okay, in fact, I think a lot of you guys know he didn't act alone All right, then we have them come out with this Iran assassination plot You know an hour two hours later and What I what I thought yesterday is different than what I think today and you know That's what happens when you think about things you change your mind right and what I thought yesterday was that this would inspire some sort of retaliatory attack against Biden But what I actually think might happen here is that they could potentially Blow up Marlago or blow up an entire building full of 50 60,000 people To kill this dude and then blame it on Iran and they accomplish a number of things by doing that one They get Trump out of the picture Two they get the war they're trying to get they get that three They probably believe that they will get Trump's base To focus on a war with Iran and that's how they want to get the American public behind a war with Iran But that's not gonna happen because his base believes that it's Biden and co and Soros and everybody That is doing this not only that when they realize even if you know it is Iran how do they get here Oh the border that you left wide open. Yeah, got it. Yeah, so dude like I don't think this is that's what I think they're planning I could see that man. Yeah, I could definitely see it and I don't know if that's You know, I've just been working this out and working this out and working this out and that makes the most sense that accomplish most stuff for them Uh and keeps them in a good spot. So You know, here's the reality guys. They're not gonna let you guys think you got it in the bag and this guy's just gonna walk right in and all that That's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. They're not gonna allow them to win you guys who Are voting you need to figure out how to get everybody that you know to vote for him so that the the the margin of Winning is so big they can't cover it with their cheat um, you know, I feel like this is almost a False climax for Trump's people like they think oh, we got it one now And dude, that's where you lose the game when you think you got it one and I think it's very important for people to realize that yeah Yeah, 100% man guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments man This is uh, we'll stay stay uh stay following this as more stuff comes out man. We'll see uh, we'll see what happens Let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said.

Love you guys. Hashtag don't be hurt. Yeah I got somebody with that. You got a couple people. Yeah, uh, let's check out this we got one more for you Because I think this is important to address. Okay, I'm gonna give you the opportunity to clear clear the air for us. Okay Apparently, I'm not the only person that did some research At Noah Alexander 10 Andy I remember a few episodes back when you said you didn't listen to Taylor Swift I caught you red handed brother MFCO episode five says different quote I listened to her basically because she's hot No, hey, just call it a different Taylor Swift. Oh, it was a different. Yes That was a different Taylor Swift. Oh, she was country back there. That's a different human That's different. Okay That's all you got that's that's the story. All right. Yeah, one me What Wasn't me All right, man. Appreciate you know, I'm gonna keep doing that research Um, all right, hey Get in there and block now Yeah block that motherfucker Guys, let's keep this cruise moving. We got headlight number two Uh, this is an interesting one. Let's talk about Biden a little bit because there's some interesting stuff happening in a white house literally as the shows recorded Um, Obama turning on Biden Um, apparently he's pressuring the president to drop out right now as we speak Um, so if I'm a president Barack Obama is pressuring president Biden to reconsider his 2024 run for re-election according to a new report Obama and Biden have only spoken once Since the president's debate debacle on June 27th, uh, but stress during that conversation that his old running mates chances of beating Donald Trump were Quote greatly diminished the Washington Post reported the 44th president Also stressed uh, that while Biden's legacy was important to him only his former vice president can make the call on whether to stay in the race Um, this is quote and of course we know Biden stands on this um now we got wine drinker Nancy She's apparently now flipping on this as well Um, Pelosi told Biden he'll lose the Trump and take down house based on polls. This just came out These are conversations that are happening right now Um, Pelosi's now encouraging him to drop out not even encouraging a parent like and according to these inside reports They're like strongly telling him to drop the fuck out of the race Um, it's not just him. It's everybody pretty much on the democratic side right now Um, that they're all singing the same tune Now you know jack uh Pasabic uh forget how he pronounces last name placebo pro seabitch jack um cool guy He's an insider. He knows a lot of these people inside of you know the White House all these people I mean he has some friends and some places he tweeted this out Um, he says breaking massive drama right now in White House Kamala advisors straight up telling Biden advisors. It's time to pass the book Exact words used per White House official. This is the first direct Open conference uh confrontation at the senior level Um, which is also interesting because at the same time Trump put out a statement about this Um, Trump campaign issues funny response after Kamala Harris commits to VP debate debate with JD Vance Uh, this was their statement um, in response to Kamala quote we don't know who the democrat nominee for vice president is going to be So we can't lock in a date before their convention to do so would be unfair to Gavin Newsom jb pritzker Gretchen Whitmer or whoever Kamala Harris picks is her running mate Damn, all right, that's funny now And Biden is like seriously declined even just within the last 24 hours. He's falling up the stairs again having issues getting inside the car Um, and apparently uh, you know is defense secretary austin moe Biden called them the black man because he couldn't remember his name Here's a clip. Have you seen this? No, oh, well And so it's all about It's all about tuning people with dignity And it's about making sure that we're coming for example. Look at the heat on getting it because I My name day Stricted defense for black men I'm in ketonji pran. I mean because of the people I've made Dude the bro Carpops you know what's crazy? What's crazy is he's been like this the whole time dude and so many people defended it You know, I don't buy this shit from the people who support him You guys knew he was like this the whole time you guys don't recognize the damage you're doing to your own lives By continuing to stand on that side of the line with these people your good people bro. I don't doubt that I don't doubt that you have Misconceptions about Donald Trump or things that you don't like or maybe there's some true things you don't like But at the same time dude You have to look down the line and you have to look at where the future is gonna go and dude these guys are intentionally Ruined the country. This isn't about you being right or Having to stand strong and dig your heels in there's a time in life where you say hey I was on the wrong side there and this is a great opportunity to do so because it couldn't be any more clear Yeah, well now there's this whole talk apparently he comes out today saying that you know he has COVID now Yeah, well dude. Did you see like two hours before that he said that the only way that he would step down is if he had a medical Condition and then two hours later he's got COVID Even though he's had this cough for weeks now apparently now he has COVID even though he's you know triple quadruple 10,000 octacon deductible boosted. Yeah, I mean it's weird, you know, he's not wearing a mask even though that's part of the protocol. He's not wearing a mask Um, I'm like seven and he was struggling getting off the plane a secret service agent had to like push him inside of the beast because he didn't have the strength like there's some weird should happen I mean, I think They're gonna drop him Comma steps up to save the campaign down dollars the question is who do they keep her in as the lead on the ticket I don't know. What do you think dude look man? I don't know. I don't I don't know. I don't know I know this I would almost love to see Kamala get nominated because I would love to see she's gonna be a disaster just like him bro like she's worse. She is less popular than Biden way nobody likes Kamala Okay, and like the race baiting shit that she always stands on is not at the top of Importance anymore people have moved past that for the most part, right? Um So yeah, I don't know dude. I you know, I still think they're gonna figure out a way to get Michelle Obama in as the uniter like a voice of reason It's their only chance of actually pulling a fair election off But I think they know and I think we all know that it's not going to be a fair election Which is why I keep saying it's important for anyone that wants to get us out of this um To go get everybody that you know that hasn't voted to vote, you know, there's hundreds of thousands of gun owners registered hunters In every single state that do not vote How is that possible? You know you guys have to get engaged this time and it's not a joke so Yeah, man, I don't I don't know dude. You know, I know this if I were in charge of their their team I'd be figuring out a way to get Michelle Obama in there because dude Even though you know, I think a lot of people don't like her There is like this little sect of people that are so up Obama's you know, ask about everything. They think Obama's still great And I think a lot of people voted for Joe Biden because of fucking Barack Obama and Uh, I You know, I just I don't know. I think that's I mean she's smarter than Kamala. She speaks better than Kamala You know, she can run the power. Yeah Yeah, she'd dug a basketball better Kamala, you know um But like dude, you know uh She led to league in sacks last year She beat Michael stray hands record. Yeah, right, right Um, but yeah dude, you know, I don't know. I think that if I were on their team and I was serious and we had only one chance to win That would be the person I'd be putting in now would you run would you still run the double I the double Ebony? Yeah, for sure the Ebony the old Ebony and ivory no, I'm like double Ebony's no, I'd run the Ebony and ivory who would be the ivory Michael stop Michael stop. Yeah, oh, okay. Yeah, I have them lead blocking for He was a bruiser actually I have Michelle lead blocking for yeah Yeah, man listen listen this this is gonna be very very interesting how this plays out I just keep thinking about you know those hundreds of millions of dollars. They got a campaign dollars Yeah, they got to save that yeah, right exactly and that's what I think Could dude, I think there could be a double switch here. I think it could switch once and then again um I could be completely wrong on that but I could see them putting Kamala in To get through the DNC and then having something happen to her and then picking someone else. Oh, man. We did a joke Yeah, right. Yeah, fuck yeah, that'd be crazy. We'll see, man God, tell us what you guys think who who is going to be the Democratic It's probably gonna be it's probably It looks like By what they're all saying that it'll be Kamala and Gavin Newsom, but I don't know how you could put Gavin Newsom in there. Yeah After what he's done to California and everybody knows it dude even the left knows it No, right easy target to attack the only problem with Newsom is is that he He has no problem blatantly lying. You know, like he doesn't get flustered When you when you hammer him with facts It doesn't bother him because he makes up his own facts. You know what I mean? Yeah, so like if you have someone Like when you when you when we watched that debate with um DeSantis and Newsom the Sanctus would hit him with shit That were real facts and he was just like that's not true. This is true, right? And he just makes some shit up and then the interview goes and that's a fact and like dude I'm sitting there watching this I'm pretty well read on what's going on And I'm texting you know like People that I know that are in government and I'm like what the fuck and they're like bro. This is just straight up lies So you know and dude you can lie to people who aren't paying attention. They don't know right You know what I mean especially if you got the charisma and because he has yeah he does he has I've never forget when they when they asked him about the fucking fence that they put up when China came to town in California Yeah, he's like yeah, we put the fence up because it's defense So what the fuck bro like what then one guy was like so you just cleaned up the city for Zichi paying You're not gonna clean up your own citizens and he goes yeah, it is what it is. Yeah, like like you're all Yeah, that's the kind of duty is that's what he is man. He's a piece of shit. Yeah, that's for sure man Guys tell us what you what you guys think of this topic let us know down in the comments I was that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three. This is an interest of one Um, and I don't really know what to make sense of this so so let's see what we got here the headline reads former CIA analyst Charged for acting a secret agent for South Korea intel and exchange for gifts um Now South Korea supposed to be one of our allies And we protect them from from you know little angry guy. Yeah Why would they be doing counter-spice on us like why would they have a double agent on us I you know now Wait, so she sold out her she gave away trade secrets so does so does for sushi Hmm Fucking says it in the headline Accepted luxuries like handbags and expensive meals at sushi restaurants. You think I'm over here being racist She's Asian she's South Korean I'll listen DJ is over here thinking I'm fucking Sushi you in the back pocket on that one This doesn't it does say it. She does look like she likes sushi Oh What she got I mean she's uh it's not bad I mean Just saying you know Sushi and spy on me all day you know Just kidding so she's so she But but yeah, so she's watching sushi raw Ha ha ha You had Missouri rolled for it. DJ give me that spicy tuna I want that's Friday plate roll Right. There you go I got no Missouri roll for South County roll baby Um, I love you babe, I'm sorry, you know, jokes. Popaster, you know Um, the Justice Department has charged sue me Terry A former CIA analyst and senior official at the National Security Council with acting as a secret agent for South Korea's intelligence service in exchange for luxury gifts that they made. Terry, who's married to the liberal Washington Post columnist Max Boot, accepted luxury gifts including handbags, expensive meals at sushi restaurants, and $37,000 of funding for her public policy program on Korean affairs in exchange for pushing South Korean government positions during media appearances, sharing private information with intelligence officers, and facilitating meetings to allow South Korean officials to be granted access to US officials. The Justice Department said in an indictment, quote, as alleged, Sumitary, a former CIA and White House employee subverted foreign agent registration laws in order to provide South Korean intelligence officers with access, information, and advocacy. US attorney Damian Williams said in a statement, quote, Terry allegedly sold out her positions and influence to the South Korean government and returned for luxury handbags, expensive meals, and thousands of dollars of funding for her public policy program. I don't really get the angle here. You know what I'm saying? We're supposed to be protecting South Korea, helping them out, Taiwan, all of that shit there, and then they got double agents working for us for sushi. It's like, that's weird. It's super weird, man. It's super weird. Now I will say this. I do know that it is a common practice for other countries who are not our allies to have these type of operations happening here. What else is very common? For our strongest ally, the strongest ally of the United States of America, to have hundreds of dual citizens in our government. But they're not getting in trouble for accepting anything. No indictments there. That's weird. They're allowed to come in and talk about the benefits that we get from serving the other country. It doesn't matter which one. This other country, and saying that they are our greatest ally, and they can be dual citizens, and they can do all of these same things. Go out to dinner, get gifts, and what are they doing in return? Right. Interesting. So we're going to go after Sumitari, for our sushi rolls. And we're not going to go after the other people. You can't do that. Don't. Why? Why? Why do you say... What? I don't get it. Well, I mean, it feels like we could be racist since this is racist. I mean, this is racist. They're going after the Korean, but they don't go after this other group of people. It is racist. Okay. All right. So I'm getting an invite to say some racist things. That's racist. Some of the best jokes are racist. They should have gave her a Mitsubishi. So sh- Whoa. Suzuki. Yeah. Oh, life, correct it. Yeah, man, listen, it's weird. Now, in another move, I told you I bring this back local. Speaking of spies, do you remember a while ago we covered those Chinese police stations in the United States? Yep. Now they, you know, they crack down on some in New York, San Francisco, California, right? Apparently, we have one in our own backyard. Where? In AG, Andrew Bailey, homeboy, squad, our guy, he's going after him. Good. So, Hellen reads Missouri expands probe into Chinese service center with alleged ties to Beijing. The Missouri Attorney General has expanded its investigation into the Chinese service center in St. Louis after his office found evidence that this Chinese outpost has violated Missouri law. Quote, our investigation centers on allegations that the Communist government of China is attempting to establish a footprint in the Shomei State, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, and a statement issued on July 7th. Mr. Bailey issued a civil investigative demand to investigate the Chinese service center's actions and failures related to soliciting and reporting charitable funds in Missouri. His office, quote, has reason to believe that the Chinese center has, quote, engaged in is engaging in or is about to engage in deception fraud, false promises, misrepresentation, unfair practices, and or the concealment, suppression, or admission of material facts and connection with the solicitation of charitable funds, according to the release? He says he's taken it very, very seriously, that this investigation last year, Mr. Bailey first launched the investigation into this outpost in Missouri, following reports that a powerful agency of the Chinese Communist Party, the United Front Work Department, runs at least seven outposts on US soil. The agency advances the CCP's interest abroad. And so yeah, we knew there were all over the country, but apparently there was one here, Bailey's cracking down on that now too. Any anything on that? Yeah, they should listen, it goes back, listen, say it, man, Chinese government or any government, any government should not be able to own property in the United States. No, period, especially farmland, especially farmland. You're going to give our enemies control over our ability to grow our own food, right? This goes for all nationalities. The reason America's fucked up is because it's not serving America first, okay? And all these politicians that get online and get on TV and say these things like this country is our greatest ally, like they're saying about Israel, nonstop. Bro, these people serve Israel's interests for funding for their campaign. I don't know how hard that is to understand. And it doesn't matter if it's Israel or if it's Germany or if it's China or if it's fucking Mozambique. It doesn't matter. It should not matter. It doesn't matter. Dual citizens should not be able to serve in our government. They should not be able to take any money from any foreign government for anything. Foreign governments should not be able to own land in this country for any reason. Government officials should not be able to work with these people in any regard whatsoever. At all, everything should be from America, for America, by America, for our interests, not there. And dude, this is absurd shit. Like we got to get back to being America first. All these people that come out here and say Israel's our greatest ally, nonstop. Those people are being paid to say that. A lot of them are dual agents and they serve and make decisions that hurt our citizens in favor of that country. That makes no sense. Okay. And it could be any country. This is just another example of that. Our country is so corrupt and so bloated. It needs a massive realignment. And one of the realignments that it needs is that we need to eliminate these foreign interests, whether it's monetary or representative or ownership of land from America completely. Those things should not be allowed. Dude, my issue, I don't understand why that's such a hard position to have. You know what I'm saying? Like it does it like that. To me, it's common sense. It is common sense. You know, and the other issue is common sense. People just look for a reason to call you something. It's just like when we did the, when we did the fucking show on George Floyd and we were right and we said the guy died of fucking fentanyl and all this shit and everybody got pissed and said we're racist, right? When we fucking said Ukraine was bullshit, we got called all that bullshit. Okay. When we said that we're America first, not Palestine or Israel, we got called anti-Semitic. It's not anti-Semitic to say that Israel should not have dual fucking agents or dual citizens in our government. It's not anti-Semitic to say that we shouldn't be serving their interests over our own. Those are, those are, that's just nationalism. That's just saying are people matter most? Are people matter first? And once our people are taken care of, then we can discuss doing things for our ally. I'm not here to argue who's an ally and who's not an ally because we're going to have probably some different opinions. But the truth of the matter is, is until our country looks like fucking Dubai where you can walk down the street and you don't get mugged, you don't get fucked with. Our cities are clean, our streets are clean. People, you know, are, are, there's a high trust in our society until we get to that. We have no business doing anything with anyone else. And these politicians up in Washington, this is how they get rich, dude. This is how they stay in power. They serve the interests of other countries. Other countries wire them money or their, their uncle's money or their brothers or their family. Like Joe Biden. You know, 10% for the big guy and they peddle their influence. Bro, that's treasonous behavior and it needs to stop. It has to stop completely and we need to fucking demand that it stops. And we can't get upset when they call us anti-Semitic or this or racist or misogynist or this or that. There's nothing wrong with telling the truth and saying, this is how it should be. There's nothing wrong with standing up for your own rights in your own country. There's nothing wrong with standing up for your own people. And guys, we are all in this boat together as Americans. This is not left right, gay, straight, black, white. When we go to fucking Russia, they say there's an American. When we go to China, they say there's an American. They don't say there's a black American, a white American, a Jewish American. They don't say that shit. And these people continuously divide us and divide us along every line of contention that we can possibly have, whether it be politics or our gender or fucking race or sexual orientation or anything else. They work to divide us as much as possible because they understand that if we are fractured, we are powerless and they get to keep the power. And when you think about how much effort and how much money and how much time and how much propaganda they put into dividing us, it should be very simple to see what they are afraid of. And until we, the American people, all of them get together and say, hey, we're together on this. They're going to have the power. And when we do that, we'll have the power. But if we're going to argue over all this shit and continually call each other names and fight, we look like clowns on the world stage, bro. No one else in the world acts like that. It's not happening. Okay. So, yeah. I mean, all of this shit should be illegal. All of it should be stopped. And that's one of the things I was talking about yesterday. Like somebody asked me, they're like, well, you said, you don't really agree with Trump on some things. What are some of the things you don't agree with? Well, I just feel like he needs to be far more radical than what he's actually, I have the opposite opinion. Like, people are like, oh, this guy's Hitler. I'm like, no, he's not. That Hitler at all. No. I don't even think that he's aggressive enough. I don't think that he's aggressive enough in his policy, bro. I think all of it, is he really going to deport all these people? I don't know, but they need to go. You know what I'm saying? Is he going to shrink the size of the government by fucking 50% because that's a good start? Is he going to lower our tax to 10% because that's where it should be? Those are things that matter. They matter to all of us and they would make a huge difference. But is he going to do that? I don't know. You see what I'm saying? Are we going to wipe the book's clean of all the unnecessary regulation law that we have? Things that have piled up over 249 years or 48 years. Are we going to clean this up so we can maybe build a chicken coop in our yard without having to get permission or grow some food in our garden without having to get permission? This is absurd. It's way past freedom. It might have been free 150 years ago, but it's fucking way past that. The elite ruling class has done what the elite ruling class does across history. They make rule after rule after rule after rule after rule until all the rules say that they own all the shit and the peasants don't get anything and their quality of life goes to zero. So that's where we are in this country. And if Donald Trump's going to come in and recognize that and fix all that, great. I think it would be the greatest president that ever lived. But if he doesn't, it's still a better option than what we got down the other path and we can use that as a bridge to take it further the next time. That's my opinion on the situation. Yeah. I love it, man. I love it. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Down in the comments, let us know what you guys think. Great work, A.G. Bailey. Yeah, pretty funny. Funny how like our two friends, the friends that we know and support are the ones that are kicking everybody's ass and government everywhere. Everywhere. Eric Schmidt and Andrew Bailey, both from Missouri, both been on the show multiple times, both personal friends. And they don't give a fuck. They are stomping on dick, dude. And that's that's what we need. Small y'all. We need more. Yeah, we need more little sushi roll. We need more of that. Yeah, for sure, man, shout out A.G. Bailey, bro. Appreciate you guys. Well, that being said, man, let's get to our final segment of the show. As always, we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck. Now this is a good one for you. Tying all of this in. We got to bring this shit back home. We got to bring back this love of country. And there's a really, really cool place that's doing it. I think this is pretty awesome. So with that being said, our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads, Patreon ice cream shop rewards free soft serve to kids able to recite pledge of allegiance through July. I think this is pretty fucking cool. I like ice cream. Ice cream is good. Joe Biden likes it. Joe Biden does like ice cream. Who does? It's part of the what's your favorite ice cream? Like those free all of them. That what Joe said. Which one is really your favorite? You know, I mean, I would be a fancy. What are we doing? I'm sure you're going to come out with some fucking butter, but kind of bullshit. Tell me about it. Let's hear. Well, so there is a place. I give them a shout out. There's a place downtown. What's it called? It's called the fountain. Okay. You know about the fountain. No, I don't think I've ever been there. It's down on a, I think it's off of olive, I think. It's called the fountain, though. Bro, it's all handmade ice cream. And they have like this little thing called a hand churn it. Bro, like grandma used to do. Bro, listen, bro, my great grandma, she used to hand churn ice cream. It was fucking awesome. Bro, and they make this thing. You can get this thing. It's called the pineapple upside down cake. Yeah. And bro, like they take a fucking slice of pineapple upside down cake, put that in the bottom of the fucking thing. Yeah. And then like coconut ice cream, fucking like bro, it's fucking, it's ridiculous. You ever had a, have you, have you had? Do you like frozen custard ice cream? Yeah. Sure. Well, I take frozen custard. Take both, yeah. Yeah. We got two of the best frozen custard places ever. Ted Drew's in Andies. Yeah. Ted Drew's in Andies. Yeah. Those are good spots. That was all different, too. Yeah. Like they're different. Yeah. I like them. Oh, it's completely different. I mean, Ted Drew's is a staple. Icon. You know, but Andies pretty good, too. There was another place to now. You might, you might get shot trying to go there. What's up in Jennings called velvet freeze? Oh, they used to have those velvet freezes all over. Yeah. Yeah. Those are velvet freezes like a little man. Still there. Yeah. Still there. There used to be a good one in South County called spankies. Spankies. That place was awesome. Yeah. I fucking love ice cream. But dude, if I'm taking ice cream, my favorite is mint chocolate chip. Really? Yeah, bro. Well, mint chocolate chip is good. Sounds about white. You don't like that? I think that's a white person thing. No. No. It's funny that everybody is saying no is all white. Do you like mint chocolate chip? You know, I think I think I'm I stand proven here was science. I know. Yeah. Right. He doesn't like it. Look at you guys agreeing. You guys should make up. You guys going to kiss now. Come on, man. Anyway, back to the kids. In the late afternoon on any given Monday in July, the kids all know to gather here to celebrate their common love of America and ice cream. Eskimo King lives along Market Street in Swansea, then still has an old time mom and pop ice cream shop feel handing out soft serve by the cone. This is local cookie. No, I think they're actually, let me see. Swansea is over in Illinois, bro. I think there's a few swancies though. Oh, really? Yeah. No, this is in Maine. So Eskimo King of Swansea Maine. Okay. Yeah, Massachusetts. Maine is M.E. Right. Is it? M.I. M.E. Is it? M.I. M.E. Is it? Yeah. M.I. Is Michigan. Know your shit. Yeah. Good job. So Eskimo King of Swansea, Massachusetts. I thought you just said it was Maine. Shit. No, it's Massachusetts. M.A. Okay. Yeah. So they serve an eye popping 350 flavors. You can imagine from Carmel Nut Crunch to Shark Bite and everything in between. Have all the colors of the rainbow. But every Monday this month, their specialty will be red, white, and motherfucking blue. For kids celebrating America with them by stepping up to their open-air service windows under a flag-beckoned awning, they will hand out free ice cream to all who tilt their head up to one of those youthful smiling cashews and ask. There's only one question. The 12 and under, if they can recite the pledge by memory, Eskimo King owner Nancy Demos, who 67 told the Epoch Times, if they have older siblings, sometimes they help them if they struggle at the window, but they'll get free ice cream. So Miss Demos added that the girls at the till will help a child fumbling with the word indivisible just on the tip of their tongue or one who is otherwise stuck. One way or another, everybody gets their ice cream, she said. The Massachusetts town is right beside Bristol, Rhode Island, and so every 4th of July, parade held by the neighboring town ultimately brings visitors in for ice cream draped from head to toe in red, white, and blue. Very patriotic, so it fits right in, Miss Demos said. Eskimo King is only too happy to serve. So yeah, cool. Hey. Ice cream looked good. Yeah, it does. What do you notice about that picture? Why is the black on the bottom? The what? That's the cone. That's the cone. You know, because everybody just pours into us, huh? If it was a black cone, there'd be nothing in it. To cut. Y'all are fucked up, man. Here the one that starts this shit here. Listen dude, here's what he said. Here's what I don't like. I don't like that the kids get help and that everybody gets their ice cream. This is meritocracy. They need to heighten their standards. All right. If they can't do it, tell them to go home and practice. We're not helping anybody by giving them free shit. You turn this little girl down, bro. Yes. The fuck out of here. You're fucking practice. Come back later. Well, you're not. No, man. You're gonna let her. Yeah, give it to her, bro. That's how they end up with participation mindset. No, in fact, if she tries, listen, in fact, if she gets it wrong, somebody should spank her. Put it locker in a cage. The till she says it right, then she can get out of the cage. All right. See, this is why this is why I don't have kids. Come on, dude. You be giving all that ice cream out. Bullshit. Now if it was like ducks or something, I'd be giving her. Or dogs.
