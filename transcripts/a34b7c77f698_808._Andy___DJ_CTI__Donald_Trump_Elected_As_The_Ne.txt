What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the real estate goodbye to the lies the thickness and Delusions of modern society and welcome the mother fucking reality guys today we have Andy and DJ Crows the mother fucking in that and that's what we're gonna do. Let's just get right into it. Okay, we got a big show Don't forget to show the show we're still dealing with censorship traffic throttling shadow bands all the stuff Can't wait for these guys to take care of this business. We'll get right into that But it needs to show the show all right guys. So don't be a hell shut the show. All right. What's going on man? Now then dude? What's up big day huh? We're still free. We are free. We're not in jail. I don't have to be trans Yet You know feeling pretty good about it. I forgot about that. Yeah, shit. Oh, you thought I was lying I already have my outfits picked out brother I was working on my dick to Emily what size of the show I Weren't got me a special fucking duct tape and everything man Look before we get into this. I just want to say this You know for four and a half years we've been doing this show and The reason that I did this show a lot of you guys know me for real AF. You don't know me before that I had a show called the MSEO project and It was the number one entrepreneur podcast in the world Did that show for five years in? 2019 I recognized that a lot of weird things were happening and I made the decision to transition to talking about what was going on in the world and business Not just business and entrepreneurship and the reason I did that was because I recognized being an entrepreneur for my whole life and building some significant companies that we can only be successful if we have fertile soil to be successful at some point the American dream Ceases to exist because the math in the soil doesn't allow it to grow and Under communist slash progressive Economic conditions like the ones that Kamala wanted to put into place openly You guys would have been screwed, okay? So the last four and a half years and I'm not saying it would be impossible I'm just saying it would be a lot harder than what it was for me I don't want that because our country is built on entrepreneurship our country is formed and crafted and the culture is created from entrepreneurs how we treat each other how we do things in our businesses how we Handle our culture in our businesses people take those things home and that becomes the culture in our community and If we don't have entrepreneurs setting the culture that means we rely on the media and the government to set the culture and So for the last four and a half years I've worked and DJ has worked and our team has worked very very very hard To put on a show that helped Shine a light on some of the changes that needed to be made and some of the things that were going on that prevented the growth of business and That's why I've combined Q&A of in business content with cultural content and current event content because the current event content is the soil and Then there's the entrepreneur business kick ass in life content, which is the application of skill You need both to be successful and we got to a point in culture where America and Americans and entrepreneurs were so busy focusing on Building their businesses that we took the eye off the ball of the soil all right for a long time and Over the last four years I've been trying to bring awareness to you guys to understand that as entrepreneurs as successful people as hungry people We have to look at both we have to keep our eye on civics on what's going on in our country and We have to go out and execute and so I've tried to provide that both at at the same time And the reason I bring that up is Because now we're in a position where I feel like we've taken a pretty big step I do not think Donald Trump is perfect. I do not think Donald Trump is going to fix every problem I think he will make the soil more fertile and That leads us to where we are now, which is we are the youth we are the young entrepreneurs We are the next generation of leaders and we are going to have to work very very very hard over the next four years to become as successful as fit as intelligent as Independent as possible so that a communist type government can never take control of us ever again And so this is very important for you to understand we have society and culture and Current events which DJ and I are going to continue to do Okay, however, I am going to be opening up the MFCO project again And I'll have some very pertinent news to that very soon within the next 30 days we will have that open, okay? When that opens up we will practice our skills We will learn our skills we will dedicate the skills over there and then here on CTI We will talk about what's going on in the world So I want to let you know I haven't launched the MFCO I've waited two years to launch it because I wanted to get to a point where I was confident that we had made a step forward And protecting our environment so that we could grow what we need to grow But now we're in a position where we have to fucking grow it We have to live the standard we have to realize that personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion that we need and that we as individuals If we want society to be better we have to be better the government can only do so much and should only do so much The rest of it is on our backs. We have to carry that load especially you young men, all right? So now is the time where we are going to start Looking into how to do it. Here's the skills Here's the how you're going to become successful and we're going to work really hard on that and then also continue what we've been doing here So I just want to bring this up. It's an obligation Just like it was an obligation for you all to vote just like it's an obligation for you all to speak up Just like it's an obligation for you all to stand up Just like it's an obligation for all of you to live a high standard so that other people See what a high standard looks like and they join you and we shift culture I think if anything yesterday or the day before when you're hearing this was an evidence of the culture shift that's been coming all right But just because this man got elected does not mean that you can go to sleep It doesn't mean you can go back to playing video games and being a fat fuck It means that we have to get super engaged We have to get super serious about becoming the best that we can be and we have to execute so that what just happened can never happen again I'm very very very very proud of you guys for your commitment over the last four and a half years to see where we have come to see what has happened in the last four years I Have no doubt That a big part of what happened in this election has to do with you guys and I'm just very fucking proud of you I'm very proud to be a part of this group. I'm very proud that You guys are the people that you are and that you're committed to being the best you're committed to doing what's right? You're committed for Living the standard and just reminding you that now is the time where we have to go as hard as possible towards that So before we get into anything I just want to say that up front, okay? We got the MFCO project coming now. We're gonna dedicate hard time to getting better Hactically But we're also gonna keep an eye on what's going on in the world and I don't know. I'm just I Could have came out better, but the truth of the matter is I'm just super grateful dude I'm just super grateful for you guys. I'm grateful for you guys to support the show who support us You know who wear the bison gear who go in the store and you know support our companies guys you're making a fucking difference and And And we're gonna continue to do so we're gonna continue to drive hard and I think in the next four years We're gonna be a fucking force to be racking with okay? Nobody at a bare minimum is gonna come in and make us Depending on them. It's not gonna happen ever fucking again. We're gonna restore the American dream We're gonna restore the American work ethic and we're gonna make winning fucking cool again, okay? So that's what we're gonna do buckle up buttercuffs. Yeah, I fucking love it man Well, we do have a lot to cover today, man, so But yeah, so let's let's go ahead and dive into our headlines then Guys, you know you can check out all of these headlines these articles pictures links videos go to Andy for seller.com You guys can find them all link there Let's get to our first headline man first first big thing Donald Trump elected as next president of the United States Yep, we'll let that sink in for two seconds.

You're gonna say yes Yeah, now let's go to mainstream media here quickly Um, because they're also having some meltdowns. They're starting to turn in on each other. Uh, we'll go to uh MSNBC first some moan Sanders she slams Democrats For the stab this That was the Biden coup This was this one was interesting um, so she's actually a former president Biden spokesperson Uh, Simone Sanders is um, she kind of went off on Democrats. Let's listen to what she had to say Old yes, but I do have an indictment of some of the strategy and again the people that said Joe Biden was the problem Where's my camera he was not the solution Okay, it's I will just note that Joe I will just note that it is probably not the best idea that Democrats orchestrated a very public stabb-fessor proverbial stabbing in the front of the sitting president of the United States of America And then didn't use him in his hometown of Scranton Pennsylvania I will depart to mr. Lipschut So we shouldn't know what the first black woman Asian? Yeah, I mean look dude Uh So it was a coup Yeah, I know you know i'm saying like like there's so much weird shit You know what I think it's funny what her shirt As I fucking Charlie Brown Fuck is that The fucking black high you bro. I think lots of stress funny. See I'm trying not to like Just go off until it's my turn to talk. There's so much to say So I'll let you just keep going all right. We got some more um, let's let's stick with MSNBC Um, you got uh Joe Scarborough you hear what he had to say Bro, this guy looks like a fucking cartoon character. He does he looks like dillbert dillbert. Yeah. Yeah, yeah I could see that his little bd eyes and like dude you know he goes home and gets pegged You know saying like that's his wife that blonde lady sits next to him on the show. Is it really yeah? And he's always on there, you know like just saying all this Super low-tee weak-ass beta male shit He gets home. He's like put in my butt. I can smell the estrogen out of his mouth. I can you can look at him He looks like a cartoon character. They made out of fucking clay. I will explain him on TV apparently. He's a clone or some sort of like He's a terminator. Hmm. That's what he is. Well apparently is my fault that trump won So my fault black man or racist a misogynist is what I heard. That's what it is. That's why we uh, that's why trump won So let's listen to what he had to say I just say we have really quickly too Democrats need to be mature and they need to be honest And they need to say yes. There is there's misogyny But it's not just misogyny from white men It's misogyny from Hispanic man right? It's misogyny from black man things we've all been talking about who do not want a woman Leading them might be race issues with Hispanics They don't want a black woman as president. I say you know the the the The Democratic party that I've always found when you're sitting around talking They love to just sort of Balkanize everybody into these separate groups and say oh white people don't like women and Black people no this is it is time for the Democrats to say okay and you and I've talked about this before A lot of Hispanic voters have problems with black candidates Right And some of the most misogynist things I've heard going on and there's get out the vote to a came from black men I mean misogynist things so you're absolutely The racism is coming out Nah it's you motherfuckers bro and ain't me no more. It's fucking you guys We're the problem. Yep of course bro and the solution see I love it everybody knew you were always the problem bro Like I love it. Yeah as the racism is really starting to come out from these people bro no shit. It's fucking People Bro first of all this guy such a dumbass he like look you just got your ass whooped The nobody cares about mainstream media anymore. They it if anything was proven at all It's that everybody knows that mainstream media is fake They know that these people are delusional. They're pushing propaganda. They don't trust Hollywood They don't trust the music industry people have figured it out You talking heads on mainstream media are fucking done We are the media now motherfuckers not you okay? All the people out here who have Audiences and built communities based around telling the truth and then trusting the hosts of these shows Because they don't lie and they don't propagate and they don't fucking try to manipulate Okay, you guys are done Now it's our time we are the captain now that's correct So Go home Get yourself some lube Get that peg and going on like I know you love and you know Go cry Lay in the fetal position the fucking shower Don't take it easy on him tonight. Yeah, he's gonna need it Bro the meltdowns are just keep coming in let's go check out some of the top Supporters The top voice I also love how they try to blame it on walls. Okay. This was We're gonna go back bad before walls Like what are we talking about? When we when you picked walls we were just like all right well, they're trying to sink it on purpose You know like you got this dude who's I don't even know how old he is, but he comes running out Like he just starred in fucking twinkle toes the Broadway show Waving around his limp wrist and talking about you know how he's a football coach But he's gonna run a pick six you don't know what he's talking about He's a liar he dude. He looks like he's got a super Fucked up hard drive. I just leave it at that You know and like you guys could have picked literally anybody that would have been better than either of those two And maybe that woman on the on the show there on MSNBC is correct and that they shouldn't have just could Buy now And they should have thought about this a little bit more Maybe if they held a new primary they would have come up with a decent candidate That wouldn't of underperform where Biden was and by the way Where are those 17 million votes that were missing from 2020 to 2024? We had the highest turnout ever, but 17 million votes are missing So let's get back to investigating that because what damage was caused over the last four years How much Suffering was caused how many lives lost how many cities burned how many businesses closed how many hardships creating How many people killed Okay, because of this insane Fraudian election that happened in 2020 and where we be if that hadn't have happened Okay, and I'm not just gonna sit here and say oh in 2024. Let's all move ahead and this and that no I'm with the people with that like my neighbor who's a Democrat cool bro. We're all good I don't have a problem with those people. I don't have a problem with my neighbor and my my brothers and my sisters that are American citizens But I do have a problem with these communist elite fucks at the top who have victimized our culture our people and destroyed our country in their own best interests and that needs to be dealt with with harsh accountability period Okay, because a lot of damage has been done. This isn't like I know everybody feels good and everybody's excited And by the way, Trump's not in office yet Okay, so I just like to put that in your brain too. Yeah Got a little bit more of that later. Yeah But yeah, I mean I just I just like watching these meltdowns happen. Um, Harry sissaboy Harry's sissin I really thought better of America. I thought we wouldn't elect a criminal sexual abuse or fraudster and bully to be president I was wrong. I'm so sorry. Oh, you sorry about that all that money took for saying all the shit that you said Now you look like a dumbass forever, bro You picked the wrong side. I came on here when he first started this and I said when this all unfolds You're gonna regret doing that So you sold your soul now you're gonna be labeled Who you feel idiot forever forever, dude You know you got on there and you ran and screamed about all this shit about Republicans You don't know a fucking thing about reality, dude And you're 21 years old. We're gonna fuck you are you know barely you know where your dick is I Even if it was 31 on the you get what I'm saying. I feel you mean like broke this this kid has gone on the internet Insulted everybody with no life experience for last three four years And now like your brand is done dude. It's done because all of that woke shit that you Propagated for and and posture yourself for is dead people are done Call them people massagenist no one cares. Call them racist. No one cares. Call them Anti-Semitic no one cares Call them up all those terms have been exhausted Through overuse. I'm not saying there's not relevant people who are Massagenistic or who are racist or who are anti-Semitic But because you guys call everybody Nazis and Hitler and anti-Semitic and racist and massageness and all These transphobic all these things for so long. They don't mean anything anymore So now you guys create an environment that's gonna be free reign Which honestly bro? It should have been the whole time anyway because Free speech means that people can say stupid shit and be judged accordingly for saying it So if someone does say some truly racist shit the community will hold that person accountable If someone does say some truly massagenistic shit or Anti-Semitic shit or whatever you don't like the the the world will will adjust accordingly to that free speech Okay, but now it can't do that because they've exhausted all those terms in the meaning So now we're gonna deal with a period where those people have no voice no say and the real victims of these things are not gonna be recognized Because no one's gonna believe them. That's the dangers of it dude. That's what I'm saying and so The woke shit is over. It's fucking over the fake victim hood shit the The I'm a victim because I'm a this and this and this I'm a I'm an indigenous black Brown South Asian Hawaiian Italian American that shit's overdue. We're going back to being Americans. Yeah, you know You can either you can either be an American with everybody or you get to fuck out. Mm-hmm That's that's where we're gonna get to and by the way people are leading their accounts Hold on, do you not remember me saying this four years ago that the pendulum was gonna swing back I told you motherfuckers. It was swinging back When it first started to swing back and and I said you're gonna want to make adjustments and What you're talking about and what you you know present yourself as and How you present your company and here we are now all the pro-American companies are cleaning everybody's clock And you guys who were too afraid to speak up You're behind the ball just exactly like I said Yeah, man, it's funny too because like a lot of these people too like know that like to your point, you know like Leave you know, but a lot of these people I'm gonna drink drain of drum gets away They're deleting their accounts now. They're shutting down their fucking accounts. Yeah, that's because they don't want to get trolled because bro The way they treated people was not cool. Yeah, like this guy David hog This is the bad place. Okay. Well leave leave no one asked you to be in the public eye bro Leave you're a kid who who had to go through a terrible event who then took on a cause You know nothing about because you think it qualified you You know because you witnessed this event. I could appreciate someone Wanting to do that, but you went way off the rails bro and you became this crazy fucking turd And you insist and are gonna go be buddies. Yeah, watching porn doesn't make you a punch dog, bro No shit. I learned that the hard way. Yeah, no shit. You know, I'm saying yeah, so This journalist democracy died in darkness like do their melting down um, and uh, well dude their melt. Why do you think they're melting because they know they're gonna get held accountable? No, that's not why I'm very concerned About Trump actually doing the things he says he's gonna do in terms of holding people accountable There are crimes against humanity have be committed. We can go on and on and on and on They the reason these people are freaking out the reason they're throwing tantrums the reason that and this is very Very very important for every single American to understand The reason these people are freaking out and the reason they're saying Trump's gonna put me in a camp or they're gonna Kill us or whatever they say because that's what they would do to you That is what they would do to you if they have control over you that is a fucking fact So the reason that they're so scared is because they know what they would be okay with Happening to you. So before you go Thinking that these people who say this crazy shit are your friend and you want to unite with them You better remember what they were willing to do when they had the power That's real man. I'm all for Everybody of common sense unifying. I'm all for Democrats Republicans Centris Everybody getting together, but these elite tyrants at the top that have been talking this crazy shit They have to be held accountable because it's not gonna fucking stop. Yeah Yeah, let's say some more meltdown to this time from unfamous people. Yeah. Let's check this first one out Why Yeah We're sick of you guys we're sick of people like this and my wrong is saying that Are you are you not tired? I'm so sick of you know, we're all tired of this crazy shit That's what I'm happy about though like I'm glad that the pendulum is like it's past that point where like Shots a grown adult acting like this spaz and out yeah posting on the internet dude She's not the only one there's other was look let's check in on mr. Simpere Just voted and I chose Family and this ring the terror now. I chose family. I chose women. I chose America. I love you Moving on on moving on we're moving on I love all this That's still That that's not real. Oh, this is real. No It's real. So is this one? Anyone else helping meltdown. I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to wait Um so stressed how you can't look out into the world into the people of this country and see what's happening And how hard we're all fighting for rights what are you fighting for? From people I go from historically crying one minute over the pain of this situation and then Historically crying the next minute watching so many people come together and women from around the world supporting us and cheering us on I am 48 years old and I have never I experienced anything like this. I never thought I would in this country. It's like It's like I can feel The pain and the fear From every single person. Bro, these people are fake victims There's nothing that fucking hurt her. She's not hurt. There's nothing that's going on her. She's this is attention These are little children that need attention. Mm-hmm. This is this is no one's hurting you No one touched you no one abused you no one There's no law that took away your rights none of that shit is true These people are on the internet trying to get attention and play professional victim And it's super entertaining because no one cares anymore now. How to check this one out I am the choice I am That's a good song actually Bro You know and here's the other thing about all these you know You guys didn't understand that you're the fucking tiny minority in this country You with your little tattoos all over your fucking face and you know you're 500 piercings and your weird ass shit and you're all You're not your blue and your pink and your fucking glasses and all this shit you guys do You're the minority you're not you're not the fucking majority and when you're the minority and by the way I don't care about any of that shit you go do they I just pointing out the facts. You all look the same And it's and that's a whole nother topic. Yeah, I'm an individual then why do you all look the same? Yeah, my naries. Yeah, so But the point is here dude Is that you when you're the minority and you're being tolerated and you can't recognize that you know The majority's getting tired of you shit It's probably a good idea to stop jamming it down everybody's throat It's probably a good idea to quit calling everybody fucking Nazis and Hitler and all these names when You're the minority and you're not even the minority by a little bit. You're the minority by a fucking lot Okay, so yeah, it's not like 50 to 51 49 bro I don't understand like how do you go around the world Being like this and look around and note not notice that like it's you just you. Yeah, yeah, man It's weird man. I got one more fear for you check this guy out. Oh, man. This was uh on a live stream as he announced it check this out Okay, when he throws actually gonna win this fucking day I'm Jesus Christ. I'm so pissed off Fuck God damn it That guy's got bigger problems than Trump Like it's belly And it's fucking titties. Yeah, man. Nice titties Tommy Tommy titties. Jeez, man Well, how you how like why are you even care dude? You're gonna be dead in the year You know, I'm saying why are you so mad you this guy's about to have a fucking heart attack. Yeah The is just it's so yeah, it's wild. I love to see it. I'm I'm like yes Yes, I can feel it coming. Yeah, see I it doesn't really do much for me like I think these people are embarrassment to themselves to America to the communities I don't think they're good people for the most part I think there's a lot of common sense Democrats that probably voted for Kamala, which are really good people But these these people like that are psychotic about it and Have been abusing people and harassing people and calling people's names and going up on their porch and stealing their sides And calling them fucking Hitler and getting in their face and spitting in their faces and all this shit Row fuck those people. I mean dude. I'm sorry. No, I did it like it's been it's been 15 years guys Like it's been 15 years. We've been dealing with this crazy shit You know, I'm saying like we cannot allow them to continue to act and behave this way and civilize society They've been they they and you guys know I'm telling the truth like you might be you know I can't believe he's not saying a nicer message. Well, no, I'm all about uniting I'm all about uniting with people with common sense and all that shit I'm all about you know normal political rhetoric rhetoric Yeah, okay, you said some things. I said some things But these people that have been harassing people and getting people fired and fucking up their companies and their jobs and their careers and screaming and throwing tantrums and confronting people and restaurants and pulp bro I got nothing for you man You get what you get don't act like a fucking asshole And I don't think anybody should forget these people because bro These are the same people if given an opportunity to get in power again will crush you with it Now something here is important Andy and I'm glad you actually brought this up last little piece on this first set lines here Um is that and if I was fucking Trump I'd sue Harry system for this for this comment that he made Yeah, cuz police lander. Yeah, it is sexual buteser fraudster none of those things have been proven None of them Yeah, take all that money. Come on. I just gave him bro. What I would do. I I'd sue the fuck out of him. Mm-hmm But it's funny because you brought this up Andy because I think it's important to You know not forgetting all of these people and Thankfully the left is actually helping us remember who those people are You go to politico and Trump promised to get revenge here are his targets and it's a very nice long list and has all the reasons why And I just think it's great. Let's let's dive into this list here quickly They say first up is Joe Biden, okay, and they say all of these people is based on Trump's own words, okay, so Joe Biden Trump is called Biden corrupt He reposted the truth message is that he should be arrested for treason. Yeah, I think that was my clip What yeah, it was actually I think that was my clip they're talking about where I said he should be arrested for treason It is your yeah, you retreat you we truth. Yeah, yeah, yeah, shit then on truth. Yeah So you got that apparently he's going after Kamala Harris again She because of her actions at the border But Barry's up in there on his on this alleged list of revenge Where you true accused Obama of treason back in 2020 because he spied on his fucking campaign in 2016 It's true. That's what they're giving us the actual fucking you know, I'm saying like this is a very interesting article here, man Hillary Clinton He's on there. She should be locked up Nancy Pelosi because hold on let's go back. Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's go back go back For you back go back to Biden. Okay, Biden. I think Biden probably in per I'm just gonna get my take on all these people as we go Biden Probably voted for Trump You think so yeah, no and so did Jill I heard today That Jill Biden is like walking around the White House all smiles and shit super happy. No shit. Yeah from our buddy. Yeah, no shit. So So I don't think that Biden uh I don't think Biden's gonna get away with the things that he's done because what he's done is completely deconstructed the country intentionally for profit Which is gonna be easily tracked and traced now so There's that you know if look It all depends on what Trump wants to do dude and what these people do mother fucker like you guys should be holding these people accountable I'm sorry. I'm not these people this is communism. We have to remember this They Push and push and push and push and push until the limits about to break and then they back up and right now they're backing up Okay, because they're they're like fuck we couldn't have done the election fraud. Yeah, which I'm still surprised. I still think We got we got some stuff. Okay. Yeah Um comma hairs. Yeah, well, I mean Look what they did look like what they've done dude with the borders the biggest crime that would be in this country It's the biggest crime that's ever happened in the United States You know, so I mean yeah, I mean and Trump said at a Pennsylvania rally that she quote Should be impeached and prosecuted for her role in permitting what he termed as an invasion of the US by undocumented immigrants Barry 2020 Trump accused Obama of treason for what Trump describes as the FBI surveillance of this 2016 presidential campaign over its ties to Russia Yeah That's proven yeah, he he he he him in Hillary green lit Hillary, which has the next person on this list Hillary Literally came up with the steel dossier. They pumped it out in coordination with the media for eight Fucking years and divided this country telling you and all these people that are like freaking out today You know, you know, why they're freaking out because the media's told them all this shit that isn't true all right And Hillary made up the steel dossier they talked about it for eight years in coordination with the media They impeached Trump over it turns out she made it up Okay, that's treason The all of these people are guilty of fucking treason dude all of them and Pelosi yeah, I mean the J6 should alone The all of the inside of trading bullshit. She's been doing she's a fucking she is she's committed treason to this country All of them, you know, he's got a lethicia James in there. They go with that school. They got on this list for her political prosecution of Trump she's up on there even the justice The judge Arthur and Goren yeah, remember his fucking smiley face. Yeah, he thought he's gonna get away with everything Fucking creep man former FBI director James comies on the list apparently Hunter Biden and the rest of the Biden family I mean they like do this is a long list political released out with some names that even I forgot Peter Schrock He was the FBI special agent Who showed after some text messages got leaked that he was politically motivated And you know calling Trump an idiot saying that there's no way they're gonna let him get in office things like that Which they didn't which they didn't yeah They also have the 51 intelligence agents Intelligence officials my brother they're telling us everybody like yeah, I'm reading this arm like yeah, yeah Absolutely, yeah, that's because they know it they know it members of the You know what this is This is them telling on the people who did it to avoid accountability to get tied in with it. Who wrote this? Politico, yeah, well see politico's trying to throw them on to the bus so that they don't get wrapped up in it themselves. Yeah Yeah, it's beautiful man. Yeah, that's what's called With that they're throwing these motherfuckers out there saying this is what he allegedly did when we all know they did And you know, it was funny because yesterday and the day before and the day before that nobody did any of this Now the day after the election politico is saying oh, this is what they did.

You can't bring it back No This let's check one more comment out this last comment comes from uh at I'm gonna get Magala to hot to hot. Oh Maybe 39 32 Uh, she says thank you Andy Four years ago I discovered your podcast while doing 75 hard not long after I voted for Joe Biden my second time voting Democrat Your platform gave me the perspective to vote Republican this election I chose to listen to both sides and not just go along with the narrative I prioritize common sense over voting with my emotions That's how decisions are made decision tell me at first of all that's amazing. It's fucking off. Okay Second of all Tell me a decision that you've made in your life that was a good decision that you've made when you were emotional Tell me one Every bad decision that you've made in your life has been made when you were in a high emotional state or you were under the influence of alcohol or drugs That is the high likelihood for people's bad decisions Decisions especially about your life especially about your career especially about the country should be made with logic and thought and thinking and not emotion because dude That's how this game is played against us We all have good hearts. We all want the best for people and people have figured out how to make things sound really virtuous that aren't and I've got a lot of comments like this over the last couple days and I just appreciate you guys I appreciate you guys for thinking for not being so grounded in what you believe Or think you believe that you can't be open to criticism or be coachable and honestly It says a lot about people and their ability to succeed because you know now once you've been able to Come to terms that you know you may not be correct in your thinking That opens up the ability for you to understand that in all areas of your life and make progress and so it's really cool to see You know, and I just I'm proud of people man. Yeah, it's fucking awesome. Yeah, all of you guys are super awesome and we appreciate you guys Seriously from the bottom of our hearts man. Thank you guys for being real ass fans But with that being said, man, let's get back to these headlines headline number two Gotta talk about what's happening right now as it stands so At this time Kamama mama la She is about to address the nation she's on stage right there But that's an interesting stuff that's happening across the country steel that I would like to shed some light to So right now the time that's recording a couple hours ago They had to evacuate the Georgia state Capitol over a gas leak Some some weird stuff's happening there the Georgia state Capitol was evacuated just a day after the election for a Construction crews struck a main gas line on Piedmont Avenue in Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in downtown Atlanta on Wednesday morning forcing the state Capitol to evacuate it staff according to the Atlanta Journal now There's there's other stuff that still happened unless we got a couple of states is still out there Um that I have that are not at 100% certain either still some votes coming in Um, and we're gonna focus and I would like to focus in on Philadelphia just for a little bit um trumps claims Of massive cheating in Philadelphia rejected by officials like that like I love how they just shut this shit down so quickly Um, this happened uh, yesterday. So this was a truth that uh Trump put out says a lot of talk about massive cheating in Philadelphia law enforcement coming All right now it's something I want I want to show show you guys something if we go to Pennsylvania or go to Pennsylvania They are not at 100% in okay, um currently there are about 98% of the votes are in There is a 138,000 votes that they're still expecting to come in okay now The difference between like in the lead of Trump versus Kamala is 133 Yeah, okay, so like yeah, this is what they did in 2020 dude and except all 138,000 would come in for Biden Now with with that being said okay, and of course like you know the mainstream media there You know they're running these fact check campaigns and you know they're talking about all crazy shit um But don't believe what your eyes are telling you right because like you know CNN and MSNBC themselves admitted that there was going to be thousands of fucking ballots that are gonna be dumped after the polls close Yeah, they were running the same timeline the same Something happened bro because they were saying the same stuff that they said in 2020 and then all the sudden It just they called it Something happened it's weird man like I mean check this clip out from last night. I have just learned from a source close to the counting process That the next batch the second batch of male ballots that will be loaded and posted scheduled to at 11.55 p.m. That will be tens of thousands of ballots They're still working through it So narrowing that number down any further not possible at this time will continue working with it But it will be tens of thousands of male ballots that will be posted at 11.155 just before midnight you know um And and there's still there's still some issues. I mean go even going back to this fact check article You know like Bro, there were citizens that voted in non citizens that voted in this election. Yeah And again, I love to give this guy his credit because I think he does personally a great job James O'Keefe man He does some really solid work. He had a bunch of poll workers Uh that had like undercover cameras on a shit all across the fucking country hundreds of them um, you know and his and his Attempt to try to you know make sure this election was secure But he found this out in in Philadelphia specifically um, that uh There there was these allegations that came out that you know, they're letting non citizens Uh, ink they're encouraging them to vote right now Again fact check, you know, uh people they're gonna say oh well, you know, it's just allegations. There's no evidence as there's uh, it's uh, it's uh, you know uh There's non-profit Siba Uh, who's accused they were they were set up right across the street from a fucking ballot location Right and they don't want you guys to believe their eyes when this man is literally going up to these people asking them questions Or sending them undercover people and they're literally telling him yes, that's exactly what we're doing So it's like, you know, did people vote or not? I mean you You can't believe you're fucking eyes man Um, there's shit going on with some of the machines still um, that the delayed a lot of stuff You know, so like Pennsylvania really concerns me Philadelphia specifically um, because they're they're saying that you know the the difference between again It's 133,000 uh votes is the separation. There's still 138 that are out That's enough of a margin if I can flip that no, it's not because it would have to be a hundred percent her Well, that's what they're saying and a lot of these ballots Um, that they were exactly that all her Um, a lot of you that is what they did in in 2020. It's what they did in 2020, man. So it's like I mean I you know what I think from what I watched the whole thing top to bottom. I watched all the channels. I watched everything I get the feeling that they had plant that Emma I watched MSNBC and CNN and Fox on MSM I get the feeling that they planned To do a similar operation in 2020 But then there were so much people watching that they couldn't fucking do it That's what I think happened. Yeah, um, I also think That it's very important for people to to remember Donald Trump is not inaugurated Okay, he's not in office and I personally Have told you guys. I didn't believe they're gonna let him in office. Yeah, all right So Just because he won the quote-unquote election There's a long list of things to go and I'll tell you what sets off my spidey senses about all of this Is that they are all acting fairly reasonable and it's what for one of two reasons one They are either terrified and they know they're fucking caught And they know that they've got a step in line or they might get that's their only chance to not get held accountable Or two They have a backup plan to do something terrible to Trump now remember these people fucking try to kill Trump It's wise. Okay, so That to try and you know, assassinate Trump between now and inauguration is not out of line and a very high likelihood Um, in my opinion is what I've been saying where they try to do some thing and blame it on Iran and get everybody to go pro war Well, I mean here's something that people got to understand too is even just the process of certifying the election One thing that's trending right now Um on social media Let's dive in on Jamie Raskin quickly so there's there's this suite. This is the original tweet. Let's going around okay The tweet reads Breaking Jamie Raskin said quote let folks cast their votes for Trump if that's their choice But mark my words we won't be certifying the election He might win, but we'll ensure he doesn't step foot in the oval office Now, this is the tweet that's going around. So you know, Jamie Raskin respond This is just a day when this is coming out. Yeah Jamie Raskin responded on his Twitter account saying this fictional quote is 100% fabricated It's one more lie in the stream of right wing lies designed to undermine our election despite this actionable libel And all the disinformation America is having a free and fair election and Congress will certify the winner And it's interesting It's interesting because here's the thing here's the funny thing about the internet bro Uh nothing gets deleted nothing goes away It will forever exist. It's immortal um and uh I got more than a tweet for you about this Jamie Raskin guy. Let's check in on them because here is a video Of him speaking to a group of his fucking pegas. I don't believe this was like the pegging society of America or some shit I don't know don't quote me But let's check in what he had to say at this uh this meeting I'd have the freedoms and equality of the American people But the court is not going to save us and so that means the only thing that really works is people in motion Amending the constitution, but again It's necessary, but it's not sufficient because what can be put into the constitution can slip away from you very quickly And the greatest example going on right now before our very eyes is section three of the 14th amendment Which they're just disappearing with the magic wand as if it doesn't exist even though it could not be clearer What it's stating and so you know they want to kick it to congress So it's gonna be up to us on January 6th 2025 to tell the rampaging trump mobs That he's disqualified and then we need bodyguards for everybody and civil war conditions all because the nine justices not all of them But these justices who have Not many cases to look at every year not that much work to do I mean look dude you this is that's delusional talking that's someone who's not aware of where they stand in the hierarchy of things You are out of touch bro. You do not realize that the mass of the population Is literally going that will not happen. No, it's not gonna happen Well, I mean something to keep in mind too for a lot of people just so you guys understand you know um This certification process. This was a big deal back in 2021 the j6 situation right The vice president the sitting vice president certifies the election with congress They act as the president of the congress um, so who's gonna be certifying this election It's Kamala Harris. Yeah Right and now she's not the first vice president to have to certify her defeat it happened a bunch of other times in history Um, about 16 times in history um has a sitting vice president had to certify their own defeat Outgore to be in the most recent back in 2001 um, you know, so it's not a common Um, but there is enough time between now and then and I don't know what they're gonna do man, but Well, she called him today allegedly and so it's so did Biden so I don't know Yeah, guys tell us what you guys think down in the comments let us know the fact that they're they're calling them and saying hey, you know Let's do this civil and shit. That's so out of character for them It makes me think they have another plan Well, I mean even just the fact that like in the delay like I mean again, I we knew Last night One two in the morning that it was okay like yeah when Trump went up to speak Dude if you went and watched MS NBC or CNN during that time mm-hmm They were saying that Trump preemptively like called the election right Right even though everybody else had already called it yeah, you know, but like typically man like you know There's a phone call that happens, you know where you could just concede peacefully, you know since that didn't happen Like so I mean even that's out of character. Yeah, you know saying but Dude, it's it's weird man. It's interesting times. I would just like my message my my advice is You know, I think while this does feel good. It's definitely a win or at least it appears to be on surface Um, and it's fucking great real work. We're in people fucking voted. It's fucking amazing We still got a lot of time to go you know, I'm saying the lock and happen a lot has happened in the last 30 days We got three more months. Yeah, you know, I'm saying so Well, they were calling us Hitler fucking three days ago. That's what I'm saying that shit does they don't just that doesn't just go away. No You know So it'll be interesting man guy. I saw Harris was in front of the fucking capital or the White House the other day like four days ago Yeah, yeah, all of us Hitler calling us Nazis Joe Biden calling us garbage. That was fucking two three days ago. Yeah So I mean, you know the problem with the Republican party bro and and center and right people it always has been the same problem It's that they take the high road They want to be left alone and they have this live and let live mentality Which is very noble and genuine and the way it should be But it leaves them open To subversion and to attacks because when you go up against vicious people and you think that they're not going to do things Because you have a certain integrity or you have a certain character And so you don't remove the possibility of them harming you You're unintentionally harming yourself and your family and your society and your culture This would be no different than like you walking up to a fucking starving male lion And being like oh, he's so cute. He's nice. He's not gonna eat me because your house cat won't eat you No, I mean, I'm not gonna eat him right. I'm not gonna attack this lion So he's not gonna attack me and then what happens the lion fucking kills you And this is what has happened over and over and over again to the conservatives and the moderates and the people on the right And really just common sense Americans is they They which by the way is a noble thing they set like they want to be friends. They want to be Good neighbors. They want to work together in unification But then there's this Sektive people who are on the very far left who are not Democrats. They hide amongst the Democrats. They are coming this Who will burn you the fuck down the first chance they get and so we need to understand what we are dealing with Who's on the list and those people have to be held accountable by this new administration or We're gonna be dealing with the same thing again. It's gonna be worse because these people are smart They're well-funded and they're superstitious and the relentless all right So Before you go and say oh, let's just live and let live and forget remember what happens when you do that because it's Historically not good. Yeah Yeah guys jump it on this conversation let us know down in the comments What you guys think with that being said let's get to our third and final headline I want to talk about some projections your thoughts on what should be the next steps from Trump Um, and so let's get into our third and final headline headline number three So yeah, so there's been some interesting people that have been calling Trump outside of Outside of the America The United States He's rushed to Congratulate Trump plugs victory plan and bipartisan support so Ukraine's velada mirrors lensky beat most world leaders to offer his congratulations to Donald Trump Using his message to apparently expressed hope the things will continue unchanged between Ukraine and the United States of America Hopefully that that's not the case But yeah, he's made some calls um and you know, they're already talking about how Trump's victory This is a CNN article with the headline reads Trump's victory could mean US withdrawal support for Ukraine and war with Russia As it fucking should The this article dives into it saying Ukrainian commander in chief Olex sender Zorzky sat in the statement on telegram on Saturday that the situation on the front line quote remains difficult In the certain areas quote require constant renewal of resources of Ukrainian units Meanwhile, Russia is understood to be bolstering its manpower with North Korean forces has been his 10,000 North Korean troops Our in Russia's kursk region And are expected to enter combat against Ukraine in the coming days US officials have warned Um now Trump's said multiple times that he could have that war over Day one yeah He's friends with Putin. What do you think what what do you think is the plan there like what is the okay? I tell you who it is yeah, all right The media the Democrats the i'm not talking about the average human Democrat We're not listen. I want to clarify something Because I don't want people to think I'm talking about my neighbors or my fucking dude down the street who might think differently than me I actually believe that almost all those people are really good people And I actually think that the people who fall for these people the reason they fall for them is because their hearts a little bit bigger than their head Okay, so In their wallets apparently, huh and their wallets well look I'm just saying idealism The reason this show is called real AF, okay, it's real American freedom everybody thinks it's real Andy for salad. It's not the fuck it is But it's the show for the realist all right The opposite of realist is idealist, okay? idealistic people have big hearts And they have trouble thinking almost like that lady who said I was I was leading with my heart now with my head Which is really good. It's a good way to live okay But when you make decisions like that you you become very vulnerable to lies because you trust people because you're a good person And then people come to you and they say don't you want to be a good person You're like yeah, right? And then these people go with it. So when I'm talking about Democrats, that's actually what I think about Democrats and I think centrist and people on the right I think they you know they they're less Idealism and more realist at this point in time. Yeah, where things stand today You have to make decisions from a realist perspective what things are not what you want things to be or what they should be and if you make decisions Based upon what things are you make effective decisions if you make decisions around what you want things to be or the way you think Things should be you make bad decisions all the time all right, and that's a lot of what happens here So the media my point saying all this is that the media Has lied to people about Vladimir Putin for a long fucking time because it benefits them the upper echelon elite Democrat Quote unquote elite Democrat officials We're mostly communist right Have lied about Vladimir Putin because it benefits them Trump and Putin would be like me Calling one of my other guys that I know that owns another cup like I know all the guys that own the companies that we could Pete with I know them all I got them all myself own in fact We all text each other and we talk shit and we have a good time. We always we you know like it's not really this bad thing Like yeah, we're competing, but we're still cool, okay? So this would be no different than me Calling up one of those dudes who I've known for years and years and years who I have mutual respect for because they've done something that I've done as well And I respect that because I know how hard it is and he knows how hard it is so we have mutual respect So I call him up on the phone. I say hey Let's stop doing this bro like this is fucked up your guys are getting killed my guys are getting killed It's cost to me money. It's costing you money. Let's stop doing this shit, okay? That's how this works. So Trump's gonna pick up the fucking phone. He's gonna call Putin He's gonna get he's gonna say hey Vladdie Daddy's home All right no more this bullshit and Vlad's gonna say god Thank you. These people are insane. How did you even do that and dude and then they're gonna start working together That's what's gonna happen dude. I think and then the media is gonna be like look He's with Putin friends with poop. Yeah, but they've been lying about that dude a whole time you guys got to be smart How many speeches do they allow you if it listen this goes for any historical figure by the way If they won't let you watch their speeches You should probably go try to watch their speeches Because there's a reason that they won't let you watch him if they were as bad as they said they were Wouldn't they let you see him You would like if you the boogie man is really that bad. I'm fucking shown to you so you know not to go over there Right, you see what I'm saying right I think you know the more that this you cranes shit like has been drawn out I'm starting to rethink The Putin's perspective and I think the whole reason that you know that like he One has allowed this stuff to go on we actually talked about this a little bit was all tan When he was here. Yeah, you know rushes making half a billion dollars every month that this war goes on Yeah, of course, right like they're making money. Yeah, this war right Um, I think it was actually on Putin's in and this is speculation I don't know but I what I like to believe is that Putin is a very principled man Yeah, and his whole goal was to just expose this for the American people because people tend to forget The only reason America has any type of attachments Uh to Ukraine Is solely because of the Biden family situation that's right with Ukraine Breastma and all that shit that they did we have no ties. They're not allies. They're not a NATO. They're not Like we have zero interest Biden had interest. Yes, that's the only reason we're sending a dollar to fucking Ukraine. Yeah, you know I'm saying so I believe now like I feel like Putin is more of just a principle thing like yeah I'm gonna drag this out so that way the American people in the world can see can see this It's possible, you know, I'm saying like I think that's what makes sense to me man. It's possible You know, so like I mean how many people knew that NATO was encroaching on the border to Russia. How many people knew that there was a ton of bio labs in Ukraine, right? How many people knew that before this right? How many people knew that there was a bunch of real Nazis in Ukraine? Yeah, I mean because we're talking about a that we're genociding Russians Russians, okay? We're talking about a top three world military power Yeah, if they really wanted to but like they could just fucking squash Ukraine It's like they could have done a long time a long time. They could have done it in a couple days Days You know, I'm saying but this has been going on for over a year You know, I'm saying like that is the only thing that makes sense to me at this point man. Yeah, well, I mean that's a I mean, I think that's a fair good perspective and observation. Yeah, you know, so I mean, I hope this you know, we don't know I don't know speculative shows But I wouldn't you can deduce things through observation. I think that's a really good observation bro Yeah, man. It's it's highly possible those guys are friends. They're not fucking Look dude, and not friends because they're buddy buddy is what they respect Yes, yeah, I'm putting does not fucking respect Biden period and it doesn't respect Biden because I know I'm Biden selling out a fucking country for this Okay, I agree with that But I do think that Putin has respect for the American people. I would agree with that I actually think he's shown massive restraint over the last few years Because he knows what's actually been happening and I think he believes And I think it'll come out that he believes and I actually think it'll come out that it's a hundred percent true That there was a coup in 2020 and he understands that we were running with a rogue government in a bunch of fishy shit And he didn't want to fucking kill a bunch innocent people Well because that shit was happening in his own backyard. Yeah, I know dude Yeah, no, he saw you crane. They did the same shit you claim in 2014. It was a color revolution You know, I'm saying like the shit was happening in his own backyard. It's too close to home You know, and so like I mean that's that's one of those things It's like I mean even just on the bottom like Americans We have this like idea that like you know the shit won't affect us until like it's affecting us Yeah, and I think Russia just took more of a proactive approach to it like no See this shit that is right down the next door, bro. I got to deal with this. It's highly possible that you're correct You know, so I mean we'll see I hadn't thought about it like that at least like I don't know I don't know, but it goes along with the observations that I've had every speech I've ever watched a Vladimir Putin and I try to watch them all not because I'm some Putin fan But I'm trying to know the truth. Yeah, and I have not seen any aggressive speeches From him that make him appear to be at the people that the way they describe them. I've never seen that. Yeah, man Yeah, so I mean it's interesting. We got to watch that so that'd be interesting I want to let's get you take on another situation that's happening Outside the United States that also is I mean, I'm sure it's on Trump's type prior like top five priorities right now the Middle East Thought this was interesting other people that have called Trump or at least put out public statements Hamas I'm in Palestine Hamas is Fox News article reads Hamas reacts to Trump victory says he must work Seriously to stop the war in Gaza So the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas said Wednesday that the incoming administration of presidential election winner Donald Trump must quote Work seriously to stop the war in the Gaza strip Declaration comes after a report emerged claiming Trump acts as Rayleigh Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu To wrap up the conflict by the time he gets inaugurated on January 20th If he had won the election Trump ultimately prevailed. I'm over vice president Kamala Harris obviously So it's interesting. So so you got Hamas now coming out saying yeah, I Trump like let's wrap this shit up Interesting on off at the same time they also celebrate the Trump win by firing more rocket into Israel. So I mean you got that But something that I thought was very very interesting. Let's go to the other side of that coin Israeli government celebrates Trump election triumph Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his supporters celebrated Donald Trump's election as president Hailing what a leader of the Israeli settler movement called him ally who would support them unconditionally congratulating Republican Trump Netanyahu said the former president had made quote histories greatest comeback He says quote your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful Recomitment to the great alliance between Israel and America He said in the statement which was echoed by the leaders of the hard-right nationalist religious parties Are there any this coalition Now it wasn't even just the statement that was made by Netanyahu that I thought hard-right You're still doing this shit. It's weird But but there was some like is there a regular right Is I hope so I'm just saying like it should be isn't every isn't all all right hard right far right There's there like a normal right We're just right But let's go to the streets of Israel because there have been there's been billboards now That I put up all across Israel and they look like this Congratulation Trump make Israel great Hmm How about make America great How about Israel you worry about yourself how about that you start shit with everybody Okay, and they get mappy real so they're like the little brother or little friend you had I used to have this buddy I did still buddies with him And motherfucker used to get a fight with fucking everybody And I was like the big guy and I had to fucking get in fights all the time because it's motherfucker Okay, I love the guy and I'll fight yeah, but like bro learn how to fight your own fights Okay, and if you don't want fucking problems stop making fucking problems That's what I see when I see Israel dude. Yeah, how do you think Trump handles this I don't know I don't know But if he stays true to his word and he says true about getting America back on track He'll eliminate any sort of foreign influence in our government whatsoever Doesn't matter if it's Russia doesn't matter if it's China doesn't matter if it's Israel doesn't matter We should not have any government officials who have dual citizenship or take money from any other country on earth Period if you are serious about making America great again And you are serious about America first you will do those things you will remove All foreign influence from our government including Israel From the United States government And if you're not serious you won't that's it No, and that's what we'll see and that's not that's that goes for any country that goes for any country We should have zero foreign interest affecting our government either in terms of kickbacks bribes backdoor deals dual citizenship any of this shit shouldn't be allowed Well, because like I mean if we can make the same statement that like that the only reason There's no allegiance at the United States has it to Ukraine Yet we're sending billions of dollars and supporting them and making decisions that affect Americans better that country We should be able to have that conversation about any country regardless of what that country is no shit Period like it's a very simple conversation. Well no shit You know, I don't know why we can't like can we we can see this whole thing have to no listen, dude We have to move on from cancel culture political correctness You know silent majority all of these things that are cultural weapons like when you say you can't talk about that Like I'm talking to the listeners when you guys say oh, I can't say that You're self-sensory. That's what political correctness is designed to do to get you to self-sensor That's what cancel culture is designed to do to get you to self-sensor If you realize that these things are fucking culturally dead which they are They are the minute you say they are the minute that you're able to say hey fuck you Give a fuck what you think this is what I think and I have a right to think it The minute you can do that their their little operations their games are done and culturally their games are being rejected So all of you who agree Every single one of you who agree that we should not have any foreign influence whether be Russian Chinese Mexican fucking Israeli in our government Fucking say so because that's the truth We don't have dual citizens and everybody else's countries. We aren't we're not fucking their politics They don't fuck no bro. They don't let that shift fly We're the only ones to let that shift fly let's stop that shit if we're America first. Let's be America first Let's not be America first accept Yeah, the Israeli government uses anti-semitism as a weapon against Americans to speak out against this This has nothing against Jews. This is about the country of Israel and the people who lead it Well most of which aren't even symmetric people Okay, so how the fuck is this anti-semitic to say Israel shouldn't have influence in our country that is not no country Ships right exactly so far for that shit bullshit guys jumping on this conversation.
