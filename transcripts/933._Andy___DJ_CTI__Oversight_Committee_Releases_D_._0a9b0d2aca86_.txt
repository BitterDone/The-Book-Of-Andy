She scored two goals. And so I got like, yeah, well, yeah, she was. She was the fastest one out. No, but she scored two goals and came over doing like a little halftime scrimmage thing.

So like, so like, dude, if we scored a goal or hurt another kid, yes, he would take us to the store and we buy a toy. Bro. I don't think he does know that. I don't know if we've talked about it on a real AF. That's an MFCEO story. That's true, though. That's fucking sick, dude. I'm down for it. And she told her coaches after practice, she's like, my daddy said he's going to get me candy for my goals. And they started fucking laughing. She likes candy and cookies, bro. Oh, fuck yeah, bro. Listen. She's all about it. We know where she got that. Mom. Oh, yeah.

Well, bro, that OK, if I do have a critique, right, the hospitals, brother, the shit that they make you sleep on. Like that little couch. It's a mini couch, bro. They get funded by fucking billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars, and they buy these miniature couches. You can't fucking fit on this fucking thick. Like, tell me, bro, that we can't get a bigger couch. No, fucking listen, it's bullshit. It is bullshit. It's sexist, actually. It's it's what it is. It's discrimination against the big man. That's what it is. Yeah. Well, I hacked the system, though. OK, so every stole a couch. Yeah. The thing is, like the nurses, they come in the room like every fucking 10 minutes. Yeah. Like they never stop. Yeah. Hey, mama, sorry, you know, and then fucking fucks everything up, makes babies cry and shit. And so every time she would come in, I had her bring me another blanket. So by the end of our stay, my fucking cot was like this fucking thick as fucking blankets. Is that how you like the is that how you like your bed? Like soft? I know I like soft, but firm. Yeah. I'm a big guy, but I don't know. I got to have the firm one. I need some I need some firm, you know, I'm saying. But I need to be soft. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I get it. Soft. You know, yeah, yeah. A little hard and soft. Yeah, I get it. OK, sounding a little gay. Just a little bit. All right, man. So what the fuck is going on in the world? I have not been paying attention. Same. And I've been busy. I read this my second full length podcast I've had to record today. Just today alone. Yeah, yeah, I saw that. No, it's it's yesterday. I had a fucking I had to go home, bro. I fucking like blew this. Yeah. Yeah, I didn't know what to do. I had a situation arise at HQ and I think I fucking I think I blew a fucking fuse. No, fuck. Yeah. I couldn't fucking see. Oh, it's been a while. Is it that bad? I got pretty mad. Oh, shit. Well, I didn't hear anything. So that's good. You know, I want to know. Look, I'm handling it better than I used to. Yeah, sure. Yeah, that's true. I'm proud of you, bro. Listen, I'm proud of you. I'm going to tell you what, dude, it was easier when I just kill people. Like when I would just rip their fucking Adam's apples out of their fucking throat. Yeah, it was so easy. Yeah, it was way easier. Yeah. But it's not as easy trying to be nice. No, trying to live, laugh and love. I'm not wired for that. Yeah. I'm wired for fucking battle. Yeah, I'm with it, bro. I'm with it. But no, there is a lot going on. There is a lot going on. Guys remember, pay the fee. Don't be hoes. But we're going to get into a lot of topics, but I wanted to start something off with because, Andy, I appreciate you, man. And you've opened my world up to a lot of different things. One of those things being heavy metal music. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And I didn't really, wasn't really into it. We started working out, jamming at Sal's gym, you know what I'm saying, during the- Those are some good workouts. Dude, those are some good workouts. Yeah. Little fucking- No AC. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? That's a real workout. Yeah, I mean, if you- This is shit over here in the gym and fuck, this is fucking bullshit. Air conditioning and the fucking- This is bullshit. Bro, just turn to air conditioning. You're not even really working out unless you're about to die. That's right. That's a fact. That's right. But you turned me into some heavy music, man, and System of a Down. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, you're a big fan of them. I like those guys. I like them. Korn. Yeah. All right. Yeah. It can put you in a mood. It'll make you want to do some stuff. You know what I'm saying? Listening to that type of music. Yeah. It was actually a running joke. We got to be careful because if we play heavy music around Andy, he's going to fucking kill somebody. You know what I'm saying? But out of all the things that it can make you want to do, this thing never really crossed my mind. So they actually had a concert, System of a Down and Korn did, up in New Jersey, and a guy started jacking off at the stands. What? Shut the fuck up, dude. I got the video. Let's check it out. Oh my God. Here's a clip. The guy smacks the shit out of him. He's jacking off in the concert, bro. What the fuck? What did I do? Was he really fucking beating his meat? Really beating his meat, bro? I don't know if he was drunk. What the deal was? What the fuck? There was a bunch of young girls and shit around. They carried his ass out of there. What the fuck? Dude, just wanking it, bro. I'm glad that dude pushed him in the head. Oh yeah. It's good to see. What are you in for? I was pounding it, you know? Fuck, dude, I was at Korn. The music just got ahold of me. I decided Korn needed some cream, you know what I'm saying? This guy's weird. His name's Joshua. Now he's famous forever for jacking off at the Korn concert. Oh my God. Bro, what are you doing? Bro, I don't know, man. Joshua... He's jacking off that seal. Look at his fucking face. All right, chat. So what would you guess this guy does for a living outside of masturbating lions at heavy metal concerts? Bro, come on, man. Okay, his real job. What do you think he does? Starbucks. No, he's got some sort of... He's some sort of kid counselor or some shit. Oh, no, no, no. That would be too bad. That would be too bad. Okay. Too bad. Do we get a hint? Boats. Boats? He's a captain? Seamen. He's a seaman. He's a seaman. Okay. On a historical ship out of Washington. This guy goes around and dresses up as a pirate and you can rent the boat that is fully staffed with... What do they call those? Scallywaggers? Yeah. Scallywaggers. Bro. Oh my God. Well, bro, he's used to beating off in front of everybody on the ship. There's nowhere to hide. He's like, fucking dude, I don't got to do... That is not a face of regret. No, that's a face of... You stopped me right when I was about to... Bro, imagine getting thrown in the fucking clinker with all these fucking dudes and they'll be like, hey man, what'd you do? What'd you hit for? What the fuck did you do? Oh, man. You're never going to believe this. They said I was jacking off at the fucking corn concert. It's corn. Come on, man. But I really wasn't. Yeah. Was it? I had a scratch on my balls. Yeah, that's it. I don't think he looks like a dude that would deny it. No, no. He's going to fess up to it for sure. Yeah. Bro, I thought that's what he was doing. I thought that was like he was like... Air drums? Yeah, the air drums and shit. Nope. Dude, that's so bad, man. I'm glad that dude smacked him in the head. Bro, what are you doing? Yeah. No, shout out to him. Bro, that motherfucker should go to prison. Yeah. We don't need that in society, dude. No. This lack of moral standard that's infected our society where dudes are just shitting on the street and jacking off in front of women. Bro, these people deserve to... Listen, I don't care what anybody says. You can be mad at me and you could say, oh, fucking... These people do not have a place in society. They don't belong in civilized society. They don't want to be. No, that's right. That's right. They don't have any interest in being. They get their excitement off the disruption they create and it fucking ruins everybody's shit. Like, I'm so tired of these fucking weirdos, bro. Anyway, fuck that guy. Yeah. It's just like... Out here jerking off sea lions. That's what I'm saying. Like, okay, you listen to some heavy metal. You want to punch a hole through some drywall. I get it. I've never listened to heavy metal ever and then been like, man, I got to be... I got to get one out real quick. Yeah, I never thought that. Like, fucking not once, which is kind of amazing. You know what I'm saying? Like, I'm 40 something years old. You think that would like... It would have happened by now. Yeah. Well, at least once. Yeah. No, it never happened. Sorry, guys. I like your music. Yeah. Not that much. Yeah. What are you on, the world? Oh, fuck. I thought that was interesting, man. Yeah. I'd say so. Yeah, guys, tell us what you guys think down in the chat. What should the appropriate punishment be for jerking off in public? Yeah. Yeah. Playing what song? Yeah, cut it off. That's a fucking great solution. That'd be great. Woodchipper to the song, smash it with a hammer. Hammer smashing. That'd be appropriate. That would suck. I like that. No, but it would make it bigger. You know what I'm saying? Oh, dude. I mean, look at this guy, peeing his butt. Motherfucker, some people do that for fun. That might not be a punishment to him. Yeah. I mean, fuck. Twist his dick. Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's right. That's what we got, man. But yeah, let's get into our headlines, man. Guys, remember, as always, if you would like to see any of these pictures of us, of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to andyfussella.com. You guys can find them all linked there for you. You guys can also come check us out on video, Spotify, Twitter, YouTube. Come check us out. Yeah. Or else. Or else. Or else. So yeah, let's get into our first set of headlines, man. Let's kick things off. Let's do a little Epstein update, because there's some things happening. Not for real. But there's some other stuff happening. Good old Epstein. Yeah. So Oversight Committee releases DOJ Epstein files. And it was like 33,000 pages, an additional 33,000 pages. Most of it was heavily redacted. And the other stuff we've already seen before. And so this comes out. There's this new, the House Oversights Committee, they subpoenaed the Department of Justice. And this was, now they did this back on like August 5th, I believe. And so this was the update on it. So they just released that. And it's nothing. It's really nothing. There's not a whole lot there. And again, it's all put in no actual chronological order. There's nothing really going on to there. But here is the update that I want to talk about, that I'm interested in. Is that this Oversight Committee, they actually listened to some testimony in closed chambers with some alleged victims of the Epstein situation. Nancy Mays, Representative Nancy Mays, she was seen leaving the meeting ahead of time, saying that she had suffered a full blown panic attack. And so there was a video of her leaving that meeting. Let's check this clip out. Yeah, so she walks out and then a couple of hours later, she posts this on Twitter. She says, since it's already being reported, yes, I left the oversight briefing with Epstein victims early. As a recent survivor, not two years in, I've had a very difficult time listening to their stories. Full blown panic attack, sweating, hyperventilating, shaking. I can't breathe. I feel the immense pain of how hard all victims are fighting for themselves because we know absolutely no one will fight for us. God bless all survivors. So that happens. She and she got some shit on Twitter about that. You know, but there was a recent survivor, not two years in. What happened to her? I'm under I don't know. I don't know anything about it. I haven't heard anything about it. I don't know if she's been public. I'm not saying she hasn't. I haven't heard anything about it. You know, but here here is another development that has come out with this, though, and this comes from Anna Paulina Luna. She says that Jeffrey Epstein may have been an intelligence asset working for our adversaries. And so she puts this out kind of like in a tweet, but and kind of lays it out in some bullet points for us. So she tweeted this out. We'll go through this. She says some of the ref, some info referencing the Epstein victims testimony today. So she says there are over thirty three thousand documents. Names will be in those files per the victims. We need to follow the money trail. This was a well orchestrated operation with many tentacles to include shell corporations, et cetera. Chairman Comer via House oversight is sending a SAR's request to the U.S. Treasury. There's a lot on cover referencing the Deutsche Bank and how money was funneled and moved. Epstein's network was described as an international trafficking network to all members of Congress who were present, both Democrat and Republican, and also involved trafficking women from Slavic nations as well. Immigration fraud, et cetera. Many of those women have stayed silent due to fear of retribution. Foreign governments, as in more than one, were named to be working with Epstein. Victim information, rightfully so, was redacted from release, but the committee as a whole is working to ensure that they will be given access to their information. That was previously denied to them by other admins. Thank you to the Trump admin for handling all of this over handing all of this over. One victim had a newborn daughter threatened for coming forward. Epstein was still victimizing underage girls on work release while wearing an ankle monitor only to spend the evening in prison. The attorneys of some of these implicated individuals have apparently already tried to contact some of the victims' attorneys. Representative Comer is running point on this, and she's going to be backing them up. Now, I know we've talked on the show, you know, like people fixating on the child trafficking portion of this and how, like, you know, if not saying that it's not that, there just hasn't really been proof of that. If it is that terrible, absolutely terrible. But I think the bigger, not bigger picture. I think it's it's important to clarify what is defined as a child. Right. Like, I think, you know, an underage girl who's 16 is still fucking child. But a lot of people are talking about children in the context of them being like babies. Yes. Fucking three, four years old. Correct. Yeah. So so that's what I that's what we mean about the children. It's it's these these are underage women who are children, I guess, like what you legally have for sure legally. Right. But they're not like small babies. Yeah. Which is what most people was going. I'm not saying there's any fucking anything okay about that. I'm saying that it's a it's a it's a misunderstanding of how people are looking at. For sure. And I think our biggest takeaway, too, was like the purpose of the trafficking and the purpose of the trafficking by all evidence that, you know, or theories, whatever you want to say that is blackmail. Yes. They're doing that. And a lot of people are saying, oh, it's because they're eating all the babies and all this crazy shit, which, dude, you know, who the fuck knows if it's true or not. But that's there's been no evidence to show. Sure. Right. And there is a lot of evidence to show the blackmail. For sure. And so, you know, and Paulina Luna comes out saying that it wasn't, you know, it's not just one foreign government that was involved. It was multiple foreign governments involved and that most of the women were coming from Slavic nations. Now there is. So after they did this closed door briefing to this oversight committee, they then went out and representative Tommy's Thomas Massey is involved in it. Major Taylor Green's involved in it. Comer is as I said, one of the victims did speak because they did like a little press conference outside to the public. And this was one of the clips from from that press conference. Let's check this out. I have spent the last 17 years in my own prison. For she Jeffrey and all the co-conspirators did to me. I was raped repeatedly. I was raped three times a day sometimes. And I was not the only girl on that island. There was a constant stream of girls being raped over and over and over again. And yes, you must die in prison because I've been in hell and back for the last 17 years. And 27 for me, I was 10 years old when Liz Stein was being trafficked. I was 10. That is how long the sex trafficking ring has been going on. She's saying she was 10. She was 10 years old. Well, then maybe that's a different story than we were just talking about. Yeah, she says she was 10. So I mean, and again, like, yes, that's absolutely terrible. Does it? But there's still another element of this is that, again, it was it was these just nasty fucking old rich fucks that were just doing dirty shit. Or was this an orchestrated thing that was not my government? Yes. To get those rich dirt fucks or politicians or whoever it may be. Like, yes, this is a bad piece of it. We don't want to miss. What was the purpose? Was there a purpose for it? No, the purpose is to get leverage on everybody who is relevant in any situation ever. And if you think about the technology that exists now, they no longer need to do this anymore. OK, if they did need to do it, Jeffrey Epstein wouldn't be dead and he wouldn't be in jail and they would still be doing it. Right. The reason they don't need these these systems to do this anymore is because they have the technology now to just do it. They can dip right into your phone. And by the way, don't you find it interesting that every single person who ever goes against these people almost always ends up being found to be some sort of child molester or have some sort of sexual pictures on their computer? And nobody ever stops to ask how did they actually get there? They just assume that the person did that. Right. When in reality, these people can put these this shit on any device they want and then fucking knock on your door and put you in jail and say, you're a fucking child molester and your life is over. And that's what these people do now. They don't need to go get the fucking they don't need to go do this anymore. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Well, that means let's go cruise and comments, bro. It's been a minute. Yeah. Cruise some of these things. We've got some hot ones in here. Yeah. No, no. Some hot fries. First one is from locally hated wraps. Says, if Andy ain't wearing that Batman PJs, I'm not watching the show next Monday. We all heard that. Fuck. Oh, yeah. Fucked up. I got to get them, dude. Yeah. I order them right now.

It has to be at least. Even if you're fucking little, you should wear XL. Just to pretend. Yeah. Just to get a taste of the pressure. Yeah. Yep. Next one is GUEs. He says, the reason I started listening to tuning, toning to the show was 75 hard back in 22. The reason I continue to listen to and share the show is because use of the perspectives provided comedy and lessons to be learned. There is not another show like this that there speaks of the topics and viewpoints like this. Unsurpassed quality here. Always. Thank you, brother. Yeah, that's very, very fucking genuine. Nice comment. Very nice, man. You know, I was thinking about this, too. We are better than everybody else. I was just thinking about that.

It's like Andy said that six months ago on literally every fucking one of these guys clips. Oh, yeah. That's my favorite stuff. Yeah. Yeah, man. I wish our followers would fucking call him out more, though. It's funny. Like how some of these shows get the spotlight. Like, well, I think they've deleted a lot of that shit too, though. Huh? They delete those comments, bro. Oh, well, I'm saying this. What I'm saying is it's interesting that like shows that have are saying like, we're so fucking out front that by the time everybody else is saying it like, we look crazy. Yeah, right. But then, like, somebody else says it, and it's all over the fucking Internet. It's like, dude, what do you like? That's my life. Like, all I do is watch clips of all the other guys. And I'm like, you know, I just love that. Other people say shit that I said six months ago. Yeah, and then like everybody like holy shit You see what so-and-so said right?

So did you see that clip of? the United States Fucking bombing the shit out of that boat bro Yeah Okay, so Trump releases the footage of US strike on trend day a ragwa boat drug boat off of Venezuela So this happened Tuesday Well, I believe actually on Monday and then he released it on Tuesday and it's footage of a US military destroying a Boat carrying drugs and trend a ragwa gang members off the coast of Venezuela I mean, it's like a fucking 12-second clip But these are allegedly narco tear or were allegedly narco terrorists Fucking destroy even if they weren't but and so like when I saw the clip the first time though I didn't think it was real because it looked like a fucking video gamers like some Call of Duty shit but I Fucking love it. This was this was the clip was posted out from the official White House White House page. Let's check this out. I Mean, it's just you know, they're just you know being terrorists drug narco terrorists You know just you know doing terrorist shit drugs And then Kabir going off to corn is right. That's right There it is and then kaboom Fuck It's fucking awesome they were headed here they're headed to the United States. Hey, okay and You know there was a boat then there wasn't a boat And then you know, I just love the shit talk that happens after this stuff You remember when he killed that fucking that died like a dog. Yes Abu yeah been sorry No other world leaders doing that like that I imagine Connor McGregor will probably do something similar Should he win the presidency over there, but he tweeted Trump the truth this out I'm basically saying fuck around find out. Yeah Everybody else needs to be aware and be on the lookout Because it's not stopping. So I thought that was great now the DOD there, you know, that's who you use use military forces to conduct this This this very targeted strike warheads on foreheads is the same thought was fucking awesome But there's something else happening with the DOD that I thought was interesting. This has to do with migration. All right Defense Department to send up to 600 attorneys military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges Alright, so this just came down. All right, and I thought this was this was pretty interesting So the Department of Defense, they actually changed the name is now back to the Department of War, I believe They did that little change, but they are considering authorizing up to 300 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges the defense official confirmed Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in the statement that at the request of the Justice Department the Defense Department is in the process of identifying qualified judge advocates and civilian attorneys for details to serve as temporary immigration judges Parnell said the Defense Department attorneys would help with the backlog of cases by presiding over Immigration hearings the Associated Press first reported So right now there's a backlog of 3.4 million cases Just in the immigration side, right? These are people who are trying to claim asylum These are people who may have committed some some not so good things on American soil And these are judges would be sitting there determining whether or not they should stay should leave And now the DOD is getting involved in this Now of course that's you know having some backlash but Well, I mean, you know, it's everybody, you know, well we want the 3.4 million backlog of cases Why wouldn't we want that? Who wants that? Right Right. I mean should we just add them to the fucking list of people we kick the fuck out of here Let's expedite this process. Yeah, and I think that's the thing It's like, you know people want this stuff to go so quickly right and like Yes, we do right but to your point just even on the strategy side like on our judicial legal side, man It's like it's so bogged down with all of these fucking hoops and hurdles that Obstacles that you got to jump through like if it I wish it was as easy Why why does someone who's here illegally have rights at all due process? Yeah, right Well, and so like and that's the thing would you fucking get that in any other country? like if I fucking went into you know, wherever else and Like do I get it like a fucking fair trial and shit and they're gonna be fair No, don't you get just around it up and throw either thrown in prison or thrown the fuck out of the country? Brittany Griner Russia, I mean, yeah, I mean what the fuck are we doing? Yeah, I'll be real dude. I'm sick of these people these these Dude, I'll be real man I'm sick and tired of these people who have no contact with the outcomes and the issues that every Single regular person has to deal with from these motherfuckers being here and then stopping them from going I am tired of people who just resist everything That anyone tries to do to clean up this country for the sake of resisting it I'm sick of people siding with the criminals. I'm sick of people siding with you know anybody who's not a taxpaying American citizen and These people who stand up for example and get upset that criminals are being Deported or that crime is being squashed by whatever means necessary And you're throwing a fucking fit like this douchebag in Chicago. Oh Yeah, you know I got some of that oh good Yeah, so so then that's the transition right so like, you know, those people deserve to go to fucking jail You are a treasonous American. Yes. Yes, you are rooting against the American taxpayer Who voted your stupid ass into office you motherfucker? Yeah. Well, that's the thing and so it's like, you know I think what Trump is trying to do because of all those legal obstacles both he's he's embarrassing them Exposing and he's using the powers that he can't yeah, like how how how stupid does Pritzker look right now, bro Like like Washington DC you even have Every single day bro. You even have the left media saying bro. This is nice. Yeah, I don't worry about shit I live in DC. This is fucking great. You have people on fucking CNN and MSNBC saying that You have people in the the dangerous communities, which are mostly black communities saying they're thankful for Trump and what he's doing And you got this fuckface this fat Piece of shit in Chicago and his little butt boy Telling people are they ready to resist the American invasion? What are you talking about bro? Well, I saw that clip. I watched that clip about a hundred that guy should be kicked out like Legitimately either put in prison kicked out of the country Yeah Dude if I stood on that if I would have fucking that openly blatantly called for a fucking revolution They're I'd be in fucking prison like J Sixers insurrection, but these motherfuckers can do it whenever the fuck they want Yeah, no problem at all. Here's the clip. I hope they do fucking stand up against them. Yeah, and get run the fuck over Let's check nobody's gonna do that. No, the people in Chicago were like fuck. Yeah, bro. We need this shit fixed Well, so some funny things on that, but I want to play this clip This is because any talking about the mayor of Chicago Brandon Johnson Here's the clip. He's referencing Are you prepared to defend this land this land that was built by slaves? A land that was built by indigenous people a land that is built by workers. Are you prepared to defend this land? The people United will always prevail I need you all to stand firm to stand strong if this president decides to continue to break this constitution Okay. Okay. So I had to do some research. Okay Do you know who founded Chicago? Okay. All right. Well history lesson. It was a black guy His name was Jean Baptiste Pont de Sable. Okay found in Chicago Black guy, okay you Cuz we talked about you know, his land was you know, listen, I ain't trying to hear listen We're done hearing this shit. I don't give a fuck. Yeah What is it? They there's some truth to it, but it was this black guy slaves Bro Jean Baptiste, okay was made his fortune in the slave trade Had 80 personal slaves the sign of death and And they maintained to be a part of his estate even after you know, the black slave owners were the worst ones to bro Bro, that's historically accurate. But here's the thing. It's like, you know, one of the things like obviously we know crime is fucking terrible Right. Look, I want to make this point. I don't give a fuck who built what I don't give a fuck I don't want to hear about fucking slavery from people who've never fucking had to deal with it I don't want to hear about how I'm fucking racist for the last fucking 40 years of my life because of something that happened 300 400 200 fucking years ago I'm fucking over it. And so is everybody else. Oh, yeah, I saw this video online last night of this black girl saying Do you know where the do you know where the phrase good morning comes from? Good good morning means it's back in the slave days They used to say good morning the slave owners sent it to the black people to make them feel but it's spelled different you stupid fuck It's a different word Like dude, I'm so tired Everything being this thing. Mm-hmm. Like fuck dude. Can none of us have to deal with that? Can we all look at each other and be like? all right That happened 200 fucking years ago, can we please work together now? Can we become something productive? Can we stop being led into these arguments and these disagreements by the elite people in the fucking earth? To hate each other so that we continue to be victimized by these same people like dude I'm done. I'm done hearing about it. If someone brings it up to me, I don't fucking care. I don't care what you call me I don't care. I don't care. I'm over it. No, I'm over it like what like 200 years ago when my family was fucking raped in Sicily by fucking the Moors like Imagine that was my fucking identity. Yeah, right. You know what I'm saying? Like Jesus Christ, dude Yeah, so don't say good morning. I'm fucking so over it dude. I'm so over it. I'm not I'm not the only one Everybody's tired of it. Everybody's tired of this Weaponization of history to make people feel guilty so that the people who are making the people feel guilty can do whatever the fuck they want Yeah, no, it's real. It's real Well, so on this thing, you know, send in the garden to Chicago, right? Because they're not asking they're not asking the people the right they're not asking the right people about their thoughts on this Right, you know, you know who they ask Andy fucking white Karen. No, I'm sure no they they asked they asked the criminals Wow the criminals yeah residents of Chicago's most violent block don't want Trump to send that I wonder why I Wonder fucking why why well, this is another example of what I'm talking about about them siding with the fucking criminals, bro This ain't a fucking this ain't a temperature heat map. That's a crime heat map violent crime heat map, bro You know and like here's my thing too, right because you have these people like, you know, Mayor Johnson gets up Oh, no, don't sit on we don't want them here we're gonna fight whatever it's like bro You're literally you're you're trying to rally up people To be on your side so that they can continue to fucking live in fear Did you hear what he said? He said more than that. Oh, yeah. He said the shootings will continue Bro, it's like it's insane. It's insane. And you know what? I'm actually what I'm actually more concerned about because like here's the thing like If they were actually doing any any type of decent job, then we would see it But I guess ain't just crime that Chicago, you know, wait, Brian Brandon Johnson should be focused on as a fucking reading levels of Chicago And how approximately only 30% of Chicago public school students? Hey, it's three to eight. They want that They want that they don't intend to fix that They want people to be illiterate. They want people to be stupid. They want people to be violent It gives them a story to tell about what they're gonna fix and then people to blame That's what they want Like it's sad man It's sad. Well, that guy's a racist piece of shit both of yeah, they both are racist piece of shit fucking but boys I Fuck another thing. I fucking thought about what's up, you know the body positive as long as we're in on the shit The Body positivity movement. Yeah. Okay. Remember like you see him in workout clothes. No, bro. There's a picture of it Yeah, well, it's pretty bad. He's lost some weight. I think no. No, I think he has I'm being fair I think he's lost some weight. I think he's lost actually like a hundred pounds Because he's like seven. Yeah, right. But the point the body positive this shows you dude like These people are so full shit Notice that all the fucking fat body positivity people Now they're taking ozempic and they all got skinny. Mm-hmm So it shows you that they were full of shit the entire time the entire time Yeah, they were full of shit What's no different than these guys they were just looking for a fucking way to not have to do the work like Like well, it's just like these guys like, you know telling them like oh, we're not gonna fix the crime We don't want you know troops here while they walk around with 24-7 fucking armed security, dude. No shit I mean, I think Pritzker I think you should go live in a block Yeah, go live in until the problem solved no security. Yeah and tell me then then tell me how that's right You know what? That's actually a really good idea Like what we're all these people who want to side with the criminals They should be forced to go fucking live in those neighborhoods then no period go do it. Let's see It we're not moving a guy who's never had to work a day in his motherfucking life. By the way, he is loaded No, he's not loaded. He's the richest politician in the fucking whole country Oh, yeah, and he didn't earn it at all. He fucking inherited it. Yeah, no matter what the fuck they say on the internet No That's stupid bro fucking douchebag Dude, let's move on The point is all these people are full of shit They're all liars that like anybody who speaks up for crime deserves to fucking go to prison you know anybody who speaks up for illegals to be here deserves to fucking go to prison and it was funny because Another thing that we didn't get to cover because we didn't have a show this week was Newsom got a he gave a speech and he said that he was worried that That Trump was going to send ICE agents to the polls all that I saw that I thought Yeah, that illegals didn't vote in elections Is you know if you're not an illegal? What do you have to be afraid of ice for right and why are you concerned about that? Like these people are so stupid do they tell on them? So, I don't know who's dumber dude the people who fucking can watch the shit and believe what they say or the guys that say it Yeah Intimidate the voters Good which one it's good Yeah, it's stupid man guys doing something wrong. You're gonna be afraid of that's my philosophy Yeah, man guys jumping on this conversation.

Okay wilds who hopes to be back home tonight Grateful for the messages of support pouring in I appreciate them with all the good comments that made but it's also been good for me to Have such a good network of friends and family wild says at one point he had 30 Buffalo on his property But as he's gotten older he has whittled that number down to two and he says that he is sad to think That he can't trust being alone with dozer He is going to try and look at all of his options including possibly finding another place for dozer to go.
