We just got back off with nice weekend We were in probably what I would say maybe not the most historic place on earth or even in this country But I mean a pretty historic place. Yeah, I thought that was pretty fucking yeah, we got to go to Boston do a couple days I never been it was the same. Yeah, and I've been up and down the east coast a few times I've never been to Boston. Yeah, I thought it was fucking beautiful I thought so too we flew in and then we got our driver our driver We're pulling out of the airport and the driver's like hey, look at that. That's where Paul Revere was captured And I'm like damn yeah, holy shit. Yeah, and then like along the way He's like here's where this happened here's where that happened here's where this happened and like dude It was just crazy. I bet the people there don't even think about it though. No, no It's funny you brought a driver up because he actually texted me on Saturday. Yeah, if you don't mind I like to read this text message from me because I mean we talk about you know, we interact With real people we get to see real temperature checks. Yeah, you know, I'm saying so he texted me he texted me this on Saturday So after we were already back home and we flew back Friday Friday, right?

I like you guys even more You guys are the best and most organized clients I've ever met I've seen a lot of people from professional players actors CEOs, politicians, etc. Your organization skills Just give me a little shout out, but I'm he's like if you ever come back to Boston Please ask for me. I'll take care of you and anything you need that's cool now He's a fan of the show and it makes sense because like you know how we do it We try to like you know, I might throw a couple stuff out that I didn't know if he was gonna pick up on it not but He was from Columbia. Yeah, he said something like he knows yeah, he knows the truth Yeah, he knows what evil looks like he knows what all of this shit that they're doing to us. You know, it's evil exists Exactly, that's a big problem for us. That's a big problem with a lot of people in America, bro They don't have the thing to compare it. That's right. It's been so good for so long people people assume that everybody It's just such a great person because they're a decent person. Yeah, it's not the case man I mean dude like it sounds good like I mean It's a nice hope But it's just not it's not the truth and you will get hurt With just that hope. Well, we're seeing it happen. Yeah, man look, bro What's happening in this country is the result of the good? It's a result of tolerance. It's that's tolerance movement that's been put down through culture through Hollywood through the media For the last decade or so maybe maybe 15 years and You know The good upstanding normal people of this country had been bullied into tolerance In the tolerating things that they don't really feel like they should tolerate because anytime they've spoke out against it They've been labeled a racist a misogynist Yeah, whatever dude all the is right and You know, so now you have a big part of the population who stayed silent and and in the face of what I believe to be either Evil or mentally ill people and they've gained a bunch of ground and this is like playing a football game, dude You got you got an offense and you got defense and if the defense just says oh, you know these like it doesn't matter They could be playing Little league Peewee football players and the defense could be NFL and the NFL says you know what We're not gonna we're not gonna hit these guys because they're little and they're small and we feel bad for them and they yell and cry and throw Tantrum if we beat them so we're eventually the other team's gonna win they will march down the Yeah, and like that's what we've got going on we have the weakest most mentally ill people in this country Getting a free pass because good Upstanding patriotic American citizens who are common sense driven are afraid to offend them because they've had tolerance jammed down Their throat for so long and that's that's that's what the result we're seeing is from it's from good people Not saying shit when they recognize that things are fucked up. Yeah, no, that's real shit, man That's definitely real shit I brought up the Boston story because Boston Massachusetts like set beautiful place love the people Really really awesome stuff, but since we've been home There's something else going on in Massachusetts right now, and it's literally all over the internet I don't want to get to Q and I'm crazy, right? But do they just found a body and Barack Obama's backyard This is a number's body found in search for blackmail paddleboard a 43 who drowned and pond on Obama's Martha vineyards its estate 911 call was made from ex-presidents 12 million dollar property last night. What was this? This just fucking has it yeah, like last night. Oh really? Yeah, yeah, I haven't I've been busy Real job Outside from YouTube and yeah, that's right outside being youtuber and something that's better But yeah, so just a little bit so so divers have found the body of a paddleboarder who went missing in the water off a Martha's vineyard near Barack Obama's sprawling $12 million state The 43 year old vanished on Sunday evening while he was out with another paddleboarder on Egratown great pond Massachusetts And emergency crews were dispatched to Obama's residence witnesses told cops the man went underwater and then briefly Reappeared as he struggled to stay afloat before submerging again around 7.46 p.m A massive joint agency search resumed a Monday morning for the African American male Who was last seeing wearing all black without a lifejack and MV times reported His paddleboard and hat were recovered Sunday evening and his body was found in the water at 10 a.m On Monday the dispatch Address for the incident came from Obama's Martha's waterfront vineyard home It is unclear if the former president 61 is currently staying at the estate Massachusetts state police said shortly before 10 a.m The body of a missing paddleboarder was recovered from Egratown great pond by Massachusetts state police divers Quote MSP underwater recovery unit divers made the recovery after the victim's body was located by a Massachusetts environmental police officers Deploying side scan sonar from a boat Yeah, man, I like it's just I mean that sounds like a freak accident. I wouldn't dig too much into that Yeah, unless there's more to it. I mean was this on a pond though? It's like in the ocean. No, no, so it's on the pond. That's like on the island. Okay, right? So the island's around about ocean But on the island. It's a pond. Okay, and that's where this half you're sure about that positive That's that's it there. That's the pond. Oh, well, that's a like a more like a lake pretty big. Yeah It's not that deep though. I think they said That's a feet deep A feet deep and even about a hundred feet from shore. What what happened to them? That sucks. I don't know man. It's just weird. You know, I mean you should probably get where this picture of Hillary come from Yeah, I don't know it's just it's just weird man like the whole thing how it came out is just and they're not releasing the name and all of it like they're holding it off I'm supposed to be releasing it later on the day, but when they release the name You know, it'll be interesting to find out what kind of connections he had for sure. Yeah, these people These people certainly don't have the reputation for you know Letting people who oppose them survive. Yeah, you know, yeah lose loose strings right. Yeah Oh, man, it's just I just thought it was interesting man, but uh, all right, man Well, it is cruzy internet. Yeah, we can get to cruising now that we got Hillary out the way guys Let's get into it, man. We got a we got a headline number one headline of one reads now hold on For those of you who I gotta give you this book because for those of you guys who don't know Outside of just being a youtuber and supplementing seller all right, you're a branding genius I don't know about that Listen When I do New York Post calls it. So I mean your brand of genius. I thought you would have a great insight on this first deadline Twitter announces new name logo and direction Want to see what you got on this so so Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino revealed on Sunday that the company that she was recently hired to lead is changing its name It's logo and the future of the platform quote It's an exceptionally rare thing in life or in business that you get a second chance to make another big impression Twitter made one massive impression and changed the way we communicate Yaccarino wrote on the site quote now X will go further Transforming the global town square X is the future state of unlimited Interactivity centered in audio video messaging payments banking creating a global marketplace for ideas goods services and opportunities She continued quote powered by AI X will connect us all in ways. We're just beginning to imagine Even the site owner the article continued site owner Elon Musk said in a tweet late last week that the site was going to Transition into the new brand over the coming days This tweet was posted out just yesterday That's all your merit took posted this out calling it the new Musconemy with all these different logo options And Elon Musk replied saying quote going with minimalist art deco on the upper right probably Probably changes later certainly will be refined And officially now Twitter HQ is now the XHQ It's just a massive rebrand going out right so he's scrapping the bird the bird is out bird is no longer the word And X is in Now there's been mixed reviews from the public This person Dan Hilt tweeting or I guess it's called Xing now he X did Xed this I guess Insane that Musk would rebrand as something as iconic and topical as Twitter to quote on quote X Or this lady Tiffany Fong she says quote sorry dude. I'm still calling it Twitter Andy you know a little bit about branding at least a little bit. I think that's fair to say at least Can you get us in the mind like what what when is this necessary what can you can you get us maybe a peek into what Elon's going through right now? Well There's this concept that When people become successful in things They start to believe that no matter what they do it will actually work and it's a great idea I call it the Midas touch. It's it's not real though and you see this a lot with entrepreneurs right they they built something that was really great and Then they go over here and like you know you built a business and then you think you can be a restaurant You know owner and you start to open a restaurant doctors going into yeah, right like and they think because they're successful at Surgery and they've been a successful doctor, but now they can run restaurants and what they fail to understand is that each avenue Is it's different thing and then also each skill set inside a company is a different thing So certain people that understand brand may not understand sales may not understand marketing of the brand may not understand leadership right And when you become successful, it's real easy to believe that anything that you touch is going to work It's the drone hubris telling you that you're great Honest take on this you know look Elon Musk is I'm I'm a mere Fucking bacteria compared to what he's accomplished in business, okay? So this is coming from just my perspective and I'm aware of where I stand next to him. Yeah I think his Tesla brand is weak. I think the cars are ugly. I think if he did if he made some better looking cars I think he'd sell a lot more of them. I think there's a lot of shit that he does that could be improved upon tremendously I think this is this move he's not considering a whole bunch of things I think one you know you have the time of Twitter being familiar, which is over it's it's 15 years people understanding What Twitter is and you just flush that down the toilet? So now you have to start over you have to start over and you're starting over and in 15 years You you probably won't have the brand equity the Twitter has because Twitter is a pretty good name All right now you also identified one of the problems in your question when you didn't know what to call it Okay, everybody knows what a tweet is now one of these things gonna be called okay That's something to be thought through another thing to be thought through is that X is a generic turn And to get fucking trademark on a generic term is virtually impossible This brand because the term is so generic will be very hard to actually enforce and get a trademark and He will be okay because he has a he has unlimited expendable income But for you and I to do something like this it would be impossible because they wouldn't even award us a trademark Because the branding is so fucking generic. So there's all kinds of problems here with this move This guy's a PR expert though, you know when he came out with the fucking what is that truck? He came out with the cyber truck that you know and he threw the rocket the window and it broke I was in touch yeah, bro. We got tons of PR right this is getting tons of PR right now So it's hard to know what is actually going through this man's brain because he's very intelligent dude He understands how to use the media he understands how to get people to talk and so it could be that too So I'm not gonna sit here and pretend like this is a dumbass move, you know, you like everybody else there There's a lot of degrees fucking dumb fucks on the internet these guys These guys are They've never built anything they never built a brand they never built a movement They never done anything and they've all got an opinion which is the problem with the entire internet anyway All opinions are not created equal all right The biggest problem with the internet is that it's allowed people to have no experience and and Really anything to feel like their opinions are as valid as people who have the experience in those areas and that's a big problem with Society we see it in every single this is part of the reason I stopped comp are posting on the internet because I got so tired of The dumbest people in the world having shit to say about things that cannot possibly understand right like that's that's a big problem and I don't know dude like time is going to have to show what his move is But if if we're looking at it surface level and we're just saying okay, he's gonna roll with this I think it's a poor move. I don't think it's a move It's like if I was sitting in the room with them. I'd be like look dude You got 15 years of brand equity. All right, everybody knows what Twitter is. It's a tweet. What are you gonna call it an X? Maybe they have a name. I don't know. I don't know what it is You know There's there's all kinds of objections as to why this is a bad move And not very many to why it's a good move and to be completely honest. I don't think I think this is And this could be this this could be the intentional You know watering down of this platform in order to like sort of let it dissolve out Because a lot of people talk about Elon actually being a part of what's going on You know, he's invested in neural link. He's invested in all these companies He's he's he's backed a lot of these things this climate change initiative a lot of these things that the communists in the world are trying to push he's been a part of for a long time and it's hard for me to tell if he is Just a very smart intelligent inventor who's just now recently become aware of what is actually happening Or if he's been a part of it the entire time and I it's hard I can't tell I don't know if we're not friends, you know, I love to be friends with him, but like the point is is You know, we we don't know yeah, and so it's hard. It's very hard to tell so like you know if you had a platform, right and you you You saved it from the the censorship and all the BS that he saved it from And you got everybody on your team and then you know These are the people who are quote unquote the enemy of all the things that your actual business practices depend on Support it. Okay, so you get all these people in one group and then you intentionally devalue the platform and kind of make it like irrelevant There's a lot of things it could be yeah, you know, one of the first things I thought of when I saw this is I'm like damn Maybe he's trying to let me do like Twitter does have a as much brand equity as it does have You also got to think about all the negatives that goes with that right like the Twitter files things like that So like is this him trying to you know, I guess I don't move himself from that. No, you know, I'm saying the Twitter files help the brand equity of Twitter Not hurt it. Yeah, you know what I mean like that's the story. Yeah, we had this we had the sinking ship We came in we fixed it now. It's this amazing thing So you're saying that name could have still been I tell you what if I own it just still be called Twitter Dude you guys got a lot of money Elon doesn't have enough money to spend to create the brand equity the Twitter has already It's and everybody's brain everybody knows what a tweet is everybody knows what Twitter is How you no matter how rich he is and if he spent all of his money on trying to rebrand ex It still wouldn't be there because branding takes time Okay, branding there's a time aspect of branding but you cannot outspend It's just a part of the equation. So time existing is part of the branding equation Right, there's a reason I wear this hat every day and you don't know what the fuck it stands for You're all gonna find out branding right? I'm saying so It could be a lot of things And my humble opinion compared to his this man's success um, I could be totally wrong, but I'm pretty good at branding stuff. I know what I'm doing I could probably help him a whole lot And I don't if it's surface level and this is what's going on. I don't see how this makes sense I'm on that real quick though, you know like there was this video That went around I want to say maybe eight months ago or something Um, but Elon Musk he was talking to like just this journalist kid And they're talking about the spaceships the rocket ships and shit right I mean kid didn't mention something about the rockets and Elon Musk was like Fuck why haven't we been doing that literally change the whole game plan My point is is that like to to that point Do you think it's also possibly because we even talk about this with Donald Trump that he is just surrounded By people who are either not giving him honest feedback or just giving him feedback of what they think he wants to hear Who's better at branding somebody who's built a whole bunch of brands in real life? Or somebody who graduated from fucking Yale with the marketing. I would say the real world application. No shit Okay, I could run circles around every motherfucker on that team. I could promise you that Not a single one of person on his fucking team has done anything close to what I've done. No, okay Not even fucking close. They just read about it. They read about it They got taught about it and the what they got taught about was brands like Coca-Cola and Pepsi Okay, and Kentucky fried chicken McDonald's okay That's that's old. That's not the way shit is branded now It's different and so he's got a bunch of academics around him who don't know fucking shit about branding or marketing or actually connecting with people in any way Shaper form and bro if you pay me a hundred million bucks. So you're I fix your whole shit just real talk That's the number call me up. Yeah, I do it It is why it's gonna take you know you could also just join our takes no No, it's it's worth that yeah Yeah, it's worth because this could cost you more like ten times that would make him billions of dollars It's real shit guys tell us what you think man join in the conversation Hashtag x the bird let us know in the comments what you guys think about this new Twitter New x you let us know with that being said let's move on to our headline number two headline number two reads Critics unleash on Kamala Harris's evil astonishing lie about florida school curriculum on slavery This is absolutely amazing Absolutely, I don't know if you've seen this I heard about this. I haven't seen anything. Oh, do this perfect I'll end up feeling it all weekend and kind of like just Stay off my phone. Well, this is fucking great. Yeah, this is great. Let's dive into it So vice president Kamala Harris faced a wave of criticism Friday following her speech in Jacksonville, Florida Blasting what she said was the state's new history curriculum Teaching students that slaves in the United States actually quote benefited from slavery Quote just yesterday in the state of Florida. They decided middle school students will be taught that enslaved people Benefit it from slavery. They insult us in an attempt to gaslight us and we will not stand for it Harris said referencing the new curriculum approved by the Florida Department of Education on Wednesday That includes the history of slavery in the United States Uh the new curriculum actually states quote Instruction includes how slaves develop skills which in some instances Could be applied for their personal benefit leading to countless critics accusing Harris of brazingly lying and misleading the American people Oh, I'm a little confused here. Mm-hmm. Is she saying that or was that what it said before? So So the new curriculum actually states so so that's actually from the curriculum the old curriculum? No the new one Okay, this is from so instruction includes how slaves develop skills and some instances Could be applied for the personal benefit. Okay, for example, and there's facts and fucking evidence the shows is right there were slaves who you know I'm just saying like in my mind. I'm not understanding what's going on Yeah, but like if a slave was like let's say A tax specialist right like he took care of the horses and the saddles and right and put the shoes on the horse And then he was free That would be his skill set while he would learn how he would earn a living and then what would you do with that skill set He would go start a business or work Well, how do you think that the slaves survived after the day they were free? They used the skills that they learned while they were in slavery to actually produce income for their families As a free person shoemakers cooks anything. I mean you name it those partners, you know farmers that's history Yeah, that's that's actually what happened Well, according to Kamala Harris Uh, it's just an attempt to in to to gaslight us how Because slaves didn't benefit from slavery that's so what she's saying is is that That immediately once slaves were freed they didn't know how to do shit. We've been fucked for 300 years So what she's actually saying is that all these slaves that did this work they farmed And according to their point of view they built America So not perfect hold on So according to their point of view they built America, but then once they're free they couldn't build anything right Because they didn't learn any skills. Yeah, like none of the HBCUs or any of the hospitals that we build or I'm just I would like to hear that argument What is that how How is she what is that argument Oh, they're racist you can't ask that question Like what does that make sense? Blatantly untrue. Yeah, that makes sense man. That makes sense and so so this is great. So National review National review writer Charles Cook He actually wrote an entire article on this Um on the national review. It's uh that you guys gonna check the article out for yourself It's had mine Kamala Harris is brazenly lying about Florida slavery curriculum I'm in which the article Here it says here's the list It's 191 item strong It contains the word quote slave 96 times Quote slaves plural 23 times and slavery 45 times I've pulled each line out in the order in which they appear which is largely chronological It starts with quote the earliest slaves and ends with quote the integration of the University of Florida So he lists this out of the actual from the Department of Education of Florida The actual list to pull it out the words I just want to go through some of the things Um that are introducing this new curriculum, okay? Couple of things like this instruction includes what life was like for the earliest slaves and the emancipated in North America Or examine the underground railroad and how farmer slaves partnered with other free people and groups and assisting those Escaping from slavery what color were those people black and white I'm just saying yeah, it's important um Or things like this you know we just covered the uh the benefit the personal benefit aspect of it but Um there's even things in here like this instruction includes the practice of the barbery pirates and kidnapping Europeans and selling them into slavery in Muslim countries Or instruction includes how slavery was utilized in Asian culture right that they're looking It's just generic stuff stuff that I thought was pretty fucking cool that you know well that's not being taught. It's here. Yeah Okay, keep going All right um instruction includes the founding of historically black colleges and university I look through this list of 191 things that he pulled out I didn't see not one That look crazy and guess what? I'm not the only one who disagrees Um seeing an in-panelist calls out VP Harris over quote completely made up Florida slavery curriculum claim here's the video It's amazing to me that how little common Harris apparently has to do this she can read something on twitter one day and be on an airplane the next to make Something literally out of nothing. This is a completely made up deal I look at the standards. I even looked at an analysis of the standards And every instance where the word slavery or slave was used I even read the statement of the African-American scholars that wrote the standards not run to st. But the scholars Everybody involved in this says this is completely a fabricated issue and yet look how quickly Harris jumped on it. So the fact that this is her best moment a fabricated matter is pretty ridiculous And more than that So he mentions the the scholars the African-American scholars who worked on the panel to comprise this new curriculum Um and on that panel you'll find this gentleman dr. William B Allen Uh who is the Emirates Dean of James Madison College and Emirates uh professor of political science and Michigan state He is the former member and chairman of the u.s. Commission on civil rights has been a long uh been a Kellogg national fellow Full bright fellow and a member of the national council on the humanities That's somebody I think would be you know offer miseducated on history right um or this lady Now this is dr. Francis Presley Rice Um, she's a retired United States Army Lieutenant Colonel um and she writes about it But I think the problem is the reason they don't really want people to dive into this is because My doctor Presley Rice she wrote this article a few years ago titled unveiled democrats racist past Maybe they just don't want the cat out the bag and yesterday. Yeah, right You know, I don't I don't know. Maybe they just don't want to get out Andy. What do you got on this? What do you got on it? Well, listen I'm happy that com will actually brought brought Like to this you know because people are actually able to see Exactly what they want and don't want to be pushed right like when you got people that are going through True history right not not not the winners history but real fucking history right And when you go through it and you see the things that you know should actually be taught They don't want that to be taught But but When you say they don't want that to be taught Are you talking about the idea that slavery has existed in all cultures across the human History correct across right every Generations who have actually more people enslaved right now than there ever has been in the history of earth Exactly And not only that but so you see what they don't want to be taught But what do they want our children to be taught well? They want to be taught that the only slaves that ever existed were black slaves America Or what about teaching our little black boys to cut the penises off? Well, they're cool with that being taught teaching our little black boys That they can never succeed and they can never become successful in America because the little kid that's across from them who happens to be white Is inherently racist and has power over them just for existing So you tell me who I mean who who who who's it's it's incredible to me How they start how they attempt to start the victim culture in black America from like literal birth Right like you could never be and these are people now Kamala Harris is the vice president of the United States her role And Joe Biden's role is supposed to be to unite Americans not black Americans not white Americans not Asian Americans not Latino Americans not Native Americans but Americans to work together to progress the country in a positive direction for the benefit of all of us Americans That's their job. That's what we elect them to do and what they do is they actually come in and they divide every single person at every single point of contention for their own benefit and it's absurd to me that We have people in power That propagate these sorts of things And people champion it and cheer for it and think it's okay Like if you cheer for this don't you understand what you're cheering for? Don't you understand that you're cheering for the idea that you know if you're a black person and you're saying Oh, yes, this is true. This is she's right or if you're like you are basically cheering and and celebrating the idea That she believes your less capable as a human being Which is simply untrue always untrue Andy is damaging right because DJ it's it's it's fucking criminal dude even looking at the basis like the base fundamental value right like the the whole idea of slaves benefiting right like Look at the story. Let me ask you this real talk. Yeah You got two little girls at your house. I'm white Okay, well, could afford me. Yeah, right At least on the outside. All right I come over to your house. Yeah, and I'm talking to Ryan. I'm like, hey Ryan, you know, she knows me as her uncle Andy, right? She does yeah, and I'm like Ryan, you know And you're in the other room. Okay, yeah, but in the s'mores ready.

It's too bad that you're born black You know because you're never gonna be able to succeed You're never gonna be able to be anything because people like me are gonna hold you down. Bro be black on black crime that day You know, I'm saying. Oh, I'm just real talk What would happen if you came in and had Did I get it? I put a bullet in my fucking head bro, but see that's what these people do at scale and they have no problem Saying it no, and then you have people who are black people that's fucking agree with it And then you know who agrees with the most the white upper class middle White middle upper class women the brunchers yet the brunchers bro. That's what we're calling for now on brunchers The brunchers fucking say oh yeah, yeah Can't get an idea. Yeah, so I mean, but like think of it in that context bro. It's discussed No, I'm just saying think how evil it like if you witnessed this in an individual context Every single human being Black white doesn't matter would say this is fucking wrong But because it's systemic And what's funny is we have riots to burn down the country of that systemic racism Do you know what the systemic racism is? That it is that it's telling little kids That they cannot be things because they were born a certain color and what's supposed to be a free country We're all men are created equal And we all have the right to pursue life liberty and happiness See what I'm saying. So so because it's in a system like How do people not connect these dots how evil it is and like and do the this it's a very very simple fix right because instead You know the conversation could go like hey, yeah, you know what slavery is a part of this this country's history Right, I mean, I don't know if I have any you know ancestors are like to call right but like at the end of the day, you know to be able to tell a story That while yes, there was slavery In voluntary as harsh as rule that was there were still people who were slaves That we're still able with despite all of the hardships built stuff invented things Created hospice like why is that United States wouldn't even be the United States without the contribution of those Americans That happen to be black that you're talking about right now. So I'm saying so it's like you know like it's it's it's a very simple Like flip in the in the sentence or in the conversation that could be having that can completely change The entire trajectory of that child's life Right, but because they want to play this word game and because they want to dial everything is negative now You're gonna have these kids will so so we just had slavery and then that was just it There was no benefits like nobody like there was just nothing like that's the end of the fucking story That's what we're gonna choose to tell our children Furthermore How could we don't talk about what was done to change the fact that they were slave right well that that's inside the new curriculum It is they talk about Not only just like I think they actually mentioned it as black patriots Um They do talk about it because I did I did see that they did they talk they call them black Patriots look man here here's the new curriculum here's the reality and and people get upset when I say this but I don't care um Race baiting and the discussion of race is only done by people who are racist and when we Truly break down what this racial division is It's a low IQ highly emotional highly divisive argument that these people in power that's in their playbook that says hey We can't have these people get along so we're gonna push this race issue So that they fight and they can't notice how much we're doing to actually Damage their life experience while we enhance ours. That's it. It's a low IQ emotional argument for people who can't think Who are unable to understand reality and um These people are experts at putting it in front of us until we get smarter black white people Especially until we get smarter to the point where we say hey dude Judgedured people on the color of their skin regardless of who they are or what race they happen to belong to is wrong And in America we judge people by the content of the character and how good of a person they are and how they treat others and That's how we do it here in America until everybody gets to that page This shit is gonna keep going on. I'll be real with you like dude the race arguments to me Like it's it's fucking laughable like it's laughable shit like because People who Continuously buy into this over and over and over again if we're being fucking real The the reason people buy into it over and over and over again is because it gives them an excuse as to why they don't have to try Very hard because if they don't try very hard it doesn't really matter because if I tried it wouldn't work anyway And that's what these people prey on and it's it's it's bad. Let's say go dude Listen man We have to get smarter than these people. Okay, this this lady's barely fucking black All right, let's be real let's be real. I don't know one fucking black person that would claim her as their own Okay, she she's a fucking tyrant. She's stupid as fuck. Okay, she You know, I think You know, we're gonna you're gonna go to space one day like space think about it Like I just so it's so annoying dude and like Bro, I'll be real. I don't think most black people are with these people at all. I think it's over I think the race argument is pretty much over. I think people still get upset about it And if we're being honest about race Does racism exist? Absolutely exists. Does it exist like they say it exists? No, it exists some little one-off Things that happen to us and by the way when I say us it happens to white people too. There's a lot of situations where Not a lot, but there are certain situations where over the course of our lives We're probably going to be excluded at something because of our race. All right, we're probably going to get talked shit on because of our race Black people you guys are the kings of talking shit on white people. Let's be fucking honest And you know what I don't really give a fuck it doesn't bother me. All right There's far more of black people accepted to talk shit on white people But there is white people talking shit on black people I can tell you that because we've never been able to say anything Even if it was actually thought that you can't even say it because you'll get fucking like if I say Hey White people aren't the problem in black communities black people are actually the problem in black communities You get fucking yelled at Like you see what I'm saying. There's a double standard of of what's considered racism And until we get to the point where all of its bullshit and we all say no dude That's that's a fucking human being who if I go over there and slice their arm open they're gonna bleed red They got the same internal stuff that I got they happen to have a little bit more melon in their skin Because of where they come from in their culture on the planet where there's more or less sun Like this is basic shit And like the fact that we still argue over race in 2023 in any way shape or form It's kind of embarrassing to us as human beings. That's what we are You know But again like is it really where we are or is it just where they tell us that we are that's what I think it is I for the most part I think there's some people who buy it who are victims who are going to always be victims who are of the victim mindset And because the victim mindset is popular right now, you know It gives people permission to not really be productive or hold a high standard in life because You know, they can just say throw their arms up and be like well fuck. I'm you know, I'm this or I'm that or I'm that whatever it happens to be right victim culture is very Hot right now. There it is I think it's I think it's fading though. I think people are coming back around Uh, but dude all in all man. I think it's a ridiculous argument. I think Americans the thing about America that's made America America is the fact that All cultures from all different places in the globe have been able to come here and abide by a set of core values American core values and create some amazing things and at one point become the most powerful country in the world for a very long time In fact, I believe we're still there I just believe we're being told that we're not if we truly believe what you and I have said this whole time is that China has compromised Our highest political offices our politicians and our media and our Hollywood Which is very easy to see by the way that they contribute money to all of these cases Then why would China let us think that we're the most powerful country in the world wouldn't it be in their benefit to beat us down and make us think that we were losers and that were you know, everybody's Uh, you know, hates each other and you know Everywhere we go. There's people trying to convince kids that they're cutting off their dicks like all of this stuff that we are Propagated is clearly designed a weakened morale in the country and demoralize us and if we believe what China is doing Or if we believe what you and I say on the show regularly that China is actually influencing all this wouldn't that make sense Why would they why you're saying you're saying that Because they're doing it that that is the proof that we're not that When I'm saying is if you think about How things actually are it makes perfect sense as to why we are propagated to believe that we hate each other Why we are propagated to believe that everybody's you know uh With the Adult men shaking their balls and kids faces right the opposite is true Correct got it right like dude. This is the one is to think we're weak because we're actually very strong correct They want us to think we hate each other because we actually love each other. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Psychological warfare that's what we're dealing with that's real We're dealing with psychological warfare from another country And I believe that the whole thing with COVID was all part of this. Yeah, like COVID definitely came from over there and it was definitely known about by our country And the people who knew about it in our country were getting paid by those guys And what were they getting paid to do were they getting paid to make the country stronger or were they getting paid to make the country weaker close down Right, and that means these people are fucking actual traders to you and me Okay, and now we take a look at all of the things that they're allowing to happen the crime in all the cities um The border crisis the inflation the sending of all our military assets to foreign countries so that we have a problem with our own assets here The depleting of the oil reserves name me a single move that these people have made that has strengthened our country our country Now name me one And you can't name one and now we have the evidence that they're taking money from China Now and this all started with COVID Okay, so Like bit to me what this is is this is a giant Operation attack that is from China to America to weaken our country to make them the economic power and probably eventually take us completely over um, and there's been a number of Americans in the media in the politician in the politics and in Hollywood Who have either leveraged people or sold us out to their own personal gain to this foreign adversary, which is treason So that's what we're dealing with in my opinion. Yeah And it all flows into this this shit. So like I don't know. I think that's a beautiful point. I mean Look We keep falling for it though You know our our people keep falling for it like we keep falling for the fact that like you know Because someone is a little more tanned than us. There are enemy or a little less tanned than us. There are enemy like dude Really like really think about that Like just like I said think about like if I was having that conversation with your actual kids, right? Think about how basic that is Like you you think that someone is your enemy because They come from a different place in the world and They have less melanin in their skin or more melanin in their skin Like are we really that fucking stupid as a as a culture It's not true And the reason that this has been propagated. It's not just propagated here currently now This has been propagated over the course of history, right tribalism um Wars over you know Like from different country to country like dude all European men are basically the same like Poland Italy uh, you know England France Switzerland Belgium Germany like they're all the same kind of people but People in power have for thousands of years convinced The people in these countries which by the way that border is a made-up line that is made up by someone who said This is mine and I own this and all of you peasants are part of my shit And you've convinced people to fight battles and kill each other and murder each other and rape the women and genocide people based upon a made-up fucking border When those are your brothers and sisters right over there 10 feet away like dude Humans have to get smarter dude You see what I'm saying? Yeah, man Like We we have been manipulated over Thousands of years by people who have power to believe that we are so different that we must kill each other And that's total bullshit. That's total bullshit total bullshit And until you know if humanity would all come to this realization that We're all pretty much the same dude. We can have world peace if you took all of these leaders and all of them The leaders of these countries with the exception of a couple guys, okay? And you put them in a fucking Space capsule and you shouting to fucking space Okay, the world would improve drastically like Like in like a week Because people with people from the from the real world would say hey, you know none of this stuff they were doing made sense We should be doing it this way this way this way this way and everybody would Everybody would would rise up in a positive way Right people don't want to fight. They don't want to argue. They don't want to hate each other Nobody wants to hate each other and if they do want to hate each other The only reason they want to hate is because you've been told to hate or you've been taught to hate And that's not just white people towards black people or black people towards white people. That's cross-human rehistory culture So like dude when we think about this We have to really like break it down like these people who have Empower of any kind or sort have no moral authority over us We are we are like divine godly beings. We are not like Germans and Italians and Frenchmen like dude, we're we're fucking people And until people understand that we're all people. We're all trying to be happy. We're all working hard We're all trying to like shit can't change We're gonna continue to go down this this process of Global tyrants and every different country serving themselves and using the peasant class That's us to produce for them to go down. Yeah like bro when we were in Boston We're walking here Remember we drove by the federal reserve And we were talking to the driver and we were to lat making a joke about like there's a most pal What some of those powerful people in the country or in the world in that building And you know those people sit in that building and they look down to street and they see all these people And they don't see people bro. You know what they see they see their slaves that have been designed to produce for them And you might say well that's ridiculously andy that's well, okay Let's do the math on your income. How much of your income do you pay to the government? You pay more of your income to the government than you get to keep in your own house if you do the full math That is a fact What does that make you Slay it doesn't make you free So to run around here and say that this isn't the case you're you're just not awake to what's actually going on They refuse and to believe it Until we get smarter when we collectivize our power together as human beings This shit will continue to go on and it will get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse My opinion most of these global leaders should be fucking put in the fucking woodshipper The whole world would include the whole world would improve literally like instantly You know shit man guys, tell us what you think chime in on conversation. You guys know how it goes So what happened? It's what happened to the whole world said now Mm-hmm like no more tyrants we declare our independence just like they declared their independence to 1776 We declare our independence. We're not paying taxes. We're not doing your shit. Fuck you What would happen? What would they do they couldn't do anything It'd be over for them all we have to do is not comply with any of their stuff and say no We're doing our thing fuck you and if they try to hurt us we fucking put them in the ground They're pretty simple fix real simple Well guys, let's get to our thing for domestic terrorism. Yeah, I mean that's I think that considers cool I think that's considered global terrorism guys is on the list. Yeah, I think we escalated. We make it yeah Moving on up Bro, they're the terrorists. Oh We're the terrorists because we don't want to pay you all our money We're the terrorists because we're tired of you stirring the fucking piece that we would like to have in our lives We're the terrorists because you shut down the country for two years and cost us all two years and ruin a bunch of kids Like we're the terrorists because you don't allow real education to happen and instead on tiktok We got these people doing NPC stuff looking like fucking the end of humanity like bro We're it's us. I like barb mother fucker. Come on bro Come on It's them. Let's go Let's get it these people. It's not just the United States. It's fucking all of them All of them when they fly to get together and they all honor each other and shit. That's all bullshit. There's balls and shit Huh, yeah, I know they do weird shit there. Oh fuck girl. They do kids shit That's what that that's a whole thing bro. These people are all in a club. It's George Carlin said at the best These people were in a club that and you ain't in it And that's it and and their club they ruled roost and until we go in and take the roost over and say fuck you They're gonna continue to do what they do to us which is make our lives hard make our lives miserable make our lives stressful make our lives You know Shit, that's what they're gonna do. No And then they're gonna they're gonna smile in your face and be like is it freedom great Be saved our democracy. Yeah Guys, let's get into our third and final headline headline number three headline number three reads report Don't abide and put Joe Biden on business calls dozens of times shocking I can't believe it Ha ha ha Don't you look at some of the headlines that come out after we've covered this for like years now and like just like roll your fucking eyes Right look at it because they always put it up in the same notion like all sides are like freaking news Can you believe this? I would appreciate if you guys would start telling all these people You know the Andy and DJ said that fucking three years ago, bro That would be cool like you guys like our little army here like when these headlines come out That we've all been saying the whole entire time let mother fuckers know Yeah, cuz you know it's not even fun like Yeah, no shit You know, let's get into this though. So so this is bright bar Uh bright bar news article reading hunter Biden reportedly put then vice president Joe Biden on calls with family business associates upwards of two dozen times Devon archer hunter Biden's former business partner who reportedly was expected to testify before the House oversite committee to Today when the show was being recorded Uh will tell the committee that he witnessed hunter Biden using the influence of his father during business meetings by calling the former vice president Committee amounts announced Monday A person familiar with archers expected testimony told bright bar news the outstanding date is under negotiation with his lawyer Fox News reporter the devon archer pulled out of today's Scheduled testimony the third time he cancelled his commitment uh this X came out from X Uh chat uh program X this out he says house oversight committee chairman James Koma confirms the fox that barisma board member devon archer has cancelled a deposition three times Archers under subpoena from the committee Foxes told archer has canceled because of personal reasons and schedule conflicts Uh the committee hoped to bring uh in archer today, but that is not happening Fox Is told the committee is now aiming for thursday, but it's far from clear if archer will show oh shit What the fuck a hell we popped up again what the fuck's happening um Get that out of here, but archer a Biden family business associate and hunters quote best friend and business was in legal trouble in 2022 for defrauding a native American tribal entity And was ordered to pay around $43 million Uh to the victims price was the rest in 2014 archers served with hunter Biden on the board of barisma holdings a Ukraine based energy company archer was also photograph playing golf with then vice president Joe Biden in south hampton uh here's the notorious picture there What's up? Oh, you want to see the picture again? Yeah the guy the guy Yeah, I don't know what the guy is right with his armoring. I don't know what they should. I don't know That's a fucking hair piece bro. That's that's worse than the hair piece right like bro. That's the ultimate beauty you have all this money And that's the best you got bro. I don't know what that is bro some of you guys just need to accept it man Like if your hair starts quitting on you fucking fire that shit. That's what I'm saying. That's a look That's a good look remember when your hair was quitting on you what I tell you I say you fired that shit Really? I said you have a good look now look at you. Yeah, well famous saucer dig boss I'm saying but look let me say this The only fight I've ever lost in my life was with my hair line. You didn't you didn't lose it I let it go because you fucking fired it. I said heck it. Fuck out you sensed that it was quitting on you didn't love you no more You said let it go. Fuck out of my house. I accepted the truth. That's right You and you did so you did so with dignity. Yeah, fuck you. I didn't fucking you didn't lose you one look at that I look at that fucking face bro. You got a face for radio Yeah Oh man, thanks thanks Well bro if I sit there told you you're a beautiful black man that would be a little weird We keep that for private. Yeah, I must say you tell me that all the time. Yeah, well you just said it on the internet. Thanks Thanks Yeah, so the committee expects Archer to tell the committee about one instance in particular that involves Vatem Porscheishky a barisma holdings executive and Michalozo Chefsky of the company's founder according to the New York Post both Ukrainians met with Hunter Biden and Archer at the four seasons resort to buy at Ju Mariah Beach in 2015. This is the conversation allegedly Quote while they were sitting outside at the bar Vatem Porscheishky a senior barisma executive Foned to ask where they were because barisma's owner Michalozoz Chefsky needed to speak to Hunter urgently Soon afterward the two Ukrainians joined Hunter and Archer at the four seasons bar and Porscheishky asked Hunter Can you ring your dad? At the time it was early afternoon Friday in Washington, DC Hunter then called his father put him on speaker placed the phone on the table and introduced the Ukrainians to Joe Biden by name as Nikolai and Vatem Uh in the presence of Archer Hunter Biden apparently used the phone trick as many as two dozen times the post reported Willisoblow or Tony Babelinsky Most known for his joint venture with Quote 10 held by H for the bit guy Confirmed a similar tactic during his experience with the Biden's at the Shattoo Marmott and Los Angeles Quote I'm also aware of other Biden family business associates confirming that Joe would take phone calls from Hunter In the middle of business meetings and with way in via speaker phone Babelinsky said quote Sitting with Hunter at Shattoo Marmott before I first met Joe Biden on May 2nd 2017 Hunter was adamant that his father takes his calls at any time no matter what his lawyers say or with gatekeepers like Kate Beddingfield Farmer Biden spokesperson playing interference The American people don't fully appreciate yet the key role Joe Biden played in the Biden family global influence pedaling I would equate it to a chairman's role in a traditional business structure. He added No shit. Yeah, no shit So let's backtrack a little bit so in 2015 archer discussed expectations of high ranking U.S officials in Ukraine One month before then vice president Biden visited Ukrainian president petro Poroshenko To demand the firing of a prosecutor investigating the company That was a famous video when I ran everybody saw that where you talked about I told him you need to fire him But they're not getting no money. He fired him Ukraine got the billion dollars Um Everybody's talking about a little piss, but here's one interesting thing that I wanted to bring up right so mainstream media You guys we all know how they operate they don't talk about certain things are damning Um, but I want to show you what mainstream media is focused about their focus is about uh this headline for example DC federal courthouse photos spark Donald Trump indictment speculation Uh saying the media teams have been setting up campsites outside of courthouse and washington DC amid speculation that a new indictment against Donald Trump right so you got all this overwhelming proof that's coming out about this Biden family But of course they still got a target Trump Now before we get onto this Andy, I got to show you one more thing that I thought was just really really bizarre So the only things you're seeing on on you know on the internet right now are those two topics I just mentioned are the three recovered so far But here's another uh headline that a lot of these left-leaning news sites are picking up again that I thought was pretty interesting headlines like this Note cards and shorter stairs how Biden's campaign is addressing his age AIDS appeared to be making concessions to Biden's age hoping to avoid viral moments Or or headlines like this from ap news Biden downplayed's age talk but subtle accommodations will be made They're bringing his age back up and it's fragility It makes me think there's something's big about to fucking happen But Andy can you give us any sensor uh calm well The eight to me The age argument is not a real argument like yes, he's seen now. Yes, he's Like losing his mind No shit. Yeah, I mean, it's on my like he they even changed the stairs that he uses to get on the Air Force one and shit. I get it. I understand that but You guys knew that he was old and seen now 2019 2018 you knew that then So everybody knows that that's the truth And it seems like the age discussion has thrown out more and more As a cover What's actually happening which these men have like the article state have been doing pay per play Uh for literal i mean who knows how And in my opinion the reason that this isn't getting talked about Is because All the politicians do this in some way shape or form and so they're not going to blow the whistle on their own way to make a living and make an income and For this is how does Bernie Sanders go around talking about socialism and then have you know all these Million dollar properties multi-million dollar properties. You know what I'm saying? Right like these people are all full of shit all of them and The reason that they're not blasting this dude for what's really going on is because they're all guilty of it And all of it is treasonous to this country all of it So that's my take on the age argument and then furthermore I believe that he was put in power So we would say man He's just old and seen now stupid which makes him the perfect guy to advance an agenda that is Very damaging to the United States, right? We can look at like oh he depleted the oil reserves. Oh, that's just Joey's stupid Oh, he they're leaving the border open. Oh, they just don't get it. They're so stupid. He's old Oh, he you know made these gaffes, you know, and he said these things. Oh, you know, that's just old Joe He's actually a really nice guy. Oh They said all of our military weapons to Ukraine. Oh, you know, these guys are just so stupid and And in reality there's nothing stupid about it. It's all an intentional play that he's being paid to run And he has the perfect guy to run it so that because we all say man They think we're stupid. They don't think you're stupid They know you're stupid That's what people are failing to understand They don't think you're stupid. They know you're stupid They understand that you will look at this at surface level and you will not truly understand what's actually happening here Which is the destruction of the United States Furthermore When I used to say that these people for example, let's use the cocaine thing right in the White House Now They have surveillance of every single inch of that building There's no reasonable person on this planet that thinks they can't figure out who actually did it And we all kind of think we know who did it right and then not saying who they know did it. Tell us who did it So do you like I saw somebody talking about this and the And this is a pretty well-known quote-unquote conservative influencer That's a whole another subject And they're like at the end of it. They're like they think we're stupid Well, you are stupid and here's why Could it possibly be that they don't actually care if you see it or not and they're actually just doing these things to show you We're in control and you're not and they're in nothing you can fucking do about it Wouldn't that make sense? It's a big power point at what point Do dictators that emerge Cross from being someone who's pretending like they're acting in the interests of the people into actual dictators that dictate Well, they don't just come out one day and say I'm the dictator What they do is a number of small moves over the course of time that you do nothing about And over the course of time these moves get progressively more absurd and progressively more damaging And as we do nothing about it they gain more and more and more perceived power to do whatever they want And we thought about that Does that make sense the most perfect soon The more they're the more crazy shit that they do the more power they gain to do whatever it is they want They're operating without any court any sort of recourse whatsoever And so what we call that is unmasking of the communism that is us going from What we perceive to be a free country which is a lie first of all To a new way where there's certain people in power that just call the shots and you can't say shit about it And if you do we indict you Put you in jail. I don't think the cocaine wasn't accident I think it was intentionally put there from the calls to the EMS and first responders and the hazmat team Let's make this reaction. Let's put it out to the public because here's the thing if they wanted to keep that quiet They could have kept it fucking quiet. Yeah, but that's how they take the mask off bro Yeah, that's how they do this. Let's create the fucking response. Yeah, let the people see it And they won't do fucking anything because they know what you're gonna say They're you're gonna say oh, they're so stupid or they're gonna say oh, they think we're stupid No, they know you're stupid Because you keep saying they think we're stupid That proves that you are fucking stupid I like Does that not make sense to you? That not makes perfect. What what point are you conservative pro-freedom people out there Are gonna stop saying hey, they think we're fucking stupid and start saying what it is They're doing whatever they want and rubbing it in our face and they think we won't do fucking anything about it That's the truth Oh We think they must think we're stupid Like what are you are you working for them? Are you part of them? Why are you pushing that message out to your millions of followers? Why are you conservative influencers pushing out that message or they think we're stupid to your millions of followers? No You're doing their work by propagating that message. They don't fucking think we're stupid They know you're stupid. They know that you're not gonna do anything and they're rubbing it in your fucking face And you're eating it up with fucking fork and knife like Thanksgiving dinner bro About my t-shirt. Yeah, like It's dibro is gross to me It is man. Oh They they must think we're stupid. No, they think you're gonna sit on your fucking Instagram and not do a mother fucking thing That's what they think and make some more excess and the more you allow them to continue to get away with it Over and over and over and over and over and over and over again the more power they gain Okay, if they get if they can ship all of our military supplies to Ukraine If they can deplete our oil reserves if they can open our borders and let millions and millions and millions of Military age males from other countries come across the border If they can allow crimes to run run rampant in their city if they can deflate our currency and ruin our economy if they can Uh, you know, I'm a stan if they can do what they did in Afghanistan and make us look ridiculous If they can do all these things like no consequences Yeah, so and they can get us to believe that a man as a man and a woman as a woman What can they not do What like where's the line where's the line if we lived in America 30 40 50 years ago the military would have already arrested all these people in my opinion The military is like abandoning the oath that they took the oath the oath I believe is Defend us against all enemies foreign and domestic well guess what I'm not the fucking domestic enemy And neither are you and neither are the people listening So where's our military stepping up where are actual leaders stepping up where where are people stepping up in these three letter agencies saying no This is fucking bullshit You see what I'm saying Like do we listen we pride ourselves over here as America being home of the what Brave That's not what I'm seeing A whole bunch of people took those oaths that ain't doing shit. It's real shit Guys, what do you think? Let us know the comments hashtag call on Tyrone I like that one I do too. Let us know guys that was our three headlines It's time to wrap this thing or bring this show home with our final segment of the show as always Thumbs up or dumbest fuck.
