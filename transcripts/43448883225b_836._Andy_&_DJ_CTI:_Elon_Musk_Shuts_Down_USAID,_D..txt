Oh So I bought these you know those metal saucers You know like a trash can of lids Sorta okay, but they're like you know the saucers like those are the best sleds dude The saucers you like to sled on saucers Yeah, I don't think you know about it because like at your age they made you like wear a bubble suit to helmet to go down the hill on these things You know actually what we used to do So like I grew up in the city right you know the city has alleys and the big dumpsters We used to break the the big fucking plastic lids off the dumpsters and Use those that's kind of a that that would be a pretty good sled. Oh, it would great because they they're they're great You know they're concave Yeah, I have a little ribbons. So this is the same kind of thing, but it's for white people got it so it's a it's a metal saucer and You never seen Christmas vacation where Clark Griswald puts his secret Snow the likes yeah, and then he goes real fast. Gotcha. Okay. That's what it is, but dude I'm soup like I bought these things like Ten years ago because I was like oh, they probably don't make them anymore I found them and I bought like six Yeah, and I just found them in the barn. Yeah, so I'm like waiting for the right snow and We're gonna get busy. Yeah nice little hill you could do too dude that one in the front where all the deer are you got a nice Heal yeah, but see I don't want to walk I don't want to walk up it. That's the worst part But that's why I don't ever want to go do that shit. Yeah, cuz like you gotta have someone with a you know We got to do luxury. Yeah, we got like we got to get the UTV to drive us back and forth Have a heater on or we could put like a tatch a rope to it and use the the Hummer to fucking winch us back up That would take a long time. That's true. Yeah, just use a side by side. Yeah, that's true. All right, we're smarter not harder Yeah, that's what it is. Yeah, I like it. What's going on in the world today, man? I mean it seems like it seems like there's so much going on It's hard to keep up. Well listen. I mean the last CTI we did it was not as girthy Yeah, this one's gonna be we got the girth back. Okay, because we do have a lot to cover all right There's a lot to cover in this episode. We got choke motherfuckers Yes with the girth. Yep Gobble gobble mm-hmm. Do we see what things given? All right. Yeah, but first before we even get into that 80 you know, we talk about this a lot You know, you talk about you know, just the culture of the country right obviously and with that we talk about clothing And dress, you know, I'm standing there. There's some standards that should be set and I think you know Hopefully the country will get back on track But I think there was kind of like a like a step backwards this past weekend. Did you see Kanye's chick. Yeah, yeah Let's let's talk about it here briefly Kanye, yeah, West His wife shocks onlookers shows up to Grammys red carpet completely nude An update they got kicked out. That's what the headline says. It's actually not true. No, they just walked the carpet and left and just fucking off Don Limon's actually getting the heat right now because he's the one that started that shit. Yeah, surprise surprise But yeah, Kanye West and his wife Bianca's and Sori They were at the Grammys They don't know if they were officially invited a showed up to the red carpet took some pictures and then dipped out I think down Limon probably started that rumor because Kanye fucking like big dogdom because down limon was trying to do interviews and stuff And like kind of just like yeah, no, I'm trying to get focused but now I know yeah and kind of snubbed him and so He got kicked out. Yeah, you know typical down limon behavior. Yeah, for sure, but He's such a nerd dude. He's such a He's a he's such a word. I want to use But you know, we'll start with an F. Yes, and with a G. No T But we're gonna say that for the end of the show Uh, but yeah, uh, you know and listen this is not like the first time she's worn some crazy shit I don't even know if you can call this a whimming crazy shit, but Um, dude the dress man or the whatever you want to call. I don't it's like a fucking cheese cloth. I don't know what it is Um, here's the video. Obviously if you were discretion advised rated are, you know, how your kids all that get stuff Let's check this clip out I love that let's see the Yeah Teachers all right, I'm looking We knew we were gonna get here. Okay, we knew society was gonna get to this point, you know 20 years ago You know, we had wardrobe malfunction and a nipple slip Now we've gotten to the point where free the nipple every fucking girl who can't you know, uh Do anything else has an only fans and their butt naked for three dollars a month showing their butt whole and Now we've got, you know women just being totally nude you know, I mean look, man It's these guys are professional celebrities. We're sitting here talking about it. That's the point It's a point of making people relevant and um, you know, it is what it is I I'm over the I'm over the over sexualization of everything in society like though It's just doing it for society. No, and it's annoying. It's stupid and where are we gonna go from here? You know like I don't think you can go much less. That's what I'm saying like there's something to be said for What's left to the imagination? You know what I mean? uh I also think there's something to be said for people dressing with class and women being classy and like to me this just is the opposite of what I value in terms of society. I mean, that's just full stop. No, no, I you know like and I actually like Kanye a lot I do too. Yeah, and you know, she's obviously a beautiful woman too, you know, but like I think she'd be much more beautiful She was dressed super classy and he was too. Yeah, you know, and I just But Kanye is gonna do Kanye and I think everybody knows that And I think he's a genius to get people to talk about him which he accomplished with this he does it every time Yeah, so maybe like oh my god Yeah, so I mean like look man, and he's worth fucking a couple billion dollars So you can it's hard to argue that he hasn't been effective at it. So it's like You know, it's not my cup of tea, but I'm I mean he's doing him and it's working. Yeah It's fun. You know, he kind of looks like you know what I'm saying dude like I think women should be like I think the classy like like I don't know like Almost like Audrey Hepburn like classic aesthetic is much better than what these girls are doing these days like I just think And it's not about it's not to come back to you. Yeah, but it's not about like this trad wife shit either. It's it's like It's like elegance and classiness and like it's just not I don't know man I'm like if I was fucking 20 years old or 25. I'd be like holy shit. All right, right? Look at her boobs, right? You know now I'm just like yeah, okay. All right cool. Yeah, I mean and dude You know, it's unfortunate because I think she could do that look Very well. Yeah, whatever man. I mean, he's got we're talking about him That's right and I like him. That's right. It is what it is He's always and he's an interesting character. I just I was paying attention to even what he was wearing He kind of looks like blay. He could be like blades cousin but a knife You know what I'm saying. Yeah, like he's always doing some interest. He always looks so man. Yeah, man I don't know what that is either Didn't he have like the titanium grills and shit too? I don't know man. I don't know. I say bring three pea suits back Huh, yeah, you know, yeah, I mean I like that. Yeah For I think I think too though. You know, who's style I like we're gonna turn this into like TMZ or some shit GQ Let's do it now. I like Conor McGregor style bro. It's a pimps style Conor McGregor knows how to dress He's got swag. You may like him. You may hate him, but the guy is cool He's got he's got swag. He's got personality. He looks good. He dresses good It's I don't know it's hard to beat yeah, it's hard to beat. I was gonna say this man I do think it's important because we do adjust the culture side of this two men like Guys got to raise their standards too, bro Yeah, not just what we wear and but what we you know, I'm saying what we Give attention to I think that I mean that's just a lesson there for the young bucks man and But yeah, I just thought that was interesting guys. Let us know in the comments what you guys thought about the The Grammy show like so the same TMZ, but I just thought that was interesting Yeah, and I will say this to like I've seen some clips of the Grammys These people are fucking idiots like Do you see Trevor Noah? No, just them They love that Trump is back in power because now they can be part of you know the resistance Yeah, and it's like dude shut up. Yeah, like we are over make movies make music Which I the fuck up Like I don't care. Yeah, like I don't care what you think about politics I don't care what you think about the world. You're a moron. You're a theater nerd that made it Okay, like I think it's important to remember who these people are and where they come from and to To understand Who they were 20 years ago, right? These are theater nodes Okay, who got famous and now they're pushing their theater nerd world views On to you and you think that these guys are like super cool and having together and really smart no These are people that got picked on these are people who have you know now they've got some cloud some power And that's why they're always on this and by the way they got an answer to certain people They got to say certain things we talked about this over and over and over And if they don't say it what happens to them oh they get you know You know Remove from the circle of influence and you know they get Kanye's just so big he was able to Yeah, kind of saved him on that side Let me do this and they're so they're so far removed From the world. That's the craziest thing right like I mean they don't fucking go to work like a nine to five like 90% of Americans they don't you know like they're so far removed from even knowing the ins and outs and intricacies of a daily Struggle that Americans have there so far removed from that both it's absurd dude. It's crazy, but here's my opinion on it right like come on makes no sense Um, well, I mean people could say that about me Yeah, but I wouldn't say you removed bro. I'm not I wouldn't say you remove. I'm not I remember very clearly where I come from Every day too, bro. It's not like yeah, I'm fighting for everybody out here these people these people that work for us The people listening like bro. I'm one of those guys. I wasn't hand or shit So like I've come from that and I want other people to have the opportunity to come from that So yeah anyway guys, let's know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said Let's get into our cruise you got a lot of stuff to cover, but remember If you want to see any of these articles pitches links videos go to Andy for seller.com You guys can find all of that stuff linked there for you with that being said Let's get into our first headline. We got headline headline number one I'm one reads Elon Musk shuts down us a ID With Trump's approval hours after taking control of it and locks out 600 staffers overnight This is an interesting little development we got going on um, you know, you call this I guess doji work maybe I'll be a Elon Musk president Trump shut down the in battled government agency tax with humanitarian relief overseas after they agreed the organization was quote Beyond repair Now the billionaire first buddy led a civilian review of the federal government with Trump's go ahead And decided this week to shut down the US agency for international development or USAID and its Washington DC offices Staff for shock when they woke up Monday morning to emails instructing them to stay out of the agencies dc headquarters quote It's became it became a parent that is not an apple with the worm in it must said of his six decade US international aid and development agency says quote what we have is just a ball of worms You've got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It's beyond repair. We're shutting it down He said in the audio only appearance on twitter um, so what you know USAID they as of 2016 They reported that it had 10,000 235 employees on its payroll it managed more than six 40 billion dollars and appropriations in fiscal year 2023 Which is less than 1% of the federal budget They approve funding And assistance for about 130 countries With that taxpayer dollars For this year the president's budget request was 28.3 billion in foreign assistance But now that office is completely gone like they woke up Monday morning To this email that was sent out to them that read At the direction of agency leadership the USAID headquarters at the Ronald Reagan building in Washington DC will be close to agency Personnel on Monday, February 3rd 2025 agency personnel normally a sign to work at USAID headquarters will work remotely tomorrow With the exception of personnel with essential onsite and building maintenance functions individually contacted by senior leadership Further guidance will be forthcoming Now people are complaining people are crying Well, well if they shut it down how what's what are they doing working at remote? What does that mean? Well, they're shutting down the building first okay The plan is to X about 10,000 jobs okay. Yeah, all right keep going but yeah people are up and that arms about it You know I'm saying but it's like they don't understand that It's agencies like this with bureaucratic bullshit that's in 50 million dollars for condoms so fucking Gaza Right well here. Look dude. Yeah, the important thing Well, you got more yeah, I mean like but like I mean just examples of where this shit comes from like is the lensky just came out and talked about this I'm a couple of days ago. Mm-hmm. You know, it's a zalissi claimed That Ukraine received less than half of us aid don't know where all that money went Um, and he's saying that out of you know 175 million dollar billion dollars apologies That they only received 76 billion You know, but it's stuff like this like that's money gets funneled in It goes through these bureaucrats through these agencies and then goes where? Then their pocket Okay, this is what we've been talking about for years and years and years and years people are all right first off As I've said over and over and over again Until our country looks like Dubai until our people are wealthy until the crime rate is zero until the the Parks and the buildings Look amazing until the homeless problem is solved We Should not be sending a single dollar anywhere else in the world for any reason And then once that happens once we get to that Then we should sit down and have a talk to Decide whether or not we should do that anyway because the United States and more specifically that's us you and me and all of you listening Is not our obligation to fund all these programs across the globe and they have convinced us that it is our obligation And because we are good people we say okay these people need help and these people need help and these people need help And we forget how many people here need help I invite you to take a drive to your inner city. I invite you to take a drive to rural America And see how our citizens are living Before you think that we should be sending any money anywhere the only people that believe that we should be sending money anywhere Come from two different groups of people that comes from white ultra-label Progressive kids that don't know anything about managing money or it comes from the politicians who are standing out in front of US a ID right now Pist off that it's closing and the reason that those politicians are standing out in front of it is because they are the ones who benefit from this Zelensky is Pist now because he knows he's not going to get any more money and he knows he's probably going to get killed So he's telling on the group that gave him all the money and he's saying we only got 75 billion dollars They sent 177 billion. Where's the extra hundred billion? Well This is how these politicians come into office as a bartender or a base level lawyer Worth zero and leave were tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars and so here's how the operation works They send 50 million dollars to Gaza for condoms, but only 500,000 of it makes it there and then all the people who Made that program work split the money. They don't tell on each other because it's a good deal for everybody Then they take that money and they do what Nancy Pelosi does and they take all the information that they're privy to and they multiply that money out through insider trading No matter what they do Here are the facts. They've been stealing from you and I for decades and they have conditioned us to believe that that's normal and okay Because they play on our hard strings. They convince us that these people Over there over here and way over there Are more important than our neighbors and the people who live in this country which we all agree is not the case So if I were president I would be doing the exact same thing that is happening now. I would be cutting it all None of it would be going there and it wouldn't be a 90-day freeze it would be a forever freeze Okay, because we don't have a responsibility to fund all of these different things all over the world Those people should be doing their own business in their own country building their own economies and if they can't Sorry about it. No, we'll come in and take it or someone else can come in and take it But countries that cannot operate on their own with their own economy don't deserve to be countries Okay That's just simple to me man. It's the bottom line. Well, I mean the other piece of this too like you got some people businesses get to stay open that can't run a business properly What happens to them they either go away and someone else takes them over This is how the world works okay, so We need to lose this idea that other people deserve any of our tax dollars until this country looks like how it should Which is the most amazing country ever? Well, I mean here's the other thing too, you know like I was reading through like seeing go because it's important to see what both sides are saying about it Right like a super important to watch that and like you know, you got people I think she's like a MSNBC lady or whatever But she's like yeah, but like you know, that's only let's slice them like 1% of our government spending Okay, well like look I read this I happen to walk around with a pretty successful guy every day And you know, it's very it's a very simple thing to understand in my opinion, right? I mean, we know this in our own lives and our own bank accounts You don't go broke by spending you know 90% of your paycheck every single paycheck, right? Yeah, go broke by the Starbucks here and there you go like the it's the pennies and shit that add up So yeah, this is 1% of our budget, but like if that's being mismanaged and being fucking just thrown out and sent wherever right like we'll never be An efficient country like we're supposed to be it won't work. Yeah, it won't work You know, and so it's like well, I mean dude that's that's You know Look dude, we live We are the peasants They treat us like peasants. They steal all our money and here's the problem They tax us into a position Where it's hard for the average American to actually survive And that's not just the tax that they put on them That's the tax they put on the place where they work and the people who create the jobs and they create this system where it's very very very difficult to Have abundance in this country regardless of what they tell you okay? They tell you it's possible You have the opportunity But the way the system set up right now you have to beat the odds to do that in other places And I know this is you know hard to believe People lots of people are wealthy and the reason they're wealthy is because they don't have to pay tax and the economy is free to grow and flourish Without the oppressive government putting their throat or their foot on the throat of of the economy for their own gain all right and That's got to change and we're sold a bill of goods. It just isn't true and it seems like You know the government now is making some moves people that have been elected or making moves more aggressively than I anticipated They would it makes me happy and and if you're opposing this It's because you're either getting paid to oppose it or you're really stupid you know 100% yeah I mean I even just the basis of you get this organization USAID 10,000 employees You're telling me that every single one of those employees are essential To shipping condoms to Gaza right every single one of them They're essentials of setting up drag shows and fucking Brazil like yeah, they're like every single one of those Yeah, but see like look they're all on salaries that we're paying look bro If they're trying to tell okay Sending condoms to Gaza does that sound absurd Absolutely, okay having drag shows and gender studies in and Brazil. Let's just say no drag shows in Brazil Okay, does that sound absurd yes, but we will pay for that yes, okay Now think of all the things that they funnel money through That we would say oh that makes sense Okay, so let's think what I'm saying is Think of all the things that they had to convince us That made sense before they got to that so they could funnel money away from us. All right So they've run out of stories to tell yeah that makes sense And now they're getting to these absurd ones So that they could steal more money. So if they're stealing money through condoms to Gaza or drag shows in Brazil They're stealing money everywhere All right, they've run out of stories to sell you of excuses and those 10,000 employees are busy operating all of these things and dude, you know musk and trump are They're right in shutting it down and and this isn't just you know the person says oh well, it's only 1% It shouldn't be a single dollar shouldn't be at all. It's not only it's 1% It's it shouldn't be a dollar what how much is that 1% equal? It's a shit ton of money. Yeah It's still a shit ton of money and what would that 1% do look like back in our pockets? That's right I mean, it's insane, but but you know talking about you know taxes and you know wasteful spending We finally are seeing this is Monday when we're recording the show We're finally seeing some actual action from the Trump administration when it comes to fixing this issue One of those being You finally usher's in his long awaited tariffs Canada, Mexico and China And here's how it could affect the ordinary Americans So Trump Trump put in his tariffs he started it Right started and he's already put out another list of Of more countries to come that will start seeing these tariffs But yeah, he started with Canada, Mexico and China Canada and Mexico will be hit with a 25% tariff on all imports while Chinese products will receive a more modest 10% tariff The US will also impose 10% tariffs on energy products from Canada including natural gas oil and electricity So let's see how these countries respond it Let's start with Mexico They freaked the fuck out and they folded Trump halts tariffs on Mexico as it rushes troops aboard it So that was an agreement between the president of Mexico And essentially what the Deal that was made was that all right. Well, we'll do something can give us a 30-day pause on the tariffs because that will kill us And so the president of mechio agreed to send 10,000 National broad troops to the border to help Slow the illegal migration that's been happening and also Efforts to block the flow of drugs specifically fit and all coming across the southern border So yeah, Mexico folded all right, which I think is really the point to a lot of these tariffs right like those You know, I guess they sound scary, but there's more there's a better reason behind it of why he's actually doing it Canada Canada's trying to you know, they're political wise. They're trying to you know, posture and obviously they're talking shit But why do Canadians think and it's funny because you know the 25% tariffs on Canada This now comes out the survey says Nearly half of Canadian businesses plan to move production to the United States 60% are looking for business acquisitions in response to Trump tariffs Where 48% are actively planning to move So what does that do for the country? Great jobs. Oh shit ton of jobs. Oh shit ton of jobs. Creates it creates cash flow creates Everything that we need you know generates all kinds of revenue Look dude man bad bro. Here's the other thing people People are crying about this, but at the end of the day Trump's doing Canada a favor by putting this in one way or the other Okay, and what he's trying to do is leverage Canada to become Part of the United States so that these companies don't have to move So he's creating pressure from within For the people to say hey, let's join them that makes sense Because now we're going to have to move everything there or we're going to go out of business right all right So he's creating pressure By doing this, but but here's the thing Let's say they don't Okay, and this is what I haven't heard one person say If they weren't to become a state Long term they would have to create their own economy like we were saying a few minutes ago So What he's actually forcing is either you're going to become part of us or Long term you're going to have to produce in Canada and buy from Canada which will strengthen their own economy And then what will happen is the business owners of Canada will start to realize that their own Government is making it so they can't fucking succeed Okay, so it's going to produce Good results and good outcomes for Canada no matter what But nobody's talking about that. Well not only that. I mean like one of the you know things that you know We get a few things from Canada for sure, right? But like you know from the past four years with the last administration we've been importing energy bro We don't need to Right, which is also part of the other plans real baby drill. We're going to be energy dependent like we were in 2016 2017 when gas prices were fucking a dollar. Yeah, you know, I'm saying like it's a win-win situation no matter where you go Now here's another thing too that nobody's talking about specifically with you know northern You know the northern part of this continent is the geographical importance to Right Russia is controlling that entire fucking system up there Russia between Russia and China. Yeah, right the pathway So even just strategically but bro, there's places you go in Canada where the population is mostly Chinese right? Okay, right? We can't afford to have a border That is vulnerable or a country that lives above us that says we're going to side with your biggest rival Exactly, which is what is going on exactly? So there's all kinds of things, but here's the ultimate thing None of this if none of this happens and Canada just reinvest in its own country They're gonna have a stronger economy anyway. They're having independent economy. It's just people don't want to go through the the The in-between time where shit's going to be hard, okay? So 100% man, you know that all these people are look well fucking tariffs are gonna raise prices Don't you know? Yeah, that's why he's talking about eliminating income tax so you can afford More shit. Yeah, make sense Um, you know now the only country so far that is given really any actual pushback is China And even though they got the smallest tariff percent China threatens to retaliate against Trump tariffs So in a statement the foreign ministry said China Quote China firmly deploys and approaches this move and will take necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests the foreign ministry said China's position is firm and consistent Trade and tariff wars have no winners Um You know so they put now that now again like we got to talk about like who's it actually affecting? What do they feel? Um, let's go America first. We got largest steel producer in the United States announces support of Trump tariffs um new core Again the largest steel producer in this country Um, this was a statement that was put out by their president and CEO and chair um Leon uh He says quote New core applaud the first step taken by president trump and it's America first to trade agenda We look forward to working with president trump to enforce our trade laws and strengthen American manufacturing Now I thought this was important to include because bro we were just done in Austin Mm-hmm And we got the opportunity to hang out uh with Jesse James mm-hmm Um, who is by far and my opinion one of the greatest American tradesmen in this country That is ever existing history um, you know, but like you could see the passion that he had For his craft man, it's like like I remember say I think I said it probably like three times down there because what he's working on now He got some cool projects going on but bro. It's needed more now than ever You know just bringing that that that revitalization of that industry back to this country because we're gonna need it We're gonna need it dude. I just it's super super important man Um, and so it's good to see you got some backings from an actual American companies on this that are making these blue hair People shut up. Well, I think you know people that don't understand this it's just vertically integrating the country, okay? In business You know you're you make a good right like Let's just say you make protein powder, okay In business if you just make that Stand alone your company is you know sort of At the mercy of the people who sell you the wrong gradients and also the people who Sell your product for you all right, so you don't have very much leverage. You're not very strong You're not very stable You know other people can fuck you up pretty easy, right? But if you go out vertically integrate where you own the farms where the the cows live and you own the plants where The product is processed and you own you create the ingredients and then you make the product which is the one that you sell and then you own the Distribution points and then you own the retail centers, okay? Now you have something that's very stable That is not really up to What other people decide they want to do with you or not and it gives you massive leverage and it makes you much that much more valuable That's what he's trying to do to the country All right, and people don't understand this if we just If we just get our shit from China and get our stuff from other places We're at the mercy. Do you not remember the supply chain thing that happened during covid where you know Everything went crazy for like two months. Yeah, because everything's coming into the country right and if China decided Hey, we don't want to We don't want to sell you anything dude. It's gonna really screw things up for us So what Trump's doing is something that you know, we should have done a long time ago It should have never went away from that and all of these you know uh These international treaties for trade and all this shit Bro, none of that shit shit had ever been done at the expense of our own manufacturing or on economies and You know, we've been talking about this. I don't know I've been talking about this for four or five years telling you guys that it was gonna come back this way And you better start trying to make your shit here and here we are You know, let me say that over and over and over pro-America brands are gonna become hot You're gonna have to read people are gonna become like dude This is this is what I said was going to happen for the last four years happening now. Yeah, so not only hot Bro's gonna be a necessity. Yeah, it is. I mean, uh You know, it's it's a it's a great thing for this country and it's it's also good for other countries If other countries can't stand alone on their own economy, they shouldn't be other countries. They should be states I'm with it. Yeah, I'm with it now There's always some some shit happening behind the stage We talk about this all the time as well and bro. Why would we allow You know, can't you want to be vulnerable to these other countries? That's right. Why would you allow Canada To be allies with China and allow them to potentially work with them in some sort of military operation You know covert or open you know, it's in any way shape or form. It's funny because you know didn't Didn't this just happen and like what was that 20 2020 right with the invasion of Ukraine? Why do you think that started that started because of that yeah, you're expanding fucking NATO into it You can't do it Bro, we got Chinese weather balloons flying across the country look dude the last administration Solar country out to China and it's being fixed now. That's the bottom line. It's solar country out to everybody To fucking everybody. Yeah, everybody was yeah, and all of those people from the last, you know Like that hundred billion dollars that's missing That should be forensically identified to exactly where it went Who got it and all of those people should be putting jail forever. I'm ready now These are all good things that are happening right but there's always something happening behind the scenes Kind of backstage, but I think it's very important to address Um Call me Paul revier. I don't care. I want to bring this this this in uh RFK, you know, he's still going through his confirmation hearing Um, hopefully he gets confirmed. He's waiting on the vote right now Um, but there was an inter- there's been a few interesting things I've been watching them and just like seeing what was gonna happen with this So I want to show you this first thing here uh bill gates Warren's RFK junior is misleading people as Trump Trump's pick for health secretary awaits confirmation vote, okay So you got uh good old Billy gate, okay He just he just put out a little interest in warning Saying that RFK is misleading people about vaccines, okay Um, all right Okay, well why wouldn't he say that that first of all he's got huge financial interest in that Second of all he's got huge Not go to prison interest in that Or executed interest in that, okay, so let's let's be real. Of course. He's gonna say that. Yeah, right Okay, cool. Yeah Then let's go back because this was the first one I saw this is let's go back to November of 2024 Um, and you got the the spawn of Satan Alex soros He also had a very interesting message for RFK junior um, he tweeted this out Uh, he says they are playing with fire Americans will be screwed if there is another pandemic Okay And then and he tweeted that with an article that was talking about RFK's plans for health agencies Um, and Elon Musk even replied to that when that happened he he said uh, you put an asterisk they're saying Scandemic. Yeah um But here we are all right, it's February 3rd And now allegedly there is a new virus that was just discovered in Alabama And it's raising pandemic fears Kind of like a vent 201 right before COVID man. Yeah Whatever dude Right, I told you these people listen. Here's what's gonna happen if this isn't done swiftly enough Hmm, and it's moving fast moving really fast, but it needs to be done immediately Is these people will release a real pandemic a real one that kills people and make all these people look like they did it That's all that needs to happen bro All that needs to happen is these people release an actual Super deadly pandemic and they will make all these people It will they will blame all these people and fucking you know, that's that's gonna be their move Trump did he told you know you got RFK saying no vaccines right all of these powerful people have been putting all this money behind all these things the gates is The sorrows is the the world economic forum people like there needs to be a global initiative To remove these people from influence The biolabs everything it needs to happen all at once and it should it should have already happened Should have been done on day one your trump and RFK and this administration is giving these people a massive opportunity to unleash an actual pandemic To make everybody who's you know working for all of these things right now look like the guilty party that gets Hundreds of millions of people killed you know, so that's you know And then they accomplished their goal of depopulation and removing the resistance and all this stuff because the average person Will fall for it. Yeah, so we'll see we'll keep you guys updated on that but jumping on this conversation Let us know what you guys think Down in the comments with that being said.

I was that being said. Let's keep the cruise moving We got headline number two. Um now this happened when we were out of town Uh, it was a packed full 48 hours here. I want to dive into this a little bit. Let's cover. I know people One day one here has talk about this. Um, we got to talk about the plane crashes um Uh, this first headline 55 of the 67 victims have been recovered from the DC plane crash Uh, so officials have recovered the bodies of 55 of the 67 victims killed Uh, after an army helicopter and an American Airlines passenger plane collided at low altitude Neuronald Reagan Washington National Airport last week Uh, quote it's my belief that we are going to recover everyone said DC fire chief john donnelly Uh, during a Sunday briefing on the victim recovery efforts and debris removal Um, so divers are still searching the uh, the the Potomac River Mm-hmm Uh, for the remains of the the 12 people um, the waterway is obviously closed to any vessels and other ships Um, but yeah, they they've noted that all 64 people aboard Flight 5342 and all three people in the black hawk helicopter were killed. Um, this happened on Wednesday night Uh, last Wednesday night um, and it's so far the deadliest air crash that have uh, to happen in the country in the last two decades Um, so it's a big deal now they did just recovered the black box from uh, the American Airlines plane um And the jet recorder from the DC helicopter Uh, so and they're saying that this could reveal some some very important things here Um, one of those things being um, is that the data from the passenger jets flight recorder Show its altitude at 325 feet that's plus or minus 25 feet Um, when the crash happened Wednesday night Now data in the control tower show the black hawk helicopter at 200 feet at the time of the crash So there's about a hundred foot discrepancy there that's yet to be explained But if the impact did actually occur at 325 feet uh, that's well above the ceiling height for the black hawk helicopters They can only go up to 200 feet in that area in that area right so There's still some explanations that need to be set out right like there's still no questions that are still trying to be answered right now Um, you know, and obviously a lot of people jumped on on this i know trump made some initial comments the d.o.d Came out with some initial comments when when all of this stuff happened Um, and since then a couple of days ago um, it took them some time but the department of army Identifies two of three army soldiers involved in the helicopter crash All right, um, the first person is a staff sergeant Ryan Austin O'Hara. He's 28 of Georgia um, they're still trying to get a positive identification on him And then the remains of chief warrant officer set uh, two Andrew Lloyd eaves who's 39 of great mills Maryland um They know that he was also on the plane now on on the helicopter on the helicopter. Okay. Yes on the helicopter now There was the the this conversation was going back and forth about you know, well who was the actual pilot in command Um, and it took them a while to even release the name right like obviously They're still trying to recover bodies and things like that, but um The army finally identifies the third soldier involved in the helicopter crash and that it's going to be capped in Rebecca Lowbitch of North Carolina She serves as an aviation officer in the regular army um, she and li uh or commissioned in 2019 She had no deployments. She was assigned to the 12th aviation battalion Um in Virginia. Um, she's received a few army awards um and accommodations uh, but This is where it gets weird This is where it gets weird man, and I'm just being real here So you know a lot of information is is quickly coming out about this stuff um most recently Captain lobitch uh, she was a Biden White House social aid Okay, she was working in the in the White House. I saw that under the Biden administration She served as a social aid during the Biden administration um, she actually i mean just as recent as last month when they were handing out the medical honors um, she she was one of the the uh, military members that escorted the recipients Uh-huh in the state she was there quite often um But okay, whatever. I mean military members. Yeah, she she was assigned one of the freedom metal winners to escort Right, Raul Lauren actually. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, you know, so like okay. Well, I mean whatever like people you know I don't know if those are you know, volunteer positions. I don't know. Doesn't really matter But this is what This is the issue and this is what I really want to focus on is again, there's this lack of transparency That leads people to think and come out with all of these weird theories and and things like that that's dangerous for I think everybody um Because obviously there's a tragic situation right and we don't know why exactly that crash happened. We know it did But here's the thing The pilot Rebecca lobitch her entire social media was scrubbed The night of the crash And not just her social media her entire families all scrubbed All scrubbed Well did they have it before they had it before how do we know that way back machine? Okay But then after it's all scrubbed and then that was the last person to get you know, released and identified in this crash on the military side why Well, I mean, I think it's probably you know I mean look dude before I even say what I'm gonna say I don't I don't like the idea of politicizing Or creating conspiracies around every single thing and I've seen so many conspiracy attempts With this case and I think it's honestly it's pretty gross to me um Some of the things I've been seeing like Saying she flew it into the plane intentionally and just all this shit that nobody knows right I think That The reason First of all, there's other things. Okay. She had 470 hours of flight experience, which isn't a lot. It's not all right I I mean do look I think in the current climate. It's pretty obvious that they don't want the DI Narrative to go further than It has to and I think this is probably an easy target for that Uh the pictures I've seen of her it It seems like she's gay Uh She was definitely very active in and The gay and lesbian community Maybe she's a quote unquote ally. I don't know. I don't know this woman I that doesn't make her unqualified if she was gay right Well, make sure unqualified is the lack of hours and training um That would be Required to be effective at what she does and I would bet if we were to trace this back We would find that there were a lot of applicants to that program that were more qualify that were passed on For her to get that position and that's what they're trying to hide that that's my speculation yeah, all right As to why they would scrub this out At a minimum. Yeah, okay Beyond that I don't know but but it seems like it's an effort to To Squash the DI conversation when in reality, dude It doesn't matter at this point because it's going away no matter what so and it should we should be based on merits We should be based on skill if we want to be great. That's what things have to be Every sports team is based on that Every you know great achievement Over the past hundred years outside the last 20 years has been based on that People either good a shit or they're not and the best should get the opportunity and the ones that can't cut it She'll have to get better or go find something else and DI can put people in danger It has put people in danger And I think this is one of the cases that they're whether it did or it didn't in this case My personal opinion is it seems that it did and a lot of people got killed And they're trying to you know squash that conversation with them happening Yeah, and I say that with a lot of empathy for all the families Even her family. I mean bro, this is horrible sad and and really dude like You know her family now they got to deal with all these people saying what I just said that's not that's not fun You know people saying worship you know, I'm saying yeah, well way worse and But I think what I just said is probably the reason from what I can tell um And it sucks man, you know, but there's lots of other positions in the world where people who Are not qualified have been given positions Because of their race or their gender or other reasons besides their skill that puts people in danger yeah and and You know this seems to be one of them. Yeah And until you're out of the point too though, man like you know the conspiracy theorist had jump in on this stuff because I was another playing crash Literally, I don't even know if it was exactly 24 hours later. Yeah, that happened in Philadelphia um, that was a wild scene Yeah, wild scene. Yeah You know and so far I believe the totals that they have um, yeah patient Who's 11 she's I need think it was a total of like 11 11 11 deaths. I want to say um 18 injuries I mean, it was a massive. I mean the videos and the pictures of the scene The horrific yeah, and there was videos of like there was videos of people on the ground that were on fire trying to like Some of the videos I saw of this that were posted on social like I just I mean look dude It's important that people see those things, but they were just hard to watch. They're very very hard to watch me um, you know, but like I mean even with that like again people can so quickly. That was a pediatric meta meta-back flight Yeah of a of an 11-year-old girl 11-year-old girl, man who had just received that day life-saving treatment Dude, it's just it's horrible to say that stuff. Yeah, and I don't I don't nest these things don't seem to be related. No No, that was my point. Yeah, I mean because so many people do I see it all yeah, we're under attack It's like dude shut the fuck up, man. Please like have some respect for people I mean it yeah, it's just sad dude and you know It reminded me of a situation that people forget about You know just because things happen close to each other Doesn't mean they're related, you know when 9-11 happened there was a very Serious playing crash like 60 days later in New York where two or 300 people were killed They were playing crashed and brought in the Bronx, yeah, right? And you know, I remember that. I was 20 I was like 20 and uh, you know people because of the timing they were like oh, it's another Yeah, and it just wasn't it was just an unrelated thing and You know unfortunately in my experience in life bad things seem to happen and and groups You know, and I don't think this is these things aren't related. It's just two tragedies right in a row. Yeah For sure. I hope there's more information man. I think like you know to my point earlier though I think that's why it's so like there has to be transparency With the prop to do that you're right because bro if they don't have transparency That's what gives the the conspiracies Life you're creating exactly what you don't want. Yeah, you know, I'm saying so like let's just have an honest discussion Keep people informed about what happened. Yeah, and and give us the best answers you can also do they don't know like they don't they don't know Yeah, there's been no there's been no investigation on the black hawk crash that you know So I just think it's dude I don't know man. I mean dude, I think you're right. I think I think the lack of transparency for so long in this country. I mean look dude even You know even I'm built that way, you know when I when I see something happen I'm like okay, what it really happened what actually because I'm so used to being lied to by these people and by the media And this is why we got to have full disclosure of all the things that have happened uh, we need if we're gonna trust the news in the media again There has to be some big changes in regards to the disclosure And the overclassification of information to the American citizens. I don't believe there should be classified information unless it presents a legit Like we shouldn't be saying oh This guy is is responsible for this and we need to kill him and he's here right because now we can't get him right There's things yeah, right. Yeah, we shit but but after we get him we should know what happened You mean But you know there's too much lying. There's too much classifying and bro These are people that we pay to do a job for us and then they at some point in time I figured that we don't deserve to know what's going on And it's created this environment where everything becomes a conspiracy And uh, that's unfortunate because now We don't know what's true or not true and that's the goal. That was the goal That's the goal of communism That's the goal of the control of information and censorship That's the goal of you know, believe it or not trans Generism is tied into this because they want to confuse people to the point where they don't know what the truth is And like I've said a million times on the show if they can convince you To call a man a woman and a woman a man Then they could give it you have anything and George Orwell wrote about this in 1984 We don't know what you know the goal is to not know what the truth is And they don't want us to know what the truth is because if we don't know what the truth is Then it's very hard for us to have loyalties or pride in our own culture Which creates a situation that is primed for a globalist community and like I said last week These guys are really stupid because they could create a globalist union Had they allowed these cultures to just exist without interference You know 100% man. Well, I think here's the other issue too You know even when this stuff does start you know we move towards a better transparent government where they're releasing this stuff You're like it's still gonna be hard because like shit. Do we trust that? I know You know what I said probably you know So it's gonna take some time to work through that man again Players are out to all of the victims of this and yeah, it's super it's super sad. It's sad shit man. It's sad And so we'll stay up to date on this as more information comes out guys jump down in the comments Let us know what you guys think. I think people need to remember dude These are people's brothers and sisters and dads and uncles and sons and these Like when when when like these people look on the internet You know, so when you get all these knuckleheads and dude, I'll be real man, you know There's people I know that jumped all over this and I'm like bro. What the fuck is wrong with them? Yeah, like You know what I mean like we forget that these people see these things I Don't know it's just it's The war I don't know we need we need humanity back bro. There's what we need I just it doesn't get the clicks And it doesn't get the shares and doesn't get the traffic and you know, it's it's it's counterproductive to what people Want you know and sexy they let people let their own desire to be first And for attention getting the way of their own empathy for human beings and and it's sad that we're there Uh, and I don't know how to fix it. No, beautiful said man guys. Let us know down in the comments With that being said, let's get to our final headline headline number three talking about humanity Um, let's talk some shit about these leftists, right I like yeah Well most of most of the leftist communist not democrats. Yeah, not liberals left Leftist are not liberals, right? They're not democrats, right? They're communists I'm happy to talk shit on them all day. They're there's they're subhuman, okay Period, yeah, well, so they uh, you know and by the way they think you're subhuman. Oh for sure All of you listening subhuman so uh remember that when you worry about offending these people remember They don't give a shit about offending you no they wanted to throw you and fucking camps three years ago All they care about is not offending each other. I don't know what I don't I don't know what they think yeah Well, so but I don't like them and they don't like me Well, most of the country does it right and I think that spoke and with this this this most recent election Um, and so you know, they're in the they're in the process right now of trying to reorganize No, I already know where this is going and re re re talking about idolize, okay And no new image and first image no, they're not they haven't figured out why they lost They still haven't figured out why they lost they they're out there crying and complaining about all these stuff's Trump doing while most of the Countries like yeah You know what I mean? We have to fix this now and they and the joy reads of the world and all these people They continue to beat this drum dude and they don't realize the more you we should be thankful They're beating it because the more they be on that drum the more those people wake up and they're like well this ain't it The same it yeah, this ain't it, but they're going through it. So they're trying Let's check out their valiant effort Democrats brutally mocked as beyond parity and Enchambles for obsessing over gender equality and cringe worthy new video So the the the DNC, okay, the democratic national committee They are going through some leadership changes right now trying to figure out who's who and apparently you know who's what and I If you were like put this video in front of him like watch this new like you know What's that what's that the B What we have a long be babble on beat like if you told me this was like a movie they were putting together a set filling That's guys are great. I believe you. Yeah, I would believe you. Let's check this clip out. So this is Let's just check this clip As you know our three at large vice chair positions are used to ensure gender balance among seven offices Treasurer secretary National finance chair and vice chair for civic engagement and voter participation and the three at large vice chairs our rules Specify that when we have a gender non-binary candidate or officer The non-binary individual is counted as neither male nor female and the remaining six offices must be gender balanced With the results of the previous four elections our elected officers are currently two male and two female in order to be gender balance we must We must elect One male one female and one person of any gender so again This is what we have to do for this vice chair race We have to let one male one female and one person of any gender To ensure our process accounts for male female a non-binary candidates We conferred with our RBC co-chair our LGBT caucus co-chair and others to ensure that the process is inclusive and meets the gender balance requirements in our rules To do this our process will be slightly different than the one outlined to you earlier this week But I hope you will see that in practice. It is simple and transparent As we must elect a candidate of any gender as well as one male and one female vice chair We will first ask members to elect a candidate of any gender on the first ballot Any candidate male female and non-binary can be elected on that ballot That's not real brother That's that's a parody That's not real it gets worse He gets worse. No, no check this clip out. It gets so that's not real. No, this is fucking win was that from this is uh This is from this is from today. They're still doing this. They're doing it right now and it gets worse Got to do a little old him in there Why check this check this out and then we'll begin with the opening statements each candidate will have 30 seconds And we'll start with Dr. Quintessa halfway Good evening everyone It is my desire to be the next DNC chair And I just want to give you all a little bit of something that's been on my heart here over the last couple days You fight on you fight on You fight on you fight on When your government is doing you wrong you fight on oh you fight on You fucking kids right there. Thank you. Thank you doctor halfway They don't know a man from a woman, but they know they're right from the left not only that I mean, you know clearly this qualifies people to run, you know the country You know what I'm saying like she had a nice little voice It's all right. Okay. Well, you know they're voices It's sound like some you know old school black Southern church music You know I would ever man like you know it's not like a slave him I wasn't gonna say it. I said I said I said she's in the fields We fight oh Old son is hot I can keep going I can do this all you got the words wrong Hey dude look look look what keep going we got more Oh Jesus Oh, no, they fucked up the right life you see that Are you ready to go in the offense? Are you ready to go in the offense? We have to win back our young people. I am the only candidate in this race for any of these positions that is on Hmm Yes, yeah, they did the David all crats believe that David hog Is going to be the masculine figure they need to regain the young male vote. Yep 24 years old Okay They actually just elected him. I saw he's the DNC vice chair. I saw that and he has his agenda out His wishes is to abolish ice defund the police and designate the NRA as a terrorist group so all the things that most of the country just voted for We're gonna my bet try again We find one dude like this can't be real bro. I wish it wasn't like how stupid are these people So you're going to win back the young voters by doing the opposite of what they just voted for exactly what made you lose Dude look man, I don't really I mean good, you know good because you're going to lose and you're going to keep losing over and over and over again and These people will never win an election again now they will never win again because what Trump's doing Is he is and it's fun dude. It's fun to watch them squirm dude because of the way that they treated red-blooded true patriotic Americans especially masculine men over the last since 2008 when Obama got in They've tried to gay up our men. They've tried to make them into women They've tried to remove all their leadership all their masculinity ever and it's worked to to a certain extent You know the average man has the testosterone of a 60 year old man back in 2020 They put chemicals in our food. They put chemicals in our water And this is why Trump and company are moving so fast. I think I talked about this last week You know, they're trying to move so fast that we get time as citizens to live under the results of the actions they take And by the time this next election comes around we're like bro. This is amazing so You know, I don't I hope these people stay on this narrative. I mean dude David hogs dork He's been a dork forever no one follows him. He looks like a young version of that character from South Park that like Hard to uh the teacher, you know like his like dude It's bad okay if you're gonna be taken seriously dude You better get on some tests to ask your own start working the fuck out because you look like a total pussy That's just reality man. I don't know how to say it any other way. No, I was nice Yeah, there's no other there's no young man that aspired to be like him like if you want to lead people bro People have to aspire to what you're about to be like you right and he There's no young man I don't think any that look at I don't think there's a single young man on the planet that looks at David hog and says I want to be like I want to be like David. I don't maybe Harry's assistant maybe Harry's okay. He's Harry Yeah, but I would argue that Harry's assistant is a better candidate than David hog Because Harry's assistant actually laughs and when you give him shit, he's kind of good natured about it I've seen him I've seen him interact nose out of talks a little shit. Yeah, you know in like bro You know he's he's intolerable, but in somewhat of a like sometimes you're like you're like laugh at it I'm like it's I don't know like he's more appealing than this guy. Yeah for sure. You know what I'm saying like Toss off Rome's good. Okay. Yeah, yeah You you have no right to a gun. You are not militia when you're talking about the second amendment rights You're talking about states right to have what is today the national guard like this guy so fucking stupid the 24 year old Yeah, he doesn't understand he has no perspective, you know like oh you were you yes I feel bad that you were in a Mass shooting at one point in your life that sucks, bro, but the reality is is that that's that's criminals We should stop criminals and mental health people. It's not about the guns. Okay, people you're trying to get the Spoons aren't making people fat. It's the food they eat in the lack of discipline. Yeah Oh, you know what it's a stupid argument dude. You know and you know what? There's a lot of car crashes happening. We should ban cars. Yeah Airplane's crashing but it's banned fucking airplane listen It's the dumbest argument in the history of the of the earth and if if we had This is what he doesn't understand if We didn't have weapons we would already be conquered. We would speak of fucking Chinese over here because of how pussy guys like you are That's the truth truth, so you know, it's whatever man Keep electing people like this keep putting these people on your team and you guys will keep losing to do the great job Look dude, and people are tired of this shit this this uh You know, we're gonna have we got to have One man one woman one non-barry binary We got to make it equal in this look bro equal outcomes are impossible to produce They're impossible to produce because you can't account for things like discipline and ambition and skill and knowledge and you're trying to remove the development of the human being And create equal outcome not understanding that you cannot do that. There's always going to be People who strive for more there's always going to be people with more ambition and more discipline and more like It's anti-American dude and like honestly like all you people that are in this shit fucking Dude these people don't even try they're just And it's you know, it's you know, it's even funnier Is that they're perfectly happy to accept the The tax dollars that are generated by the producers that they hate right like those people out of all should be the biggest fans of people like me Right, but instead they try to destroy those people You know, they don't even understand that they're trying to bite the hand that even fucking feeds them So it's whatever the irony I know I know but these people are low IQ and because they went to a four-year college And they got quote-unquote educated Which is indoctrinated they think they're smarter than everybody. There's a huge difference between Being educated and being intelligent, okay? Huge it's not even close to the same thing and and dude Let's talk about the DEI initiatives that have been happening in colleges for the last 20 years all right To claim that your group is the most educated And produces the least in real world Should be a shining example of why DEI is a bad idea Okay, so the the days of wearing your Okay, now look if you if you graduated Harvard 30 years ago that's saying something. I meant something. Yeah, yeah Say it something if you graduated Cornell 20 years ago It means something still but if you graduated from one of those places in the last 20 years All it means is that you were sold a bunch of bullshit that doesn't actually exist in reality And you don't understand natural order or competition or capitalism or any of the things that this country supposed to be about So become a capitalist listen dude. Yeah, listen That's what they're doing and uh, you know Honestly like someone who comes along and says at this point in time And sit like right now like your 20s and you graduated from Harvard. That's a bad thing You're not getting hired because of that like people are going to look at you and they're going to say I want to create a company That wins Well, this guy went to Harvard, but he graduated three years ago. So all he did was get indoctrinated To the social initiatives and and and be made to be an activist and I'm going to hire this activist to come in my company and They're all kinds of shit up Nope, you know, yeah I'm going to hire the person who has no degree who comes from very poor outcomes who wants to change the trajectory of their family tree and is willing to do whatever they have to do to do it Not your lazy ass who walks around and talks about how I'm part of the most educated group in the world But you don't produce anything. Why is that? Why does your these people believe that because they have a certificate from a fucking school where they're taught All kinds of things that aren't even true about reality that they somehow have the right to come in and tell everybody else What to do and by the way? They don't have to actually work because they're smarter than you right They're owed your work and then they have the nerve to attack capitalism They these people are total hypocrites bro, right? so Whatever these people are dumb They're low IQ. They don't produce shit. Their day of reckoning is here and they're angry about it And that's that yes, we can yeah, no you can No, you won't yeah I love the democratic party as as as it's known right now needs to be completely burnt down Your leadership is I'm sorry for lack of a better terms mentally retarded all right And they need to move from this far left progressive gender bullshit that has been rejected from society I shouldn't be saying this because I'm gonna tell them how to fucking get back in it Say it don't tell them how to save it.
