yeah yeah yeah good man I'm I'm excited I'm also excited about what we have going on this year I'm very very excited about the new MFCO project a lot of people have been asking about it and they think that I'm just releasing the old episodes does that really really some people think that guys the old episodes have always been available they're free and they'll always be free okay I always wanted to um provide a gateway for someone who's starting out from scratch and you know can't afford to you know go out and join rta or whatever right so they're always there they're always for free if you go all the way down in the real af audio feed this is before we are on youtube uh you will find the MFCO project which was the most popular entrepreneur podcast uh in the world when we were doing it so uh and it was number one in all shows for a long time not just business so uh if you want to go listen to that now but the new MFCO is not the old MFCO it is completely different all right one of the biggest differences is is that a lot of people who have come up I guess since then starting listening to MFCO and now own you know seven eight nine figure companies and they're going to be coming on the show and talking about how they use the principles which principles they used to build the companies that they've built so a lot of you young bucks and business can see and hear and understand that these things work another thing that we're going to be doing it's having some of my most successful friends come in and talk about how they do things so this isn't like typical internet fucking coach shit this is real people who have done real things outside of just creating a coaching business um then we're going to teach you how to win and it's never been more important that you guys go out and win than it is right now we have a big problem in our culture where winning has been villainized winning has been attacked it has been looked down upon and the fact of the matter is that's all about societal control and we have to understand that if we want to be truly free and we want to live in the greatest society that we can we have a duty to be the best that we can in all areas and that includes being successful it's not just about driving a Bugatti or driving a Ferrari and living in a nice house I'll be the first one to admit that's bad as shit I love it but it's actually about us as individuals understanding that we have to be the example we have to extract every single ounce of potential out of our lives um and not just for us and our families but for everybody else around us in the community so I am very excited we've been recording shows for quite some time and I'm very excited to get that launch bro like it's going to be I since we've been recording the shows I've started to realize how much I enjoy talking about success business entrepreneurship personal development um and really helping people get the ball rolling in that direction you know I'm saying yeah I know there's a lot of people hungry for it yeah bro and I think you know with the emergence the last few years of the entire community of fucktards uh that have come out of nowhere to sell programs when they haven't done anything ever uh somebody has to come out and teach people what it really looks like who's actually done yes so that's real man I'm excited about it uh it's gonna be it's gonna be awesome um and that's gonna be launching in the next couple weeks so if you are interested in new MFCO project like a lot of you guys are uh first off we are going to continue real AF the exact same way that we've been doing it so it's not going away and secondly for you to know when the MFCO project drops you have to go to my website and get on the Andy Graham email list okay uh just go in there sign up for the Andy Graham it's a daily post that we write you come in it's little inspiration little personal development little little life advice that we do every morning comes right to your computer we don't spam you we don't fucking send you 75 emails a day I don't fucking pitch you on a bunch of shit I hate that shit too but if you want to be aware of when this happens you need to go register for the email because uh that's the only way we're gonna talk about I'm not gonna be pumping it here on the show I'm not gonna be talking about it on my social I'm just gonna put it out there and you guys are gonna do with it what you want yeah oh yeah man tell you well guys it is Monday yeah let's make some people better today yeah let's let's do it guys Andy I got three good ones for you so let's knock these out guys any question number one Andy I appreciate all you do I know you have probably heard that a thousand times by now but I really do I found your content like a year and a half ago and it's amazing I have a question for you about distractions I'm 24 just finished up law school I have no idea how but nevertheless I'm entering the world world and I feel like everything around me is nothing but distractions how did you handle and view distractions early on in life versus how you handle and view them now distractions I mean we just talked about having a lot of shit going on well I don't know is out there well first of all what do you mean you don't know how you got through law school you showed up you did the work and now you got through it just like you're gonna do anything in life okay so don't take away the achievements by trying to pretend like you're a lot of you guys fuck yourselves because you talk bad about yourselves and you say I don't know how I did that but I got through it all listen dude every time you say negative things about yourself every time you you know subtract from what your actual achievements are you are taking away your own belief in yourself there is nothing wrong with saying hey I just got through law school I graduated was tough but I got through it and I did a good job acknowledge that bro that's a hard thing a lot of people can't do that you should be happy about that don't act like oh I don't know how you know exactly how you showed up you did the work and now you're fucking know with it and now you're ready to do something else so I got to address that right up that's right a lot of you fuckers you buy into this humble bullshit and you take away every bit of confidence and self belief because you downplay your actual achievements and of course there's people that overplay their achievements but it's usually losers that do that okay you're winning acknowledge that you're winning acknowledge what you did to win and keep doing that I hate when people talk bad about themselves that's real bro I couldn't get through fucking law school you know saying like that's a massive fucking achievement dude I just don't do that it's bad for you but people think it's everybody else is gonna take your confidence away bro no it's you that's it dude you are the one that takes away that shit because society programs all of us to be self deprecating and fucking overly humble and take away our achievements and act like we're not dude no you're a badass motherfucker you just got through law school that's fucking awesome congratulations by the way I'd give you a fucking hug if you were right here okay so that that's first that's first now how do we handle distractions all right look man we're always going to have things that are outside of what we are pursuing in our professional life not all of those things are distractions some of them are just life okay so we have to determine what is a distraction and what isn't a distraction for example having a significant other in a relationship can be a distraction or it can be something that benefits you if you have the right partner a lot of people will say I can't have a significant other or I can't go play sports or I can't do this because that's one minute away from my goals well listen dude if you are that concerned about living your life and it takes away from this thing that you're doing what will happen is first of all you will burn out and you will get tired second of all you don't need to live a draconian life in order to be successful third of all you're gonna miss out on a bunch of things and fourth of all it's completely unnecessary all right we just have to determine if it is or isn't taking away from productive actions so the actual way to deal with distractions is to understand if it's a distraction or a benefit just because something's in your life doesn't mean that it's a distraction so you need to work to eliminate the things that are pulling you back or pulling you away or you know keeping you from doing what you want to do and the things that are propelling you forward okay you need to have as many of those things as you can outside of what it is you're trying to do and you need to have the least amount of things that holds you back all right and a lot of people think that everything holds them back it's just not true a lot of things you'll have will push you forward so you handle it the true answer to this is you handle it by being productive with the time that you have all right and it's not just about time no one cares how much time you put in no one cares how busy you are no one cares about anything other than the result that you produce and if that result takes five minutes it takes five minutes if it takes five days it takes five days if it takes five months it takes five months but if all three of those people are doing the exact same thing the dude that gets it done in five minutes gonna get paid the most all right so how productive are you being how focused are you I have developed a tool that I have used for 20 plus years that solves this problem for us it's called the power list you can get it for free at episode 16 on the audio feed what it does is it allows you and shows you how to break down critical tasks that move you forward and it doesn't talk about how much time you're gonna have to the time is irrelevant so if you can become effective you have five critical tasks per day that you need to cross off okay and then the rest of the time is yours to fill with distractions or fill with entertainment or go live a life this idea that is put through by all these fake ass mother fuckers that you have to work 50 hours and a 24 hour day is a lie that that's how you know they haven't done anything because no one can do that all right so it's not about how much time you have it's about how productive you are and what result you produce and a lot of people have problems differentiating those two concepts because they grew up in a regular job and they come from regular you know I work for someone they pay me to do shit and they have trouble converting because they're so used to thinking about this I'm getting paid for my time I'm getting paid for my time poor people get paid for their time successful people get paid for their skill okay so how do you use your skill to be as effective as possible as fast as possible so that you can get paid the most money and have the most free time well you create a systematic framework that outlines the critical tasks that you need to do you do them every day you realize that there's only so many things that you need to do in a day to get forward and then you have the rest of the time to do whatever you want and that's how I've lived my life if I get done my critical task by 10 a.m. I could do whatever I want the rest of the day if it takes me till 10 p.m. I'm working on that it just depends on what the task is so there's that but ultimately dude look the truth of the matter is I had a really good time grow my business okay I worked very hard but I also enjoyed things and some of those things would be called distractions but those same things that are called distractions are now great memories that I have of my younger years so I wouldn't trade those things you see what I'm saying so we have to understand dude this grind grind grind grind grind grind grind mentality yeah it's true but the more effective you are in the higher skilled you are the less time you have to put in the more life you get to live okay so I would encourage you to reframe how you think from time to effectiveness and now you're in a turning you bill for your time but we all know what the fuck you guys do you get you go in your computer you pull out your little sheet that you send to everybody and then you say that sheet would have cost would have taken 10 hours to make and any bill in 10 hours yeah right so you know we all have a couple of names in there a couple of words how these guys don't have anybody cool but that's that's the bottom line dude like eliminating distractions you know if you ask most of these people out here what I'll go in a dark room and I meditate for 75 minutes and I'll put a I mask on and then I'll dunk my face and cold water they have all this shit brought listen dude you don't have to worry about being distracted if you're fucking effective you don't have to if you're working yeah so the answer is build your skill set be more effective get shit done quickly and the more time you have to do what you want you go to the Cardinals game you're fucking you know go on vacation you can fuck off on the internet it doesn't matter because you got your five things done and five critical tasks done per day will get you where you want to go yeah most people don't get any done yeah that's real shit I want to I want to dive a little bit more deeper into this this concept you brought up about just differentiating what is an actual distraction and what's lied from what's just something that will benefit you for example like the the relationship thing yeah okay we've all been in relationships that were a distraction you know women who for us guys I'm just gonna speak for I'm a speak as a man sure I've been in relationships before where when I was broke I was yelled at for not having any money okay and the same relationship when I got busy to try to make money I was yelled at for not having any fucking time so as a man there really is no win with a female like that yeah so you have to find friends and partners and people that are going to help push you forward and understand what you're trying to do not try to be selfish with your time and take away they have to have the long-term vision and so we have to understand that the same thing that could be a distraction for you could be a benefit for me if I had the right partner that's just using partners you see what I'm saying so many things are like that like many things like uh a friend group oh that let's yeah for sure a friend group friend group you know I would I guess my question was it's like you know because I feel like there's a fine line here you got to be careful with of like okay like I got my five things done but I could also be doing stuff in the all-time that will wipe out all of that progress of those five things so I think like I guess when I'm asking is like does this really come down to to like the discipline level you have as a person going on this this journey because I mean I think discipline's a different topic than what we're talking about here um this is this yeah maybe I mean maybe it's the discipline here of of staying true to your mission and not allowing people to be distractions but you know everybody goes through this dude everybody goes through this phase when they start out and everybody in their family and everybody in their friends and everybody they know what are you doing what do you mean you're doing what do you mean you're gonna start a vitamin store what do you mean you're so fucking vitamins yeah what you're not gonna get a real job like like what are you talking about that doesn't make sense oh you're gonna build a brand you're you're gonna you're gonna build a you're gonna build a world class nutrition supplement brand lifestyle high performance lifestyle brand you're gonna build that from St. Louis where you who fuck you think you are okay like dude you think I haven't heard all the shit I replace those people with other people who say bro that's fucking awesome how are we gonna do that how how can I help you know what I think dude what if you did it like this what if you did it like that you know I I don't know much about it but I was thinking I was in the store and I saw this what do you think okay even if it's not valuable it's the intent because they want you to fucking win so you only have so much energy in a day and if you spend a any part of your energy and this is the truth here I we talked about you know you don't have to spend 50 hours and 24 but you do have to account and allocate your energy properly and if you spend one fucking unit of energy when I say one unit I'm just gonna say okay we all have a hundred units of energy in a day that we can use right we have when we fill the gas tank it's at a hundred we get to choose how we spend that energy and if we spend any of that energy on things that pull us backwards we will lose to people who have understood that they needed to replace distractions with things that propel them forward so if you have equal skill set okay and and you probably don't you're probably behind the skill set and you're also spending your energy dealing with a nagging girlfriend or a shit bum boy friend or a family that fucking doesn't believe in you or anything and you're spending your energy over there and you've equal skill and this guy has figured out to put things in his life to propel him forward he's gonna destroy you it's not you cannot be that good you're not that good so we have to understand there are people that are as good as us and better than us who allocate their energy properly and that's a real thing I won't you don't have to work 24 hours or a day but you do have to allocate your energy properly one thing I know for sure from all of my friends I don't hang out with anybody not because I'm better than anybody but all my friends are successful all of them do that right none of them none of them have a relationship or friends or distractions or things that pull them away from what they're trying to do they all have people to contribute so you have to be aware of that energy expenditure I would say more than anything and learn to replace things in your life that are a distraction with things that push you forward and that that takes that that's hard that's a hard thing to do it's hard because you've been friends with people for a long time or you've been in a relationship for a long time yeah but I love them yeah bro listen just because you've been in a relationship for a long time doesn't mean it's the right relationship oh man you know so like the we we have to we have to equip ourselves with things that are going to push us forward and we have to remove the things that aren't I did a podcast on this on MS CEO years and years and years ago anchors and propellers in a boat okay I can't remember what number that was the guys will find it here real quick but it basically describes that we're all in a boat okay and there's 10 of us and you're either rowing or you're fucking holding us back and throwing anchors in the water that's it and you got to remove the people to throw the anchors in the water and replace them people that row episode 150 on the MS CEO project that's at the bottom past real a half episode one go to 150 on the CEO project and we talk about this concept directly I love it man I love it guys any question number two Andy I had to fall them out with the close friend two years ago and while I've tried to move on I still find myself feeling hurt and angry when I think about what happened I know holding on to these feelings isn't healthy but I don't know how to let go and truly forgive how can I release a resentment and find peace with with 2025 here now I want to get through this how do you how do you really let go of those anchors you had to let go I got a good that's a good question value yourself more than that you got to value yourself more than that like why would you why would you keep someone in your life that you know shouldn't be there regardless of how long you know them or how what you did or what memories you have entrepreneurship is a different thing dude success is a different thing you don't get all the things everybody else gets but you do get things they don't get okay so there's a trade and while a regular person who maybe isn't highly ambitious they they can deal with relationships in their life that don't push them forward because they're obligated to in their mind right I'm related to this person or I've known this person since kindergarten and a lot of people would say that's being a good person I don't think that has anything to do with being a good person I think being a good person is you taking care of yourself making sure you become the best person knowing that when you're the best person other people improve too that's being a great person so you know when we think about letting go you know I understand when you're younger it's hard I don't know how old this person is yeah inside but when you get older you just carry less and less about that shit and you just kind of accept reality for what it is I personally I really I people are gonna think I'm a fucking fuck per se in this but like I really don't give a fuck like if you don't want to be here if you're not about what I'm about if you're not trying to win if you're not trying to be better if you're not trying to improve if you're not trying to kick ass and you don't want to be my friend I don't care like at all you know what I'm saying so like I don't know why and I'm trying to like empathize with this question and think about like how I was when I was younger and I think when I was younger I felt rejected by these things and because I had less confidence and I had less belief and I hadn't accomplished as much and I didn't believe in myself the way that I should and I think when you're in that state you know relationships can hurt a little bit more when when you feel rejected or wronged or whatever but dude the best way to get to a point where that shit doesn't bother you is to win and it's to believe in yourself and it's to build yourself into what you should be this is a big benefit of 75 hard and live hard because once you get everything on tune and once you understand that you are in control of most of the things that matter in your life and you're not just drifting through it sort of changes your perspective on everybody else for for better or worse the people who don't belong in your life it becomes very clear and the people who do belong in your life that becomes very clear and so and I think I think you develop enough confidence of self-belief through that program to where you don't mind if people don't want you you know what I'm saying like I look back at the times I was rejected or the times I had relationships or friendships fall apart and I'm just being completely fucking honest it was a blessing every time every time and no disrespect to anybody that's listening but just being real dude like my life got significantly better every single time one of those things happen and while I might have been sad and it may have bothered me if I think back to the times where it bothered me for a long time it was because I wasn't winning it was because I wasn't at my potential and I didn't believe in myself the way I should and I felt like oh well you know I just felt like I wasn't good enough and it's because I wasn't and I think the other thing that you can do is you can use it as fuel you know one of the biggest drivers of my life has been these situations it's been people my friends that didn't believe in me you guys hear me talk about it all the things I just said a minute ago those came from people that weren't quote unquote my friends you knew I knew them personally well what do you what do you think you're gonna do like I'm gonna win bitch that's what the fuck I'm gonna do okay and you're gonna be the same and I'm gonna win and that's that and so when we think about you know these times of rejection and these times of disbelief and these times of doubt and these times of falling out that's massive amounts of fuel for you to go do what you want to do and I know we live in this feel good society where everybody wants to say well don't worry about what they say well listen if you don't worry about what they say you're missing out on 50% of the available fuel and it takes 100% of the available fuel to get where you want to go and every single motherfucker I know that's built anything relevant that is highly successful whether they talk about it in public or not if you get them in private and you get a cup of fucking whiskey they'll tell you everybody they hate they know their names they know where they live they know what they're doing and they'll say fuck that motherfucker I'm winning and they're proud of it and I'm talking about all the all the spiritual gurus feel good all of them I know mom motherfucker and all of them have this dark side in them that wants to smash fucking faces and that comes from rejection it comes from doubt it comes from people breaking up with you it comes from people saying ignorant shit not believing in you these are things that you can use by simply saying fuck them and going to do it yeah you know so you have to become one of these people that can absorb the negativity and then not dwell on it but then turn and do productive things in terms of taking action to move forward I think that that has been one of them for me that has been one of the most powerful fuel sources that I've ever had when people believe in me and people fucking like and I'm and they're like yeah you're great dude that doesn't motivate me you know what motivates me is a motherfucker saying bro you you haven't done shit yeah and that gets harder and harder to do and so as you progress you have to find different ways to fuel yourself and like for me I replaced because a lot I mean dude look you know I don't have a lot of people anymore they're like oh you'll never do that like I get an opposite oh you're so you've done so well so I have to use that as fuel because now I'm like no I actually haven't done anything I'm gonna do this and this and this okay and and and then I think about the purpose and who's who I'm responsible for and the change I'm trying to make right like the msco project the reason I'm bringing it back isn't for any other reason that I realized that we have to change the culture of ambition and winning in society especially in the youth and that's what I want to do it's not you know I want to prove people wrong about how much I know now now it's a bigger mission right like when I come in to my companies it's not how much more money can I make it's what are we trying to do how are we trying to change things what kind of result are we trying to create what's this going to mean for my team all of these things are bigger missions than just being wanting to prove people wrong so as you progress through the path of entrepreneurship you're going to find yourself motivated and driven by different things and the beginning you know it's usually like material ambition I want car and want house I want a big fat bank account then when you set out to do it you get a bunch of people that will doubt you tell you you can't ask you why you're doing it try to talk you out of it and then you get pissed okay so you start using that for fuel then if you're good and you're dedicated you end up finding yourself in a place where you're doing okay so I'm not getting the hate I'm not getting the disbelief I'm not getting the doubt I'm not getting the fuel that I was getting so I have to adjust how I attack because I'm not operating on that fuel anymore and that is where you finally get to a point where it's no longer anger or frustration or hate or dark side energy and you move into a positive energy which is these are the people I care about I'm responsible for these people this is the mission we're on this is what we're trying to do and it becomes we're trying to build rather than prove anything so there's phases to it and in the beginning dude if you try to operate without that dark side energy you're probably going to get stomped on by people who know how to harness it properly because we only have like we talked about a hundred units of energy and let's just say half of it comes from the mission positive what I want to do prove people right I believe in myself and the other half comes from fuck you motherfucker I'll show you exactly what the fuck I'm going to do and when I walk in I see you 10 years from now you're going to be embarrassed you didn't fucking believe me those two things have to be used for all of us the regular people who don't have billion dollars worth of fucking funding for our companies that's how we got to do it yeah yeah it's a say to say you wouldn't be where you if you didn't use that negative I love when people fucking hate I love when people talk shit I love it's rare now but it happens still I mean it does and I don't care I don't care I don't care who it comes from because I love it so much I take it from anybody like the worst thing you could do to me like if you're competing with me is talk shit or hate on me or tell me that you won't because I will stop your fucking face into the dirt I will go I will go back to sleeping on a pistein mattress in my first retail store to beat you you won't do that you're not going to give up your comfortable life you're not going to give up your fucking five series BMW to go back I fucking give up everything bro don't fuck with me I'll stop your fucking face you better off just leave me to fuck alone yeah since I'm going to say shit just leave me alone that's why you should never fuck with competitors bro especially ones who are accomplished because there's a good chance that those motherfuckers are some bad ass dark driven motherfuckers and when you fuck with them bro they'll go to the ends of the earth to fucking ruin you not ruin you like burn your house down ruined you but win so big that you feel like a dumbass yeah that's shit man that's real guys any question number three let's get a final question here Andy I got a business question for you question number three Andy I'm four years into my business I do landscaping from design to build out some maintenance I have 12 employees and we are doing really well I've been able to pivot during the off seasons to keep my guys paid and working now we are getting back into the work with spring around the corner and my question is about reinvesting into the company as the owner where do owners mess up with this concept and what's the right way to go about it reinvest in the business how you do it where do owners mess up they mess up by taking money for themselves far too soon and if you want to know the truth you should keep all the money in the company every single dollar that you make for as long as you possibly can and then when you do start getting paid you should pay yourself the minimum of what it takes to cover your living expenses and let everything else compound scale and that is the fastest way to build a large company that will provide for you now most people don't do that because the first time they can make 200 grand or 400 grand they're fucking they're so hungry that they want to take it I was no different by the way and I could tell you this if I had delayed just a little bit in terms of getting paid it would have exponentially scaled me faster so this is something that I think we all make mistakes on yeah um so if I were re if I were doing it today and I was in my 20s and I was I was young even if I'm in my 30s in your young or 40s in your young you're just starting I would keep as much in the company as I possibly can for as long as I can possibly do it and I would live in a way that was way less than what I could have what I really could afford for as long as I was comfortable doing that and people will say well winner winner win win win is the time yeah it just depends on what you want bro depends on how big you want to build something okay some people are happy you know with a just having a half a million dollar house you know they want that's that's success to a lot of people you know driving a denali is success to a lot of people but some people that's their fucking roof so they're gonna have to do this probably for way less time then somebody who wants to build the greatest American economy in the world which is what I want to do yeah okay so their scales to it and we just have to determine what it is we want and uh and then we also have to consider you know life you know what I'm saying like life the time goes I mean it goes by and there's a thing called quality of life you know a lot of people will say don't ever make emotional decisions about money I would say that's 90% true but there's things that you could overpay for because they're important to you like the house you live in okay like maybe uh you know this is your dream house and it costs you a little bit extra that you to live there well that's okay if you know that and you understand you're making an emotional decision for the quality for your trade off a quality of life yeah so now that's a whole different topic it really is because I don't want people to get the wrong idea but we have to understand that if you want to be as successful as possible then you live below your means for as long as possible and reinvest for as long as possible and that's what that's and the less you do that the less successful you're probably likely to be and then you know like I said along the lines when you make a logical versus emotional decision you you should be a very aware which decision you're making okay like you you don't need a fucking escalade now do you want to escalate okay well all right you want it you don't need it you understand yeah and it's okay to make one decisions as long as you can afford it and it's not putting you behind the eight ball and it's not crushing your finances um you know there's people uh there's people that will deny that like you know ramzy logical decisions yeah Ramzy Ram if you listen to Ramzy which by the way I got tons of respect for for Dave um you know he'll say don't ever do don't ever do that yeah okay well what if the what if you die hmm and you never got to do you never got to taste any of the fucking you know what I'm saying yeah so we have to understand to answer the question very simply keep as much money in your business for as long as possible live very Spartan for as long as possible and let the business compound that's that's the fastest way to grow a business yeah when should you spend money on yourself in the early days only when needed when you're a decade in and you want to buy a fucking BMW and it doesn't mean shit if you buy it who gives a fuck you know you know what I'm saying these things house a car a lifestyle should not put you in some sort of bind financially at all and your goal in business is to build a machine that works at scale and that takes time and it takes money and so if you want to do it fast you put everything you got into it yeah okay can we can we talk about some real numbers here like for you what what did that look like for you early on in business how long did you go before you took anything out well the first three years I made zero dollars like zero we didn't we worked other jobs and we lived in the store on and off and then also some shitty apartments like four hundred dollar a month three dudes living in it right sounds great yeah no for real dude and uh and then the next seven years I made six hundred and ninety five dollars a month post tax for a grand total of my first ten years of fifty eight thousand three hundred eighty dollars for my first ten years in business that I could have made more money working in McDonald's okay but that time set the framework for what you see today all right so that was the foundation of everything we've used to scale out my tenth year or eleventh year I made a hundred and eighty thousand dollars you're thirty by this time right yeah that would make you think okay so yeah there's a lot of there yeah I mean yeah it's just yeah I was thirty twenty nine twenty twenty eight or twenty nine um made a hundred and eighty grand the next year I made over a million bucks and I haven't made less than seven figures ever since then so but I wouldn't have made that seven figures ever if that first ten years I had been taking money out to go fucking drive a five series beamer some bullshit so uh so this is an important distinction now what you were taking home the seven ninety five that wasn't what you were taking home because that's all you could you're saying you could have taken correct correct correct okay okay so so for and that's up that is an important point yeah from years six to ten we probably could have got paid pretty good but we put all that money back in gotcha that's the distance when you're talking about it okay so so I mean dude and you know my all my just so you know like all my friends made fun of me everybody I knew made fun of me everybody everybody was like Andy's still fucking doing that little vitamin shop like bro they said to my fucking face yeah this is why I stopped going around people like you talk about eliminating distractions that's why I don't fucking do how do I go no go you you spend more time with me than anybody where do I go do we go here and we're going home that's it I don't fuck with anybody I don't go anywhere I don't talk to anybody and it's a bad habit now because it's become almost hermitish or anti social to my successful friends but the reason I got that way was because everywhere I went all I heard was bullshit yeah so I stopped going to family shit I stopped going to fucking social shit I stopped doing anything I stopped talking to anybody because dude I got tired of hearing that bullshit and I didn't want to fucking hear it because when I did hear it I'd spend three fucking days like doing over it so I just cut the shit out and I fucking put the blinders on and I went over here and and that was it and I I don't regret that you know because now you know I lost a lot of friendships and and but they weren't the kind of friendships that were serving me dude you know what I'm saying um yeah so dude listen this is all hard to navigate this is a hard thing for people to navigate like we have to understand that you know there's going to be people in your life that have to be removed for you to get where you want to go it's just reality and and you have to do it you don't have an option because you won't get there because the energy expenditure on that negativity will force you to lose in business you see what I'm saying man so you know I tell you this if you got a girlfriend of bitches at you for not having any money she gonna bitch at you for being too busy or vice versa now her's nag give him the fuck out and that's real shit yeah you got a bum of a boyfriend yeah same for boyfriend yeah yeah get him out of there yeah get him out of there boo boo yeah bro yeah I love it man guys I mean dude like we're you guys have to understand you are on a different fucking path you are on a different path you're on a path we're only one percent of the people that choose the path are successful and only eight percent that choose that only eight percent in population choose that path only one percent of them are successful so you're choosing the hardest possible path so when you listen to your friends and you listen to the memes on the internet and you hear people talking about all these things none of those things are for you they're for them entrepreneurship ambition success requires a different mindset that hardly anybody understands because they've not done it so stop reading the memes and stop trying to fit your life into all these frameworks that all these so-called experts try to frame up for you on the internet right oh you're a bad person if you're super focused and you don't have time no you're not you're living a different life than those motherfuckers and there is no standard of how we should live you have to go out and pursue what it is you truly want your heart and if you do not do that at the end of your life you will have a major regret you will say fuck I could have I should have I would have but and it's not gonna make you feel a better at that point so please understand this if you understand nothing else than I ever say ever if you get sucked into the vortex of what everybody else wants for you and what everybody else thinks for you and what the memes say and what the therapist say and what the fucking your friends say you're gonna be just like them and most of you don't want that so ignore the noise and realize you are living a different life you are living a different path and that path requires a different set of rules than anything else you're reading online and when you do read shit online you say oh that's good who wrote it and what they do this is a guy that just writes memes does he know what the fuck he's talking about is this a therapist who's convincing people that they're broken so they can get paid who's writing it is it a regular motherfucker that's talking about balance what the fuck do they know about balance to have balance you gotta have success too don't you ambition too those people don't have any of that they think balance is sitting on their ass at home fucking do nothing so none of that shit applies to you here's what applies to you decide what the fuck you want to do break it down into actual steps daily execute those steps as quick as you can every single day you're gonna have balance in your life because you'll have free time and you're gonna have success and that's how you have to look at it dude this this this society we live in that that rewards victimhood and laziness and fucking quote unquote balance let's be real dude motherfucker to talk about balance or they what are they really talking about they're talking about being lazy as fuck that's what they're talking about don't listen any of it guys it's all you are living a different path you're on a different mission not everybody is going to relate in fact very few people are gonna relate just keep that in mind I love it man I love it guys and that's a hell of a way to start a Monday man all right guys don't forget real america freedom gear drop Wednesday at seven o'clock and we'll see tomorrow
