Johnson and Johnson you know that's his company yeah I'm in Johnson yeah that's what he's sponsored by them they're my dad he's their best cousin there you're dad they're my two dads yeah that's what it is man no man let's get let's get let's get Monday going to a good to we gotta have a still calling first uh let's get Adriana on the line a Adriana let's do it hello a Adriana hi hi how you doing this DJ what's going on not much just finishing up a meeting how are y'all sweet we're doing sick man I got any good Adriana hello how are you fabulous thank you so much for asking all right is this a good time oh yeah absolutely how did the meeting go meeting good DJ hello yeah hey no I said how did the meeting go uh well there's a reason why I asked the question I did today okay well let's do it let's get into it now what you got so I just kind of wanted to see you know at what point you stop pouring into something especially when it won't receive what I bring to the team um it the team sees me as a leader but I'm not empowered to lead by the owner um I believe in the mission I'm a manager I have attempted to put a lot of things in place but I'm kind of at a crossroads of you know when is enough enough you know do I stop being underused here and grow where my value is honored or even I'm on a crossroad of opening up my own business okay well let me ask you this when you say uh you're not empowered by the leadership to lead what do you mean by that because you also said you're a manager so I'm confused on what you're saying there absolutely so I was hired as the manager um background I've had 10 years of running hotels and switched career paths and gotten to wellness and health and I understood from the initial interview that me coming into this team was to help build create SOPs and help grow the business um but as I've come into the company again I had moved away for a few months and then moved back um because I moved out of state but I was still always helping and when I came back we're hitting our two-year anniversary this week and there's still no use of SOPs um there's no contract even for us as employees and there's just been multiple conversations about trying to create a background for the business so we can be successful have you had these discussions with your leadership yes it's one owner he's the doctor um I'm on my third conversation and what how do those conversations typically go they are typically very positive but no follow through okay now when you say no follow-through is it possible that she's waiting for you to follow through I have presented all documents and follow up on my end what what are you waiting for what are you waiting for her to do is what I'm trying to understand yeah absolutely um the best way for me to put it is that though I'm the manager she won't allow me to rule anything out so she's saying no don't do this or she's saying wait or she what is she's like micromanaging yeah like I'm trying to understand where the block is like like because due to a lot of times in leadership you know like for example uh let's say somebody would bring me a plan of how to do something um well I'm not going to do it like that's their job to do it right so I don't know if the situation is she's telling you no or she's looking for you to take initiative to develop on your own I'm trying to figure out where the block is absolutely so what are our meeting today any of the initiatives that I put forward and have been attempting to understand and I was told that she was not comfortable doing that until end of year or maybe next year when we hit our three year well so you have an intermediary between you and her is that correct no it's um me directly to her so she's telling you I want to wait until the end of the year yeah is she giving you a reason why she says that it is too busy to put any of the processes in play is that true it's definitely very busy but I don't believe we can grow unless we have these processes in place so when you have well when you have these discussions do you push back on her and say hey listen if we put these in I think we can grow faster yeah and what she said today the line has been just then I want to put a playbook in place for the office but use your best judgment if your decision but then she does not support it well do you think that it's going to work yes well then go do it and then you already have you already have one foot out anyway you're already thinking about other things um at the worst case scenario you go do it and it doesn't work and you get to learn a lesson on her behalf like you're not going to you don't lose you know first of all let me say this I don't think she's leading properly but I also don't think you're doing your job properly all right I think there's both there's both people have fought here one she's not communicating or supporting or standing up and saying this is why we can't do this she's not giving you clarity which is causing you to have frustration and resentment and bitterment and question should I even be here or not on the other hand I can see it from her point of view which is she may be thinking well we're too busy um and dude there could be financial issues that she doesn't want to disclose to you there could be a re I don't know I don't know these things okay but I could tell you this there's been a lot of times in my business where people wanted to do things that were good ideas and I said hey man we gotta wait and they didn't understand why and the real reason why was because we had too much money out at the time and we had to we had to you know be careful about making any investments and and things and so um um there could be my point saying that is there could be some hidden reasons that she's not willing to disclose that could be causing hesitation so my advice here is okay you asked in the beginning about maybe going somewhere else or maybe going and starting your own business so if that's how you truly feel then what do you have to lose by doing it and and and trying to do it and by the way I'm not saying doing it so it fails I'm saying doing it the absolute best that you can to try and win because at the end of the day if it doesn't work you're gonna learn something and that you'll be able to take that with you and if you take that to a new passion or a new career or a new company you'll have that lesson in place but it sounds like you're pretty confident that it's gonna work so it could be a really good opportunity for you to gain her complete trust and then end up in a position where you truly do feel fulfilled and respected and appreciated um and I gotta be honest with you okay there's been I could think of a lot as every single one of my main leaders that that we have here in our company um every one of them this situation happened along the way at one point in time they had an idea I didn't like the idea I gave them the opportunity to execute the idea the idea worked and then I started trusting them more to have more responsibility so depending on how seasoned this woman is as your leader um she probably has a lesson to learn about that as well because we as entrepreneurs tend to think sometimes that we're the only ones capable of doing things and uh you know we have to see someone do something to really learn to trust them so what I actually think is here for you is I think it's a tremendous opportunity I think it's tremendous opportunity for you to step up for you to make some changes for you to make the company more profitable and to earn trust earn respect be seen for what you actually are and what you actually do bring to the table and by the way I'm sure you moving away for a while has affected this it's a it's the ability for you to make that up too so I think this is a tremendous opportunity for you if you if you do it well if you don't do it well I still think it's a tremendous opportunity because you're going to learn a lesson that you're going to take with you and it's not going to um personally cost you anything because otherwise you'd have to learn that lesson in your own business and that would be expensive so my my recommendation is you know hey sometimes leadership has to be taken not given all right so yeah it's it's you know every one of my great leaders of our great leaders here and and really any of the companies that we own they took they took the leadership they didn't wait to get it they took it and I think that's one of the biggest disconnects between uh you know executive owners operators and employees trying to work their way up a lot of employees have good ideas and good plans and they're afraid to bring them up well and then they get mad that you don't value them for what they bring well how the fuck can I value someone when I don't even know what the fuck they think in their head so number one they they have to learn to bring those things to the leadership number two the leadership if they've been in it long enough may have seen this before they may have said hey we tried that back in 2017 we got our asses kicked so if this was going to work it would have to be different than that and then you might have to go back and redo it and because that person wasn't there in 2017 they might take that personally that's not a personal thing then there could also be a situation where the employee has a good idea and just does it without asking anything and that's also bad because like I said if they if they go back and change something without you know informing the leadership they run the risk of stepping on a landmine that we've already stepped on before so there's a way to do this and the way to do it is exactly how you're doing it minus the taking initiative okay so you came up with a plan you didn't just put it in you you went to the owner you said hey this is what I think we should do she seems like she's indecisive about whether or not she wants to do it you feel that you're very confident which is what she hired you to do she hired you to make the business better you feel very confident so your job is to make these changes and I would you know do what you need to do and yes there's some risk to it but is there really because you're going to learn either way and that's that's got that's where I'm sitting on it what do you think I I completely agree I think my biggest problem is as her the owner I didn't want to completely overstep boundaries um but I know that for her she has had no leadership experience prior opening this business okay being the doctor well then she probably doesn't trust anybody to do anything and you're going to have to show her that that listen if here's what's going to happen if you don't show her that that you could do this that company will never grow or expand because she'll never trust anybody and you'll ride away in that career so here's your options stay where you are and right do what you think is the best and the company grows or you do nothing and you you waste away in a company because the ownership doesn't know how to allow people to lead they don't know how to delegate yeah I would just think about it from this aspect too like the I think the intention matters a lot right I give you're truly trying to do something that you truly believe is going to help you can't really go wrong with that I mean you can if you're stupid right right okay but she's got she has a lot of experience yeah she knows she's she's made the plan she's presented the plan the owner said hey not right now and then she said today hey well you do what you want but I don't necessarily think we should do it right now and that's the owner's way of having an out if it goes wrong and she can hold Adriana accountable okay so I would do this wouldn't work that's right so Adriana's job is to go make it fucking work and make the owner kind of have to eat a little eat a little crow so that so that Adriana gets the trust in the respect and I bet after that the the toe I know after that the tone will change the dynamic will change between the owner and Adriana and then she'll be free to do her job so this could be your your chance to get what you want and what you want it out of this the whole time yeah so you so I could tell you sad and frustrated but listen man you got nothing to lose at this point because you're already miserable you're already thinking about doing other shit you're already pissed off they don't listen to you sometimes you just got to do the shit and show them you know what I mean yeah like I've had a number of guys who in my company that got promoted that I was like dude why would you promote that and then and then you know what they turned out to be awesome you see what I'm saying there's I mean I don't have a problem with that because like dude I'm not trying to be right I'm trying to win so you know I can only see you know remember the owners that they can't see the fucking front lines man like that's like the general saying they can see the front line you can't see the front line you don't know what's actually going on in the trenches you have to learn to listen to those people and you have to be able to determine who's full of shit because some guys and some girls will just tell you shit so their job gets easier but you have to learn who the people you could trust are and this is a great opportunity for Adriana to earn the trust of her ownership by going out doing something doing it well making sure it works and then that will that will not just teach the owner that will allow the business to scale which will benefit all the employees so love it yeah that's that's that's what I think can you do it yeah I definitely can all right you got nothing to lose no I don't all right well let's go do it no honestly I'm about to go back into the real man get things going all right good good we appreciate you for calling in as you're on appreciate it no I appreciate you guys on a little back end I'm on 75 cards for the second time and I've lost 100 pounds and I just appreciate everything that you guys do thank you so much that's that's that's why we do it it's amazing that is that is that is that is awesome news congratulations on that no I just rightly appreciate you listen to you everywhere religiously thank you so much go out there thank you for your time guys if you listen do what you know how to do do it the best she can earn her trust it'll change your whole life it'll change her life it'll change the employees' lives yeah you actually have a duty to do it yeah say do all right let's go do it let us know how it works out of course thank you guys so much all right thank you that's awesome yeah man that's awesome you know I was thinking too like one of the other reasons and this may not be this situation but are there people are there other owner operators decision makers entrepreneurs who are who are simply just afraid to grow from where they are like they're they're cool where where they are and like growth I guess can scare them is that is that a thing yeah but it's not a yes but it doesn't work in real life okay like because it betrays the reality of the market the reality of the market is there's always it's always moving forward okay so you're moving forward okay and you decide I like it right here this is cool but the market continues to move forward people are innovating they're trying harder they're getting aggressive they want to grow eventually they they they swallow you up so they're in business you there is no host and that's what kills people man they think that they get to a certain level and everything will just be all right and that's not how it works man very rarely does that work and it certainly doesn't work long-term it might work for a year it might work for two years but it's not going to work that long and we see this in usually multi-generational businesses where the dad or the mom who owned the business worked very hard to grow it the kids come in and they look around and they're like well fuck dude I'm rich cool yeah I got this business and they don't do shit and they don't try to get aggressive and they're going to the lake on Thursday and coming back on Monday and you know walking around the office acting like they're a big deal when all the other people are doing carrying all the fucking water bro so and then those companies lose like business is the most competitive fucking sport on the planet it is way more competitive than any other physical sport it is the consequences are way higher because we're not talking about winning a game we're talking about people's fucking lives can they eat or can they not eat can they go to the store can they not go to the store can they have a pay their rent or can they not pay their rent those are much higher consequences than winning a fucking football game and so to think that it's not the most competitive thing it is the most competitive thing and if you think that you're going to come into the game and run your game half-ass you're gonna get fucking eaten up dude so yes there's owners that do that but it never works and it is a common thing you know like they say like like more common than you think it is no there's what they say they you see this on the internet too bro like they say shit like well I don't want to make any more money than I make right now but and that's fine okay don't pay yourself anymore but you better go to work every day and fucking work your ass off to keep your business going you see what I'm saying I don't necessarily need to make any more money okay I get that I'm not saying everybody has to be fucking warm buffet nobody not everybody wants to drive a fucking Ferrari or Bugatti or fucking whatever man not everybody wants to live in a a a big ass house I totally get it but the game is still the same you know I'm saying like you better show up and you better be ready to go to battle every day and people say I hate when people use the term war and battle and business well fuck if you ever done it you know I'm saying like it's pretty fucking brutal bro I don't know the better analogy you know like you're gonna live or die because of it you're either gonna fucking survive or you're gonna fucking starve it takes everything you got 100% of your focus all the time and yeah while it may not kill you today it'll probably eventually kill you I mean that's the truth so I just you know I think people have big misconceptions about what business is really about and yeah man it's it's it's it's it's fucking hard and you better be showing up every day I think a lot I think a lot of people fuck this up to a lot of owners because they think only really about themselves like if you want to know if a owner gives a fuck about their team pay attention to how much they're actually in the office and how much they actually do do they walk around and and know their names and ask how they're doing and find sheet out about them do they know like anything about their people do they are they there are they trying to win you know what I'm saying like I don't know feel were me and I didn't own businesses I would certainly want to work for someone that gave a fuck and and dude you know the ones that don't and usually end up losing long term and you know why they end up losing long term because eventually they can't find anybody that's competent to work for them because all the good talent and all the good skills wants to work for a team that's actually trying to do some shit like dude the the idea that a lot of owners of businesses have that they want to attract the best talent but also not like aggressively have a big mission to accomplish is a flawed idea because do you think that people that work that are the best do you think that they just want to show up and go through the motions that's not how they think they think like fuck dude I want to you know I want to do something great I want to I want to build something awesome I want to be a part of a winning team I don't want to be a part of some Shlub half ass organization that gets excited because it's Karen's fucking birthday oh we got cake in the fucking cake room no one fucking wants that no one wants that shit pizza party yeah yeah pizza party day woo like no one what I mean pizza parties are cool but no it's pretty good I mean just saying like when you work at a company where the idea of company culture is a fucking pizza party you know like that's wrong place bro and uh you know like that's only going to become more important with the technology changes that are happening because there's going to be a lot of people that won't have jobs and there's going to be a lot of people who are really good that are looking for places to build and so I think there's going to be a big sort of revolution in in all business uh and I feel really good about where we're at because like we've been doing this shit the whole time that's real man I love it man guys let's get to our next question we got it right in here uh let's get to question number two Andy where do you draw the line when it comes to being ethical and wanting to make money the fuck are you talking about well we're getting through I don't need to fucking hear a rest of the question there there's only one way to make money long term it's by solving mother fuckers problems okay what's unethical about solving some ones actual problems if you are in a business that sells something that doesn't actually solve their problem you should look for something else to do because eventually people will figure it out they have the ability to go on the internet and say fuck those guys they didn't help me they didn't provide a service they showed up late they charged me too much they bullshitting me and then what happens after not a long time is that they go away so you have to understand and this is the truth and a lot of people will always argue this because they don't understand really anything about how this works you are paid in proportion to the value that you deliver and the value that you deliver has to be real you have to solve their fucking problem whatever it is if it's a plumber you got to fix the fucking leak real well and then I would recommend maybe take care one or two other things that you see need to be fixed so you can go and say hey man I fixed the leak oh by the way I noticed this was squeaking I took care of that I did this I took care of that and you know what I did it for free no big deal anytime you need something call me I come take care of it then what happens is the person goes on their mother fucking phone and they say I had Joe the plumber coming to my house man fuck he was awesome dude everybody should go to Joe that's how it works okay so money being made unethically is short money it will come and it will go and you will be broke that is reality you cannot make money and by the way life is long so it's very important that you do this the right way because if you don't you will be in and out and everybody will know you're a full of shit scammer whether and I'm not talking about just on the internet I'm talking about real life real people dude there there was people that went to assemble Emily's new office furniture they showed up for one day they assemble one table out of like 17 then they left and they never came back okay so that they will not be in business very long you see what I'm saying they took the whole money to by the way they got paid so we got to make some calls but the point is is that the short money is non-valuable service it's unethical the only way to make money these days is by doing things ethical in the long term that's it that's fucking it and so as long as you're doing that you should have no problem taking the money can I think that like yeah I do want to read this real quick well hold on what the fuck you earned the money you solved the problem dude this is broke thinking well I mean yeah just fucking yeah well so he said go with a thousand mother fuckers like this yeah so he saying that give me the money send to me I will ethically take your money you don't want the money because you think there's something unethical about you bro you're thinking it's fuck I don't even have to read the fuck question it's a good question it's a fair question okay it's a fair question so he just started a a a yard and land service company okay his business partner they just booked their first client she's an elderly widow living off social security and the the quote that they gave it was 500 bucks they felt like that's fair for the work right but he's saying his gut is telling him that he needs to do it for free his business mind says take the 500 and his last side says to do it for 300 or like at some time of discount and he's asking if that like where's the don't do it for a discount do it for free sometimes you're gonna do things for free sometimes there's gonna be things that you do because of the right fucking thing to do okay okay I used to plow fucking driveways when I didn't have any money I'd fucking plow streets and driveways people with fucking old people I do for free every fuck cuz they couldn't fucking do it yeah that's what you do yeah okay if you have a feeling in your gut that says hey I need to you know do something good don't do it as a discount because here's the thing she will tell all even though you did a nice thing she will tell everybody oh Steve and Bob gave me a discount and then you'll be getting asked for a discount from fucking everybody so do it for free or do it for full price when I speak I do it for free or I do it for full price I don't do any negotiating all right because I don't want the fucking deal to be taught I'm not dealing with negotiation all right so that is that is not an ethical problem that is the decision for you to make because you think it's the right thing to do by the way if you do the job and you take the money there's nothing unethical about that there's nothing unethical about that as long as you do the best job that you can and I bet she will still tell everybody hey Joe and Bob did a great job and they did it for a fair price and you know so this this is probably just a lot of times when people start businesses dude it's very very hard for them to ask for the money I don't know what that is but I struggle with it too is it a worth thing I don't know if the servers are proud of it yes it's yes bro it's like well here's here's what it is it goes back to what I was saying in the beginning of the question okay we grow up being told by our families and teachers and fucking everybody we know hey look at that rich motherfucker he's fucking screwing everybody okay so that's shit gets beaten our head and dude honestly that was the case for a long time let me explain why when the advertising world started a hundred years ago and it started you know we had television radio print okay there was no ecosystem for feedback other than word of mouth and word of mouth took years to spread all right so if you and by the way companies figured this out very quickly so what they were able to do is instead of running an an ad that was true they could completely lie and their products weren't what they say they were and really what it came down to is the bigger the promise the more sales so so what's that mean they usually means the bigger the lie the more sales okay but it took people years to figure this out that this was happening so these companies would get really fucking big okay so people that are older than us would look at these rich people and say that guys fucking screwing everybody and that's where that comes from okay then business changed when the internet came around a specifically in social media came around there became a instant feedback mechanism that allowed customers to hold companies accountable for actually doing what they say they will so a lot of you young people you don't really understand that the perception of older people thinking that rich people are fucking evil and bad and this and that and you've heard that your whole life because that was their perspective of how things were marketed all right that's why it really does that does not work now it's complete opposite now yeah so so you bit so here's where we're at you a lot of people have been told that rich people are evil and they steal and they're unethical and they're disinterested and there is a lot of those still but they only stay around for a little bit look at all these motherfuckers on the internet who fucking scam people and look where they are and fucking a year from that all right they're usually fucking gone and if they're not gone yet they're gonna be gone all right so we're in a different era now so all these things that you've been told about wealthy people are actually completely untrue because for the last 25 years there has been accountability there has been a requirement that if you become successful it's because you offer a great service and you saw a great problem and because of that you are handsomely rewarded with money and so now the way the system set up if you are going to become wealthy you have to have done it in a somewhat and probably highly ethical way okay now are there exceptions like under comments oh I know I know there's one yeah okay come back in three years and tell him where the fuck he is all right that is the only long-term way to win apple computer is one of the biggest companies in the world they sell a fucking laptop that's three times four times ten times as much as everybody else's you know why because it's fucking better okay everything's like that now because the market is so transparent the values have have become they they're no longer perceived they're real does this make sense absolutely okay so if apple if apple wasn't that good we would know it would it be sell would you buy for would you buy a three thousand dollar laptop if you bought one that sucked no okay no nobody else would either that's how the fuck it works okay so the best products win that's it and that's how it should be so this idea that you know wealthy people are screwing people know most of those wealthy people have provided way more value than you'll probably ever provide your whole life and so when you try to dog them out for being rich and successful you look like a fucking clown okay because the only way to win in today's economy is to be the real fucking deal all right so that caught this entire perception that your parents and your teachers and people older people have beaten your head is inaccurate now was it accurate when they grew up yes but it's different now okay and it's been long enough to where ninety nine percent of the companies that are alive today that have been alive for the last decade let's say five to ten year minimum let's say ten years they're they want to survive they weren't like that okay so back to the yard mowing if you feeling like in your heart you should do it because it's the right thing do it because it's the right thing it once you're gonna fucking take it you know I'm saying like you're gonna feel good about it you're gonna get some goodwill you know maybe she said maybe she'll tell people that you did it for free but what you want to avoid is the discount situation okay you want to avoid people saying oh it's up for negotiation because they did it for half price for me because that will automatically devalue your services and everybody's eyes if they know it's negotiable you either do a full price or you do it for fucking free and that's it I love it I love it guys we got one more oh let's get a third and final question got another calling by the way how do you know that that lady's not sitting on dude I was thinking bro listen to her it's just fuck right because they've a lot of them that've been smart and they've accumulated you know lots and lots and lots and lots she could be playing you bro right it was your body house for like 20 grand dude just sold it for three and man you know like you don't you never know I you never never never know who's who like if she accepted that price and like cool yeah she probably has a fucking gazillion dollars in the bank bro right you know like I'm being serious it's really like you can't just feel sorry for people you gotta you gotta understand man just because you look at someone you think they don't have any fucking money you you could be very wrong like like when I walk around in my daily life other than me driving a car the fuck the cost of like millions like like if I drove a fucking Honda Accord and you saw me walking around there's no way you could look at me and know that I had money you see what I'm saying it's real bro so like my dad's the same way like when my dad you know like was in business he'd fucking walk around a Harley Davidson shirt and he could afford stuff you know like we used to have this dude that came in the Brentwood store that we all talked about he come in and he was like dude what do we call him I know it was Ellen oyster we call him captain and say no okay and he come in bro like fucking cut off shirt holes in his shorts this guy come in by five six hundred dollars for the shit loaded yeah you can give a fuck he pull out a cash wire like like Scrooge McDuck bro walk the fuck out yeah you can't judge them no and that's a big sales no no do not judge people on how they look do not judge them on what the car they drive and do not judge them on what you think is expensive because you happen to it would be expensive for you okay if you do those three things you will suck at sales you have to present the product ask for a fair value and you will be successful I love it man I love it guys let's get your third and final call and we got one more call in for you guys let's give our boy Josh let's give our boy Josh a call good Josh Josh what's up man hey how's it going good brother this is DJ I got Andy here what's up Josh how you doing brother good how are you we're doing good man you sounded a little happier when you heard 80s voice why wouldn't he be was it was that about he's racist clearly Josh where are you calling it from bro uh Des Moines Iowa all right well he's definitely racist yeah Josh we're displaying bro what's up dude what are you doing I know it has a good you guys are good I'm back on a little bit so I'm a little delayed behind trying to catch what you guys are saying so are you sure you're good are you sure are you sure yeah Andy is still fucking with you I'm sorry Josh what you got um my question is um I'm an entrepreneur um I've been working at a uh for dealership as a technician for 10 years um plus in my ass every day and uh I'll call you to the point where I'm uh doing everything really well um and recently about six months ago my manager approached me about doing a uh special skills uh work uh rebuilding uh transmission and I got here that I uh also learned from he went out on uh paternal leave so when he came back and found out that I was doing uh his line of work um he just turned really spiteful um and just stirring a bunch of drama in the shop and when I uh approached my manager about you know he's being a little vindictive and you know uh causing issues uh they basically told you know we can't do anything unless you know HR needs to be involved so my question is um I've been ignoring him but it's not working very well you know I've just kind of feel like I'm looking over my shoulder a lot you know something when the next you know drama or altercation is gonna happen and I'm kind of wondering uh how much for nerf perspective you know since you know from an entrepreneur how can I uh just kind of you know keep pushing forward keep getting better while I'm feeling like I'm you know trying to dodge bullets at the same time all right let me ask you a couple questions all right buddy yeah all right so can you kick his ass um yes and that's uh why my man hasn't done anything all right so if I if I could if I could do what I need to do I'd be sitting across the middleweight woman getting on that all right brother listen so don't we know that you kick his ass so don't kick his ass don't don't kick his ass all right I was just well I was just so um our man how old are you and 28 okay how old is this dude uh he is 29 okay so you guys bought the same maybe 30 at this point all right have you talk have you talk to one year ahead of me have you have you have you have you have you have you had confront if you confronted him about it in a in a decent way now I have I've approached him or at least the you know attempted to you know with a smile or a sec you know trying to be you know as professional as I can and it just met with um you know a scowl uh what do you say when you do when you when you when you do that what'd you say I just tell when that's it was like hey man you know like I I filled in for you while you're out you know having your kid you were nice before this and now that I've learned you know your specialty you know a line of work and I'm you know obviously I'm not going to you know stop doing that work now that I've learned it now you know it seems like you know you kind of do like I'm stealing your job and you know you're being confronted about it what's he say and he just he just kind of sits there and sares at me with a you know uh gowl on his face and then about an hour after that my man's would come over and ask me why I was father ask you ask you why what you know I was like well he's gonna sorry what yes your man's came over and asked you what why I was bothering him like I was like trying to instigate something got it got it okay so he doesn't listen to the show obviously who the the the vindictive employee co-worker he's definitely a hoe oh you what it sounds like well you know look dude this this is common all right you know a lot of people have scarcity mindset and they believe that if someone else starts to you know learn a skill or step into their territory that it means it's they're threatened by it and and this guy's threatened by your presence and what he probably thinks and you could probably confirm this is that he thinks you're trying to take his job like what you said in the in the uh uh uh what you just said a minute ago so how I would handle this there would be a a couple step way of how I would handle this um one I would grab your manager and I would say hey I would like you to come to me come with me to what's this guy's name uh here's the but here's what I would say I would say hey uh I would ask the manager to hey will you come and kind of just stand by while I talk to we can kind of squash this cancer that's going on back here in the shop um and I would bring him over there and I would say to right in front of your manager I'd say hey brother I don't know what your problem is but it makes me uncomfortable um I'm trying to do the best that I can you know we should be able to work together and we're both great at what we do so instead of us you know having a bad relationship I'd like to have a good relationship or we could be productive and do twice as much work for the company and I would say that right in front of your manager and then we'll see how he reacts and he'll either play ball or he'll smile a fake smile and then he'll go back and do what he was doing before but no matter what because your manager witnessed the conversation there's going to be some sort of accountability if he goes the wrong way with it so that would be my first step you know would just be to to have a witness conversation and dude you need to be very respectful very nice willing to bury the hatchet uh non-confrontational but firm like hey I have to come to work here every day man so do you there's we spend most of our time here we spend as much time as we hear as here as we do with our families there's no reason that we should have this tension or this negative atmosphere it's not good for either one of us my intention is not to to take your job my intention is to help you do your job and have you help me do my job so that we can both do very well and have a conversation like that right in front of your manager and then see what happens if it continues to happen your manager is probably likely to do something about it if he doesn't do something about then you're going to have to just come to terms with that you have to deal with that in the workplace and that's reality and the truth of the matter is is like you know it's not like you can't give it to him back it's not like you can't be fucking more of a smart-ass than he is so sometimes when people won't play along and they won't be cool you have to out uncool them and you have to get in the gutter all right and i don't like doing that but sometimes it's necessary for people to earn respect so those those are sort of the options you have i would definitely attempt to do it the ethical way the right way the nice way but it sounds like you've been doing that it's not happening i would try once more the way that i described and then after that i would either ignore it and just be a grown man and be like this guy's a fucking clown almost like laugh at him for being such a douchebag because nothing nothing really makes bully stop more than people laughing at them for being a bully so unless you're gonna kick his ass that'll definitely stop him but you know that's probably not going to be good for your career um bullies respond well to two things violence or becoming the clown and uh you know i think you can make him the clown other than that dude you know it's it's um you know it's tough it out be be thick skin or find another place to go you know i'm saying yeah no for sure it's uh i was raised you know the trade everyone with respect you know yeah just to see you know like we're all working hard you know i i obviously you know i as far as like that you're you know i outwork him but you know it's you know i always treat people with respect you know it's it's just kind of i understand but remember we're yet i'm opening to see you know that kind of stuff listen just a couple things one just because you treat people with respect doesn't mean they'll treat you with respect okay number two you have to respect yourself also and laying down and let a mother fucker walk all over you is not self-respect so while i and i appreciate the fact that you were raised good you sound like a really good dude i've never met you before i i think that's how you should always behave but there are certain instances in your life where people are gonna not respect the fact that you're respecting them and they're going to disrespect you and those situations cannot be uh ignored because that will diminish your self-worth your self-respect your self-esteem and that is very harmful to you so you you've put enough thought into this already where it was important enough for you to call in the show so that means it's bothering you so that the the the damage to your confidence itself the steam is already happening so you you have to figure out a way to end this and there's certain times in your life where standing up for yourself is very uncomfortable and this sounds like it's one of them for you but i can promise you that once you do and if you do it the right way and it works you're gonna feel really good about yourself i haven't had very few situations in my life that i haven't been able to resolve with that kind of a conversation like hey bro listen i'm on the same fucking team as you do like i'm trying to do good you're trying to do good i'm trying to provide for my family you're trying to provide for your family you're good at what you do i'm good at what i do can't we just work together and help each other be better like wouldn't that make it a lot easier than coming in here every day with a negative attitude like that's i've been able to handle almost every single person that's ever had a problem with me in that same way because dude once they take a step back and realize that you're not going to engage in their bullshit they they they change their tune so and uh you know it's it's biblical bro like you know Jesus says it he says love your enemies and when you love your enemies man they usually end up becoming your friends and uh they ex you know some of these people have been treated so poorly in their lives that they just expect to battle every time someone steps on their toes a little bit or even gets close to them and and real talk dude i'm guilty of that you know i've been i've been treated very poorly by a lot of people throughout my life and so sometimes when people get close to me are even in my i get very aggressive and defensive about it and i've had to learn how to not do that so i can relate to someone kind of like this guy a little bit so i i think you'll be able to resolve it with that kind of conversation and if you can't you're still going to have to stand up for yourself and and instead of going in and and being physical um you know you could do it with your brain by outweating them and out smarting them and just making them feel like an idiot you there yep yeah what do you think you're um you know i think i've kind of already exhausted option one um and you know i've been talking with my significant other you know kind of comes to the conclusion of you know ignoring him and it's just seems like it's not working i'm just got the you know kind of deal with it like you said but i just you know kind of need to hear it from you know bro if he if he's gonna go now though if that's where you are that's where you are bro you know like i'm not i don't want to be an asshole but like if i have to be on to be the biggest mother fucking asshole in the planet i'm gonna outasshole you i promise you that so that's right right that's kind of to come to terms with not yeah i'm terrible about doing that no bro because you've given him chances you've given him chances bro and and this is about respecting yourself man so i understand it's hard for people like you but like dude there's just people out there that are that are that are they're fucked up so um yeah so too far gone you can't do anything to get them back that's right that's right man and that's why punched him in the face sometimes verbally um tensed right now he probably thinks you're a pushover he probably thinks so i could say whatever i want to josh he wouldn't can do shit you know i'm saying well he scared to even come talk to my manager told me that so well but as far as you know him completely motherfucker you get my way and he ain't that fucking scared if he keeps talking shit right right i can tell you this bro i don't deal with that shit you talk shit to my fake say whatever you want to my fucking face but if i catch you running your mouth out there behind my back we're gonna have an issue and i have that policy inside my companies like we're not gonna have cancer here if you want to come to me and sit in my office and tell me i'm a piece of shit i will hear it and i will hear it calmly and we can have a talk but you go out there and i find out you've been doing that you're out so you know i look man i think you know what you got to do and unfortunately um you know it sucks but actually i think after you do it you'll probably i think if you stand up for yourself the sky i'll end up respecting you that's the truth probably become best bro that that usually happens dude every time i've ever had to do this with someone we've ended up getting closer because of it which is the weirdest thing ever so sweet man we'll just we appreciate you brother hoping all works out for you man oh appreciate appreciate you guys take my call all right brother go handle business you'll be good don't beat him up yeah i'll try not to all right brother that's such a crazy thing because they're just like what do you want me to do like want me to promote myself go back to doing the the low level technician shit like to make you feel better it's hard for lower your shot you know look dude i think a lot of people he sounds like a really nice guy there he does and a really well mannered good character man well you got good i got a good i got a good boy but also a good character man stands up for shit when it's fucking wrong yeah okay that's part of having a strong good character strong good character does not mean just being nice all the time it means you know beat tree people really good but match their energy too like if they fuck with you you fuck with them harder yeah and that's part of like that's a carman that's a universal carman yeah and it feels bad when you when you want to be a good man yeah that doesn't feel good you know like like for example just an unrelated example let's say the fucking power went out and you know me i don't like killing animals i'm not an animal i love animals but i can promise you if i had to i would have zero issue killing fucking anything in order to have my family eat you gotta eat bro it wouldn't i wouldn't think twice about it come here baby that it is what it is it is what it is it's called the fucking natural order and as long as we have the luxury of not being in natural order that's fine that i'll be peaceful but when natural order becomes the order we as men have to transform into those kind of men and part of having a strong character is being able to do that and that includes standing up for yourself when people are unreasonable okay and when you pride yourself on being a good man and being nice to people and treating people with respect that's very difficult because you know that it's unnecessary but that guy doesn't and we get in our like there's been a lot of good men killed legitimately killed by people who we projected our goodness onto them there are bad people oh yeah there are evil people there are people that don't give a fuck and don't hold the same value system that you do and you have to be able to understand that and people that don't end up learning very painful lessons you think everybody's is honest as you you think everybody's as real as you you think everybody's as genuine as you you're making a big mistake okay because if you think that the ones that aren't will get close to you and they will hurt you in many different ways so you have to understand this not just be cut because dude i think most of the people listen to show here are very very good people part of you being a good person is being smart enough to recognize when other people aren't and you cannot give them the benefit of the doubt it's dangerous it's dangerous dangerous dangerous to you it's dangerous to your family that's real man that's fucking real man guys Andy that's three that's a beat for the week man yep that's a new one yeah he's for the week for the week baby all right guys don't be a hoe bad bitch who did slow got her own bank row can't fault does it know here shot case closed
