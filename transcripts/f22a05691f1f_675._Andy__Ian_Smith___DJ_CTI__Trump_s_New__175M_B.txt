yeah got a lot of a lot of a lot of stuff going on um first uh you know maybe we could try something just dumbass of the day think that'd be fun all right yeah dumbass the of the day goes to Kamala Harris shocking shocking but watch this dumb shit so this hell I reads Kamala Harris claps along to Porto Reacon protest song before realizing it's about her that's what he did that's not a shocking headline that's what he has it is it's like this lady is a fucking clown all right so let's let's dive into this real quick so vice president Kamala Harris um had an embarrassing fumble during a Friday visit to Puerto Rico where she was spotted clapping along to a protest song against her before an aid translated the lyrics after delivering remarks in the territories capital of San Juan Harris stopped by the neighborhood of Santoris uh to tour the Galloco community center and hear from community leaders Fox News reported a group of protesters holding signs with messages including quote Kamala Harris war criminal shut up shut up this real shit man uh and call in the United States genocide all met the vice president outside the community center along with a a band playing music video captured the hilarious moment where Harris went from smiling and clapping along to dropping her hands when the staff renex her reportedly translated the Spanish lyrics here is the video you know i like the way they protest better than we protest yeah let's see got some soul look at that that's beautiful haha she's like yeah they fucking hate you she's they're saying that you're stupid bitch that's pretty funny so the lyrics it says uh quote we want to know Kamala what did you come here for we want to know what you think of the colony and activists saying a company by percussion instruments they also included the lyrics long live free Palestine and 82 according to the Puerto Rican journalist uh ishtra pachico after Harris seemed to realize what the song was about she nodded and folded her hands in front of her dumbass of the day no doubt could meet me Harris i like the i like the beat though i think that's great i'm but that shit was smooth yeah she was yeah she apparently liked it too yeah she still love the beat yeah little Bob gone it was yeah it wasn't it was definitely a Kamala Harris Bob yeah there's like no real rhythm to that at all but whatever sure it's so funny how these people try to be so like political for the camera and when they mess up it's so fun like it's so good well it just it just highlights how disingenuous they really are yeah they're always it's it's always an action yeah and it's she's like oh like i don't know what what's about it here i'm gonna I'm gonna fucking hate you you know we hate you we hate you that's all we do here man this is great this is great yeah like she couldn't be she fans i know i know like you know you may not know Spanish but like i think the word genocide in spanish looks pretty similar to this genocide in spanish not like genocide in english and she's like that's me Kamala asked genocide um that's me hey look at the guy next to her smiling bro he's like what a dumbass oh this is great oh fuck man all right you guys brought up in it for me me as genocide oh see see say podway what did um what chose gracias see say podway you know what Jill said Jill Biden no i believe she said she love tacos me Gustavo pantalones oh fuck man yeah that's that's great yeah i mean you all right you can't even write that show you can't fuck man that's pretty funny that's great but it is cti so let's get into our cruise all right let's get into a guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to any for sell out calm you guys can find them linked there I put that being said let's get into our first headline that line number one we gotta go over the political on political release this article um kind of uh like um what what's the word pre-adjaculate right it was pre-adjaculatory article i think that's how you say it pre-con yeah yeah this was a pre-come article from political um headline reads first search then seizure how tish james will go after trumps bank accounts and other assets little pre-come um article reads frozen bank accounts a sheriff at the door and maybe even a private plane put up for auction shut up look how fucking like they were foaming at the mouth when they were writing this this this let me see who wrote this let me find the name real quick tarry burglar magee uh erica ordered is her name yeah or their name probably there or their name they then they wrote this article yeah they are fucking idiots them said but but uh you know let's just finish reading this so you ever notice that the dumbest shit comes from people to call them they you know do you think that's because there's so many of them that their dumbness compounds that's what it is plural yeah they can be extra dumb because there's like more of them yeah right yeah they got to split the last two brain cells between two people that's what it is man Donald Trump could soon face any of those scenarios if he can't come up with a roughly half billion dollar bond by next week to stop the enforcement of a civil judgment after a judge found that he and his company committed widespread corporate fault um if Trump can't find an underwriter to guarantee the amount on his behalf and if he fails to persuade a court to give him an 11th hour respite uh while he appeals the verdict New York attorney general tish james can be uh can begin seizing his assets I also love this nickname that they get like erica you're not fucking cool like y'all not fucking be or y'all bf's you know i'm saying it's fucking a tishy talking about the attorney general at least say a real name fuck um but yeah so after this little pre-come article it's funny because you know then this comes out and he was granted a reprieve as uh a pill courts cut 454 million dollar bond due Monday which was today when the show was recorded um by 62 percent so one from 454 millions of 175 um was granted by the appeals court um and i so so yes like 10 days to come up with it and pay it off which you know listen it's still a shit ton of money right yeah um but it is a 62 percent reduction on what he was uh was going to have to pay um by today so uh this is Trump's statement i got a video clip of uh a film responding to this let's let's see what he has to say this is a fling and crime is flourishing all the state and what he's done is such a disservice and should never be allowed to happen again new york state is being battered by his decision so i greatly respect the decision of the billet division and i'll post the $175 million in cash or bonds or security or whatever is necessary uh very quickly within the 10 days and i think the billet division for acting quickly but judge and goren is a disgrace to this country and this should not be allowed to happen thank you very much wait wait wait keep going now that's it oh there's the the second the best part is when he walks off the guy yells hey Trump how are you going to pay it and he goes cash i know shit it's awesome dude you wanted to say cash bitch yeah right it was awesome i mean that's still a shit's on the money bro i you know i've seen a lot of people like like laughing about this like oh look he doesn't have to pay the whole amount and like celebrating it and like dude it's a win it's not a win it's not a win yeah it's not none of this stuff should be happening no um you know and and Trump's right here he's talking about that the states falling apart and this is what i mean how how much of the state's legal resources are going to this at the moment when i mean you've got criminals being let out on the streets yeah and he's got a fight for a 62% reduction and it's still i mean it's close to two hundred million dollars that's that's a fortune that's not that that none of it makes any sense and it's i mean it's all it's all theater but these people have no problem letting the real problems just fester you know as Trump said and look at what they're doing to this guy and it's a big spectacle the media focus is on it it takes everybody's attention away from the real problems and they're just torturing them for for no reason it'll because it will fall apart well i think i think also dude yeah it is going to fall apart but there's a couple other points here too the more they do this the more they push people towards them and and i don't think they understand that i think they think that the same old game of just calling them a racist and calling them of this and calling them of that and saying he's this and that and and persecuting them i think the more they persecute them the more it's helping his cause at this point and then the second thing is this sets a precedent for people like you and me to be completely railroaded by the court system and i think that black communities generally feel that's the case anyway so as they're watching this happen they're starting to be like fuck dude this is what they do to us which is making them rally behind trump too so ultimately i mean these these marks this communist which is what they are are not doing themselves any favors by doing this and i really hope he figures out a way to get that money back honestly like that's that's a lot of fucking money dude and for anybody and and uh you know i see a lot a lot of conservative influencers and shit like laughing like oh you only got to pay 175 motherfuck these shit i'd pay anything right so like dude in court again today dude these these conservative people got to start stop celebrating little wins that aren't wins yeah they're not just because they're giving you something doesn't mean it's a win that's the that's like the the trap of the conservatives i mean we we've become so accustomed to these little tiny victories that were you're losing things in general like in a bigger sense because we celebrate little stuff like having a number one like song and like you know and don't get me wrong like that's not putting down anybody's efforts to you know to speak on things and to and to that but we spend a lot of time celebrating stuff that actually doesn't move the needle in the direction that we need it to go that this is not moving the needle in any direction positively it's stopping the bleeding on on it's certainly not something to celebrate no yeah it's not you should say good good for him i'm glad he got some some of this but you know it's still an injustice is it still an injustice and how do we fix this how do we how do we how do we you know how do we change this how do we get this to stop happening not oh cool he got away with half yeah we you know we we stuck it to him yeah i know you didn't stick it to me yeah yeah all right his lawyer what do you guys uh maybe you think on that what is that i don't know she I bet she smart no looks like how it's turned like that um the alien on american dad well you guys can make fun of her but she's fucking smart oh yeah she's right there she's fucking smart if Trump hired i mean jumping higher me for anything so i'm not yeah I guarantee you can't say that fuck where she wearing though fuck man cool well guys jump in on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think i was that being said let's head over to him let's check him out who's the comments uh today's comment comes from at James allston he says i'm 38 and I remember watching robot jox on cinematics

cool shit man oh well let's get into our second headline let's keep this cruise moving this is gonna be this is a loaded headline all right we got a lot going on in here um maybe even a little anti-domus coming into fruition um but let's start it off nice and easy headline number two um yellow stone star kicked off flight for allegedly refusing to sit next to passenger wearing a mask all right nice and easy let's dive into this a little bit this is actually one of my favorite actors uh you guys watch yellow stone this is uh yeah the old man old man old for you Smith yeah okay um so you see you got kicked off of a flight for you Jay Smith claimed he was kicked off a flight after refusing to sit next to a passenger wearing a face mask the yellow stone actor was stranded in a Houston Texas airport when he shared a story on the Instagram video uh for his half a million followers quote you need to hear this story he captioned the short clip alongside the hashtags uh hashtag cowboy hashtag country hashtag western hashtag yellow stone hashtag yellow stone TV here's the clip you know my social media people tell me that you like me face to face but you know what I can't say face to face what I want I got just got kicked off a plane in uh I'm gonna hell my Houston Texas because I asked told them that I didn't feel comfortable sitting next to somebody with a mask on yeah I've been drinking I've been sitting in the airport for three hours yeah I'm drinking I ain't drunk but they throw me off the plane because I'm drunk because you people won't stand up and tell everybody what bullshit this is I just told them I didn't feel comfortable about sitting next to somebody that had to wear a mask and I'm off the plane yes I never video cuts off there well but I like it hey now for me I love your work bro you're great actually you were definitely drunk but it's all good wrong though you weren't wrong it's all good well we can't get drunk at airport anymore it's the only thing good about the airport I can't stop this was America you could drink beer you could drink beer at 10 a.m. you could drink beer at 6 a.m. bro yeah it's the airport doesn't have time oh yeah you could drink at any time in the airport and that's only good thing about it but it is interesting yeah that they used to kick everybody else off the plane for not wanting to wear a mask so I guess we're still getting kicked off the place yeah we're just getting kicked off you know but it is it's you know despite the fact that he probably his delivery probably wasn't great on the airplane so there's probably you take that fucking mask off yeah I'm sure that like it wasn't just like he's like hey I don't feel comfortable guaranteed but he's not wrong I mean it's you know you're wearing a mask because there's something that you're afraid of spreading and I have to sit next to you and that's okay but when I didn't want to be afraid of getting something too but the point is the mask doesn't work no it doesn't it doesn't work at all but the fact that there's there still exists the double standard I mean I fly a lot and you know I flew all during COVID and it was you know if you're not wearing the mask you're off the plane and now it's please respect the opinions of those around you they say if they choose to wear a face mask oh so we they say oh that's yeah that's on that's on every flight it says you know thank you for flying American you know blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah we didn't get that shit no no we didn't get we didn't get respect for our opinions please respect nothing it's no we got fucking arrested please respect the opinions of those who choose to wear a face mask and I laugh every time I hear it and it's like man that's it that's a pretty sensible approach but why'd you guys just come up with that now four years ago you know yeah yeah we could have used that that open well that was the argument years ago if we remember if we get back to like what the argument was about masks the argument was where one if you want if you're afraid stay home there was elderly people you stay home like this was common sense shit and they knew that from the get go because every other pandemic in the history of earth was handled that way vulnerable people stay home I'm you compromised people stay home if you want to wear a mask wear a mask and if you're afraid don't go out and that's but this wasn't about a pandemic this was not about that no and it's interesting you say that because you know you have this and I listen I love for you things are a great actor great man that's really like his character right like like he's a actual fucking cowboy yeah real man and this is not the first time he's you know had to stand on something I think he missed one of the one of the award shows because they're forcing the facts like you have to be vaccinated and he just didn't fucking go and post it to his people told him I hey listen I didn't go they required it to be vaccinated and I'm not so I didn't go good for him you know so awesome guy but but along this this this this covenerator this seems to be but see he's respecting the rule he's respecting their opinions he's saying I'm not gonna go if you don't want me to go that's fine and that that's not what those other people think that's probably one of the most irritating parts about all you know the the post-COVID world is that everything that the the people who didn't want to shut down or be afraid or live in fear and all those things all the all the very logical ideas that we put forth are now public policy and there but there's no hey you guys were right you know it's just no now we respect opinions and it's you know it's like hey that was they don't respect opinions yeah they're pretending to respect opinions because they're policy yes yeah those people do not respect opinions they've already proven themselves what kind of people they are and people don't understand that it's very date you have to pay attention to who how people behave during that time because how people behave during that time is how they will behave again in a time of crisis and those people real talk are not safe to be around those people that didn't let you come to your house or call the cops on you for being in your yard bro those people will turn you in for shape bro they've already proven their point so like they're it you know unless there's a legit like a apology type hey man I really realize how fucked up I was I don't associate with those people anymore now I now I I can have empathy for them because most of them got the vaccine and a lot of them regret it and they are the victims of mass amounts of propaganda but their behavior to me is not necessarily excused you're still responsible well because it's dangerous dude that's why if we get another situation like that those are the people that will fucking turn on you they've already shown that right absolutely in a heartbeat these are the people that'll call you you know when red flag laws yeah come you know come into sort of which is insane because dude we were the people trying to protect them oh yeah you know that they don't understand we weren't just like running around trying to put ourselves through all this shit like we were trying to save you from fucking falling for the the biggest propaganda scheme that's ever existed yeah when I when I protested mask wearing by not wearing a mask on any commercial flight and getting kicked off and banned from airlines I was protesting for your right to wear a mask if you want to just as much as I was protesting for your or my right to not wear a mask if I want to and that's but these people they'll fight you tooth and nail and then on the backside of it you know the sad part is is that how few of those people who acted like that act because there are people who have apologized you know I know some I've had a bunch but it's a very it's a very small minority of people who acted like that everybody else just wants to pretend like that never happened dude and that's that says a lot that says a lot about people's character when it's when it's so clear that you were wrong and now you know I don't I don't bring up the covid stuff very much uh anymore when I'm online you know giving social commentary but every once in a while when I do there's always the inevitable comment like just give it up man just get over it you just get over it and it's like fuck you no not only that no for the amount of shit that you had to go through personally just like dude if here's what people don't understand okay this is how Ian and I became friends he I saw that they were going to close as fucking business and I saw him in frank standing up and I messaged him online I said hey dude I remember exactly what I said I said hey dude don't fucking stop because what you're doing is super fucking important because it's going to give a signal out to the other business owners if you and a few other guys like uh Lou and some of these other guys hadn't stood up us our companies dude it would have been way worse and and dude the amount of bullshit that I watched you go through during that time the amount of abuse that you and I got the amount of shit that these other people got that we became close to dude it's you can't just forget about that and that's what those people don't understand like it was daily fucking abuse all day long worst shit ever canceling name fucking fucking with your business I had people outside my business fucking harassing me dude getting harassed where you go out in public like dude it's it's fundamentally changed my life where like I don't go anywhere anymore like I stayed at home for two fucking years and now I don't really do shit because it's changed my behavior pattern and a lot of people say that a lot of people like dude on way less social now because of it because dude I couldn't go out and deal with people like yelling at me bro like I'm not that kind of a dude that can deal with that like I can't have someone yell in my face who's then this is you're gonna sound the way it is but who's a physically inferior man like you're not gonna scream my face bro it's not gonna happen yeah no and that's the I think the the the important part of of that is just you know what you said earlier is that this is a type of of behavior that has really really really negative consequences and isn't it's not about COVID or and what they did during COVID it's about the fact that they were so susceptible and receptive to propaganda propaganda exactly to propaganda and that propaganda fundamentally turned them into monsters yeah these people were monsters these you know you look back and they like to laugh about it and stuff but like you had people like Jimmy Kimmel and like saying that and seriously saying that if you get sick and you're an anti-vaxxer the hospital shouldn't help you because I think it's exactly that was bye bye weezy yeah exactly and it and it was very stern saying the same shit and they were they're all veiled in comedy and and stuff like that but it's like they were very serious about that now take away the COVID narrative and put something else in supply put that into right what do we see now what what's the big fear now it's now now everybody's afraid of Islamic terrorism right so you know how long until there's a crisis where people start acting like that towards Muslims you know or whatever it is well I think that I think that's I think that's being engineered right now yeah yeah I mean yeah look at look at how people lose their humanity when I mean look at look at the the incident in Russia right how many how many people online were okay we got it you know I got it you know I got it yeah then we'll touch that there but people lose their humanity and that's the important part is they these people are so susceptible to propaganda and they they're not only not aware of it but it's just like dormant right now well they're unwilling to address that yeah you know what I'm saying and yeah do dormant yeah and dude I could forgive people for real that fell for it if they know they fell for it sure you know what I'm saying because dude it's gonna take unity like this is this is not we can't we can't have a functioning America without majority unity and this was just this that whole operation was geared to fracture unity long term yeah so it's it was geared to manufacture the response and the feeling that we're discussing right now and that's where like both sides have to like have a little bit of grace you know what I'm saying yeah but like dude if if I'm dealing with someone in my life who doesn't think they were wrong I'm they're they're out dude they're out they're out there's forgiveness for people who are who are willing to you know just acknowledge hey like and that it's not the simple it does take a lot but it shows a lot in you saying wow I really was wrong on that one yeah that tells the person you're you're saying that's a lot about your character yeah so that you're not one of these like sleeping monsters yeah that like the next wave of propaganda and the switches get you know get pulled and then you're on to the next thing and you're you lose that humanity once again and now now we're right back in the same same boat with just just different details yeah for sure man yeah so I mean this I feel like this topic you know what what's going on here with with a buddy here I think it opens up a deeper topic because there's also some other stuff that's coming to light right now and we got to go back to September of 2023 when this lawsuit first came down against the FDA court revives doctors lawsuit saying FDA overstepped its authority with anti-Ivermectin campaign you mean where they put a horse and said don't be a horse right right yeah and it wasn't even just that's when they knew when they knew yeah that it was an effective therapeutic for COVID 100 percent you know so there was a federal appeals court Friday this was back in September of 2023 that was filed by three doctors now this lawsuit has been going on it's basically the suing the FDA saying they overstepped their authority they're not doctors though it may be a group of doctors they're not they're not able to speak as a doctor right and we all remember the post that they were putting out um you know you're not a horse things like that right well the lawsuit finally came to a head today or remember what they did for to Rogan for for saying he took it literally put a filter on him and made him yellow yeah they made him yellow yeah and then they drug him in the media for two fucking weeks bro yeah you know um not that I think he gives a fuck because I don't think he does but but but but the facts that they tried who saw that what what what what did that change of their minds yeah what did that change of their actions holy shit man Joe Rogan to look at him like I'm not taking that shit that was supposed to be right yeah you know I'm saying which which further led some more people getting sick and more people dying that's right that's right it's fucked up you know and so that's crimes against humanity bro 100 percent when you don't know when you know there's an effective therapeutic and you know there's an effective treatment schedule and you're not you're you're denying it and you're villainizing people who figured it out like the front line doctors who stood at the capital steps and they put her in jail for 60 days listen dude that's crimes against humanity for the exact reason that you said DJ for every time they did that they discouraged people from finding it for the sake of continuing a state of emergency so they could continue to steal money yeah yeah it was it was it was profit driven lies and those lies have real world consequences to human life yeah you know you're not that's not a small lie to tell that's a that's a lie that could potentially lead to the the end of somebody's life and I'm sure in many cases did and it was it was purely by profit it wasn't mistake no none of none of this was mistaken again going back you know this is all stuff that's people who pushed back against the COVID narrative said and it was black and white true back then and you know now we are three years out in this article here you know um but there's more articles like this all the time I think there there was another all these court cases are winning now but they quietly win well this one won today yeah you know there this blood on its hands FDA loses battle against cybermectin agrees to remove COVID related anti drug social media post that's it and yeah exactly look and agrees to remove COVID blood on its hands is the is the the first words of the article and the the punishment is that they agreed to remove COVID related anti drug social media it says post but it's propaganda right that's that's it for for lying to people about an effective treatment that would have potentially saved you know stop the government stop the societal shutdown that in some cases lasted in schools for two years fucking years man they needed the transfer of wealth to happen yeah that's right they need to steal the money they needed to happen um you know why don't we go look at the net worth of all the members of congress and all the members of big tech and all the members the owners of these big fucking conglomerate um mega court mega courts versus the net worth of the American people over the last four years that would be exactly what it looks like yeah they were one line trending show on my side yeah show me what happens yeah and that's again but this is the stuff that's so frustrating about it and and why you know I know people like want to move on I get it you know we we went it was every life was all about COVID for years you know and I and and we should in no way live our lives like in that trauma bond like always talking about it but this is the problem here is that the FDA lied to you has blood on its hands quite legitimately um and not just in deaths but in in financial destruction in the the social destruction of young kids all that and all they have to do is take their post out yeah that's bullshit that's yeah that's bullshit imagine if you did something like that imagine imagine if you put out some you know you had some huge platform and you put out something that was not true what would they what what did they do to Alex Jones they find him a billion dollars because because he said whatever he said I don't even know what he said about Sandy hook he said it was a sia but it was fake but but what he said quote unquote wasn't true yeah and he got find a billion dollars in the FDA gets a lot no no take those take those post down that nobody's looking at now anyway not only that no extra people died because of that a shit time of people died because of her yes yeah feelings got hurt versus financial social and and actual human and human life yeah now now it's interesting so so this is a tweet from one of the doctors who's in that lawsuit there was three doctors total um this is dr. Mary tally boedeman who's a medical medical doctor now she was suing them she was part of the lawsuit the FDA so she tweeted this out she says breaking FDA loses its war on ivermectin degrees remove also social media posts and consumer directives regarding ivermectin and covet including its most popular tweet and FDA history this landmark case that's an important precedent in limiting FDA overreach into the doctor patient relationship um she says thank you at boedan gray pllc for your excellent counsel dr. Paul maryk who's another doctor and dr. uh Robert apte who are also in this um so so you know someone call this a win someone call this a loss but but i'll say this and i would like to get some some foreshadowing happening here because you have an interest in theory that i would like to pull out here um you know but we see all of this happening and i feel like there is a decent there has been a a very low call it up whatever you want to call it but if there has been this this this tone of accountability that has been kind of echoed and repeated i'm over the last four years i mean it doesn't stop but there seems to be some movements on the other side of how to combat this and what's going to be the fill safe right now everybody i'm sure by now they have seen i know we didn't really talk about it on cti c here um but we see uh that the princess kate came out with the cancer uh diagnosis okay now and she's received a ton of world support okay um after the princess of whales um has received her cancer diagnosis she's she's got a bunch from everybody um all of the the same people this a lot of the same tyrants hell even Joe Biden at uh from from the from from his account tweeted out uh Jill and i joined millions around the world and praying for your your full recovery princess kate this is Williams wife yes okay right now and you have a very interesting uh theory about cancer and vaccines i don't i don't think it's an interesting theory i think we're seeing a lot of reports of accelerated cancer diagnosis in the data 10,000 of you and what do you think they're going to do with those with those cases they're going to flip this whole narrative uh listen i've been saying this for years there i believe what's happening now and dude listen i know people are gonna get upset when i say this i'm just speculating what i see sure going on i believe what's happening now is they're starting to sort of admit that this they fucked up okay like this in very small doses because if they just came out and said oh we messed up people are gonna be enraged so we're seeing peace by peace by puzzle piece sort of come together that what this was actually about and i believe that eventually like i've said on the show um bunch of times is that their ultimate goal for for sort of showing accountability is to turn the narrative on to trump because trump continues to brag about operation warp speed in his vaccines and all the shit and he's very tone deaf to to any different and i said this fuck what two three years ago that they were going to blame it on him and i mean here we got a headline right here that says was trump's operation warp speed a success yeah well where Alex staff the co-founder of the institute for progress has a similar team devoted to analyzing and applying the lessons of the pandemic institute has published papers arguing that operation warp speed was a success that it should be duplicated for greater investment in indoor filtration and for better bio surveillance um and of course that's one of the downfalls of trump he i mean bro he'll take that shit and and it makes his ego even better right i'll take that in but here's the problem okay here here's the issue now well well dude oh like let me finish my little theory here what happens if uh you know a whole bunch of big names start coming out and saying oh i got cancer right and then people start to fucking freak the fuck out because they got five six vaccines three vaccines and they're hysterical because they're fucking super afraid again just like they were before and then they direct that fear and say he did it yeah and here's the thing it's not like making up these diagnosis they're right these are real diagnosis now you're seeing i think they just put out another article the other day 300 percent increase in myocarditis my that's just myocarditis yes you adjusted myocarditis but let's talk about cancer because this article comes out today what's your risk of cancer figure show 40 percent of americans will develop disease in their lifetimes after princess kate shock diagnosis these tables reveal men and women's risk of every type of tumor uh the shock announcement and uh that the princess of wells again going right back to the princess here um it seems like they're using her to be that steadfasts at first influence are almost right for this campaign um but data suggests that nearly 40 percent of americans will develop the disease in their lifetime while one in five diagnosed will die from the illness now that's just americans right but you know it's not like the vaccines were exclusive to the us that's interesting because i also was able to find this article uh from a few days ago global cancer phenomenon it's not just america the uk japan south africa and australia are among dozens of countries suffering mystery spikes of all different kinds of tumors in young people all countries with a high vaccine uptake doctors across the world are sounding the alarm over a surging epidemic of young people being diagnosed with cancers more commonly associated with the elderly between 1990 and 2019 compare it to now cases of cancer in young people across the globe have increased by 79 percent and deaths have risen 28 percent gives new meaning to that bill gates shit that he said about we can reduce the population effectively with the proper use of vaccines hmm and here's the chart where my head goes right away immediately that talkie gave immediately you know and then here's their estimate it shows a graph um and it's interesting because the article also alludes you know they they put this date studies project diagnosis will continue to rise by 31 percent and deaths will rise by 21 percent in 2030 there's always this fixation about 2030 the great reset well i mean they could accurately predict that if they actually made chemicals and and and put things in food a new cost cancer and how much it would consume and how long it would take to develop it yeah and so like these are real numbers these are real deaths right these are real cancer diagnosis that was a real vaccine so let's just go ahead and put it on the guy who workers shredded all of it that that's what i see happening that's what i see happening and he'll be too ego-tistical to to change trump trump's making a mistake not coming out and saying hey this was wrong yeah what what else we got on this man um so there's a website called the Degel Report um and it's like a military it's like third party kind of military intelligence and analysis and it's uh it's not just some random website you know governments all around the world have have used it for years um for analysis and all sorts of stuff and um i think it's been scrubbed but you can still find it on the internet they put out uh united states population projections in 2030 uh they projected a hundred million people living in this country and there these people are like rarely wrong so two thirds of the population have gone yeah yeah now whether that has to do with this or any combination of other things this you know this organization has sort of been right in all of their analysis and they they it's geopolitical analysis wars stuff like that um but they i think they took it down if i remember correctly because people were it's people had stumbled upon it and here's this organization that's almost never wrong projecting that in by the year 2030 we will see a reduction in our population by two thirds and it started to circulate and now it's you know now they they took it off the internet um two thirds two thirds a hundred million i believe i was just trying to pull it up um you mean in the United States in the United States so that that they're estimating by the year 2030 there will be a hundred million people living in this country yeah not more see total see that's that's what we were fighting against that's what people don't understand yeah and then you look at stuff like this in conjunction with everything else that uh that is happening right now in terms of health uh in terms of uh just ability to survive you know um the it financially it's getting harder for people just to make ends meet right when you have less money you tend to live a harder life uh you tend to not have access to the appropriate tools to stay healthy you know it's much much easier to be healthy when you're when you're not struggling financially and now you're pushing most of the middle class um is struggling to keep their head above water and to stay in the middle class you have a huge portion of the middle class slipping into the lower class people making what just a couple of years ago was good money uh and who are now struggling yeah um and you know and and that's that's just one area you see it you know i own uh a testosterone clinic and we see declining fertility rates among men who are in their 20s and so you're you're looking at an increase in sickness and mortality uh in all of these ways cancer myocarditis all of these other things uh financial stress um that that limits your ability to to sort of push back against um mortality and and and you know uh being unhealthy and then you also see this declining fertility rate um alongside of the declining marriage rate alongside of all these other things that would boost that population so not only are we seeing we're seeing a decay in in our ability to reproduce um and to keep our numbers up and at the same time we're seeing a huge limitation on access to proper medical care it's getting more expensive you know and it's it looks like many of these people that are coming across the border got the vaccine i bet you a lot less than the American population it's something about it. I bet you a lot less although in in Latin American countries they're they're typically is a uh a culture of just sort of accepting vaccinations as not that big of a deal so i don't know but the vaccine rollouts in Ecuador were probably not nearly as effective as they were in the United States. Well I think they had zero uh vaccines and Haiti zero. I know that there are some countries with almost none and they had almost no issues with COVID too. No no like we know Haiti for sure because they can reproduce it. Well they can reproduce it. We're gonna be on the barbecue pit. St. Louis barbecue. Yeah. We got good barbecue. Um yeah but you see that fucking clip of that guy walking down the street eating that severed leg. Yeah. Did you see that shit? Yeah that was from a few years ago wasn't it? No this dude well maybe it was but this dude got hit by a train and this fucking guy went and grabbed the leg and went to the other side of the street start eating it. Oh fine. I think pretty sure it was just the other day dude. Oh man. It was pretty crazy. That's why oh. What do you think we taste like? Well raw probably not very good but I bet if you cooked it it'd be alright. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just fucking meat. We're over like the baby bag ribs. What are we doing? I mean probably taste like chicken. I don't know. I'm gonna tell you right now dude. You like white meat knowing you. What? What are you talking about? That's some racist shit. No you're saying chicken. Like you like you like the white meat? You like the dark meat? I like dark meat. Do you? Yeah it's juice here. Oh. Yeah. Black and berry. That's what I've been told. I'm black and the berry. Sweetest juice. Hey I'm talking about chicken. Fucking weirdo. Oh man. I'm telling you right now though dude if this society collapses and I gotta eat I'm eating. Yeah. Hey. I'm with barbecue too. Barbecue junior. Guys jump it on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. Let me say it. Let's get to our third and final headline. Headline number three. This is interesting. We only got to talk about it. We know we we have some criminal issues here in this country. We also got some other threats going on but we it's a constant theme about you know giving criminals a harsh and heavy hand of justice. But let's talk about it. Headline number three reads Russian forces appear to torture Moscow terrorist suspects with one getting electric shocks to genitals. Woo. I think that I like it. I say a lot of loud. I'm becoming a bigger putin fan by the fucking day. I don't see anything wrong with that whatsoever. You know it's like I know that this person probably writing this article like wanted us to be outraged by it. And I showed you that that one tweet where I was that one thread on Twitter where I was going back and forth with this guy who I think you actually put this article up. And he was saying like you know I don't I don't like terrorism as much as the next person but but this is just barbaric. Do and it's like you see the videos. The videos were the videos were ultra disturbing dude. Like I've seen a lot of shit on the internet. Yeah. Like I'm the guy that watches the shit. Talk about what the terrorists did. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Dude. Dude it was terrible. They had they rode down in this and people with a machine. Listen man. There's nothing more barbaric. There was all these people running and they went they did the worst thing possible. They went in like this corner and like 30 or 40 of them went into this corner and a dude saw him and he just fucking stood there and just killed him all bro. It was fucking brutal. Like 130 people have been killed in this attack. It was dude it was disturbing. I've seen a lot of shit on the internet. Like I've seen dudes get their heads cut off and all that shit like I watched that shit because I want to fucking know what the fuck's actually happening. And I grew up watching Broughton.com you remember that. Yeah. You remember consumption junction. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So like so like dude these you know like I've seen some shit but like dude seeing those people panic and while this guy shooting at him rose it was highly disturbing video. Yeah dude it's fucked up man. But that's what's happened to this a little bit. So so harrowing footage appears to show Russian forces torturing suspects in the Moscow concert hall terror attack with one fed his own ear and another rithering in agony from electric shocks to his genitals footage circulated online. A period of show members of the security forces cutting off the ear of one of the suspects in the attack that killed more than 130 people and then stuffing it in his mouth according to the guardian. One of the suspects was later seen in court with a huge bandage covering his ear. Now they're shut shut it cut off his dick and shoved his mouth. Yeah well they do that later. That's when you get to the log. Okay real shit. Another another another appears to show security forces beating suspects with rifle butts and kicking one as he lay in the snow. Photographs posted on telegram also appeared to show one of the suspect suspected terrorists with his pants down and a wire attached to his groin area and a battery and a battery. It was great. Like a 12. I kind of wanted that battery this weekend because I was trying to jump the tank. Maybe that would have worked. Yeah. That was like a little like ATV's battery. Like it was like a little smaller. You know what I'm saying? Sure I probably heard his balls though. I guarantee broke could you imagine like this and bro listen after I'm torching me but just don't don't don't do nothing about balls. That's exactly what they do. Yeah yeah go right for that. That's why they do it as they as they should you know we're we ever seen that movie you ever seen that movie law-abiding citizen. Yeah. Oh that's a great movie. Okay what he does that guy in that movie is what we should do to these people and it should be broadcast on TV. It should be pay-per-view. The money should go to the victims and people and dude we'd have this country cleaned up literally in a fucking week. People watch that three or four times and be like fuck I'm done fuck around. You know what a great movie is. I'll just let it be let it be known as as to how you're going to handle violent criminals. Violent criminals who are that I mean by being a violent criminal is disrespecting the order of society. Yeah right. You know there's there's there's crime in all different aspects when but when you're talking about physically harming and or killing somebody violating someone else's rights right to life. Yes to to to life. Your life should not be respected in any way. It should be disrespected in the in the most brutal way. It should be vulgar. It should make your stomach churn so everybody else who's an asshole criminal and a violent pedophile whatever terrorist like you knows fuck around and find out. Yeah and that's and that's it and and guess what there still will be some who fuck around and find out. Yeah but there's a whole lot who are going to say yeah not for me. Not for many no terrorism. That'll be enough for me. I'm going to go somewhere else and act like this because you know for the big show bro. Oh for sure. Yeah the big show being number one hit for sure. That's we're calling it the big show. I like that. Yeah. Yeah whenever I get to be present big show. Big show. Yeah right there in a white house laundry rose guard straight up toes cut off fingers cut off stuffed your mouth dick cut off. Love it. I thought it was just a segment of box full of like poisonous snakes and just their head on a state like Vladie and Pailer. I think I think they should be kept the life as long as possible though like as they should be kept alive as long as possible. It shouldn't these people shouldn't have the privilege of a of a quick death like lethal injection. No no no no no no no no no no no like we're going to cut your ear off and then you know we're going to let it hear up and then you know what and we're going to we're going to cut your right hand off you know and then we're going to let you heal up for a little bit and then you know maybe we'll hook your balls up to a battery for a little bit you know but we'll make sure you're alive and we'll feed you you know we'll parade you around in front of everybody and then you know maybe the ultimate disrespect is just like we cut your dick off put in your mouth and tape it shut so you choke to death that way in front of everybody. I think like a cheese grade around the balls. Yeah yeah yeah yeah you know like a plane you know just great to match you without if you took away if you if you did an anonymous poll right because people are afraid to say stuff like that they're like oh my god oh my god you look cause you're often feed a tomb yes absolutely if you did an anonymous poll I guarantee a majority of people would be in support of that. Yeah because the majority people are out doing this shit yeah and they're tired of dealing with this. The majority of people are tired of living in fear. For us to reset culture there's going to have to be examples made that's just reality and you know this situation that we're here's what I don't get and the the fucking do-gutters aren't the bleeding hearts. Bro what are what is wrong with you? Have you not seen all these liberal people that agree with you that have been killed or shot or car jacked or fucked with like it's going to be you and people like me and Ian and you guys out here we're trying to save these people from their own doing and it's getting frustrating like now I'm just getting the poor words like let them fucking learn you know how many videos I've seen in the last two years were people who were like so straight up Biden people were like bro there always the victims anyway that what they're all they're always wanted to be in the victims. Yeah well you know what what why do you think that is because they're weak it's not just because they're weak bro it's because they're delusional to the danger around them. Oh yeah they're they look at other people and bro these are not bad people these are people who have great hearts who want the best for everybody who believe that all other people think like they do and they're delusional to the reality that there's criminal minds out here that could they wouldn't piss on you if you're on fucking fire bro they've never dealt with a criminal they've never had a crime happen to them they've never had anything you know they're delusional they've never been a real victim in like they've never seen it dude it's always the same people that fucking say this shit it's people they have never been exposed to the criminal element and the criminal element doesn't care they don't have the same values you have world doesn't care you know that there's a the fundamental truth and this isn't like some black pillow thing but the world isn't like a nice place overall like it's well it would be if we started cheese-grating people's balls off would be it absolutely would be it would be better but you the world is always going to be a dangerous place it always is going to be in these people are so far removed from like actually living because it's like they they've lived this very comfortable modern life forever and they've never they've never seen any type of struggle there's they've never most of these people have never lived through a couple of financial crisis anything where where times get hard and people act crazy so they think that they don't it won't happen to them but what they wind up ushering in by supporting politicians who let criminals off in their streets because we're supposed to be compassionate for people is they usher in an arco tyranny where people like what's the guy's name on the subway the penny yeah people like him Daniel penny Daniel penny people like that man who did the right thing who protected people who went out of this way and and stood in the line but stood in the gap between innocent people and a criminal he gets the full punishment of the law and then we watch all these other guys who are punching cops who are who are attacking people who are hitting old people who are shooting people shooting people who are doing all of these things that is allowed to be total anarchy and and but what now what we've created is is is a system of anarchy tyranny where the regular person is going to going to see more and more chaos in their life around them just in their in their neighborhoods in their cities while the law won't protect them but it will protect those who are doing it who are creating the anarchy well and that's a very dangerous situation but it's a it's a typical play for a government to do because eventually these people are going to beg for more control yeah that's the point out of out of the world economic forum slogan out of chaos comes order that's what we're talking about now this now this makes sense remember how during covid you remember what they did with the criminals oh they let them all out of jail huh see you guys get it yet you understand this is engineer the grocery store but there could be a fucking BLM process of 2000 people listen we had to socially distance order was why I'm talking about them intentionally creating chaos by allowing the violent criminals out of prisons in a number of states in the second to let out tens of thousands yeah if I remember yeah and these are violent criminals yeah these are not these are not coach club criminals these are fucking rape murder kidnapping bad shit this isn't like drug people like oh I sold some weed yeah you know yeah I mean you know and it's funny too like even with the bleeding hearts on that topic right there's just there's a great movie it's called unthinkable it has like Samuel L. Jackson in it it's a fucking tremendous like a dude the movie's fucking amazing it's amazing where Samuel L. Jackson he plays like this high level CIA interrogator right and there's a I've seen that bro where he goes in and cuts his fucking shit off bro yeah but you have the one agent you know that's trying to like oh he has a right stop that he's killed fucking thousands of people no in the movie that guy had three nuclear bombs yeah he's gonna set off yeah and the fucking interrogators were going in there asking him and he's like no fuck you so Samuel Jackson starts cutting off his fucking fingers like it's awesome dude it's a great movie but it just shows that dynamic of like you know these people who who decide to do these things like this this these gentlemen in Russia who are getting exactly what they deserve right like these people exist evil does exist and it has to be handled quickly on top of that and harshly it's not like I see I've already seen a lot of people trying to turn this into some anti-Islamic shit it's not that either motherfucker like bro this has nothing to do listen for that again we have to get back to judging people based upon their actions these four guys are pieces of yes fuck it's not all black people it's not all air this grouping in of all this shit is what's causing a lot of the problems dude look at that guy fuck that guy you're fucking little baby balls you fucking pussy brother things probably exploded bro you know Emily has this thing that she's my fucking I mean she has this thing in the kitchen it's like a you push cheese through it it's like it's got like a cup and then you squeeze it it's like it's like it's full mashed potatoes it's you can like it's like a strings them like a garlic press that's what it is yeah it's a garlic press put that dutch nuts in there that's right I was thinking about that that'd be a good one for this yeah yeah five bro just put each nut in there and fucking oh stomach hurts yeah just thinking about it bro but you know I'm over here thinking of ways to make the show better it's not this show the big show the big show you know the big show at Andy's telling for more for advice and suggestions you know but really this sends a message you know one of the things that bothers me so much is you know I grew up in a country where it was like United States doesn't negotiate with terrorists right and it's like but we sure negotiate with our criminals yeah you know and and we we won't negotiate with terrorists right when it when it means that we can start a war in the Middle East and and make a whole lot of money then we don't want to negotiate with terrorists but back at home domestically we're willing to negotiate with the lowest most scumiest people in this country over the victims of people who are not yet yeah yeah and then you see this and it's like man that that says a lot about Russia and and the way we act it says a lot about us and it portrays utter weakness utter weakness in in in the geopolitical sense people know that they can come to America and commit crime and get away with it and get away with it whether it's petty crime whether it's violent crime it doesn't matter they can discern people they yeah listen yeah it's criminals see it criminals see yeah I can go there and do whatever I want I can cross the border they'll give me some money and guess what if I get in trouble I'm right back out on the streets yeah I bet you people don't behave like that in Russia yeah I'm you know I don't know for sure but if I was a Betty man which I am I'd put a stack of chips on the fact that people don't act like that in Russia people don't come there with a sense of entitlement you know people don't walk around mistreating native Russians just because they're coming from some other country and and yet we whoa that that hurts that's the gulag that hurts we won't show this one yeah I don't think that can go in the show yeah that's the gulag bro that's about to ask that's a broomstick really yeah it's like it's it's it's it's it's infamous for for the gulag actually the conveyor belt of two yeah the strip inmates are stripped beaten and forced to rape one another by brutal guards with their bodies return the relatives with no internal organs that's I mean that's a good start you start there yeah that's a good start it's not what I would do I would go different out I'm being dead serious I'm not fucking around like people think I'm joking I'm not listen dude I'm very well aware of criminal activity yeah I've been around it a number of times and a lot of these motherfuckers do not fucking give a shit you don't understand people most people have never been around a mentally disturbed criminal mind yeah they've never been around it those people are different they're fucked up you should count your blessings that you've never had a deal with someone like that and you don't get it and you guys haven't sympathy and empathy for these people that kill other people or rape girls or boys or kids they deserve zero they deserve the anti of that they deserve severe and harsh punishment and when you look at the world today and you see all the violent crime happening you have to think how do you reset that and people will say we'll enforce the law not really bro because we're at a point now where the criminals are outnumbering the police force by quite a bit and the and the and the and the the the prosecutors ability to what we're prosecute all these prosecutors want because a lot of these prosecutors don't prosecute yes I mean if they if the prosecutors were actually trying if you if you took all the bad ones out and put good ones in they would have a caseload that would that would swamp them for years well dude also a lot of these guys have been put in place by fucking sorrows yeah and they all do the same shit they violent criminals come in they go out you ask the you ask the police officers on the street they're like bro it doesn't matter if we arrest them a hundred times they get the fuck out so you know like how do you reset culture well you have to make an example of people in a very harsh way very quick and say this will not be tolerated ever again starting with this and if you do this this is what happens to you and that that's what I believe now maybe it can be done another way but I actually believe that that's what it's going to take to restore order in society at this point because it's degraded so far yeah so dude did you guys see this canister one shit oh yeah the the her leaving daily wire yeah I saw that I saw that did you see that interview she did with that rabbi yeah I saw that one too that was fun crazy yeah what'd you think of that dude well you know it's um I I've disagreed with Candison a lot of things I've liked her take on a lot of things yeah but one thing I will give her the credit she deserves for is that she's not afraid to ask important questions that's um that do sometimes have ramifications you know if you start asking the wrong questions you you'll know very quickly you know um or excuse me the right questions yeah because they'll be they'll be labeled as the wrong questions by what happens to you and um you know I watch I've watched her interviews and the point of everything that she was trying to make when it comes to the Israeli uh Palestinian conflict is when does it end like when when do we when do we see a resolution to this to this conflict um because right now it just looks like total destruction it looks like the only acceptable terms for this thing being wrapped up is the complete destruction of of Palestine as a uh as a place and as a people and as a people and as a culture as well like it's we're seeing scorched earth policies and again going back to that like that loss of of humanity we have people cheering that on I know a lot of people we have people cheering that on um and at the end of the day no matter what you feel about you know terrorism and this and that there are women and there are children and there are innocent people dying um not a few but a lot and we're talking tens of thousands of thousands of people you know so a big portion of which are children uh I believe it's an overwhelming majority of women and children in non-combatants you know and you you hear this rebuttal while it's war against war is it is it is it war because you know again what do you see that drone footage of them shooting those kids yeah exactly well the evidence so here's what happens the evidence keeps stacking up to where people are now saying I can't ignore this anymore like the initial emotional response of October 7th was like get in there do what you got to do you know but we're in March now and you know now that the emotionality has come down a little bit for some people people are saying well what's this drone footage of you guys blowing up kids what is that war you know and that's the the questions that canister was asking and she started to ask those questions and and immediately she was she was accused of anti-semitism which is well I've been accused of it I was on stop anti-semit they ran a smear campaign against me because I asked the same questions I said how many how many civilians have to die before you defeat Hamas I think that's a fair question yeah you know is it 10,000 is it 20,000 because you're telling me you have to defeat Hamas but the kill count going up is civilians yeah you know yeah I'm sure you're getting some Hamas guys but how many are you getting in comparison to the civilians and at what point does that ratio become absolutely brutal and absurd and inhumane you know we're not saying that that that there isn't collateral damage but you ask these questions and immediately just like you know a couple of years ago if you asked certain questions you were labeled a racist for sure now it's instead and instead of having a debate because I don't think anybody is and I'm sure there you know I don't think anybody asking genuine questions is out to accuse anybody of anything I think it's just asking fair questions and we should be able to ask fair questions with and and receive at least a healthy debate you know if there's a reason and you can convince me of these things then then you should be able to do that if if you're going to blow up women and children you've got to be able to say something other than I'm an anti-Semite if I question you on that yeah you've got to be able to give me something and what we see with with with Candice with with a lot of other people myself included is that that's the only answer we get is that you hate Jewish people and grow I say this shit all the time yeah and here's what I say and this is the truth okay we have a gang of people that run the world okay the world economic forum certain members of certain governments they're not all Jewish but there is a portion of them that are and those Jewish people use anti-Semitism as a shield against all other regular Jews that don't know or really aren't aware of what that is actually going on they're fucking people we know to the left and the right of us all day they're normal fucking people and they use this term anti-Semitic as protection so you cannot criticize the crimes that they do and you know I it's very similar to how you know like you said two years ago if you pointed at a black person and said that's a criminal there's a your fucking racist no I'm saying that's a criminal and in my eyes you know I think that all of this accusing of anti-Semitism which I get for saying just what I just said which doesn't that's not anti-Semitic to say these people are doing crimes oh if you look on the the website stop anti-Semites that round the smear campaign against me they have an anti-Semite of the week and it goes back for years and they'll tell you why each person's anti-Semitic and it's almost anything fits the bill so any any more disagreement with that you can't yeah so they've called everybody from Vivek Ramasway to RFK Jr to myself to like just regular people to Christian Christian people now who are saying Christ is king I saw that is now an anti-Semitic I saw that how the fuck is that from the river to the sea Palestine hold on hold on hold back to the Christ is king I just don't fuck is that hold on so what you're saying is by saying Christ is king that's a dog whistle for anti-Semitism yeah so Christians and what it is is a proclamation of faith yes which in a free country everybody should be able to proclaim their faith it's not saying Christ is king yeah but so hell so but the the people calling these people I'm not saying all Jews I'm saying the people calling these people anti-Semitic for saying that what they're saying is our faith is more important than your faith oh it is that's that's the problem and I think that's where a lot of that frustration and sort of because you do see a lot of you know I call it like low level anti-Semitism sort of on the internet and you and it's I see that too and that's that's it's damaging like it is it's very like when people come on the internet bro and say you're like dude I get this all the time you're a fucking cut pussy because you won't say what it really is no motherfucker you don't understand what it really is it's not the Jews it's criminals who is Barack Obama Jew no okay is but he works along with the Zionist agenda which is the real major issue it's not about Judaism it's about this idea of a of a powerful Jewish quote-unquote Jewish state but what it is it's a Zionist state the the the separation between the two yes but what they do is they they've tied this you know they they've made this this Jewish government now it's a it's a government that's tied into the religion of Judaism and now you can't criticize the government without hating all Jews and that's not true though that's when I criticize the American government I don't hate all Americans and it does and most Americans don't even agree with fucking American government exactly and by the way when you do talk about it a lot of Jewish people come out and be like bro I don't stand with this shit one of the most popular comments on my post yeah it is like and and and you know I always try to pin them up like and make sure they're on the top of the feed because people say like hey I'm Jewish I like or yeah I get a lot of ones that are like hey I'm Israeli so I'm from Israel and they're like we hate what's happening too well a lot of people don't remember is right before October 7th Natan Yahoo was facing get him get out yeah he was wildly unpopular you know and if we remember back to back to 9-11 you know a certain certain president was too and then all of a sudden the whole country is united behind something we forget that Israel it makes it makes had the harshest lockdowns anywhere in the world outside of China they had the highest vaccine uptake so they they put the Israeli people the Israeli government put the Israeli people through the same stuff that we were fighting here except they got it worse so they were just as frustrated with their government as anybody else and and Natan Yahoo was not Natan Yahoo was on his way out he they they were ready to remember when the attack happened and they said this is our 9-11 yeah yeah now it makes a little more sense it makes perfect yeah you know but that's I think that's the important thing but remember we brought that up on the show and I got pissed off about it as I was like this isn't fucking 9-11 parable yeah and then now though seven six months later I'm like oh yes that's what you meant yeah that's why I met first time it's there it was their excuse to do bad things you know because what happened after 9-11 we use that at that doesn't excuse we killed a million Iraqi civilians over the over the course of the Iraq war a million yeah don't think that's like I come back those those fucking sons yeah so dude why do you think all these children are being killed because they understand what those children are going to grow up and be yeah and it's it's not about it you know the the October 7th attack is just like 9-11 in the sense that you know we we went out into the Middle East in in this defensive measure right but how many years were we there what did we actually find what did we actually accomplish all we did was go in there and we destroyed countries we made a whole bunch of people very very rich we spent a whole lot of American tax dollars we sent our boys into the meat grinder most of them came the ones who do come back come back with multiple issues physical mental that pours into the society and we didn't get anything but it it was always we were we were you couldn't you couldn't quite imagine questioning 9-11 right after I mean I was too young to kind of be there but I remember it but like imagine if the internet was around now you were an Islamic sympathizer no you weren't anti-Semitic but it's the same thing the same weapon if it's racist if it's you know you're you love you know homophobic yeah it's all that same thing and and it's immediately when people are doing bad things they cannot defend them in normal conversation so it goes right to what can I call you to distract away from what I'm doing it's I'm gonna turn this around on you instead of answer the questions you know it's you're it no you you you're an anti-Semitic or you're which yours is not fucking true but I think people are like the spell is starting to come off oh yeah you know and it's come off of people you know with the racist thing and this but I think now people are starting to just pick up on that stuff quicker yeah very very very quickly you know people are not afraid to be called these things anymore yeah and not because they are and not because they actually hate Jewish people but because they they know that the questions that they're asking are important the reasonable and they're reasonable and it takes it takes a certain amount of bravery to be like go ahead try to cancel me you know but I still want to know the answer to this question yeah and I give Candace a lot of props for that because you know she had a lot to lose not that you know not that I don't or anybody else doesn't um but she she stayed steadfast and well did you hear what that guy said the interviews speak for themselves yeah I have to say that you know she she's interviewing I don't know what the the rabbis name was she was going back and forth a couple rabbis the one guy's totally unhinged yeah um she asked him she said she said do you feel bad for all the children that are being killed yeah because the they were going back and forth and and she said I just want to know because he was saying it's it's a defensive measure yeah defensive measure and say okay it's a defensive measure let's let's accept that premise for the time let's not you know but she said do you feel bad about the children that are dying and his answer was disgusting it I think he said something along the lines of my heart breaks every day that Hamas makes us killed children yeah and it's just like what yeah that's that's a horrible thing to set yeah and there was no remorse you could see on it's totally like he's like he had to figure out something to say and that was the best he could do yeah and that's it I mean it and I also think anybody with a brain looks at that goes what I think it's important to to mention to like bro criticizing the Israeli government does not mean you're criticizing your friendly neighborhood buddy who happens to be you you know I'm saying like it's I think you get away from the idea this is what I was going to say in earlier this this lumping in of people this identity politics division it's good it's good people it's bad people it's criminals it's non-criminals it's pieces of shit and people who aren't pieces of shit and that's not defined by a racer religion that's defined by the character of the individual and when we start saying it's all black people that are criminals or all white people are fucking colonizers or whatever the fuck they I don't know what they say about us what do they say colonizers yeah all white people eat baloney sandwiches I don't fucking know whatever man all white people are salt all white people are racist right yeah I was gonna keep going yeah I was that was your time you know all Jewish people run the world like that's this shit is not true yeah and like we have to get away from this and start naming motherfucking names yeah what's the names I want to hear your names what's their names say their names instead of saying blacks whites Jews Mexicans Latinos how about their fucking names dude we're talking about criminals yeah we're not talking about an entire group of people dude like it's it's very aggravating because when people generalize like that it's very low IQ shit real talk and that it always it always messes up the integrity of your argument yeah no uh the top of that but the real perpetrators is they they can continue to hide yes the people who what are their names those people were taught like they can they can continue to hide yeah when we keep generalizing because you wind up fighting over low hanging fruit yeah man you know I there is a certain merit to identity groups right you're always gonna have them no matter what but you know I think if if we're going to to unify right and people really want to solve the problems that we have um there's two there's responsibility in two types right when we're having these discussions the internal group the group right so let's let's use Jewish people for example there are fair criticisms to very fair criticisms to the Israeli government to high levels of Zionism to stuff like A-PAC and and how much influence Israeli government has in the US and the yeah these are all very fair criticisms yeah so identifying and being a Jewish person yeah okay you have the responsibility to hold your own people accountable so you can't defend them just because they're Jewish yes you have to say as a Jew this is wrong what what's wrong is wrong and what's right is right and you can't and if you're falling victim to their propaganda then you are a part of what they are doing in some some some some regards so there there has to be a level of discernment between inside of groups right so well that's like black people black people got to be able to say that motherfucker's criminal that's a bad dude stop that dude yes and white people got to say you know what what you know whatever they say that guy actually is racist yes fuck that guy yes exactly yeah and then the other form of responsibility is is from from outside of the group people have to stop generalizing in a way that they know is going to mess up your message yeah because you know if you if you have a problem with what the state of Israel is doing but all you say online is it's the Jews no Jewish people are going to want to hear you yeah in which makes which makes solving the problem impossible yes so there's a responsibility of the group of the people inside the group to be willing to call out their own and hold their own accountable and to not believe the BS just because that's one of your people right you know like and I don't think it's it's it's something that people even do on purpose I think it's well no they feel they feel attacked yes just like when they say who they think is that just like when they say white people are racist I'm like bra I'm a fucking what the fuck are you talking about yeah most white people are like bullshit except for the carons that live in the fucking mcmatchens oh I'm going about let me let me let me lick your toes now and make up for it fuck out of you my sign in the yard yeah right yeah so you I mean and people need to have that responsible form of dialogue and and sort of discernment and a lot of the problems and we could end a lot of this stuff today I agree there comes a responsibility in the in what we say and how we how we communicate with people you really want to solve anti-semitism if you really want to solve you know uh whatever other bullshit there is racism against blacks or whites or this there there needs to be responsibility on on both sides of of each problem and we can have good discussions about this stuff but calling calling Candace Owens and anti-semit because she wants to know when Palestinian children will stop being slaughtered is bullshit is absolute bullshit yeah and do real talk if you guys want a country like America to be America and what the fuck it's supposed to be you you're gonna have to understand that we're gonna have to all come together bro we're we're not getting rid of white people we're not getting rid of black people we're not getting rid of Latinos we're not getting rid of Jews we all got to figure out how to fucking get together and have unity so that we can move forward in a productive way and figure out that it's us first then yeah bro and it's not it's that's not when we say us first them it's fucking 600 people up in Washington DC and a few thousand people around the world that have decided that we're peasants we're scum we're gonna eat crickets we're gonna own nothing and like it and uh if we don't you know if we can play in about it we belong in jail and that's that's fucking communism dude and when we look at what's required for us to have unity the minute we start unifying at all what happens another thing right another thing remember when you crane started it started right at the end of covid where covid fucking ended and you crane started right away then the Ukraine shit died down what happened oh the shit in the middle east happened so like dude they they are intentionally keeping us from having difficult conversations and realizing that all of us are pretty much the same we all want the same shit in general we want to be left alone we want to get along we want to be happy we want to pursue some success we don't want to be taxed to death we we want to have a family we we want to live our lives and these people at the top of the fucking world they've decided that we don't deserve that and they've decided that all of us are scum and that the quickest way for them to maintain their power the best way for them to maintain their power is to make us all fight over and over and over again about what we were born as like how low level IQ is it the fight amongst what the pigment in your skin is or what religion you might have or where your genetic DNA comes from in the world it's it's super fucking stupid and it's anti-American it's anti-American dude and if we want this country to ever recover if we want this country to ever be a place where all of our children have a chance to prosper all of us are going to have to check our egos and fucking shake some hands and say hey this is what I think I have nothing against you personally but we got to work together here to solve this problem yeah and dude that's why they killed MLK that's why they kill fucking JFK well they killed JFK over something else but they they the point is anybody who brings unification they fucking kill him why why and then why are they afraid of your voice why do they censor why do they have political correctness why do they have cancel culture why do they have all of these things they have all of these things because they're afraid of you noticing what's going on and speaking your mind and standing up and you're sitting there thinking that you don't matter well if you don't matter then why are they spending trillions of dollars on trying to keep you quiet our voices matter our actions matter how we live matters and if we don't realize that we're falling into this trap when they show us 4,000 videos of black people being the shit out of white people if you don't understand they're trying to create racial tension intentionally and let don't let yourself fall for it okay like you're you're fucking part of the plan yeah we have to get above that we have to rise above that and there are some real problems that need to be solved but that's why we got the big show I think to like a me last little piece on the 2 and he brought they want you to feel like you're alone through the shadows yeah through the censorship they want you to think you're the only person who thinks that who thinks that yeah you know I'm saying so you don't speak out you know but when you do speak out you realize oh shit oh wait you wait so you agree with me too oh you agree with me too yeah the next thing you know it's fucking everybody yeah yeah but that's why the next thing comes every time exactly right what's more divisive in society than anti-semitism it's always been the one thing you cannot fucking talk about yeah above any other shit so so like in my opinion this is their last move before like full out war yeah and and I think I still think this I think this summer's disruption is going to be migrants versus citizens and I think that's intentionally being propagated right now we're seeing that we're seeing the promotion in the media of all of these violent crimes with migrants and against citizens we're seeing all and bro by the way that's those are legitimate gripes but I think they're to the point now we're like they're ready to to send people into a actual conflict here and dude you know if that happens bro I don't think people realize how vulnerable we become as a country if we have internal conflict like that that's where a country like China or a country that doesn't have our interests in mind that's when they come that's when they come and conquer and this is why it's important to realize you know black white Jewish Asian Mexican whatever to fuck you think you are you're actually American bro and we need to get back to that ideology it needs to be American first we're sticking together and we're we're gonna handle business and that's that and that's what needs to come to we have to come together dude we have to or we're gonna fucking lose the country and nobody's gonna win you know we're gonna be we're gonna be fucking you know nobody wants the result of that where you have to like scrounge for survival like it's a third world country is that what you want not it I don't want that shit either man I like my life you have me too but we're headed there quick if we don't wake the fuck up and start getting together this is Americans bro this is not black white red yellow etc this is you are if you are citizens of this country you are fucking American and we need to start putting our fucking flag in that not in the pigment on our skin or whatever whatever where we come from yeah right and that doesn't mean you know that that idea of unification doesn't mean that you can't have your own identity or disagreements yeah and it's like you you can um you cannot agree with with uh lifestyle you can be of different religions of different sort of cultural backgrounds um and not clash that that that is possible you know and you can say for freedom to exist in we have to tolerate things that we're not that aren't for us within within reason yeah for sure not the feeling it doesn't pose a danger to you or in fling on other people's rights yes but the idea of unification you can still like be a proud white person and and but also unify with blacks you don't have to it doesn't have to be like a homogenous thing you can have your identity love your identity be proud of of the things that you are and and and whether that's religious whether that's you know uh genetic whatever and still line up shoulder to shoulder and push back against the actual enemy and the actual enemy is those that small minority of people the world's richest people who are who are shoving all of this division right down right down our throats and we're fighting over low hanging fruit while the the ultimate goal like we were talking about that at the beginning of the um the episode of 2030 and the global reset and all of these things that we all we all are pretty much aware of at this point that continues to get marched forward while we while we have these disagreements over like well well black people commit more crime so I you know black people are the problem or if it's you know it's it's we fight over these issues and yeah there are real issues but we're fighting each other over them when the strings are being pulled by somebody else yeah and what we need to do is we need to focus on who's pulling those strings and how they're doing that how they're manipulating people and making people aware of the ways because we all get manipulated in some sense yeah so I should have been guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think oh that being said let's get to our final segment of the show thumbs up and
