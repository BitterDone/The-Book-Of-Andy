What is up guys? I've got no voice because I'm sick, but this is CTI. So I'm going to save my voice for the CTI. So we're just going to get right into it. We got Andy and DJ. Cruz the internet. There we go. I got my voice. All right. We're good. That's all we need. Oh, we need one of us in operation. Bro, I've been fucking getting my ass beat. Yeah. Yeah. It's something going around, man. I don't know what it is. I mean, I feel like I've been having some like nasal leakage. Yeah. You know. And this isn't nasal stuff though. It's like it's like a whole body shit. Like the whole body. The whole body, especially the wiener. That might be something else. No, maybe we got CTI. Cool, brother. Hey, I just want to remind you guys, you know, we depend on you guys to share the show. We get traffic band throttled. And we don't get the show out there unless you guys share it. So if you get value out of the show, if you think it's something needs to be heard and shared, please share the show. Don't be a hoe. Show the show. All right. Yeah, man. Let's get into it. I wanted to check in with something here. A little Saturday CTI. This is this is a set of. Our schedule got all kind of walkie this kind of wampus. Yeah, word of the day. Kind of wampus. Okay. Where did you get that one? Yeah. Uh, old friend from a few years ago. Yeah. Yeah. Keith Emerson. Good guy. Keith Cowboy Keith. Yeah. Cowboy Keith. Oh, he's just favorite. Yeah. You know, I mean, Keith. Keith the man, bro. Yeah. That was his, uh, that was like his favorite word. Yeah. Kind of wampus. Yeah. That dude's awesome, bro. Yeah. When I first met that guy, I was very confused. Yeah, I'm a black cowboy. Yeah. Yeah. He's just he's just black guy. Where's cowboy hat and like a duster? Yeah. And he like knows everything about self defense and guns and mucking everything, man. Bro, he's like the, uh, he's like the black Chuck Norris. Like the black mr. Miyagi. Yeah, for real, man. I want to fuck with cowboy Keith. And he's like the nicest dude up super nice. He's like super deadly. Yeah. Anyway, cowboy Keith, man. All right. Um, don't get cat a wampus here. Yeah, let's get into it. I wanted to check in with something because I saw something that I think is really, really powerful. But I like to give people flowers when it's due. You know what I'm saying? So let's check in with the head coach of the Tampa Bay Bucket nearest, Todd Bowles. Okay. This guy's awesome. Okay, and he's not big on the radar. Not a lot of people talk about him. You know what I'm saying? But he's been in the news a little bit, right? And I got two clips that I think are fucking amazing. So the first one is the set on which Bucks, Todd Bowles, be wildered over a weather question as team Reddy's for Lions and Dome Stadium. So this reporter, and you guys will hear her the gender of this reporter. And I think that makes my mind a little bit something else. Just a little more gender. Just saying. But let's just watch the clip. Here's the clip. Okay. You're looking forward to our Detroit. The weather has been a factor in some of the playoff games, even for the most prepared teams today. It's 13 and Detroit, which doesn't compare to some of the temperatures we're going to have to. Any special plans to acclimate the team can not only endure, but perform. And that's how Virginia temperature should you face them and Detroit. You do know we play indoors right now, you know, the dough. I don't know. No, nothing planned. We're indoors. Hot dude. We only have to be outside for 20 seconds, getting up the bus going under the thing. So we'll be okay. Bro, she thought she had some bro. You know, she sat at home, made this very question. I'll do. That's a fair. Almost CTIs. That's embarrassing. No, man. One time when I was in second grade, dude, I had a, we got a cursive test. Now they don't teach kids how to write in cursive anymore. And I think what was that? Shut the fuck up. Do they, they don't teach anymore, right? No, they don't. So they give you this cursive test. And like they would have the A and the B. And you're supposed to write your best A and B. And I printed my A and my B. And the teacher made this big deal about it. Like she pulled it up and her name was Mrs. Greer. And she fucking held it up. She's like, in my 40 years of being a teacher, I've never seen something so stupid. And I feel like that's how she must have just felt. Like you're saying, I thought I was doing good. He handled it with class, man. You know, I love it. But there's another clip because they, you know, and I don't know, I really don't know why this is, right? But the NFL with Coach Bella check leaving the Patriots, right? It's like they've been trying to steer up some more race shit. It's kind of what I've been seeing. Like asking the Patriots head coach about, you know, the race relations and all of this stuff. And so he got passed a question as well. Bell check in? No, no, Todd Bolz here. Oh, okay. But how he handled it was absolutely beautiful. So I got the clip for everybody that's watching, listening. You and Mike Tomlin are two of the people like I coaches in league. I wonder what your relationship is like with them and your thoughts on Steve Wilkes joining that whole. I have a very good relationship with Tomlin. We don't look at what color we are when we coach against each other. We just know each other. I have a lot of very good white friends that coach in this league as well. And I don't think it's a big deal as far as us being coaching against each other. I think it's normal. Wilkes got an opportunity to do a good job. Hopefully he does it. And we coach ball. We don't look at color. But you also understand that representation matters too, right? And that when we have aspiring coaches, they see you guys, you know, they see someone that looks like them, they can grow up like them. That has to be something. Well, when you say you see you guys and look like them and grow up like them, means that we're eyeballs to begin with. And I think the minute you guys start stop making a big deal about it, everybody else will as well. Boo! Bro. Instant fan of that guy. I fucking love it, man. He's so fucking accurate. I love it. It was very, very simple, very eloquently stated. You know, he didn't get like, dude, that's how you handle that shit. It doesn't fucking matter. It's always white people saying that shit, too. 100%. It's always white people. Well, but don't you think representation matters? And... Why does it matter? It does it, man. Why does it matter, bro? We're all fucking Americans here. We're all regular people like... Dude, if we want racism to go away, let's stop talking about race. It's irrelevant, dude. You know what I'm saying? Anyway, I mean, bro, that's a fucking great answer. You could tell he's annoyed. He's being classy and he's like being respectful. Yeah. Bro, I mean, he's like, we coach fucking football, man. Like ball, but yeah, we're all here trying to win, like prepare for their weather inside the dome. Yeah. I mean... I don't know. I think, I mean, bro, I think we're getting close to culturally, closer than we have been in a long time, to how race should be viewed in this country. And I think... I think it's how it was like 15 years ago. Yeah, we've already... We like went past it. Yeah, we're too far. Oh, yeah. Right. So I don't fuck with time machines, man. Yeah, bro. It's not a big deal, man. And like, you know, what I think, I mean, we should be able to fuck... I don't know. I just think it's fucking stupid. It is, man. It is. Kudos to Coach Boe's over there, man. Where to handle that? But, yeah, man, let's get into our cruise. See, Bill Tom? He's always the same mother fuckers worried about race too, bro. It's white women. It's white fucking women. Dude, did you see Will? People, bro. Did you see that fucking real? I sent you from Will. Our buddy Will? Yeah, yeah. So our buddy Will, bro. He's been putting up some great cons. Our buddy Will, his Instagram is Will be inspired. All right. Now, he's a black man. Will's black. He's a big black man. I'm just letting you know. No fucker, it is. When he posted this real, bro, that guy is fucking massive. How do you like to get in a fucking fight with that guy? I mean, neither. I remember the first time I met him. You knew him. I met him up there at club fitness at the summer smash. Yeah, yeah. And I'm like, who the fuck is this fucking guy? Big dude. Big dude. Anyway, he posted this. He posted some great content. Amazing content. And it's underrated, bro. He should have a lot more followers than he has. Go follow Will be inspired. But he made a post where it showed like this white girl being like, dear black man. He's like, yeah. I'm going to protect you. And he's like, from what? Yeah. Dude, it's so fucking good. Black man. What's up? Know that you are enough. Who said we weren't? Know that I will always, always, always stand by you. Damn, I thought we left this shit in 2023. Protect you. Shield you. Protect me? I'm good. Know that you are worthy. Now, unfortunately, I saw a lot of videos such as this back in 2023. I thought it was a trend or a thread. Something that would go away. But here we are still going strong. This is my biggest problem with the oppressed victim mindset. What other group are race and men do they talk to like this cobbling baby? Just the way she's talking in general. And the way that I've seen a lot of these like, black man, you're worthy. Black man, you're this, you're that. Like we don't already know that. And any real man regardless of race, don't need women to shield them or protect them for anything. That's our job too. Protect and provide for women. Now, hopefully, I won't see any more of these in my feed. Let's check what's next. Hey, black man. I love you. Damn it. Logging off. It's always white women saying this crazy stupid shit, bro. Yep. What is this? I don't know, man. I mean, you ask me, bro, that's your people. Hey, my people. Let's be real. I am more black than white. That's a fucking fact. Yeah, man, I don't know, man. I don't get it. I don't get it. I'm always the women. Yeah. Like dude, dude, just get along. Like, well, we're on the most and we're about most things. Oh, like bro, like guys, it don't matter if you're black or you're white or you're fucking it. No one gives a fuck. Who's got the biggest dick? That's all that's pretty much it. That's don't make me really care about. Yeah, man. I mean, I'm trying to make points and just fucking fucking hard. You know, it's true. It is what? It's true. What? That's pretty much all we do. What are we about biggest dicks? Yeah. I don't normally think about your dick, bro. Or these guys' dicks. Do you guys think about our dicks? Metaphorically. Yeah. So it seems like you're the only one thinking about dicks. Metaphorically is what I was saying. Okay. Like metaphorically. You know what I'm saying? We're able to communicate telepathically. You know what I'm saying as a man. No. I take back what I was going to say. I was going to say guys are normal and we fucking don't give a shit. And now I'm learning that this dude thinks about our dicks all the time. Okay. On with the show. Fuck. No, but for real, dude. Like no dudes care. No. Dude, don't fucking give a shit, bro. Like it doesn't matter what you look like or where you're from or fucking what ratio. No one cares. It's always the women. Women are the ones that care like what the fuck? Yeah, fucking shit up. Anyway. Yeah. I don't think about your dick, man. It was a metaphorically. You know, like we know who the alpha man is. Like we have these telepathic communications. You know, we've sized up each other. Yeah, it happens. We size it up each other's peepees. Yeah. This might look like DJ. Small red. He says about every white person. He says that every white person has a red rocket. It's the truth. I mean, I'm sure there's like some guys in it. Like dogs have a red rocket. Yeah. That's what they look like. That's what a white dick looks like. Yeah, a little red rocket. All right, man. All with the show. Guys, remember if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to AndyFacela.com. You can find them link there. With that being said, let's get into headline number one, little Andy Dombis action. Take a guess. Michelle Obama. Oh, Michelle Obama could sneak her way into the 2024 presidential race. New York Post columnist warns. Now, this has been circulating around the internet, like wildfire. Everybody's talking about it. But what was that guy's name? Randy Consuela. Yeah, we just talk like he said something about it. I don't know. Over a year ago, he said a lot of things about it. Yeah. Remember, they're going to put Michelle Obama in. They're going to do the same shit to the black communities. They did the last election where they say all this shit. And they got Michelle Obama up there saying it. And dude, people are going to fucking buy it. My guess is it the run Michelle Obama. What qualifies? Nothing. You know what I'm saying? Like the black woman. And that's it. It's going to be Michelle Obama. Yeah, 100%. I believe that the stage is already being set. Where's the Democratic National Convention in 2024? Chicago. Who made a post about it being back in their hometown? They're standing next to each other with the sunset. And they're already trying to paint the nostalgia of Barack when he won in 2008. They are going to try and unify America around Michelle Obama the exact same way that they did with Barack Obama. I think the media is now done with Joe Biden. We're going to turn full guns on him and not allow him to run again. And they're going to put someone in like Michelle Obama. They're going to come in and they're going to say, Michelle Obama is going to unite people. We're going to bring people together. The same way Barack Obama said it. They're going to try to tell you this story now that we do. We're going to heal. And we're going to bring together. And we're going to find common ground. And then they're going to get in. And they're going to finish us the fuck off. That shit is not going to work again. Nobody's going to believe it. But what they will believe is someone like Michelle Obama coming in and sending a message of hope, change, and unity. And every one of you should be fucking cognizant of what is about to happen. Dude, for some reason, I have this gut feeling that it's not newsome. It's Michelle Obama. I believe that Barack Obama is the person that's calling the shots behind all of these moves. He said that before. There's clips of him saying, I wouldn't run or run again. But I wouldn't mind being the guy behind the scenes. So I believe, and I think a lot of people believe that he's running shit anyway. And what better way to stay in power than putting in Michelle Obama and then trying to prop her up as like, you know, the hero for black people and the migrant population. And I don't think he's the guy anyway. I think they're going to try to run Michelle Obama. I've always thought that. These people can't help themselves about the race thing. They're so identity politics driven. Pretty the black woman. Yes. A million percent. Well, that's why Kamala said prediction number three says President Biden withdraws sometime between Super Tuesday and the November election citing health reasons, Biden passes the torch to a replacement candidate named by the Democratic National Committee. Who's been saying that for years? It's going to be Michelle Obama. Yeah, I mean, listen, they're pushing Biden out. Been hearing it up. But that's like, well, I just want to know when you fucks are going to start listening to me. Like, dude, I'm not a moron. I might be, I might be a moron about some things. I'm a little retarded. I'm a little bit. All right. But the truth of the matter is, I'm pretty fucking spot on. I don't miss. They got that don't miss information. That's what it is, baby. That's what it is, man. Let's dive into this. I don't get enough credit, man. I don't get enough credit. You motherfuckers, you go out here and you see this guy's post and that guy's post and they say this shit. And I don't see any of the comments section. Hey, motherfucker, this dude said this way before you. Where's that shit? Where's the respect? Well, the truth is, those guys are listening to the show too. That's how they get something to make the post. It's funny because they'll hear me say something two years ago and they're like, oh, bro, you're fucking crazy. Wow. And then two years later, they're posting and being like, oh, I told you. Yeah, right, right, right. Yeah, you fucking told anybody. Of course. I got receipts, bitch, all of them. That's real, man. Let's dive into this article, man. So this is a Fox News article. New York Post columnist. Yeah, nobody, there's not another single person out here who's been saying that this was going to happen besides me. No, no, we got the receipts. Yeah, we got the receipts. When I said that, when I first started saying that, bro, half of my fuckers were like, bro, you're insane. There's no way. Yeah, no way. Well, there's the receipts. There's like, I don't know, 10 different fucking videos in me saying it. Yeah. That's not even all of them. Not just a few of them. No, it's a real thing, man. It's gone. It's gone to happen. Let's read this article. It was Fox News article reading, New York Post columnist, Cindy Adams warned in a piece published Wednesday that Americans shouldn't be shocked if Michelle Baume quote, sneaks her way into the 2024 race. Quote, plans are to grab Michelle for the Democratic presidency choice. Making the music is Barack, the orchestra leader, Adams wrote quote, the abomas are now nudging to force slow mojo to go. Drop out. It's like who else is there? Adams said President Biden won't debate and said the Obama drum beat has gotten quote unquote louder. A Joe flop out offers probability Michelle could wiggle in. Obama's negotiating to make that happen. She added, Adam cited a recent media appearance by Michelle Obama, the former first lady recently revealed she was quote unquote terrified. Donald Trump might win in 2024 during an interview on Jay Shetty's on purpose podcast. Quote, those are the things that keep me up because you don't have control over them and you wonder where are we in this? Where are our hearts? What's going to happen in this next election? Obama asked quote, I'm terrified about what could possibly happen because our leaders matter who we select, who speaks for us, who holds that bully pulpit affects us in ways that sometimes I think people take for granted. Former President Barack Obama has also voiced concern over Biden's poll numbers. The Washington Post recently reported that President Obama has expressed concern over the structure of Biden's campaign and became quote animated during a discussion about the election with Biden. Quote, Obama has raised questions about the structure of President Biden's re-election campaign discussing the matter directly with Biden and telling the president's aides and allies the campaign needs to be empowered to make decisions without clearing them with the White House, the outlet reported. Andy, what have we got on this? Be Mark, Mark. I'm not gonna call her big Mike. I will. I know. I know. I think she's, I don't know. Obama had eight years. He's had another four years with Joe Biden and he's gonna try to get another eight years with Michelle Obama. That's right, bro. Okay, and we have to ask ourselves, how long are we going to let this crew of people destroy a fucking country? It's the same crew. Like the country is not meant to be run by the same people over and over and over and over again. And this goes for the Clintons, this goes for the Bushes, this goes for the Trumps, this goes for everybody. And I don't even think, like it's kind of an insane idea if we're being honest that someone's wife isn't now qualified because they were a president's wife. That would be like saying, Emily would be qualified to be CEO of first form because I was CEO of first form. That's not, you know what I'm saying? That's probably good. No, she could. Yeah. But just saying that, like, no, that's not, that's not, that's not, no. But that's not a real thing. Yeah. That's like, it's an absurd thought. We're talking about the president of the United States. We're not talking about a small business operation. Right, right. And she's not even supposed to be involved in the operations in the country. So how would she know what to do anyway? Well, it's not about her knowing what to do. They don't care if she knows what to do or not. Or not. Because it won't be her pulling the strings. No, it'll be Barack. And so, dude, we've allowed this man to come in and destroy our country, reinest, instigate racial tensions. You know, before Barack Obama was president, our country didn't have the race issues that we have now. He came in and he ran on hope and change and unity and did everything the opposite of that. And it's very frustrating. Now, now I will say this. I think people understand that we cannot continue to allow the same group anymore. It's a dynasty, bro. Yeah, it's a fucking, this country was not made for that. It's like a royal family, bro, at this point in time. And I do believe that most people of common sense realize that all these people are sort of like the same little gang, right? The Biden's, the Obama's, the Clintons, like, and they're tired of that. Whether or not this works or doesn't work, I would tend to say it's not going to work because I think people have woken up to what's going on. They're going to try and divide people. If she comes in, it will be division around race and it will be division around gender. Okay, so if you don't approve of her becoming a presidential candidate for whatever reason, it's because you hate black people or you hate women. And so they're going to try to divide along the race line and then also the gender line, which really kind of makes sense because what they're trying to do is destroy the household family unit. And if they can create enough division around gender in the presidential race, they can get people to argue within the household. So she's actually the perfect candidate to accomplish what it is they actually trying to do. But she's going to come out, she's going to say hope and unity and change. And they're going to try to get everybody to come together and vote for her thinking that it's going to somehow make things better. And once they get in, like I said in the clips that we just posted, they're going to work to finish us off. And it's very scary, it's very dangerous. I don't think people will fall for it, but I'm not sure. Nothing mind you. My question is, like, and then this is a rhetorical question, but I really want you guys to ask yourself this question, like what are they afraid of? That's what I keep going back to. Why are they so afraid of Trump? What are they so afraid of? We mean, like because these, like that's the best you got is a, you know, a thousand year old man or this woman with zero credibility, with zero, like why are they pushing so hard? Because they're going to with all the race division, like you said, the gender stuff, try to separate us on every single front as possible. What are they so afraid of? And they tell us it's for to protect the democracy, but they know what's going to come. Bro, do we believe that this country should be run by a single family for decades on end? Right? Like when we look at, when we look at Putin, people say, well, Putin's a crazy dictator, blah, blah, blah, because he's been ruling for so long. And Americans, especially left this hate Putin for that. But they're perfectly okay with Joe, yes, with Biden and Obama and Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama running shit for, you know, years and years and years on end. And I could tell you this, if she gets elected, real talk, our country will be destroyed completely. That is, that is, that is 100% certain. We will, the quote unquote, finish the job slogan that Joe Biden is running with. They will finish the job and we will become a communist country. I mean, bro, I don't know, like, like I personally, like, bro, obviously, you know, I don't have the end on the black community or from what I can observe and I make it a point to try and observe black culture for the sake of discussion on the show, it seems to me like black culture has caught on to the fact that these people are not for them. It seems to me that they've caught on to the fact that Obama was never for them and Joe Biden is not for them. And I think they're gonna be smart enough to figure out that they're just trying to play. Like we saw that, we saw that one short. In fact, let's throw that in the show, okay? Were that lady talked about, this is what you get when you vote for someone's color of their skin. She was a black woman. Oh yeah, yeah. So check this out. I got it, yeah. This is what the fuck happens when you vote for skin tone. This is what happens when you vote because there's no damn desperate. You're a woman in office. The only reason why it's slow as Joe, they got his ass as president, is because of that glitch bitch, Kamala. Everybody was so desperate to put a black woman when she ain't black as vice president. And now the whole country fuck the fuck up. The whole country. How the hell you bring in all these illegals? And don't know what the fuck, the fuck? Just for votes, because the dead folks vote and didn't work, we didn't account on to that bullshit. And now y'all will take all of them cheering out of school. Why the fuck did y'all choose Chicago? So now most of them cheering out black children got to sit at home because y'all don't, man y'all getting them out motherfucking nerves. Y'all still know they're doing this shit to mostly my normally black children, but Trump deracens. No, you motherfuckers are racists. I'm getting sick of this shit for real. I'm dead ass serious. Y'all better fix this shit. What about the fucking parents? All those black people that fun and keep the goddamn school open, they sure got to sit the fucking home and they got to figure out what the fuck to do. How the fuck they supposed to work? I'm telling you Joe and Ho, y'all got still fucking go. I'm fixing the March of the United States government. I'm for real, I'm for real, I'm fixing to join motherfucking Trump because ain't no way ho. Ain't no motherfucking way. Fix this shit. Nailed my motherfucking nail. Now I think that's pretty reflective of how people feel right now. I think people are tired of being divided around racial lines. I think people are tired of being manipulated along race. I think people are smarter than vote for this person because they have the same skin tone as you. I think, I don't know, I think people are smarter. But what do you think, bro? Do you think that the black community is just gonna say, okay, well, we're gonna vote for her because she's black? I mean, honestly, I think, I think by and large, the vast majority of black communities in America, they are over it. I think there is gonna be a stronghold of the older generation, older demographic that we'll still probably vote for. And then of course, all of our lovely white liberal bruntler women will most likely vote for her as well. Cause it'll be like a Super PAC, bro. I see her Hillary and fucking Kamala all up their dancing together. You know what I'm saying? I'm trying to force this unification message. But I think ultimately in the long run, it won't work. I'd be interested to see what those polls look like. Does that make sense about them dividing people along race and gender? Yeah, for sure. And then also dividing people along gender inside the household. You know what I'm saying? Like they wanted to... That's what I'm trying to turn the wives against the husband. That's right. Yeah, one other person. If she gets in the race for real, which I think she's gonna, I think we're gonna see that sort of campaign. Yeah, and then just wait for them to announce big mic and bring out the trans issue. You really think she's trans, dude? Yeah, fuck you. Bro, listen, I don't think she really is. There's not one single black woman that I know that does not have a picture of themselves pregnant. Where is hers? Yeah, I mean, I don't know. It's possible. Just saying, listen, it's 2024, and you can't judge. Joan Rivers fucking said that she was trans and then she was dead a week later, a week later. Yeah. So if I ain't here next week, guys, big mic got me. Guys, I said over to Cruz the comments. This is where we find one of your comments on the tube and we bring it in here on this tube and we talk about it. Cruz the comment this week's, Cruz the comment comes. I can't even pronounce this name, but it'll make sense why I can't. This comment reads, made a YouTube account just to post this comment. At dinner tonight, a man walked up and offered to buy me and my wife's dinner from my bison hat and said, quote, personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion. I told him, damn right it is and let him have the hat. Keep up the good work, Andy. We are out here. That's bad ass. That's pretty fucking cool. Yeah. Yeah, I wore my hat all the time. Yeah, that's that's fucking bad ass. Nobody comes. Huh? Nobody comes to me. No one buys you dinner. No. Well, no. That's because racist. Yeah, I'll be at twisted tree. Oh, no. Yeah. No, that's fucking cool. Super cool, bro. That's cool. That's culture, man. That's culture. Yeah, my real recognize is real. You know, it's going to be big too, man. That's fucking awesome. We are done with this shit. We are done with this shit. The people who listen to this show, the people who understand what I talk about when I say personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion. Over the next four years, we will change the culture of this country completely. I could promise you that. There's one thing I know how to do. It's how to get a movement going. I could promise you over the next four years, people who wear this fucking bison hat, people who stand for what we talk about here. We will be the people who restore America to where it needs to actually be. And it makes me very, very proud to hear stories like this already happening when we've only had two gear releases. Yeah. So wait till the shit really gets out there. It's fucking awesome. Yeah, it's fucking super cool. Yeah, guys, we appreciate you guys. Thank you for your comments. Thank you guys for being real ass fans. Keep it up. With that being said, man, let's keep the screws moving. And on over to headline number two, headline number two reads speaking of black women, Fulton County DA, Fannie Willis attempts to squash subpoena related to alleged myths conduct. Now this one's not really shocking, especially her reason of why she's trying to quash it. And we'll take a guess here later with a little drum roll here. Let's dive into this Fox News article reading Georgia prosecutor Fannie Willis is hitting back at allegations that she was engaged in an improper relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, accusing his estranged wife of quote unquote interfering with her prosecution of former president Trump. Willis has been subpoenaed to give a pretrial deposition in the divorce case of Nathan Wade and Jocelyn Wade on January 23. But in a Thursday court filing, the she argued then she argued the subpoena should be quashed. A portion of the filing reads quote defendant Jocelyn Wade has conspired with interested parties in the criminal election interference case to use the civil discovery process to annoy embarrassed and oppress district attorney Willis. Willis's attorney, Seneek Axel, wrote that the attempt to question Willis is quote obstructing an interfering with the ongoing criminal case against crap. So what she saying is what she saying is that she, what she said is, so what she said is, is that good? That she had an affair with this woman's husband and now this woman is divorcing that person and they are having a divorce case and she is being called in as a witness to this case during the discovery process and finds it annoying and embarrassing and oppressive towards her. So yeah, I might have fucked her, but you are interfering with this case, that's why you are doing it. No, no. It goes right along with her refusal to take any sort of responsibility for her actions when she was giving that big presentation at the church. But this woman can do no wrong. And it's insane. That's crazy, man. So the article continues, it says, Andrea Hastings, a lawyer for a Jocelyn Wade told the Associated Press they want to help her, quote, resolve her divorce fairly and privately and that any response to Willis's motion will come in a filing with the court. Trump co-definite Michael Romans lawyer accused Willis and Wade of engaging in an improper relationship and mishandling public money in a court filing last week. Romans lawyer Ashley Merchant did not provide evidence of the alleged relationship between Willis and Wade, but pointed to proof and Wade's divorce case. Merchant alleges that Willis's purported relationship with Wade created a conflict of interest and that she benefited financially from the relationship and the form of lavish vacations the two took using funds, his law firm received from working the case. County records show that Wade has been paid nearly $654,000 in legal fees since January 2022. An amount authorized by the district attorney or Willis in this case. And remember guys, she bypassed all of the regular processes when she assigned this guy as a special prosecutor, right? All the more and all the more money per hour than any of the other prosecutors. And this guy has zero experience in dealing with any type of rico cases at all. And getting it on. Now Willis has neither confirmed nor denied that she was romantically involved with Wade. And her first comments on the matter earlier this week Willis suggested that she and Wade are being scrutinized. Drum roll, please. Because they're black. Oh man, it's great. Quote, they only attacked one. Willis said at the Big Bethel AME church in Atlanta on Sunday, quote, first thing they say, Oh, she's got to play the race card now. But no God, isn't it them that's playing the race card when they only question one? Oh, this is great. This is great. Eddie, what we got to listen, it must be nice to do whatever you want to do and then say the only reason you're mad about it is because I'm black. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like Claudine Gay and Harvard, you know. Oh, well, the only reason that you guys care about me lying about my entire academic record and plagiarizing everything that I've ever done is because I'm black. Like no, it's because you plagiarize everything. Kim Gardner, you guys only kicked me out. I'm like, no, it's because you literally destroyed thousands of lives in this community. And let people walk Scott free. I don't think this shit's flying anymore. It's not. It has no. I don't think people, I don't think people are buying this shit anymore at all. I don't even think black people are buying it. Well no, because bro, like it's the constant beat of like the black people are buying it. White people used to be silent when they said this shit. Like when when black people would say, oh, it's cause of fucking racism, white people would kind of be like, dude, you know, they won't say shit. Now they're like, dude, fuck off. Yeah, I had it up to here with it. Yeah. Hey, buddy, you look here, pal. Yeah. All right. You didn't get fired because you're black. Hey, Buster. You didn't even notice you were black because I don't see color. That's right. I got you. Yeah. I hope this lady loses a job. I hope she goes fucking jail. Dude, I'm just so sick of fucking people deflecting accountability for what they do because of their race. Like shut the fuck up. Yeah. Dude, shut the fuck up. You're either a piece of shit or you aren't. You either are or you fucking aren't and you're fucking raised on shit to do with it. I'm so sick of hearing this shit. I'm so sick when you say, oh, here's the cry of statistics. Oh, you're racist. Yeah. It's fucking math. Well, math is racist. Yeah. Yeah. You see what I'm saying? It's so like, bro, I'm just fucking over. Everybody's over it too. He's over it because they're recognizing the destruction that is creating in the world. And these fucking people who stand up still to this day and say, oh, you're only making a big deal out of it because I'm black. Bitch, you just fucking paid this dude 700 grand. You went on vacations with them. He was with him. He was married to another woman. And now they're getting divorced and you're part of the deal and you're saying it's because you're black. Shut the fuck up. I love that this shit is dying. That's what it is. Yeah, I love that the death rattle for this sort of racial deflection is happening to where people, like, you're just like, okay. Yeah. Nope. To the gallows. This is mad in a country. You're like Jesse Smolette. You know what I'm saying? All these people, it's fucking white people. No, motherfucker, it's you. It's fucking white people. Yeah. I just saw that one lady, they call her the brick lady. Down in Houston, she like tries to say that she got hit in the face with the brick. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Gang attacked her with brick. Raised $47,000. Didn't happen. And now she's going to jail. Or like the countless situations where racial slurs have been scrolled on the bathroom walls at schools. And then it come to find out is a little Ramra bad. It was actually black. It was actually black kids doing it. Well, JJ bad. Here's the reality. And no one wants to say this and people get pissed off when you say it. But criminal element, the shitty element of black culture has figured out that they can get away with a lot of shit by just saying it's racism. And society is done allowing that excuse. And that's a good thing. It's a great thing, man. Great thing. Guys, jump down to the comments below. Let us know what you guys think on this topic. But that being said, let's move to our next segment. Just leaving this here. This is where we post it. Andy can't say nothing about it. You just got to watch it. All right. Just leaving this here. Had my reach watch. Roots star, Lava Burton, stunned to learn. He is descended from a Confederate soldier. That'll look clip for you. Imagine if a white guy reacted like this is a tweet from gummy bear. Imagine if a white guy reacted like Lava Burton does to finding out that his great great-great-grandfather was a white Confederate soldier. Racism is racism, folks. And black on white racism is off the charts. Now tell me again how that reparations thing is going to work. Here's the video from him realises. So again, Lava Burton needs a guy who played Cuchquente, okay, infamous movie Roots. So this is him learning that his great-great-grandfather was actually a white Confederate soldier. Wow. That's him. You are looking at your great-great-grandfather, James Henry Dixon. It's difficult to make out, but that's your biological great-great-grandfather. Now I've fought you five minutes ago. If you told me that I had a white great-great-grandfather. You do, you can fight me, but it's the truth. And nothing you can do about it. What? Cunta! Cunta! Got white ancestors! That's right. What? Yeah. Come on now, Skimp. You know, you took two DNA tests. The two major commercial DNA tests almost never have tested an African-American who was 100% subterranean African. We all have white ancestors. But this is close! That's right, but this is close and by name. Just leaving that there. I didn't think it was that bad. No. Who said there was going to be bad? No, I'm just saying. I didn't think he reacted that bad. No, I mean, you know, I think the more poor he's probably reviewing in his brain all the ignorant shit that he said about fucking white people over the course of his life. Yeah, like the guy who was whipping him kutukinset. No, brother, that was just your great-great-grandfather. I'm shit. That's great. You know, it always works out this way, right? It always works out this way. People are what they hate. You know what I'm saying? They say they hate all this shit and then they find out, oh shit, bro, that's me too. That's you. You know, that's kind of the way God makes the earth. Works a mysterious way. Yeah, man. You know, we're all people. Listen, dude, we're all people. We're not black. We're not white. We're not gay. We're just fucking people, man. And this idea that I just don't think there's a lower IQ idea than judging someone based upon their race, whether that be black people judging white people or white people judging black people. And let's be honest, it's okay for black people to hate on white people. It's been culturally okay for a long time. It's never been okay for white people to hate on black people in my lifetime. You know what I'm saying? And we have to get to a point where none of it's allowed. Like it should not be okay for black culture to talk so much shit on white people openly. And then act like it's not racism. Like, you know what I mean? There's a double standard there that is very prevalent and every fucking white person out here knows that's true. They know it. They might say, well, we deserve it or they might say, well, we were never this or that, whatever. But they know it's true. And it's culturally okay to hate white people to make fun of white people and fucking all this shit, which I'm okay with making fun of white people. White people are pretty fucking weird. Kind of fun to make. Okay. But then we should be able to make fun of black people too. You know what I'm saying? Like who laid? I do like who laid. Great. But I'm just saying, man, I do like great cool. It's fucking great. Yeah, but but also like cream soda. So you should mix it too. Yeah, we'll suicide. Yeah, I end up like Kuntikintae. We'll call that the Kuntikintae. There's this kind of little black and a little white. You like that one, huh? Yeah, yeah. All right, I like that. All right. I'm just tired of the shit, dude. Like it's so stupid. I love it. I love it. Guys, let's keep this cruise moving. We got a line number three. Call it acoustic. You got a little bit of boat. I like it. So cream soda. Great. Do drink. We just made it up. A line number three. A line number three meets Hunter Biden's sugar brother goes scorched earth on coma. He says he's confident Hunter will repay loans. Let's dive into this. Hunter Biden's lawyer is hitting back at House Overside Committee chairman James Comer out of Kentucky, accusing the top Republican of misleading about his closed door deposition Thursday. Following the deposition of Hunter's lawyer Kevin Morris, which is part of the House Republicans, sweeping prohibits of President Biden's family and its past foreign business dealings, coma released a statement expressing concern about the lawyer's financial support for his own client. Comer claimed that Morris's actions raised ethical concerns, noting the millions of dollars the lawyer loaned to Hunter. Quote shortly after meeting Hunter Biden at a Joe Biden campaign event in 2019, Kevin Morris began paying Hunter Biden's tax liability to insulate then presidential candidate Joe Biden from political liability. Kevin Morris admitted he has quote unquote loaned the president's son at least five million dollars. Comer said quote these loans don't have to be repaid until after the next presidential election and the loans may ultimately be forgiven. I continue saying quote since Kevin Morris has kept President Biden's son financially afloat, he's had access to the Biden White House and has spoken to President Biden. He added quote this follows a familiar pattern where Hunter Biden's associates have access to Joe Biden himself as we continue more interviews this month and the next we will continue to follow the facts to understand the full scope of President Biden and his family's corruption. Now article continues saying, coma also released excerpts from the deposition showing Morris was introduced to Hunter Biden by Hollywood producer Lynette Phillips at a Biden campaign event in the winter of 2019 in Los Angeles, California. According to coma, Morris said he began loaning Hunter money which doesn't have to be repaid until 2025 and even bought 1.5 million dollars worth of the president's son's artwork to reduce the loan burden. However, in a statement obtained by Fox News digital Morris blasted coma alleging that he misconstrued the testimony quote when I first met Hunter, he was emerging from the lowest point in his life. Morris said quote at that at this time, he had no income and his wife Melissa was five months pregnant, although he was being harassed by paparazzi as well as people coming onto his property and threatening him. He had no security protection quote, I was concerned that Hunter did not have the level of support he needed. He continued quote, I stepped in and have done so every since I have worked hard to create a life that has allowed me to help my family and friends when they have needed it. I did so with Hunter. Morris added that while he did loan Hunter money, the two consultate counsel on the transactions and that he is quote confident Hunter will repay him. In addition, Morris denied ever believing the president or his administration would give him anything in return for the loans saying his quote only goal was to help a friend and that there is no prohibition against that. I don't buy it. I don't buy it. You meet this guy for the first time and then a few months later you dumped $5 million into him. That's super weird. And then you say that there is no expectations of anything coming from the big guy. What do they call them? Have there been any, because I haven't really been following this line of the story, has there been any situation? Why would this guy be getting out of access to Biden? Who knows? Who knows? Yeah. I mean, there's not a lot about this guy. He's a high level attorney. I know he's did a couple of big cases in California and stuff. You know, but who knows? What if he's just the middleman piece that's coming through? What if he's getting paid from China? I mean, who knows? Nobody started to really dig in on this guy. But at the end of the day, I don't know one fucking person that will meet somebody after a few months and dump $5 million into him. Oh, that's not real. It's not even real for super wealthy people. Like, I don't give a fuck. Who's that? It's not real things. It's not a real thing. And then on top of that, you give him another 1.5 in cash to buy his artwork, even though he's never been an artist, to lower that. I think the question would be, if we are trying to consider what's going on here, we would have to fill in the gap between what would this guy be getting from his relationship with Joe Biden? Has there been any indication that I'm outside of it? I don't think we've gotten there yet. I don't think we've gotten there yet. I mean, it doesn't make sense, man. Yeah, it's super weird, dude. This is the guy that was like a laughing, smoking that bong on his balcony. Remember? Yeah, this was like a couple of months ago or something. Popper O'Ratsy caught a bunch of going into his house and this guy's just on his fucking balcony ripping the bong. What the fuck, dude? Who cares? I'm just saying, I mean, I hit a bong all the time. That's my preferred way to smoke. Yeah. I don't give a fuck. Yeah. And I don't care if anybody fucking doesn't like it either. I mean, he just seems like a very weird way to go. I like to smoke it out of a bong. Yeah. I mean, I'm a fucking fucking weirdo. Yeah, just don't do crack. Yeah, that's right. I'm never let you do that. But my point is, is that like, you know, there's definitely something weird about some dude stepping in and saying, hey, I'm going to pay your tax liability. And then ultimately, maybe forgive the loan. I mean, the loan's clearly going to be forgiven. Otherwise, it wouldn't even said that. And I don't want nothing. Yeah, there's obviously this, well, this guy must just be a really good dude. No, he's just a great, yeah, that's what it is. Yeah, he's just a great, you know, okay, blowing over, you know, one smoking shame on us, man. Yeah, we should be more over here assuming that there's got to be some ulterior motive. That's, see, we're the problem with the world. We're over here assuming that there has to be some sort of ulterior motive when in reality, this guy's just an amazing human being looking out for this guy who was in an unfortunate situation. We're assholes. Yeah, Andy, listen, I think that's especially me. We should be more like him. I think so. You can send the wire. Oh, I thought you were going to send me a wire. I mean, that's got to be the logical conclusion. That's where the logical conclusion is that we're just assholes. And these guys are just really. This is how we're supposed to treat people is give them $5 million. No questions asked. That's how I look at me. Yeah, man. Hey, look, dude, I will say this, you know, when you have, when you're, when you have successful friends who have means, there's obviously times where those friends might step in and help you. But for someone who just met this dude, right, right, right, right, right. I could see this in a different scenario, like, let's say they were lifelong buddies. And, you know, the guy calls them up and says, hey, man, I'm in a pinch here. Can you help me out? No. And this is what I'll do for you on the back end, right? Like that's a normal, that's a normal friend type situation. I've done that for friends. I've had friends do that for me, okay? Like, to just show up out of nowhere and fucking fork out millions of dollars to fucking, you know, protect this dude out of nowhere, like that's a, I don't know, there's something weird going on. And also, did you notice like when they sat down for that congressional, whatever it was last week, how this guy and Hunter were like legitimately laughing when they got up and walked out of the room, they know something we don't know, bro. They know something we don't know. Yeah, it's just interesting, man, like, my issue is mainstream media. This is the stuff like mainstream. If you guys heard this dialogue and you're like, okay, bare minimum, it needs to be looked into, right? Like, that's a very reasonable common sense response. Mainstream media, they will tell you there's nothing wrong here at all and these guys are just perfect people. But like that does not make sense. It's something's not adding up. And so at the end of the day, let's just clear the air. Put it on the table. What the fuck is going on? Give us the confidence that, okay, these guys are just good dudes. You know what I'm saying? Give us the confidence that nothing happened. What's all the, what's all the, what's all the, I mean, they're legally obligated to tell us why he's doing that. Well, I'm just saying, like, you don't have to tell, like if someone were to come loan me money, they don't have to tell the world why they fucking loan it to me. Yeah, for sure. He adds the president and then there's, you know, a ledger misconduct here about access to this guy who had like, that's where it gets fishy. Like you're in a different scrutiny in that office, bro. Yeah, but they're not, they're not accepting that as reality. They're, they're pretending the liberal, the left liberal mindset around Hunter Biden is not what you just said. It's Joe Biden has a fucked up son that he loves very much. He's, you know, yes, he's got all these problems and yes, he's a liability to Joe and they forgive him for that. You know, and Joe Biden said, you know, he never had anything to do with his son's business. So they leave it at that. But that, well, and that's a lie too. That's come out over and over again. Those are lies. Yeah. So, you know, I mean, do look, eventually it's going to come out. These people are, they're losing, they're losing social momentum. They're losing control of information. They're getting more and more and more heat as time goes by. And eventually this is going to come out. We're going to find out what deal is here. So like, you know, it's just going to take some time. That's, that's reality. And we can speculate all we want. We can say all we want. We can guess all we want. But at the end of the day, we all know that it's, it's not just because this dude's a fucking good dude. Like we all know that they didn't go be the reason. So we're just going to have to wait and see and we'll figure out what deal is. Yeah. Guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. Yeah. Maybe you guys fucking have some ideas. Let us know. Yeah. With that being said, though, that was our final headline. It's time. As always, thumbs up or dumb as fuck. This is where we bring a headline and we talk about it. They get one of those two options. I know Andy likes dogs. I do. So that's what this one's about. All right. This headline reads, rare footage shows South Carolina man wrestling a coyote after it tried to attack his beloved Chihuahua Roxy. Do you think he gave him like, are you shopping? He killed him. He killed the coyote? Big black man. Yeah. Okay. Why do you wrestle if he just shot him? Well, he wrestled him for your let's just dive into it. Okay. So, so this is the moment. A South Carolina man grabbed a coyote by its tail and dumped it in the trash after the wild animal tried to attack his adorched Wawa. Timothy Snipe dressed in a bright red robe and slippers was taking his pint-sized pet Roxy out for a morning bathroom run in his mount pleasant yard on January 12th when disaster struck an aggressive coyote approached Snipe's yard from a wooded area behind the house and set out to terrorize Little Roxy inside revealed quote, she started looking that way and I still couldn't see anything. And then boom, a coyote jumped out of the brush over there and she took off Snipe's head. A very bold and seemingly unafraid Roxy did not flee but instead darted around the wolf-like beast while Snipe frantically tried to intervene in the attack. Here's the video. That's okay, ody. That's not too big. I love this guy's out here in his slippers with his red robe. He's a big ass dude. He does not have a gun on him. No, not right now. Okay. I was gonna say he pulls a gun out of that fucking robe. He's the fucking man. I'll take my shirt out. I know you do. You're fucking paranoid. Yeah, I know. But yeah, so some stories that Snipe heroic to you though. I walk around that property with my fucking shit off. I take my robe out. Bro, when I walk back and forth from the house of the garage, I'm always fucking. Stay strapped, get caught, baby. I've had too much weird shit happen to me. Bro, can't take any of those chances. But Snipe heroically managed to grab the coyote by its neck and then clutched it by the tail as he marched over to the dumpster with Roxy following closely behind. Snipe revealed that the rabid animal bit his leg during the chaos. After the unbelievable rescue, Snipe dropped the animal in a bright blue dumpster sitting in the yard. The coyote didn't give up and tried to force the lid of the trash can bin open while Snipe filled it its attempts. Snipe shot the coyote and then took it to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. The coyote was tested for rabies which results coming back positive a day later. Snipe received several rabies shot to prevent infection in the aftermath of the situation. It's not the first time Poole or Roxy tried to get hit, man. He assessed Snipe previously purchased a bright pink vest with huge metal spikes for the beloved Chihuahua to wear. Quote, we originally got it for the birds, the hawks. The birds used to try to land on her snipeset. Even if another dog or coyote comes and tries to bite it, they bite the spike. The actual material was coyote proof. They can't bite through it. And there's a little Roxy. Go back to the beginning of this video again. I don't see this again. Uh huh. Get on your fucking foot. Get on your fucking foot. I feel like I've heard this before. Like play that part again. I want to hear them. I feel like I've heard this. Oh, you motherfucker. You better not. Oh, you better fucking not. That sounds very similar. Sounds like this. Oh, shit.

But then you fucking drop that clip so I can. I mean, come on, man. Well, that's suck. You know, rabies shots are kind of a big deal. Oh, yeah. You don't have that much time, bro.
