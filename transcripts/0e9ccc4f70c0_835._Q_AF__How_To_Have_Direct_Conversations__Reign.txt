apparently some of the guys down there listen to the show yeah few shout out to the switch you guys stop taking it so easy on people that's right yeah I was told I was too easy on people so we're gonna have some savage shows this week no mercy no mercy straight into the woodchipper fucking everybody well I got three good ones for you all right let's get it going guys any question number one uh Andy I grew up avoiding conflict and difficult conversations because they made me uncomfortable now as a team leader I realized this habit is hold in me back from addressing problems directly how can I build the fortitude to tackle through conversations without fear or avoidance what we got on this well first of all you have to realize that unless you can have conversations direct you're gonna have tremendous limits on how far you can go with your career uh and your life you know a lot of people hide from the difficult conversations which really aren't difficult they're just conversations um because they label them as difficult upfront so it keeps them from wanting to have the conversation it keeps them uh you know procrastinating and then what ends up happening is they end up living in a situation that they are very unhappy with an unfulfilled with and frustrated with uh all because you know for whatever reason they've been conditioned to believe that these kind of conversations are I don't know not worth having and the reality is is we all know the conversations that need to be had we all know uh where we want to go and what we're trying to do and that takes being a clear communicator and direct and if you would stop labeling these things as quote unquote hard or difficult conversations and just see them as conversations that need to be had to progress where you are trying to take your life uh it removes a lot of the resistance that you would normally have to that now how do you get good at that uh first of all you need to reframe like we're talking about here where you say instead of having I need to have a difficult conversation uh you see say hey man I gotta have a conversation with you okay that's the first thing you have to recognize and there's a trade-off on the back end of having that conversation which maybe you know the conversation does cause some anxiety or maybe it is a little bit uncomfortable but there's a there's a flip side to that that comes down the pipe where you get to be way more comfortable so uh it's it's no different than any other hurdle in life it's no different than you know working through any sort of obstacle or difficulty once you get past it there is a better existence on the other side of that so you have to understand that uh and secondly it's practice dude you know when you first do anything it's not comfortable um you know the first time I ever gave a talk in front of people I was scared shitless the first time I ever did anything I wasn't very good at it so if you've been avoiding having these conversations avoiding having these uh you know discussions that need to be had it's going to be uncomfortable in the beginning but the more you do it the easier it gets so you have to muster up that courage in the beginning to make sure that you actually follow through and have these conversations and if you don't dude your relationships gonna suffer you're gonna you're gonna be with someone that you really don't want to be with you're not gonna make as much money as you want to make uh you know think your life may be okay but it's never gonna be great and I think honestly this question and this difficulty is one of the things that uh you know really holds people back the most a lot of people have it yeah for sure dude um I think most people have it you know they don't want to hurt someone's feelings they don't want to be seen a certain way and at some point in time you got to be a little selfish you gotta say hey man this is my life uh I have to say the things that are gonna get gonna get me to where I want to go and you have to quit putting them off for the sake of how other people are gonna react and you have to let them react the way they're gonna react and you have to go and do what you think is right for you and so these are these are difficult things to do uh when you haven't done them and you know it just comes with practice it comes with time and you know I had struggle with this when I was younger when I was you know early in my early in my business life early in my life these things were very hard and and you know as you move through life and you have more situations that you have to address it becomes easier and easier and easier yeah for sure I think a lot of it is is like you said that they they put too much pressure like what the other person is gonna think and like I've been in those situations like you bring it up I fuck I mean they think you bring it up and it's like oh I wasn't that bad yeah we're not bad well and also dude a lot of times we're dealing with people that don't know how to react or are highly emotional or very selfish people who you know only care about themselves you have to remember that like most people are fucking selfish dude so like they don't give a shit whether or not it's hurting you as long as they're getting what they want and you know that's that's a whole different story that's that's a story of not having that person in your vicinity in your network in your life because when you're surrounded by people who don't care how much you suffer for the sake of their you know homeostasis in their life you know that's a problem I've also heard you to say this and I mean I don't know if it applies to this but I've seen you do this in action where you focus on just the intent right like what are we trying to fix the problem like what's the what's the actual problem yeah and that's what you put at the forefront anytime you have to have any I've seen you do this thousands of time yeah is this is this pretty much yeah I mean that's a part of it right dude like you know you're gonna hurt less feelings when you are trying to get the proper outcome for everybody involved right you know a lot of people like I just said are very selfish dude and they want what is best for them no matter what it means to the people around them and those people don't belong in your life but if you have the right people in your life and you're able to deliver a message with the proper intent of you know creating a better circumstance for you and the other party now we're in a situation just having an adult conversation it doesn't need to be painful it doesn't need to be emotional it doesn't need to be this big argument it's just hey look dude this isn't working or this needs to be changed and the outcome on the other side of that is going to be better for everybody 100 percent man I think the other cool like I mean we talk about reasons why people have problems with this this situation too and you know we got put some onus on the person trying to have this conversation if you ain't got your shit together it's kind of hard to have a difficult conversation about somebody else they didn't got their shit together yeah right like I think you said before like you got to hold yourself accountable to hold anybody else accountable yeah and so I mean I think that I feel like that might be another reason where like you know the reason you don't want to have the conversation because you know your shit ain't right well it's definitely a reason in the in the realm of leadership okay a lot of people suck at leading because they know that they're not even leading themselves and if you can't lead yourself you can't lead other people and if you try to lead other people when you're not leading yourselves they're going to see right through it they're not going to respect you and you're going to have a very difficult time and that doesn't matter if it's a leadership situation on a team or in business or in your household you can't hold other people accountable the things that you're not holding yourself accountable to so this is a big you know you're pointing out something that is a big problem for a lot of people it causes them to hesitate to lead and it should you know so to be a good leader you know in all situations you've got to have your shit together as much as you're asking other people to have theirs 100% man well hope that helps let's get to question number two uh Andy I'm a 45 year old teacher who loves my work but after two decades I'm realizing I've neglected my personal aspirations outside the classroom I used to dream of writing a novel but now it feels like too much time has passed and I don't know if I still have it in me how do I reignite that passion and give myself permission to dream again start the reason you still have this vision in this dream in the back of your mind is because you never started it you never went out and chased it what you're experiencing is what most people were experienced at the end of their life about their entire life all right it's a sense of regret it's a sense of missed opportunity it's a sense of oh I should have or I could have but I didn't and there's going to be nothing worse than that at the end of your life and I would say that you experiencing it now is a good thing rather than you figuring that out when you're 80 now to the point of not having enough time we have 80 years basically on this earth so you're not even barely halfway through your time so what are you talking about you don't have time you don't have time to write a fucking novel bro like you could probably write 50 novels between now and the time that you're gonna have and you could be known as one of the greatest writers that ever lived but you're too busy second guess in yourself thinking you don't have time telling yourself all these bullshit excuses that aren't real and because you're doing that it's gonna ultimately create a situation where you're frustrated upset and regretful about your entire existence so my advice to you would be to start most people can't do that most people can't start so sit down pull out your computer open up fucking Microsoft Word and dance your fingers across the keyboard and get whatever it is in your heart in your head down on paper and who knows what you're gonna create you might create the best one of the best literary pieces of all time you might like I said you might be known you might have a whole different career but you're never gonna know that unless you go and that goes for anybody out there that has things they want to do most people don't go and they don't chase their dreams because the people around them tell them shit that just isn't true hey be realistic what do you think you're gonna do become JK Rowling right where you got a great career you need a you know you need to be thankful don't forget where you came from right we hear all this shit every day from a bunch of losers and it gets in our heart in our mind and it caused us to hesitate so your goal here is to realize that we only have one existence we only have one opportunity and you need to ask yourself what are you gonna value at the end of your life are you gonna value the work that you did or you gonna value the things that you created or are you gonna value doing what everybody else expected of you which isn't gonna be that okay I'm just gonna give you a cliff notes it's not gonna be the second thing it's gonna be the first thing all of our value as human beings come from what we contribute and what we create not just in the world but also of ourselves right what do we build ourselves into what do we what do we fix in ourselves what do we overcome you see we live in this victim society where everybody has a sad story about what they couldn't do because of this circumstance but that's not the shit that's gonna fulfill us or make us proud or really make our lives matter at all what's gonna matter is what do we overcome what dream do we accomplish what dream do we chase and not accomplish and what do we learn these are the things that are going to be important as we go who do we help with that who do we teach from our failures how do we help them avoid the same mistakes we've had like these things are the things that ultimately matter dude and uh at the end of the day you have to look yourself in the mirror and say what am I proud of dude what am I what am I thankful that I actually did and you know you're a teacher that's great you're probably helping people you're probably helping people you know overcome and and do all these things but what about you dude you know I'm saying like what is it that and there's a reason that you can't be a teacher and a writer some of the greatest writers that ever wrote anything were teachers they were professors you know consequently some of the worst too but uh you know you can make you be different yeah right yeah bro yeah I want to ask you this man and I don't know if you want to go into the story uh but I'm gonna say this and you you make the decision here right but like you you had an experience where you came to this realization man that you were swimming against the river yeah you know I'm saying yeah and like you said I mean most people don't get that yeah ever yeah but like you got to you got to like live in that purpose right so so uh so I ate a whole bunch of mushrooms yeah like in obscene amount all right and I recommend and that you young guys do that I never did that until I was well into my 40s yeah and but here's the story okay uh at the time I was really struggling with some some depression and some some hard mental struggles I was exhausted all the time um at the time I was trying to sort of fly under the radar like I had become pretty well known especially in the speaking world and the entrepreneur world and I didn't like it I didn't like people knowing everything about me um I was very uncomfortable with it uh I started to withdraw from people and instead of feeling refreshed instead of feeling like oh this feels good it was the opposite I felt exhausted I felt like I was drained all the time and um some of my buddies you know who have gone through depression episodes or struggle with depression or PTSD long story short you know they sort of convinced me to try mushrooms because they had had good success with it in terms of helping with that situation and I accidentally took like way too many like like way way too many all right uh because I didn't know how to how to dose it out right and guys I'm not saying go to drugs okay I know there's a lot of young people that listen here um and I'm not advocating for that just something I was trying to see if it would help me uh and I ended up having this like super crazy life altering reflective vision uh actually like five or six of these visions but the first one that I saw was me and a river and when you're having these these situations or these visions on psychedelics like it's like it's not like you have to be convinced it's not like you have to like when what you're seeing is sort of being downloaded into you and so you understand what the vision means it's not up for it's not like when you're looking at a painting and you're like what's that mean to you what's that mean to you like it's like getting downloaded into you and um like this is what yes I knew exactly what it was telling me and so it showed me in a river and I was swimming upstream okay and and and and like dude I'm like exhausted like I'm barely able to do it right and then it showed me swimming down the river and then in the river there was all these rocks okay and when it showed me swimming up the river the the current was pushing me into the rocks all right but when I started swimming down the river it showed that I could swim around the rocks and what it was telling me was hey bro you're here for a reason you're here to inspire people you're here to help people you could guide yourself around the parts that you don't like but you need to embrace your role in this world as someone that other people learn from you know basically I'm a teacher is what it was saying and like bro and I'm gonna be well known for it and I can't fight that aspect of it because it's inevitable and if I stop fighting it I will feel better and dude I stop fighting it guess what I felt better so and and I say all that to say this dude like we have a purpose here we have a reason here I believe that and I believe that when we fight that we feel bad and when we go with it we feel good and that's what that vision was showing me and I know I want to say this again dude like if you're 20 years old or 25 years old or even 30 this is not something that you should fuck around with because you don't even have the right perspective to understand where you are in life to to develop a understanding of what you need to do so you have to have past perspective to understand these things right otherwise it's just gonna be some hallucinating and you're gonna be like holy shit yeah right yeah no but dude like I just don't want to come across as like you know because I know there's so many young people like dude this is something that I was looking at as an alternative to you know anti-depressants and things like that and and you know I that's what it's all so sometimes we got to fucking just go with what it is we're supposed to do and I believe that we understand who we're supposed to be and we know who we're supposed to be but most of us are afraid to let that out most of us are afraid to become that badass version of ourselves that lives in our heart that nobody knows about and we're too afraid to express because we think we're gonna get laughed at and that version of ourselves is actually what we're here to do and everybody runs and hides and is afraid of it when in reality dude once you go for that you're everything changes your entire life changes the way you see yourself changes the way other people see you changes and your success in all areas of life becomes more fulfilling you know and and you become proud of yourself in a completely different way so yeah I mean it's just you know sometimes you know what you need to do you're just afraid to do it and you got to fucking go yeah I love it man I love it guys Andy let's do our third and final question question number three um happy new year happy new year uh Andy I'm taking major action this year on changing the culture of our company as it is currently toxic um I have constant turnover in my CSR position um and I know it's because of the culture my questions are two parts one how do you transform the culture of a company when bad habits are in place I'm not tolerating the behavior I've been accepting for so long now by standing firm and putting action behind my words by writing employees up letting people go if they don't adopt new behaviors to work as a team but is there anything specific that you would suggest and then uh the second question second part is what's the best advice uh you can give on how to replicate myself um I am drowning in the weeds and can't seem to find the person what they work ethic to fit the standards I need for the job I know the interview process is everything so I've been developing my interviewing skills but do you have any advice on that topic uh this show has been on repeat as I've learned so much thank you god bless well look man um first off teaching culture in your company that's like something that you would hire me to consult on okay and and just so you guys know the MFCO project is launching we're gonna tackle that uh in depth on that show many different times I could do it I could do a week long podcast 24 hours a day on how to do this so it's not something I can answer in a 10 minute answer um but I will tell you this you need to get rid of all the cancer okay when you get cancer in your body what do they do they cut it the fuck out fucking nuke it and I'm gonna tell you this most of the people that you have that are expressing bad behavior bad attitude they're not gonna change and they're not gonna go anywhere because they don't have any options to go anywhere they're really they just don't have the skills they don't have the attitude they're gonna stick with you as long as possible because it's gonna be hard for them to go somewhere else they don't have the options great employees have lots of options shitty bad culture employees don't so that's one thing you have to understand they're not gonna go away without you getting rid of them secondly those people are very likely not going to change no matter what so you have to understand you're not gonna take someone with a cancerous attitude poor work ethic low skill and transform them into a superstar I know you think that that's what happens but it very rarely happens what most of the time happens is that these people go from place to place to place to place to place to place wrecking everybody shit and then blame in the world for why they can't get anywhere and they can't see that is them all right and that's why the same situation or similar situation happens to them over and over and over and over again and every job and every relationship and you know it's a victim entitlement mentality right it's not me it's the world okay so that's the hard thing to change you can't change it's it's a it's a it's a character flaw in the human that very rarely changes so just understand that you will beat your head against the wall and like dude the worst part is is some of these people are highly likeable some of these people are fun to be around but when they get any sort of pressure any sort of stress or any sort of there assigned any sort of project or task or responsibility or duty that they don't like or they don't agree with the way it's done they fuck your whole system up okay so you have to get rid of these people 100% there's no other option because I'm promise you bro you're not good enough to turn them around so understand that uh secondly you have to stop accepting poor performance and poor behavior instantly um I would highly recommend you having an all hands meeting where you lay down what's going to happen and what's not going to happen and you have to mean it and when people violate it you have to fire them or remove them writing up one of these people isn't going to you know change the situation but what will change the situation is if you call everybody and you say hey these are the rules this is what we're doing this is what we're going to stand by here's the value system we're going to operate on and when one of your best people who sells the most shit for your company uh violates that you fire them in front of everybody and everybody knows you ain't fucking around oh shit yeah that's right they fired one of our top performers because they were fucking cultural bad fit what's that tell everybody else that tells everybody else that we better have our fucking uh you know our eyes dot in our teeth crossed and we better come to work and and you know contribute have a good attitude develop high skill and and be a contributing member of the company I'm not going to be here all right so that's a you got to set a standard and stand on it uh which most people have a problem doing you're already having a problem doing I'm writing them up writing them up I'm gonna do shit bro yeah like do you stop school man do you stop speeding because you got a fucking ticket right nobody does right all right so um we have to understand there's gonna be some casualties in this cultural realignment and then you know you have to be clear about what is expected and what is going to be tolerated and how it's going to be enforced and you know what's going to happen when we do the things we're supposed to do uh but dude ultimately man it's about consciously setting what your company stands for with a with a clear message clear value system and holding that line and that's what the culture is going to be and after you do that for so many years and by the way it's going to take years but after you do that for so many years the culture will start living and breathing on its own meaning you won't have to enforce it because it will be enforced by the peers of these people right when when you're good employees you're good team members see what's going on with someone who's who's a bad cultural fit they will just remove that person automatically so uh but dude it's a lifetime commitment and you know the next thing is you got to live that system yourself like if you don't live it it won't be absorbed right people don't do what you tell them to do they do what you do and that's a hard concept for people to understand because just like there's entitlement and the employees there's entitlement in the operators and the owners and the decision makers a lot of a lot of guys who you know they start their own business they get a couple employees and they start thinking well fuck I'm the owner I can do this and I can do that and I can do this uh and you know these are those things are things that you wouldn't allow your employees to do and if that's something that you're doing you're going to halt the progress of your company right there that's why so many companies they make a little bit of progress they get to a certain level the owners making a decent salary everybody else is eating shit and then the company goes backwards and they can't understand right and the reason that it goes backwards is because you're nobody wants to nobody wants to fucking carry all the water while you're out fucking off dude right they want you to be there with them they want you to build the team and the truth of the matter is is most operators of small businesses and most you know quote unquote CEOs um they won't do the work right you know they they want to hire people and dude you see this with these fucking idiots on the internet saying oh you're the owner you don't like these guys coaching these other entrepreneurs who have never built a business you can tell because of the way they say shit oh you're the owner you shouldn't do that you should just hire people to do that you know you you should let them do all the work you don't have to do shit and it's like oh well I could see why you're a fake entrepreneur coach because you're a fucking idiot I would clarify this too what you're saying is you can you can set all the standards you want you can you make them look nice and the lobby and all of that and you can fire as many people that don't hold themselves to that but none of that shit will matter if you as the owner operator is not are not holding this yeah and eventually yes 100% this one's okay but eventually you know when you've done it for 20 years and you've you know like for me I'm the chairman of our board I'm not the fucking CEO anymore do I still come in here every day and bust ass yeah I do because I want everybody to understand that we're all a part of the team we all got a shovel and we all got a fucking dig and that's what the game is I like digging I like building I like creating I love coming to work and doing things with awesome people I'm very blessed and fortunate to go to war with some of the best mother fuckers on the planet and I want to be a part of that but I don't have to and if I didn't show up here I don't think they would fucking stop because they understand that I've put 26 years into this and quite honestly a lot of our people are like bro why don't you just fucking yeah please go yeah like why don't you just go do some shit man like but see they don't understand that I like doing this I love this because I love the people I do it with and I love the mission that we're on and if you want to create an amazing culture you have to love the people that you're doing it with and you have to take pride in their development and you have to want them to win and you have to want to accomplish a mission with them and you know most people aren't willing to do that they have the wrong intent about their business this is like when you ask these people like I can always tell when someone has the wrong intent because I ask them very simply what is the purpose of a business and they will say to make money that's not the purpose of the business the purpose of the business is to solve problems and you get money for solving those problems and so when you understand that and you can operate inside that intent and that mentality here's what we exist for these are the problems we're trying to solve here's our bigger mission and then you can come in and do that with your team the culture is going to follow you but if you if you say hey we're going to change the world and we're going to do all this shit and then you fucking disappear and go on your bass boat you know like bro you're not going to do shit and not only that your company's going to fail all the great people that have potential are going to leave okay which brings me to the second question how do you replicate how do you replicate yourself well are you sure you even want to replicate yourself hmm are you what you want to replicate that's right oh shit that's right so first off you got to build yourself into that yeah what happens if you replicated someone who you know gave good lip service but didn't do the real work who sounded good in front of people but actually didn't execute who says we're going to do these things but then you know hides in the corner and lets everybody else do you don't think that everybody fucking sees that everybody sees that bro have you ever been doing a job outside and you got three or four people around and you could tell the mother fucker it's you know kind of skating out of the work pretending to be busy carrying the trash away instead of digging the fucking hole like you know we all see it dude and they see it too and just because you're the owner of the business doesn't mean they're fucking blind and stupid all right they see you coasting so are you sure that you want to replicate that because the truth of the matter is as if you replicate that your company's going to go out of business okay so the first thing is you need to make sure that you're worth replicating you're doing all the things like we just said for 10 minutes that you expect other people to do at a high level and if you are that and you do want to replicate that the best way to replicate that is to look around see who has the potential see who has the hunger see who has the drive who believes in the big vision and then spend as much time with them as possible I'm talking about inside of work and outside of work okay because creating and replicating yourself is not a nine to 430 job all right it's a total cultural immersion and again most owners don't want to do this they want to clock out and go the fuck home but dude I can tell you this all of my best people in every single company I've ever owned I've spent massive amounts of time with inside and outside the work and I consider those people some of my best friends in the world which creates a better bond which creates a better culture anyway so you have to convert yourself in the mind from I own this company to I'm responsible for these people's success okay and it's not I'm here to make money for me it's I'm here to make sure that these guys make a great living and that these guys can provide for their families and these guys can hit their goals because when you take your intent and you switch it on to them guess what happens they reciprocate and they help build your dreams as well so it's about putting the other people in front of you and then making sure that you follow through on those on those promises and they will follow through on their obligation as well it's a law of reciprocity but ultimately dude you know you got to become a coach you can't just be a quote unquote boss at work it's and I would I would highly recommend that you guys stop calling yourselves the boss and shit like bro you're just a member of the team and your your your responsibilities are no more important than then these guys responsibilities it takes everybody row in the same direction and it takes humility right like yeah you might be the CEO but what's the CEOs role the CEOs role is to make sure that we don't drive the ship into a fucking iceberg and we actually get where we're trying to go and then everybody else behind us is all rowing and they've got enough food and they've got enough water and they've got enough they understand where they got to go and by the way when one of them gets sick and can't row the right way I guess who gets to row you okay so like it's just a it's just a different kind of thinking that most people don't have because they're so engulfed in their own ego and their own importance that they can't understand like bro you're just a part of the team you're you're the fucking you're the coach call on the play to the quarterback and everybody's got an equal responsibility to execute you know what I'm saying business is a team sport bro it really is and just because you happen to be you know the owner of the team doesn't mean that you don't have a responsibility to be a very important part of the team on a day by day basis if you want a great team I love it yeah so it's it's dude it's you know to answer the second part of the question is very simple make sure that you're worth replicating spend a lot of time with them mentor them teach them be there you know they're their uncle right or their big brother that helps them understand not just how to execute in the office but also in life right and a lot of people just won't do that I love it man love it guys ain't it that's a hell of a way to start a Monday man yeah guys all right look we got a CTI tomorrow I'll see you guys tomorrow
