The mother fucking reality guys today we have Q and a F. That's where you submit the questions and we give you the answers now you can submit your questions a few different ways the first way is guys email these questions into ask Andy at Andy for salad.com or you go on YouTube under the Q and a F episodes drop your question in the comments and we'll choose some from there as well now throughout the week we have shows within the show it's not always Q and a tomorrow we'll have CTI at Stanza Cruz the internet that's where we put topics on the screen we speculate on what's going on we talk about what's true what's not true and then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on in the world. Other times throughout the week we might have real talk real talk just five to 20 minutes and we give you some real talk and then sometimes we have 75 hard verses that's where someone who is completed the 75 hard program comes on the show talks about how their life was before how their life is after and how they use the 75 hard program to take control of their life now if you're unfamiliar with 75 hard is the initial phase of the live hard program which can be found for free at episode 208 on the audio feed again that's 208 on the audio feed. There's also a book at Andy for salad.com called the book on mental toughness. You can get that book it's not free but it does go much further in depth than what the podcast does so I has the intention to do that. It has the entire live hard program it has the entire 75 hard book inside of that book it has multiple chapters on mental toughness and a whole lot of extra stuff as well so that book is available Andy for so a dot com with that being said we are the largest show in the world that does not run ads now I do have an ask and ask is very simple one share the show help us grow the show the show makes you think that makes you laugh it gives you new perspective if you learn some valuable skills do us a favor and help us grow the show by sharing it all right we have a saying we say around here goes like don't be a whole show show all right and then also when you see first form in your convenience stores in your grocery stores wherever you buy your stuff look for these first form energy drinks and first form snacks meat sticks protein bars and give us a little support that we want to do it. That goes a long way for us so that's all I ask so that's that what's up what's going on yokeness yeah I'm getting a yeah get back yeah man it's a it's a great day man we got we got got some good questions here really yeah I mean I think so to be determined comment so what you got I got three go ones for you I thought yeah I got three good ones for you man yeah everything good you know yeah man everything is good you know you know stay in focus feel a real focused more focused and I felt in quite a long time feeling good excited about the future you know got a lot of stuff getting ready to launch as you know but you guys don't know really yet but the biggest thing you do know about which is the MFCO project coming back it's going to be on an app and we're going to inform you about that when it drops via email I'm not really going to talk about it on the show I'm not going to go out there and talk about it on social this is for you guys who have supported me for many many many years and you can get that you know through the emails so if you're not on the email list I know most you guys are because you get the and you grams every day go to my site Andy for so calm register for the and you know that you're going to get a lot of time which is a daily email that you're going to get I'm not going to blow you up with a bunch of bullshit every single day 15 fucking emails a day I hate that shit to we're not going to sell your information other people go on there sign up you're going to get valuable information sent to your inbox once a day and then you'll get an email about when we drop that so yeah I'm excited about that bro as you know we've been recording those for quite some time and I'm having fun recording them dude like that it's it's really my wheelhouse to talk about business and success and winning and mindset and the psychology behind winning how you have to think how you have to act and then obviously the techniques of how to win these are the things I enjoy to talk about the most and it energizes me as opposed to talking about the current events which sometimes leave me frustrated as they do you but you know I think it's important that we need you know we need to understand both especially as entrepreneurs you know we have to understand the social environment because if we don't have good soil meaning freedom to plant our seeds in they can't sprout and so in addition to that we need the techniques and you know we have some big problems going on in the world and in this country but the reality is is those problems are solved by each of us individually and like I say do you guys all the time personal excellence is the thing that we need to do is we need to do that and we need to do that and we have to do that. So what is the ultimate rebellion and that includes becoming financially free of the system building things becoming the best possible version of ourselves building creating becoming everything that we were here to be and once we become great our family picks it up when our family picks it up our neighbors pick it up when our neighbors pick it up our community picks it up and the standard of everybody raises and we all have a unique responsibility and an independent responsibility to do that and so we have to do that. So I'm excited to you know sort of merge these two things together that I've done over the last 10 years you know we spent the first five years doing MFCO project we spent the last five doing real AF and I'm really excited to to really show you guys what we have you know cooked up for you it's it's much different than the old MFCO we have a lot of people who have gone on to create eight nine figure businesses that credit that information is going on. So we're going to be bringing those people on you know not your typical internet quote unquote influencers but actual people just like you guys to talk about how they did it what information was the most valuable the things they've learned through their experiences so it's going to be it's going to be cool dude. I'm excited for it. I'm excited to do it bro every time I do it and I know you're usually not there when I do it but these guys are all there and like dude every time I get up they walk out of there I'm like fuck yeah. That was fucking awesome laying down the meat dude it's just no it's just it's just I feel like it's tactical real information that can improve people's lives today and that feels good right. Other time is right for it too yeah we have a lot of young people who have been lied to for their entire school career that's a whole nother thing. That's a whole nother reason for me doing this is I realize that a lot of our young people have been misled and lied to and told things that aren't true and indoctrinated in the ways of thinking that you know and they're figuring it out and now they're like well shit what do I do now. And you know we have parents spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to send their kids to college where they're not even really learning anything from people who have never done anything I'm you know like we got to fix this shit yeah and I'm just excited to do my little part of it you know I'm 100% man well personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion so let's make some some people rebellious today let's do it guys Andy question number one. Andy I'm not even sure where to begin with this question but I'm looking for your opinion on my situation I recently received my yearly performance review which I met or exceeded all expectations was a top performer with top quality results and all year long my manager told me quote I have no items for improvement just keep up the great work. Overall it was a great review however when discussing the merit increase that is supposed to be based on the performance review he gave me a 0% increase to say I was am disappointed in this is an understatement especially when his reasoning is that he wants to give others on the team more in order to raise their salaries as I currently make more than them supposedly truthfully I don't believe anyone else the salary is my business nor do I believe I should be penalized for something that has nothing to do with it. I had an incredible year and I feel I deserved a matching merit increase it should be noted that this is our only opportunity per year to earn an increase so two questions for you Andy if you are in my situation what would you do and then as a business owner what are your thoughts on this and would you ever do this to your top performer thank you in advance for your insight. I just renewers man well look I think that's a fair I like I like the way that that question was asked because clearly this person understands there's two sides to the equation here and they're not being bitter about it yeah that's a perfect the way that that was presented was very professional and I appreciate that so where do we start here okay first of all if you really are the best performing person and they promised you a raise and they didn't give you one that's kind of fucked up that's not that's not indicative of you have been gasoline maybe maybe that's what I'm saying that's not indicative of normal behavior in my opinion I am a big believer that if I ask someone to go do things and they do them and exceed those expectations and rewarding them for that performance. I think most effective businesses feel that way but there could be a couple other things that are playing into this that you may not be aware of from the business owners outside you know profitability could be down there maybe there's not enough money to actually give the raise and maybe he doesn't want to say that to you because he doesn't want you to fucking quit okay maybe he's telling you this excuse which sounds absurd to me so that you don't think that like he's just stiffen you or she's just stiffen you and you know I don't know why they would tell you that because that makes no sense like I'm going to reward people who are less performers than you because they're getting paid not enough well then they should perform yeah okay yeah it's very simple and also your employees life decisions aren't the company's responsibility to reward them for like a lot of people are poor managers of finance and then they equate that to being not paid enough no you're paid appropriately you spend too much fucking money yeah right one of those $300 fucking Jordans do on your feet right you know what I'm saying so there could be a lot of different things going on here what I would do is I would ask to have another meeting for clarification and I would say look and I would have no qualms about having this very direct conversation I would say look I did everything you asked me to do I'd have the proof I'd have the data okay and it's very important that when you go to ask for a raise that you always bring the data all right because a lot of people will just bring you arbitrary shit emotions I did this I did that I well what's the proof yeah where's the proof how much did you drive revenue for your job how much profitability do you have what other things did you do that were in the scope what projects did you complete what projects did you start and complete all of these things have to be written down and tracked otherwise your boss or whoever's making this decision is going to be like well this sounds like bullshit even if they know it's true so it's important for you to track those things I would sit down I'd have the information ready I'd say look I was told this I did this with the expectation of this and this isn't happening and I don't think that's right and I would see what they say and maybe they get you get it a little more transparency on what the decision was made around because it does sound like the decision or the excuse that they're giving you doesn't it sounds like bullshit I'm I just I can't make I can't make sense of that why would you tell someone that you're going to pay the money that you were going to pay them that they earned to other people to get them more productive that makes no sense so that's that sounds like bullshit anything give them the money they'll see that and like they get more productive when I'm talking about absolutely yeah that's the correct move yeah so I would ask for conversation and I would be prepared to walk out of that meeting into another career if you don't get treated or get at least an expectation there might be a situation where the guy says hey look what's the guy's name is he give his name no no name Steve look Steve I love you bro but I got to be honest with you man like this has been the best year we're in a situation now where we really need to fucking get these other guys to perform because I don't have the profitability or the margin to pay you this extra money you know how do you know that the owners even getting paid we you know what I'm saying so there could be a lot of different things happening and I could tell you there's been times in my career where we didn't have enough money to get raises and there were people that deserved and I couldn't afford to give them to them and when those situations happen I'd have a Frank Frank discussion with them and I'd say look here's where I'm at bro and I would be very transparent and I would say what do you suggest that I do here and then that becomes a very productive conversation because usually if that person is really invested like it sounds like this person is they will get on board with with you the owner to help the other people start to perform so that we get a position to give the raise you see so that's what I would do I would have a conversation if it goes well he's probably going to be transparent there's probably going to be a better reason as to why they didn't give you that if it doesn't go well he's probably going to feed you the same line of bullshit and you're going to have to understand that this might be an indication that no matter how hard you work or how much you perform you're going to be capped at your earning potential in that organization which means you have to find a new organization. Okay, so it's a tough position but you know most let me give you the the real way to get paid more money while we're talking about it here's a real way this is the only way the fucking works okay. You have to be so fucking valuable that the company can't afford to let you walk okay that is it because you have to be so valuable that you can literally leverage the company and you giving you more money. No one's going to give you more money no one's going to bless you with riches it's not going to fucking happen. We are one of the few companies that I think pays people more when we start to see it automatically without having them have to ask you know sometimes they do have to ask because we have a lot of employees and not everybody gets the proper recognition but in most cases companies are not like that they will force you to have a conversation to get the money and how many years you've been there doesn't fucking matter how many days you showed up doesn't fucking matter participation doesn't fucking matter none of these things that most people think matter actually matter here's the truth. If you perform to a level that is undeniable and it's undeniable valuable to the company. You have the leverage because there's not many people out here that actually operate that way so your goal should be to outperform expectations in such a way that you could now walk into this person's office and say. Hey listen man you know you guys didn't pay me. And I was told that we were going to do this and I did everything I was supposed to do and here's the deal like I know I'm the only one in here that can fucking do that so I'm not trying to be a dick but do you got to pay me what I'm worth or I'm going to find another place to contribute to. And it's not I'm not being mean I'm not being but I you know at the end of the day dude I've got responsibilities you have responsibilities totally understand that but. I think we can both agree that there's nobody in here doing this and whatever that is needs to be fucking way better than everybody else I guess that's what you're saying I get to be careful I have the data so it doesn't just come off as ego yeah right like well it does come off as ego if you come in there without the data comes off as bullshit right. Look dude most CEOs are people that man if your managers in charge of giving you the race he's probably going to know the data but he probably thinks you don't know the data right. So it's a very important to track your own progress track your own performance and reality is dude a lot of times when you start tracking your performance you figure out that you ain't got fucking good. You're doing shit okay so it's a good way to audit yourself on your own performance yeah but yeah dude the ultimate goal to getting paid more as an entrepreneur is very simply exceed expectations and track what you've done and then go in there and fucking leverage the shit out of it. Like if someone comes to me for a race and it's not they're not that good I'm probably not giving them to it yeah like because that's the level of of expectation we have bro like I will pay more money for great but I'm not paying more money for what you're supposed to do you know we have this problem in society where people think that if they do what they're supposed to do and they do it long enough that eventually they just get raises and maybe that is the way and you know corporate America where you get a cost of living raise of one and a half percent two percent every year but I'm talking about career advancement raises I'm talking 10 20 30 50 thousand dollars a year difference right we're not talking about 2% yeah right for showing up and I think a lot of people including possibly this guy because I don't know but a lot of people think that performing status quo and doing the job is deserving of a race and it's just not it's not okay that's what you are paid to do you are paid to do the job you are paid to work hard you are already paid to do these things and a lot of people act like these things are extra they'll be like oh I'm doing this I'm again no shit bro that's the fucking job description says you know I'm saying I show up on time I work hard those are not reasons for raise that's what you're supposed to fucking do okay and by the way I understand that other people may not do that but you ain't you ain't other people okay and regardless of other people do that or not in your company you're probably still not going to get the raise for just being at the average level just doing the minute I just want to bring this up to because you know they mentioned you know you you you you talk a lot about the self improvement aspect right and it's like you know I remember coach used to tell me like you don't you know practice you don't just show up to game day and like not miss your practices and think you're gonna fucking perform and when they told this person that uh old you know just keep doing what you're doing there's no you have no items for improvement I think that's bullshit but I mean why do you look at that like I mean the sort like I find a hard time believing people are telling their employees like I'm gonna tell you this dude here's what I think from the information that was sent to well I was just told which by the way I don't get these questions at a time I don't read off a teleprompter I don't fucking have diagrams behind the camera over there that I'm fucking drawing you know right off the other diagram like I'm this is a real answer I think off the data that you have related me that you work in a company that is not employee focused or career driven in terms of escalating the intrapreneur slash employee career a lot of companies will try to hold their top performers by saying shit like this they will say oh you do the good job just keep it up yeah and you're obviously wanting more um and so what I would do is start to try to find a company that's looking to aggress I would bet that if I went to that fucking company right now I bet that the ownership is not aggressively growing the company I bet they are in that fucking coast mode or they don't care enough to actually grow and get aggressive if you're within aggressive company they will pay people who are top performers over and over and over again to continue to progress and perform I have guys that started with me at $7 an hour that are now sea level executives doing very very well I have guys who will franchise do very very well those promises that I made them are kept as long as they keep their promise which is to continue to get better and better and better and how do you get better as an intrapreneur one you do everything you can when you're there and two and this is the one people hate you do everything you can when you're not there oh I don't get paid for that no shit you're getting paid in the future for what you're doing now okay so what you're getting paid for now is what you did in the past so to get more you're going to have to do more outside of the requirements to improve your skill set to become better which that pay will cap to if you don't continue to get better so if I were you I would just follow what I said I would make a report of all the things you did I would include all the books you read all the things you did on the side to improve any programs you went through any any courses or seminars you went to I include the cost and the investment of all of these things that you're doing to get better with the metrics of how you got better and I would say pay me or I'm fucking leaving yeah that's what I would do I love most people can't do that because they don't have the ability to go fucking say that they came back it up right yeah so people love hearing this they're like yeah fuck yeah but but remember if you go in there with garbage you ain't get anything yeah and so do we have this situation in culture and where people believe that just doing the job and working hard and showing up is some they get deserve they get paid a premium for that bro I don't know if you guys understand what's going on in the world but most people are replaceable right now with a fucking AI bot that will do every single fucking thing that you do perfect so if you intend on keeping your job you're going to have to remove this idea of mediocrity from your brain and really step on the gas otherwise eventually and remember I said this you will end up on some sort of subsidized government income that the government pays you to stay the fuck home and yeah you get to run around through the fields every day but you're gonna be broke and you're gonna be eating fuck a shit okay because that's where the world's going the world is going to a place where mediocre performers will not be employed and they will be replaced with technology and it's we're not fucking that far away so I would say we're in it within a year or two of that really happening and that might be long that might be a long shot so if you decide that you really want to build a career and you really want to earn money and you really want to be successful you better figure out how to be of massive value and you better do it right now otherwise it's going to be too late you're going to walk into your place of business and they're going to say all of you guys who are you know the bottom half of the company you're out of fire yeah sorry that's what that's what's gonna do that is gonna happen at mass scale it's I've been warning people about this for years okay and we are within a 24 month window of that happening so if you even think for a second that you would like to have more money and build a better career and do all these things that represent what the American dream is you better fucking get good right now like and I mean real good yeah I love it man I love it guys let's keep this uh let's keep this move we got question number two uh you know we were talking about some some storms and tornadoes and ship before we started recording uh and then this question how you know we talked about you know before tornado happened to get real real calm mm-hmm for the fucking storm so that's what this question is sending around uh guys any question number two Andy I've always admired people who stay calm and focused under pressure but I tend to panic and second guess myself when things go wrong what can I do to develop more grit uh and keep my composure in stressful situations are you a calm before the storm guy what do you think there's no doubt but I'm gonna listen there's two kinds of people okay there's the people that when shit goes wrong they panic freak the fuck out and then there's the person when shit goes wrong they they're calm on everybody else panics which one do you think I am oh you're the latter yeah no doubt when the shit gets real bad on the calmest motherfucker in the room you know why because I know that panicking is not a productive thing you have to remain focused and you have to understand that no matter what is going on no matter what circumstance or what tragedy or what emergency it is there is a course of action to get yourself out of that situation and you cannot identify and execute on that course of action when you're in a panic state so you have to understand that while naturally there are two kinds of people you can become the kind of person that stays calm when bad things happen if you develop confidence in what you know to do when bad things happen okay and how do you do that well there's a saying in tech that says only the paranoid survive Steve jobs said it Zuckerberg said it fucking all the tech entrepreneurs it's it's a Silicon Valley thing only the paranoid survive what does that mean what does that mean what it means is this wherever you are in your life whether you're an entrepreneur whether you're an entrepreneur whether you're just a regular human being you if you are floating through life and you are not anticipating anything in life and you're just free to go through life when emergencies happen you are not prepared you are shocked you look at you say well to fuck you what's going on and you have no contingency of how to move through it in business the reason only paranoid people survive in business is because they are consistently looking for the land mines that you could potentially step on and they are always looking to avoid those before they happen so for me as you know I'm chairman now I'm not CEO I'm not an active CEO in any of the companies I'm a chairman but still my job is to visionary think of where we can go and then also and more importantly think about where the fuck we could go wrong and build in fail saves along the way and because I've been doing that my entire life in business it translates over to my personal life where in my day to day life I'm like okay this if this could happen I would do this if that could happen I could do that and it's just a framework of thinking because there's no way for you to develop a contingency all at once for everything for sure like if you're just so crazy if you're just starting today and you're like fuck I need to become more aware and I need to become more calm and I need to like understand you know that when things go wrong I need to keep myself you know level and you try to do that everything today yeah it's going to drive you fucking insane it's just a framework of thinking that you need to adapt and if you're a business owner or you're a CEO I'll give you an extra thought exercise here what is going to happen when AI takes over and you thought about it thought about what you're going to do and you thought about where it could be utilized where it shouldn't be utilized and how you're going to blend the human element and the I element together have you have you really thought about it because you should because here's what's going to happen all your competitors going to adapt the fuck out of it and they're going to cut their fucking their cost and their profit margin is going to go way up and that means they're going to have expendable capital to fucking fight you with so are you even thinking about it you see what I'm saying uh they're using chainsaws you're still using that are you are you thinking about the dynamics of social media and how people communicate and what's going on in culture and how they talk to each other and and all the trends like are you thinking about those things or are you just letting those things happen and then reacting to the them and this ultimately in the entrepreneurship world dictates what people call visionary entrepreneurs from everybody else okay and what I would call very fucking rich entrepreneurs versus moderately successful entrepreneurs the moderately successful entrepreneurs they react shit happens they react shit happens they react trends in culture happen they react visionary entrepreneurs are above that and they're looking at it and they are they are pivoting before the thing happens that way when it happens they're already ready to go you see what I'm saying and those people are perceived by everybody else as trend setters when in reality they are just looking down the road further than everybody else right one of my gifts and I think you guys will all you guys here will agree with that you guys out there may not but I'm great at it and I don't give a fuck what you think proofs in the putting I can fucking see down the road probably as far as anybody else I can see bumps in the road I can see corners that other people don't see I can see pivots that people don't see and this is why when you guys listen to CTI and you're like fuck Andy never misses well that's because I'm utilizing a skill that I have utilized my entire life to analyze what's going on in the world and yes sometimes I do miss and sometimes I do miss in business but because I've been doing it for so long I'm I'm conditioned to doing it okay so one of the reasons that I can stay calm when shift starts to fucking happen is I am used to looking at all the contingencies in every decision that I make and I think that all of you would be much more successful if you would just start to do that in your life you know don't be one of the people that reacts be one of the people that anticipates and pivots before the reaction is necessary and it makes you that much more of an effective operator but like dude you know I'm not sure if that's a skill that people are born with quite honestly I think I was gifted with it and I practice it but I think regular regular person who wasn't gifted with that who's up they can learn that by just changing their frame of thought from you know oh this happened so now I'm gonna do this right you know it doesn't matter if you put the umbrella up once it starts to rain like you need to have the umbrella with you before it starts to rain you know what I'm saying so we have to always be looking for performance indicators and culture trends and emergencies and shit that could happen and you know believe it or not I have all that shit in my brain and you will too if you start to see the world that way yeah And so I would encourage you guys, if you want to stay calm during things that are not you know easy for people to stay calm in, you have to prepare yourself ahead of time, right? Like This is gonna sound fucked up. What are I'm about to say? but like when you have your first dog, right and you have this dog and and Your dog suddenly dies, okay, and it's fucking horrible. It's one of the worst things ever, especially when you don't have kids. When you get another dog You look at it a little bit differently and you start to think like Okay, well eventually my time with this dog is going to end and so you value the time more and you're also more prepared When the time does end you understand so it's not as traumatic as It was the first time. Does that make sense? 100% so so if you think about that in the the The bad things that can happen in business You know you you can kind of be ready to stay calm when things happen in another way this comes about guys is experience Okay, when you're first like dude real talk my first five six years in business I was a fucking nervous wreck every single fucking day and and and it was because I didn't know what the fuck I was doing I was just like dude and we were on the edge of going out of business the first 10 years literally Bro like for the first 10 years in business I Mean Dude if I had fucking two thousand dollars in my bank account, I was fucking rich. No for real, dude I'm being serious like if I had fucking like there was a lot of times where I was I had like three hundred dollars You know, and I was just fucking making it work dude anything I had to do and when you're in that position You are forced to learn very quick and you're forced to deal with stress You know the the way you get good at dealing with stress is by being exposed to a lot of stress You know, it's not running from it. It's not hiding from it. It's being it's almost like getting into a cold plunge the first time Right you can get in the cold plunge and you're like hyperventilating or freaking the fuck out But then after a few minutes you're you calm the fuck down right and and someone who's done the cold plunge a hundred times You understand that that first 30 seconds is gonna be hard. Yeah, and then it's gonna get calm But the first time someone does that you can't explain that to them. So they spend a lot of time You know staying in that heightened anxiety very stress like Reactive state instead of having the experience to anticipate what happens What is going to happen and how to react and here's the good thing? You know for those of you guys who were just starting in business You gotta understand that like all these mistakes that you make when you're small It's really good that you make them when you're small you can't beat yourself up and say fuck I I fuck that up. I suck. No, dude when you first start You're supposed to fuck everything up and you're supposed to not repeat those mistakes because once you get from you know Let's say you do a hundred grand a year or two hundred grand a year and you're very first business You know the internet will tell you you do fucking hundred million a year first day, but like do let's be real Okay, let's just say you're not doing a lot and You're stressed and you're uncomfortable. Well, you're making mistakes, bro And and gaining lessons and those lessons like that that you learn when you're small End up saving you tens of millions of dollars when you get big So like all the shit you're going through you're gonna be able to recognize that at scale Yeah, so so like to see it again. Yes, and you're like oh, I fucking know that. Here's what I do That's a dude right right and what happens now is you know the younger people in the office when something happens They get fucking freaked out and they come to me and I'm like that's it. Yeah, right. Okay, do this this this because I've already seen it before And this is the value of not quitting right Just because you suck in the beginning Just because you're making mistakes in the beginning Does not mean you're terrible, bro? Everybody does that fuck I made them I think one of the biggest blessings of me is I made so many mistakes early And I'm smart enough to fucking learn from them and they happened really early in business Which allowed me to be much more successful in short time frame so You know we can't look at I mean I'm getting off course here, but the point is is that we can't look at failures and and and Things that we do wrong as a negative especially when you're small and even when you're big and you do have a big mistake You know you and maybe it cost you five million dollars Well, when you're in a position where that's gonna cost you 50 you won't make that mistake So they're always valuable and dude as an entrepreneur There's no college you can go to and get a truly Entrepreneur degree where you can go out be an effective entrepreneur It doesn't fucking exist those little course you could buy there There's just too much that you're gonna learn on the fucking job and you have to understand that that's part of The college of entrepreneurship the college of entrepreneurship you don't pay tuition to you Pay it in the cost of the mistakes that you make over the course of your life So when you look at it like that and you say oh well, I made a mistake it cost me $12,000 Well, that's just $12,000 towards the tuition of your entrepreneurship PhD That was your first semester. You see what I'm saying So when you start to look at it differently like that you don't feel as bad about your mistakes You're like oh well, I just paid fucking to get my PhD again, you know what I'm saying payments do because I fucked up But ultimately guys look to stay calm during times of crisis you have to practice staying calm It's like any other thing and when when stressful things happen You have to realize that their panic doesn't help Preparation helps knowing what to do in those situations And that comes from experience or a framework of thinking about these things naturally Because you're responsible for them in your life and so this is how I naturally think There's a good chance if we ever meet in person and we sit down and We have dinner or we're sitting around Smoking a cigar you're gonna see me Drift out into fucking space my eyes will get fucking glassy and I'm not present in the conversation And the reason I'm not present in the conversation is because I'm analyzing fucking a million shit million things all at the same time And usually what I'm analyzing is whatever idea we're talking about like let's say you're sitting with me DJ and you say hey, I have an idea for this and this and this and then I kind of like You see me stop listening. Yeah, what I'm doing usually is I'm playing that idea out Over the course of yes, yes, every time all the time yes So so it's a very important skill Because if you if you rehearse these things in your head when they happen you know what to do and I don't think enough people do that Now I was gonna have to tell you this too because I feel like this also is a piece of it It's not only that do they not do that, but they're not confident in their ability to actually execute If that shit happens listen to it's not just that it's another big part of it is this people expect to go down the path and They expect it to be they what they expect it to be in terms of hard Is they misjudge the heart, okay? It's a thousand times harder than what you think and it takes a thousand times longer and So when I say they perceive it to be easy it they perceive it to be hard, but it's actually easy shit so If you have a real expectation that this is gonna be the hardest fucking thing you ever did and Bad things are gonna happen and this could happen and that could happen and this could happen if you say that to someone They're thinking fucking paranoid and you should be because those things do happen and when they happen what separates a Great entrepreneur from an average one or a poor one is the great one has already seen this happen and knows what to do ahead of time I love it man. Well guys, we got one more question. We got a third and final question Andy question number three Andy I have your children's books And absolutely love it my daughter is nine and has started making friendship bracelets She sells them at school to make money for things that she wants to have but I refuse to purchase them for her Because I don't want her to be spoiled and I want her to have that sense of earning it Do you have any tips for me to continue to foster this mindset with her as she gets older? I remember you sharing that you sold light bulbs and lemonade and baseball cards What kept that Entrepreneur mindset with you as you grew up? I'm confused on the question so he's saying he doesn't want to buy what? So he doesn't just want to buy her shit that she wants because wasn't she making them? Yeah, that's why she's doing it. So she has wait wait wait So he's saying he doesn't want to buy her like toys? You're right right? He wants her to earn it right got it I'm not the supplies to make the bracelets right got it Look man, that's that's an escalation of vision and goals and you drop your job as a parent that wants to cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit And your daughter is to one surround her by information Does this all she is nine? Okay, surround her by entrepreneurial data and information Kids book entrepreneur books like the ones that that I write Those are a good place to start but You know continue to do that like one thing that my dad did for me was he would always like point out businesses so like we'd be driving down the road and he'd be like look there's you know Acme tire and the guy that owns that he does this and this is he's got 50 locations and he lives in this house And he does that and then we would like talk like well how did he get started? Well, he started here and we were kind of like talk through the process and my dad was always really good about Pointing out examples of people who started very small and they had become very successful and what that did was that instilled a belief in me that I could do that too That's not what most parents do no, I know they do the opposite bro They say oh that guy got lucky that they don't even understand what the fuck they're doing They don't understand that when you tell your fucking kid or you come home because you're in a bad mood for your job And you mother fuck your boss you are fucking that kid's psychology up for their whole entire life Okay, I don't care if you got your ass chewed out by the boss at work and you're mad at him today You shouldn't go home and say that in front of your fucking kids because your kids are then gonna adopt a mentality that You know, oh man everybody who's rich as an asshole Then they're not gonna even pursue the idea and they're gonna spend their whole life fucking watching cartoons and living off your fucking shit and never actually developing So as a parent now I don't have kids, but I've raised a lot of other people's kids and the one thing that I have always been made sure that they understand is that they are very capable to do anything if They're willing to pay the price to do it and that was something that I was taught and and I don't say lucky very often But I got real lucky I was taught that as a kid and so if you want to teach your daughter that I would recommend letting her see it Touch it make it real this could mean like what she into what does she like does she like cars? I like cars, so you know what we did we would go to the car dealerships and see the cars All right, and it wasn't like you know like we were just gonna look at him Super important. Yeah, like you have oh you want to live in a big house. Let's go look at some houses You know to live in that house. You got to earn this much money How you gonna earn that much money? Right, so out of fris your braces. Yes. Well, that's what I'm saying So but but dude, so you ask what You ask how it worked for me. Well how it worked for me was I was exposed to all these things And that drove my entrepreneurial curiosity about how could I put myself in a position to live that life and You know dude, I I mean Through my high school career, dude. I tried all kinds of different ways to make money most of them failed You know, and we don't talk about that enough Um, everybody thinks that you know starting the supplement business was the first thing I ever did No dude, I did a whole bunch of other shit then work. So You know continuous exposure The right information making it real Encouragement in the fact that she can do it just like other people have done it and showing her examples Um, and then showing her the result and making her comprehend like you know, hey Uh, now You're selling 15 friendship bracelets for a dollar each that's $15 now that house is It's a million dollars, right? So how many friendship bracelets do you have to sell to get to that? Well, I got to sell a million. Well, how are you gonna sell a million? How do you do can you sell a million to people directly? Well, no, so how will we do that? And then you know play a little game of you know How would we scale the business on paper? You know what I'm saying? Sometimes those turn into real businesses There's time there's kids You know out the outliers, you know people will talk about the the youtuber kids that make millions of dollars But like dude there's plenty of kids that came up with really good ideas as very young kids because kids are not bound By the restraints of society yet They're very creative and there's a lot of kids that you know 10 11 12 years old came up with an amazing idea and turned it into a multi-million dollar company. So Uh You know, it's just the environment, bro. It's exposure. It's connecting the dots for them. It's making them understand it's making them listen to productive information read productive information um You know and helping them create that entrepreneurial curiosity that eventually leads to a A breakthrough. Yeah, and something will the math will work on something you know what I mean? And 100% and then and then they work it works out. Do you think that no now? I know I'm we talk about a lot of this on the CTI episodes, but not to get too deep in it But I mean, do you think that's what we need right now? Is we need to be fostering more young? Yeah, of course of course look man America's the greatest country in the world But we missed a generation and a half of people telling them the truth Okay, a lot of people for 15 years were told Everybody gets a trophy You know, it doesn't matter as long as you try hard. No, it does fucking matter. Are you producing results? Or are you just trying hard? Um, it doesn't matter if you finish first or 18th those things matter in real life So we have been in a number of other things But we have been our our children and generations have been lied to by idealistic You know at minimum idealistic Teachers at maximum intentionally handicapped, which is what I believe To fuck up society over here. So yes, it's extremely important I think it's the most important thing we can do and I think that ties right into that personal excellence The ultimate rebellion because dude your kids are fucking watching you bro. They are paying attention to you They will become exactly who the fuck you are you don't understand that yet I am For better or worse Pretty much a carbon copy of my fucking dad Okay, real talk. Mm-hmm. All right Your kids will become who the fuck you are and however you want these kids to fucking be you better be it right now And that's just the truth So if you teach them all the shit that you were taught and you look at where you are in life And you realize that you weren't taught the right shit you have an opportunity to break that cycle by improving yourself By living in a higher standard by getting your shit together and showing them what the fuck it actually takes to win so Yeah to answer your question I think it's the fucking most important thing which is why I work so hard To try and get through to the young people and why I'm coming back to the mfceo project Because we have to fix how we think and act and behave as uh citizens and and not just citizens of here, but citizens of of the earth like Everything comes from us man. Everything comes from the example that we set and if we're not setting the right example Then your kids will be just like you dude like whether you set the right example or not if you set the wrong example They're gonna end up just fucking like you they're gonna think like you they're gonna talk like you They're gonna have the same biases as you And if you don't like those things about yourself You're gonna have to use some discipline to become something different so that they become something different And dude it's a parents responsibility to put their I think the definition of a great parent Is a parent who puts their children intellectually In a position to do much better than they did And a lot of parents don't do that a lot of parents let their ego And their own failures and their own ways of thinking Cloud the reality that they are a pretty shitty example for their kids And they say well, that's just what we are and then they tell their kids that and then they're disappointed when their kids turn out To be ship-ums, okay? So we have to have honest conversations about what we are What example are we setting What Do I not like about my situation and what do I wish was different and how Do I change it so that they will not be like me and that's a hard thing dude That doesn't feel good. That doesn't feel good to say man. I fucked up my shit But dude Your ultimate legacy on this earth is gonna be what those fucking kids do So you you haven't even failed yet, bro You could totally change everything just by taking some responsibility for yourself and the example that you set And so when you ask me is that important? There's nothing more important. I love it, man I love it. Well guys Andy that's a hell of a way to start a Monday, man. Yeah All right guys, uh, we'll see you tomorrow Don't be a hoe
