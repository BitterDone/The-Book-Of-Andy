that man it's so crazy I hope I have a good weekend hope you have a good weekend it's Monday I hope you guys have a great week yeah you know I'm saying yeah great year yeah I had a great weekend it's Friday all right man let's do this let's do it man let's make some people better to date guys Andy question numero uno Andy I'm a third year of owning an exterior cleaning business and it's going as expected highs or highs lows or lows among the issues I deal with I have one that shouldn't even be a problem but for some of us it is I feel like I owe friends family or friends of family or really anybody I know a discount or free service I have times where I was broke as a joke and still felt the need or still felt like I needed to cut somebody a break then kicking myself the whole time I was doing the work I think it stems from growing up broken I subconsciously think people who won't want to pay but what I think is high what they think is high could be two totally different price ranges either way it's holding me back what am I getting what what I am getting at is how do I shake this mindset and did you experience this in your early days of business I appreciate everything y'all do all right so when you're the owner operator this is very common because you're the one doing the work you're the one that sees the customer you're the one that they talk to about finishing the purchase there's nobody else you could kind of put it off on there's nobody else making decisions and people know that they can negotiate and this happened to me when I first started in business I would have people come in the store friends quote unquote you know and they would want to they would want a discount and it was a hard thing to get through because you don't have any business you don't have any customers and you know you need some customers so you start trying to accommodate the few customers you have by giving them a discount and then what happens is you don't have any money left over and you're doing all this work and it really puts you in a hole so we have to address first of all one why you would just offer a discount that's just your insecurity and being afraid of asking for the full price that takes time that takes experience all you have to do is start asking for it and people are going to pay it I know what's going on here you're getting real nervous about offering the price because you think they're going to say no and you're automatically cutting it down and what's happening here is you're cutting your profit margin out of your company without someone even pushing you to do so so the first problem that you need to address is why are you cutting your own profit out of your business when no one's even asking you to secondly when people do ask you you have to have a response ready to go one of the responses that I used to say is I would say hey look dude I don't give my brother a discount I don't give my mom a discount they pay full price and if you were my friend like we were friends you'd want to support me and that is what I always said to people when they asked me for discounts now not at first it took me a few years to figure that out yeah but uh you know as you grow the business and as you get away from the front facing decision-maker that you're dealing with all the customers that starts to fade away you know I don't I don't get that anymore at this point in my life and you won't either as long as you you stop giving discounts and you actually grow your business so yeah I can understand how that's a difficult thing to navigate but you have to understand there's only two scenarios where this happens and one is when you are doing it automatically because you're not confident in the value that you're offering or you're an inexperienced operator and you're just not comfortable asking for the sale if you don't ask for the sale you're never going to get it if you don't ask for the money you're never going to get it if you don't learn to do that you're going to be broke your whole life all right and secondly you know when people ask you you just have to have something to reply and um here's something I will tell you your best friends people that actually care about you family that actually cares about you they want to ask you for a discount they'll pay full price because they know they're supporting you and if you have friends and business and you uh have yeah and you have people that you shop with at own businesses stop asking them for a fucking discount you know it's not like they just buy their product for a dollar and sell it for 50 like y'all think that's not what's going on most businesses are within a week or two are going out of business and when you come in as someone's friend and fucking asking for a discount you're just quickening the and making things harder for them so stop doing that it's loser shit I people that ask you for discount bro they're not your fucking friend so don't give them one that's real sweet let's dive into this a little bit though because you talk about having confidence um I guess in the price or quality of your service or product like what what can we just dive and feel a little bit more like what do you mean by that like are you say well why would you cut your why would you cut the price down if you know you're solving the problem in the best possible way okay why would you do that yeah why would if you're solving the problem in a better way than all the competition then why the fuck are you cutting your price yeah so you got to be calm you know that you have to know you're solving the problem where a lot of this comes from is people are selling shit they don't believe in they don't think actually solves the problem and then they feel guilty right at the moment of asking for the money so then they cut it down all right so if you have that problem you should look at what you're selling and say do I actually believe in this do I actually stand by what I'm doing and saying and selling uh and if it still makes you feel bad then you know you need to improve and you need to get to a point where you're delivering such overwhelming value that the person has no problem paying it they think it's a fucking great deal because you're delivering over the top and you can do that at any price category as long as you're delivering over the top and solving the problem you should feel confident about what you're asking as long as it's not completely out of line but if you're solving the problem better if you're if you're getting the person what they want better than everybody else you should not be discounting that price that's just you not understanding business or you not believing that you're solving the problem so which one isn't and if it's you not understanding business then you just need to get comfortable saying it it's kind of like when you start telling people know when you start telling people know the first time it's pretty uncomfortable but after like the third time or fourth time when you realize you got all this extra time on your hand and no one's fucking bothering you because you told everybody know you feel good about it all right and you're gonna feel the same way whenever you look at your bank account and you're like fuck I stopped giving all these discounts all the sudden my business works all right magic yeah I think is this I mean is this a is this a misunderstanding that people have as far as like just just human nature man it's like you know people will pay for quality shit the solves the problems you know I'm saying so it's like I give you off to be a product and it's like fucking half off like I'm doesn't really even work then like I mean you know I'm saying bro there's different mentalities amongst consumers right there's people there's good better best categories and there's good better best categories with product and with consumers there's people who want to come in and buy the best okay that's the customers I like to deal with because they want the best shit I like the best shit we relate we want to solve the problem the best possible way that's where my personal mindset is and in every business I'm in I sell a premium product because that's what I relate to okay then you have good the the the the the better product okay the middle of the road they're pretty good but they're not the best okay and there's consumers for that there's consumers that want you know they don't want the cheapest shit but they don't want the most expensive but they want something that they can afford and get the product and get the the solution pretty much done that's a different category of person then you have the value shopper I would stay away from that the lowest price shopper is the biggest pain in the ass they want to fucking they want everything for free that and then when your shit doesn't work they get pissed off as if they're a premium customer okay so I don't fuck with those people I don't I don't every business I'm involved in I don't sell any value branch yet because I learned a long time ago that that attracts the most it attracts the the kind of customers that you have to spend the most time making happy believe it or not that's why well does it not make sense it makes it but when you see someone going into a fucking I mean look dude and this is for discounts look how a value shopper behaves in like a decent steakhouse okay you've been to a decent steakhouse and you've seen somebody like fucking start like mother fucking the wait the the wait staff and because they weren't fucking waited on you know like kings and queens and then everybody else who knows what they're getting they're like bro this is a fucking this is what we do here this is good right they're out of place and so dude like that value shopper takes the most amount of effort and the most amount of time to to continue keeping as a customer and also the thing about the value shopper is they're not brand loyal at all so you can't build any loyalty with them because they're always looking for the cheapest value shit so whatever's on sale whatever's buy one get five free whatever's this whatever's that and the mistake that a lot of companies make as they play their voluntarily because they're in a race to the bottom you don't have to play there it's it's good better best right that's customers every single level for real you have to decide where the fuck you want your business to be now is it possible I love I just love this conversation is it possible you know I'm a business I'm the best the best category people don't ask for discounts yeah no they don't even ask for them yeah because they know it's the best shit that's right yeah so you know is it is it is it possible for a business to rank up man like if I've been let's say I've realized I'm a fucking value yeah my value business right yes can I move up yeah how easy but the problem is here's the problem all your customers are already trained that you're a value brand so the minute you start trying to bring in higher quality products and charge more for them they're gonna bitch at you they're gonna complain at you so yes you can do it but you're gonna have a crossover time where a lot of customers leave and then you have to track new ones so it's not you're not keeping those same one not usually yeah you're not it's very hard to retrain consumer behavior you have to understand there's three categories good better best good is a value shopper better is the guy in the middle and best is the guy walks in says what's the best I love it I love it yeah I regardless of who you are I wouldn't discount your shit ever I love it man the problem is too people do this with consumable goods bro like you know they'll do this with a product that has a recurring revenue cycle that's consumable you know let's say they do buy one get five free well then the customer walks out the door and you don't see him for five fucking months okay now you can't even build a relationship with him because they stocked up on whatever the fuck it is that you're selling them there's all kinds of reasons here that you don't want to do this yeah but you know people get hungry and they think you know because everybody else is doing it I should do it you know and then they they do buy one get four free and all the sudden in three months they don't have any customers their margins are shit and they got to close their doors you know this is the mid-depth stuff man this is what our table is going for right yeah they would cover all this shit in our tank that's fucking awesome yeah I love it I love it guys Andy question number two hey Andy we got a young gun here I love these young gun questions man they they come with some heat hey Andy I really just want to say thank you for giving us the real deal especially for as young guns bro we need this stuff so I'm 20 years old and I work for an older guy he's like 50 and I've been told from every grown up that I know that I don't know shit and I get it how do I yeah huh all does he 20 yeah you don't know shit I get it I haven't lived long enough to develop my skills you say it much nicer but here's the thing there are things that I do know that older people don't have the perspective or knowledge of the millennial culture social media how to talk to young people so I guess my question is is this a culture or society issue that the older people miss out on or is this something that just happens with every generation where it's like the old doesn't understand the new how can I address this properly without pissing off the old man because I do feel like he is just missing it look dude when you're a young person and you're around old people you have to understand they have a ton of experience that you don't have so you definitely don't know shit all right however you're correct you do know things that they are not in tune with so how do you bring value to a company that is full of older people that doesn't understand a certain thing that you understand it seems like that's a pretty wide open avenue for you to bring value all right so my recommendation you would be open your ears shut your mouth listen to what they say take what they say apply it to the technology that you understand very well that they don't and become an extremely valuable asset to that company or that group or that business you see what I'm saying so yeah there's things you don't know you can't know but there are things that older people are not comfortable with as well and so where's that lane and how can you fit in and how can you fill that demand to become an extra valuable part at an especially young age that's the biggest opportunity for young entrepreneurs if they could take the principles the culture the ideas the the way that the the company moves the owners move the business the brand moves and they can apply the technology that they understand and help make that mission possible make it work that's extremely valuable shit so yeah dude you don't know a lot but you know what you know and and one of the biggest keys to success is knowing what the fuck you know and knowing what you don't all right so you know just because you know one thing doesn't mean you know all the things and just because they know a couple things doesn't mean they know all the things so how can you expose yourself as a valuable asset to these older people well it's very simple teach them the shit that they don't understand the most valuable thing that you can give someone is your knowledge not money not not prizes not jewelry what you can transfer from here to here is the most valuable exchange that can happen amongst humans so what if you could sit down and you could say hey I know we're trying to do this we're trying to do that we got this going on this technology here will help us move forward we can do this and this and this I don't know if you guys know that and show them how it works and they're going to be like holy shit that works make a tick-tock yeah right dude like there's lots of opportunity for young people to find very valuable roles inside companies right now just because of the nature of what they grew up around and what you know what the older guys didn't have you know what I mean like I'm I'm probably the youngest person that still understands the old ways and the new ways okay I I was in business for 10 years before social media really took off which means I had to run a business the old ways and then I got to learn social media and I learned how to take the old ways of doing business of applying to social media most companies have not even adjusted to that which I we've been doing for fucking 12 13 years most companies still don't do that they either try to do everything with technology or they try to do everything the old way and both of those ways end up losing because the value to a consumer has to do with the relationships that you build and how you service them and how you relate to them and how you take care of them and how you make them feel special that's more of the old way and you have to combine that with the technology that's available and most companies go one or the other they don't go both but if you as a young person who understands some of the things that these older people don't you can help you know cross that bridge for them and you become extremely valuable yeah would you say that because I feel like this is a culture they like it is one of those things that just happen well dude I mean in society is it yeah I mean every generation there's there's new technology so yeah there's over dude they're older people will say oh these kids don't get it and the kids will say oh these old motherfuckers don't get it when in reality it's just the nature of who spent the most time at what point in time that the technology flows yeah so those old dudes that you think don't get it they know a lot of fucking shit that you don't know okay and those young people that you think they'll get it they probably know a lot of shit that you don't know so how do you create some sort of a union there and most people won't do that most young people won't do that they won't they won't voice up because they're afraid the most old people won't do it because they look at you and they say you're 20 years old what the fuck could you possibly know but it's your job to display that it's your job to make it known it's your job to help them understand and that creates value but yeah man every generation you know it's the same thing you know the older guys talk about how the younger guys don't know shit the younger guys talk about how the old guys don't know shit and what doesn't help too when the young guys are eating Thai pods and shit you know I'm saying I don't know if what the biggest problem with younger people bro is they think of their way better than they are that's the problem it's never it's never usually that they think they don't know shit it's that they think they're way fucking better than they are and you know it is what it is. The older you get the less you actually that's correct as you get older you start to realize that you're not as good as you thought you were and you have a lot more to learn and the older I get the more I realize bro I got a long way to go I got a lot more to learn but then I'll talk to some 24 year old kid like bro you haven't even fucking you haven't done anything right you know like I get tired of these people on the internet talking about how good their shit is you have nothing to show for it. Okay game big bro listen motherfucker if you if you fucking open your bank account and it is fucking small and you think you're the best you are out of alignment with reality because if you are the best that bank account number is gonna be fucking big and that's not blaming on some company you work for or some count you know the consequences or some bad luck or some bad news or I was born this way no you're ignoring the real data if you are the fucking best your bank account will fucking reflect it and if you can open your fucking banking app and it says fucking $200 that doesn't mean that means you ain't the best it's very simple and a lot of these young people can't fucking wrap their brain around the real world evidence that you live in a shitty house you live in a shitty apartment you drive a shitty car you don't have any fucking money and yet you walk around and think you're the best how do those two things go together they don't okay so a lot of you young motherfuckers need a humble yourself and realize that if you fucking live in a shitty place drive a shitty car have shitty fucking bank account you sure as fucking the best you need to quit running your mouth by how you are you shut it and listen and go build your craft and then when that bank account has seven fucking numerals in it you can talk about how good you are but until then you ain't shit I love it man this this this question I'm gonna sue like I was painting the pinch your picture my head it's like you know think about like a logger right like a cut down trees and yeah old guy old guy he's fucking hard on the x like that's his tool but this young guy comes him to fucking chainsaw it's like no by that ain't it and you're the the the point is it's to kind of combine both of those the point is is that you need to come you need to figure out as a young person how to bring value to people who haven't adopted new technology and there's never been a better opportunity than that because technology is moving at such a fast rate so these guys who don't know anything who are in their 50s and 60s and 70s trying to run a company they don't care about technology they don't even try to keep up with it so where's your value your value proposition is in keeping up with it and showing the company how they can make money with it love it love it guys any question number three Andy Andy how do I cultivate a winning mentality I'm 19 years old and my parents put me in therapy as a kid and now I feel like I've lost my anger and drive to dominate and win in sports and life just in general I've read a bunch of like mental toughness books and I have on occasion you know there's been occasions where I feel extremely confident and dominant but I want that to be the way it is every time how do I cultivate a winning mentality how do you do it well how do we how do we how do we fix this well if you don't develop it you're going to be fucking broken miserable your whole life that would be the first step that I consider you're not going to ever have any money you're not going to ever live in a nice house you're not going to ever have a cool car you're never going to have a quality mate your life's going to fucking suck so maybe you should figure it to fuck out okay how do you cultivate a winning mentality by going out and working towards the win you guys listen to all this idealistic bullshit all over the internet and like how that you know therapy industry tries to make you guys fucking sterile little pussies that can't fucking operate you know they go out in the field and touch the grass you should never have any anxiety you should always feel joyful and blissful and blah blah blah blah it's all bullshit okay you're gonna have hard times you're gonna have great times you're gonna have times where you're proud of yourself you're gonna have times where you're not proud of yourself you're gonna have times where you're winning you're gonna have times when you're losing such is the journey called life and if you decide to be an entrepreneur you decide to be someone who wants more it's going to be that much harder and the bigger your dreams the harder it's going to be on the journey this is reality and too many of you guys are subscribing to this feel good idealistic touch the grass go on a fucking mental health journey all this fucking bullshit I should feel peaceful all the time no wonder you don't want to win and I'm gonna tell you this dude whoever's been telling you this this shit that is sterilizing your mind and making you not ambitious and not hungry and not wanting to go out and win they fucked you just so you know because we could talk about how society should be we could talk about how it should all be rainbows and unicorns and big fucking sunflower fields and we're gonna run through holding hands during the sunset and we're gonna feel joyful and not have any anxiety ever but that's not real life okay those are experiences that you experience in real life the biggest lie that's being told right now is that happiness is a 24 seven thing that we have to get to if you think that being happy is a 24 seven destination that you're gonna get to and you're gonna have all this joy and all this happiness and all these feelings of that are good and never any bad feelings you're gonna always feel bad because your expectations are out of alignment with reality you cannot achieve that that is not achievable so the minute you have anything outside of that the minute you have a hard day the minute you have frustration the minute you have anxiety it's going to be much more amplified because your expectation is that there shouldn't be any of it okay life is fucking hard let me tell you how it's hard it's either hard in the beginning or it's hard in the end you either suffer when you're young and have a better back end or you suffer or you fucking party when you're young and you suffer on the back end it's one of the other bro and it's not a daily thing when it comes to happiness happiness reviewed as daily moments that make me happy I have this moment that made me happy I have that moment that made me happy I this moment that made me happy and we should be grateful for those moments we shouldn't be mad that that 24 hours a day wasn't this happy experience and that's what you guys are getting from a lot of this idealistic nonsense are there some good therapists out there yeah I'm sure there are but most aren't most a predatory most convince you of a standard that isn't possible to hold they convince you that you should never have anxiety never have stress never have fear never have frustration and if you have ambition and if you have drive there's your son there's some fucked up with you okay every single thing that you admire in society every single building every single team every single fucking business every single country every single organization that you admire was built by a fucking warrior someone who was able to endure take pain get punched in the face figuratively and maybe literally as many times as they had to to build it so you can either build something great you can either become something great you can can create something great or you could be like everybody else and that's what this idealistic nonsense and society is teaching people it's teaching people that ambition is wrong that wanting more for yourself is wrong and if we're being honest who benefits from that you know why because they don't want you to have fucking anything they want to be able to control you they want you to be a poor little me they want you to struggle financially because if you're struggling financially you can't pay attention to how bad you're getting screwed all right so all of this shit is nonsense it's nonsense if you want to win and you want to develop a winning mentality the best thing that you could do is one surround yourself by winners two sets of massive fucking goals for yourself three ignore all these fucking people that aren't going to be shit in their entire life and four get your fucking ass to work every single day and and when it gets really hard that's when you make sure you don't quit because that's when everybody else quits and if you want to win and you want to build something great that's what you got to do and you got to block out all the other shit all this shit that society is telling you you need to be look at the motherfuckers telling you that do you want their life do you want to live like them do you want their bank account do you want their fucking car or their house do you want the way their fucking family looks at them I'm assuming you probably don't so why the fuck are you listening to anything they say that's what I fucking take okay and like dude you guys you young men you better realize bro the world's on your shoulders nobody's gonna come and help you nobody feels sorry for you either it's not like you're some young girl or some gay person or somebody that's in a protected class that has all these people to give a fuck about you if you're a young man nobody gives a fuck about you the fucking single fuck so you better figure it out you better figure out how to be strong fit intelligent and the money make a mother fucker your life's gonna suck and don't say don't fucking tell me oh you don't know what you're talking about come find me in 20 years and tell me I don't know what I'm talking about I get fucking tired of hearing shit bro you know you got all these young people out in the fucking world who think that like oh I need a break no this is when you should be going oh work ain't even started yet bro it's the most frustrating thing in the world and it's because they consume all of this victim mindset nonsense on the internet okay bro if you've take that sheet in I'm gonna tell you right now you're gonna get fucking crushed you're gonna get crushed you're never gonna have shit and then you're gonna be like why didn't it work out for me then you really will be a victim that's the danger of that kind of information because you start telling yourself oh you know I'm just gonna take it easy I'm gonna flow through life because you think that's what everybody else is doing and then and then here's the other thing okay if you're wired to win and you're wired to be an achiever and you start consuming that shit because you look around and you think fuck everybody else is doing this what's wrong with me and you start trying to take your warrior mentality and put it in this fucking regular person's box bro that's like taking a fucking wild lion who's ruled the jungle for 10 fucking years straight and putting them in an eight by eight fucking cage okay if you're wired to win if you're wired to achieve if you're wired to be a warrior if you're wired to build shit and be great and you have that drive in that hunger and you read all this nonsense all over the world and all over the internet from all these fucking gurus that pretend like they're fucking Buddha and they don't know shit you're gonna be fucking miserable bro you're gonna take your wild self and you're gonna put it in this little bitty box and you're gonna be angry you're gonna be frustrating you're gonna be mad and you're gonna be looking around and wondering why why didn't this work for me how come I'm so angry why do I have so much anxiety why am because bro you're trying to take a fucking square peg and put it in a round hole the world needs people like you it needs people to build it needs people to create it needs people to set an example there's nothing wrong with you for being an ambitious person the world wouldn't exist as we know it without ambitious people the world wouldn't exist as we know it without fucking creative people who are willing to pay the fucking price to build what they see in their mind before anyone else sees it okay so you are needed you need to stop thinking that all these fucking morons on the internet have a figured out unless you want their life don't fucking listen to them dude and start understanding that if you do listen to them and you're one of these people who was meant to come here and create you're gonna waste your whole life trying to fit in a box with a bunch of people who aren't ever gonna accomplish a fucking thing I fucking can't stand a dude this this victim mentality and this idealistic shit ruins more lives than anything else in our culture it convinces all these people that they're supposed to be less than it convinces all these people that they're supposed to be poor and that there's no ability in being less than what we could be there is no fucking nobility in living small there is no nobility in living in a way that doesn't inspire people you are giving gifts if you believe in God do you think God looks at you and says you know I hope my son uses none of his gifts and just chills out and just touches the grass and walks through the field and do you think that's what the fuck he wants for you you were put here with a purpose what is your purpose your purpose is not to float through life and quote unquote enjoy it yes there's going to be things that you enjoy but just like that mother fucking beer you have after mowing the grass on the hottest day of the year you will not enjoy your life unless you're putting in work to fucking create the life that you're supposed to create you'll be miserable and it doesn't matter this is why rich people who get mega rich and stop working end up killing themselves because they don't have a purpose and it doesn't matter how much money you have or how much car you have or how much house you have or what the fuck you have if you stop building and stop creating if you're one of the people that's made for that okay and this is a problem because society is made of NPCs bro non playable characters that buy into this therapy shit that buy into this weak shit that buy into this you know I got a I got a fine piece shit some of y'all are built for peace some of your built for war and those are the mother fuckers that build the entire fucking world everybody else who tells you that there's something wrong with you for being the way that you are enjoy so if we're all gonna be peaceful little fucking hippies who is gonna build the shit that we enjoy you see what I'm saying no we need an America more than ever we need men and women to stand the fuck up and say this is who the fuck I am this is where I'm supposed to be this is what I'm supposed to do and if you don't like it fuck off I love it I thought that's a way to start a Monday I fucking love it man guys by the way I'm not saying that therapy can't be useful at all that's not what I'm saying but what I am saying is that there's way too much of this fucking shit out there oh you want to stop filling down go do some shit that's pretty much it yeah man you wonder why you you know why you feel like shit bro because you're not using any of your gifts you're not using any of your talents you're not trying to get better you're not creating you're not building you're not becoming and you wonder why you feel like shit it's because inside you know that you're wasting your life stop wasting your life go out and do shit and you're going to feel better even if it's hard as fuck that is the fucking secret so you want to develop a winning mentality hopefully that answers your question but at the end of the day here's the deal if you don't win you're good life's gonna suck that's what you should know you should know that flat fucking out if you do not win your life will fucking suck and you will be one of these people who convinces yourself that all these dreams and all these goals and all these things you wanted are not actually what I want anymore you know I've changed I know you know I've gotten more sophisticated and then when you go to pay for your Chipotle you're gonna fucking be counting your quarters and trying to pay for that'd be your life I know this that ain't going to be my life it's real shit man I love it guys Andy that was three go pay the fee all
