Yeah, well like do you remember seeing anybody wear them go? I don't I don't either But then there's these pictures on the internet that show up with people wearing them like what We're just come from yeah, it's sorcery glitch in the matrix. That's what it is. Yeah Sweet well guys Andy let's let's make some people better. Let's do it. Let's do it. We got got through gillens for you all right I do I promise guys Andy question number one Andy What's up Andy and DJ? I'm 18 years old and I'm a future entrepreneur. I want to ask you How you deal with laziness because you have said you're one of the laziest people you know in a previous episode And I'm like that too even though I work out every day and do what I need to do Uh, but a lot of times I just feel lazy and procrastinate for no reason. How do you deal with this? Um, and do you have some tips for me? I hate that I'm asking this question because I feel like the answer is You just do it and just stop procrastinating but um, I guess I'm hoping that you have a different perspective or way of dealing with it How do we handle laziness Andy? Well first of all Being lazy is not a terrible thing Uh, and I know you're probably Like what the fuck is he talking about? I'll tell you why I'll tell you why Because lazy people have a gift for figuring out how to get things done Without having to put a whole lot of effort into it. All right, so they are natural problem solvers Which makes them a very effective? Yeah, all right So never thought about it like that. That's true No, it's true a lot of the most effective people are super lazy because they just want to get up Get the shit done and go back to what they were doing So it's not a terrible thing as long as you can get up and get the thing done, right? So don't beat yourself up over that I find that most most Of the most successful entrepreneurs are Contrary to what the internet will tell you they are they're actually pretty inherently lazy people That I figured out how to be disciplined in certain actions And they understand the more effective they are The more time they get to themselves to do whatever they want to do So it's part of why the power list is such a good tool for you guys Which you can get for free at episode 16 on the real AF feed Because it teaches people to execute versus Be busy. All right, we have this situation and culture where everybody wants to talk about how busy they are You know, it's almost like a natural response for people people will say Well, how you doing? Oh my god, I'm so busy and it's like dude There's no award for that. There's no reward for that. There's no trophy for that It's just something that people say to try to get people to like have empathy or sympathy for them And the truth of the matter is is that no one gives a fuck about how busy you are they care about what you actually get done What result you produce no one really says unless it's a very low-level job How many hours did you put in today really what they say is did you get this? Shit done was it done at a high level. That's what they care about. That's what the real world cares about so Contrary to what most of these dumbasses on the internet will tell you you don't have to work 30 hours out of 24 It's that also that hustle mentality that the that these guys push is not true at all These guys haven't built shit. They're repeating shit They think they have heard from some dude on the internet. They don't own real businesses They don't they they sell you coaching. This isn't real shit Okay, real people wake up and they say how do I get my shit done? It's gonna move me forward and how do I get it done as quickly as possible so I can still live a life because most people Want to have what's called balance they chase balance right? Well, the only way to have balance is to get your shit done and then have some time left over to do what you want And that's what the power list allows you to do it allows you to Get five critical tasks that are going to move you forward done every single day um And then the rest of the time after that you get to do what you want so you don't have to do what these more on say on the internet At all it's not even true. It's not even true a little bit Because now if it takes you a long time to get things done that's one thing but There's no award for that so the quicker you can get them done at a high level the more free time you have And how it works is is when you have low skill in the beginning You've got to put more time in to get the task done But as you develop skill it requires less time to get the task done which creates more time for balance So in the beginning. Yeah, you might have to put in a lot of extra time to master a skill set But as you get older and as you get more experience your ability to execute gets better Which means it takes less time which means you have more free time now true winners People who go down in the hall of fame of whatever they do They will feel that free time with more skill building and Progress even faster and higher, but that's not required to just be successful That's required if you want to be a fucking legend, okay, so There's levels to it. So think about it like that But there is a hack for this, okay? If you are a lazy person One of the things you need to do is you need to go listen to episode 16 You need to start using the power list every single day and the second thing you need to do is you need to learn That there's such a thing as called a production pivot all right And what a production pivot is is it's like this all right, let's say one of your things is to Work out every day and you work a job and you work hard every day and you get home and you're like fuck I work so hard and you start to lay down on the couch and then you're like fuck. I still need to work out And what most people do is most people will just lay there and they'll start justifying and they'll say well I'll get up tomorrow and train twice as hard or I'll do it in a couple hours or you know, I worked a really hard day. So I'm gonna give myself a day off and we'll just pick it up tomorrow And that's where most people do and then they do that their whole life and then they can't produce anything that they really want So what you have to learn to do is you have to learn to pay attention to your internal dialogue That when you start to convince yourself that you don't want to do it for whatever reason right? I do it tomorrow I work too hard today or whatever justification You have going on in your mind You need to use that as the immediate trigger that pushes you from the couch to the thing And then get the thing done and then you can go back to the couch Okay, and that's what successful people do successful people take the justification Dialogue and they use that as a trigger to move towards the action that their internal dialogue is trying to talk them out of all right So those are things that you can do um and by the way as you Acquire more discipline, you know, I would obviously recommend the 75 hard program to live hard program as a lifestyle to lead Um, that will make you an effective human that will get you acclimated to being effective and that's the last thing the last thing is is once you get in the habit of being A diligent effective person The laziness sort of becomes irrelevant because it doesn't matter what you do when you're not doing the thing All right, like I lay on the couch at night. I don't do shit All right, but I still get more done than most people do In one day than most people do in a month All right, because I'm getting them done Very diligently very specifically tasked by task by task by task and then when those are done those five tasks I don't try to do 15 because I want to feel good about the five I got done a lot of you guys will say well Do 15 well yeah, you want to accomplish 15 and when you don't accomplish 15 You're going to say why didn't accomplish my goals for the day which drives your confidence down your belief down your ability to execute And your doubt goes goes down, okay your doubt goes up your ability to exit goes down. So When we're in a situation where You start to get acclimated to the discipline the laziness becomes irrelevant like you can be lazy and still Get wherever you're trying to go as long as you have the systems in the discipline to do so So that's what I would recommend. I'd recommend listening to the power list episode episode 16. I'd recommend Living the live hard program, which is episode 208 I'd recommend learning how to production pivot and then I and then I would recommend You understanding that your mindset of laziness is actually a fertile soil for effective ideas to take place because People that are lazy are always looking for ways to make things easier and as long as you can make things easier Without losing the quality of work or the effectiveness of the result That actually makes you pretty valuable when it comes to innovating So there's benefits that come from a lazy mindset if you're inherently lazy I am an inherently lazy person if I didn't have that structure or I didn't work on my discipline or I didn't use the production pivot It would be very hard for me to get things done and honestly. I spent most of my life being uh a very lazy person that had a hard time Getting things done and it wasn't till I was You know around 30 years old where I started to figure it out It wasn't till I was like 35 36 to where I really figured it out and had I figured all this out when I was 20 I would have been where I'm at now when I was 30 So you know if you can learn these things it can make a big difference Let me actually this too though because I feel I feel like most people You know they call themselves lazy But they're really just procrastinating. They're just holding shit off. Yeah. What can we dive into that unveil that a little bit like What do you think most people what do you think is the number one reason most people just procrastinate? And and and because procrastination can't be a good thing. Well, let's be real. Do Most people don't know what it's like to achieve anything Most people don't know what it's like to finish anything Most people have never done anything of relevance ever So if you don't know of what it feels like to accomplish something What motivation do you really have to accomplish anything? And if you go years and years and years and years and years of never accomplishing anything What's your frame of mindset about that? It's that oh well, you know, I'm okay I'm alive. My life is all right. It doesn't really matter and you start to accept that as reality But that starts with procrastination and then moves into the the mindset of acceptance right like oh, I know I need to do this But I'm gonna do this instead or I'm just gonna weigh here. I'm gonna do this later And then you know that goes on for years and after a number of years people like well, it doesn't really matter anyway That's what I used to want to do now. I'm just happy doing this And they settle for a life that is far less than what they would want in the first place. So when we think about procrastination and how to overcome it It's the same thing as what I was talking about with the production pivot all right the minute you start to tell yourself Oh, I'll do that tomorrow or I'll do that later or I'll do that next week or I'll make that call later I'll send that email later or I'll you know get up and do that workout later That's the production pivot that's the time that you pay attention to That you hear in your mind and you say oh fuck all right Well, I'm gonna do that right now and that's what winners do winners execute at it's not like they're immune to it dude That's the thing. I think a lot of people think that people who win big are immune to having Any sort of thoughts of procrastination all these people that you look up to every single one of them battles this All the time they just know how to overcome it in the moment And that's what you have to teach yourself to do. I think a lot of people Because of the fake internet culture on the internet they believe that all these people never deal with thoughts like of procrastination or laziness You know if we go on the internet and we look at every time dick and hairy on the internet they all tell you You know, oh dude on the baddest motherfucker alive. I get up fucking the day before yesterday That's when I started my day, right? That's the shit. They say they say all this crazy shit And people who have tendencies of laziness or people who have tendencies of procrastination or like well, I'm fucked I don't I can't fucking do that right and the truth of the matter is that's not true Every single person out here who's built anything gets tired. They get frustrated. They get angry They get demoralized they get lazy they procrastinate and the whole thing that you have to understand is that all of those things are normal But how do you overcome them to still get where you want to go? And that comes down to you understanding and you hearing your internal dialogue and then doing The opposite of what it actually tells you to do until you get the positive internal dialogue Which is called the boss voice, which is if you check out 75 hard you'll understand what that means Until that voice starts to take over you do the opposite of what the weak voice the bitch voice says, okay And it's that simple when it says oh, we'll do that tomorrow get the fuck up and Go kick ass right now and that it comes down to that man. I love it. I love it guys Eddie question number two Eddie you've mentioned many times That you wanted to quit a lot, but you just never did Can you give us some insight on what was the closest you ever came to legitimately quitting and why you didn't And how did you pivot during that time to move forward and get your head back in the game? well I would say out of all the times I've wanted to quit um, we were about 10 years in on the company and Chris and I both decided we we we basically had an idea for first form That was just starting and then we had a bunch of stores that weren't making any money And we both decided that you know, this was never going to work out and we need to start looking at other options And remember we were closer to 30 years old then we were like oh man We got to get our shit together. You know, we're getting old everybody You know all our friends were having kids and doing all these things And so we felt that pressure And so we started looking at things to do and and Chris was going to go to officer candidate school to be a pilot in the military And I didn't really know what I was going to do so my dad and I decided that we were going to try to buy this serious carpet cleaning franchise and um I went to training In Columbus, Ohio and ended up getting hurt and I hurt my back and I was in bed for nearly 30 days And during those 30 days, you know, Chris and I were took the conversation started on the phone Of how are we going to close the stores and move on and by the end of that 30 days we had made conversations like fuck dude I don't really want to clean carpets that sucks and he's like yeah, I don't want to go do all this and so We actually had changed our mind and started talking about What we liked about what we did and what we liked about what we did was when we worked with people Sometimes accidentally we would spend an hour or two with someone because we weren't busy We didn't have a lot of customers And so people would come in and we would spend time getting to know him We would spend time listening to him. We would spend time actually helping him and then they would come in months later You know down 40 50 60 100 pounds in tears right being I'm so thankful and so grateful That we helped them figure out how to get themselves on track and that was awesome dude like that was one of the coolest things That was the coolest things About what we did when those situations happened and we had the conversation On the phone about that we were kind of like well, what do we like? What do we don't like well? I like this I like this too Well, let's start trying to replicate that okay, and so we shifted from a company that was trying to just sell shit To a company that was trying to help people get results and dude right after that our company exploded so That was the probably the closest to where I was gonna quit and what it the reason I didn't was because I didn't want to do what I was gonna do after that and I Figured out what I liked about what I was doing and I remember what I liked about what I was doing and then I just committed to doing doing more than more of that And that brought us through that time Would you say that like that that's that would be true for most people like I mean I feel like most people find themselves and times where All right, this this just isn't fucking working, right? But then like have would you say that it's true like if you just If you just look at the situation differently It's highly possible you can actually push through this if you if you set your your most people I think most people Get in that frustrated state Now remember I was doing that for 10 years at that time or nine or 10 years, okay? So I've been doing this for a long time. This wasn't like two or three This wasn't like I was here for six months and this isn't for me or I'm here for two years and I'm not a millionaire yet That that's not what this was this was 10 years of struggle now Remember we didn't have anybody invest in us. We didn't have social media ads We didn't have the internet the way that it is today like it was a lot different And it was a lot fucking harder to grow business back then so like it we were burnt bro and we had given it our best shot we thought and When we re-evaluated how we were doing things we realized that we were doing things the wrong way We were trying to sell instead of trying to serve And when we started trying to serve because we had accidentally done that enough times to recognize that we Like that result the best that's when things change for us And so I think that most people if you would just take a minute to step back and say what am I doing here? Why am I doing this? Why did I start this? What am I trying to accomplish and you actually keep that shit in mind? Yeah, I think it does help you push through because there's gonna be a million times when You are frustrated angry doubtful Want to quit that you have to push through so you have to be able to step back and say I'm just frustrated This is a bad time for me. I still love what I do. What do I love about it? I love this part of it and then you have to lean into doing that part of it Which helps pull you through the hard times and usually helps you make a lot more money too Is it fair to say that I mean you can pretty much be successful like in any line that you're in If you're just doing the shit the right way for long enough. I mean is that really the same? I mean obviously there's things that can't scale up or there's think like for example like if you're a tattoo artist, right You're trading your time for money. Yeah, okay, so you're only Opportunity to really scale out is to get so good that you could charge a bunch of money, but then You're still limited by seeing them saying so then you have to look at okay. Can I open shops? Can I do this? Can I do that? Anytime you stay in the zone of trading your time for money That's where you start to cap yourself. Okay, so you have to figure out how can I scale this out? How can I get better? How can I improve and That's the only situation that I would say where you have to think a little bit differently About how you're gonna move forward, but yeah, in most situations, dude You know, this is gonna this is gonna help you get through So basically what you're saying is you and Chris were able to keep pushing through and move forward on this because The other option that you had on the table was shit so much work. Yeah, and that's the other thing to consider Is like what are you gonna do if you quit? Okay, a lot of people quit whatever they're trying to do in some sort of emotional state, right? They get emotional they get frustrated for a month or two and then they quit without even having a plan of what they're gonna do And then six months a year later Like fuck why'd I quit that? Why did I fuck off there? Why'd I get let go for that place? Why did I allow myself to do that? I had five years in there. I had three years in there I had this and this is how people get in these binds, dude where they can't get out of it right they get in the hamster reel They go three years of the thing Then they change things and then they go three years of a new thing and then they change things and then they go three years of a new thing And then they change things again You can't get anywhere in three fucking years that's gonna be relevant to you and your dreams That's the reality it takes way longer than that and so I think most people fall in this trap of getting a little bit burnt out getting a little bit emotional And then thinking the answer is to totally change up their life and sometimes it might be But you only have once or twice where you can really get away with that because you're running out of time And when you're young you don't understand that you only have limited time So when you're in your 20s if you go three years three years three years three years three years all of a sudden I'm 34 fucking years old you see what I'm saying so Now you're like fuck I really am running out of time So dude you have to be able to say hey, I'm committing to this. This is the path I'm taking I'm going to do this no matter what And I'm going to push through and make it happen and if there is no future there for real Then it would take Some reevaluation, but as long as there's a future there Yeah, bro, it's you have to learn how to push through because it's never gonna be fun every day I think that's one of the biggest lies. It's told about Business you know nobody gets on there who's successful and says yeah, some days I really want to quit except me I'm the only fucking guy that says that Everybody else comes on and they post you and they want you to think they're superheroes I never quit. I work 24 hours a day And uh, okay, well you must not be very good at what you do if you got to work 24 hours a day You know what I'm saying um and they tell these these younger people this and Younger people like we're fuck I just can't do it. I can't hang I'm not you know and there and what's crazy is these influencers They're telling people this for their own ego They want people to see him as a superhero instead of actually helping people so yeah, that's real shit Yeah, that's real guys Andy. I third and final question question number three Uh, good morning evening or afternoon to your fellows first and foremost Uh, thank you DJ for coaching me at your time at St Mary's uh, my name is key. I stumbled upon the show around this time last year Uh, the mental fortitude the lessons and the desire to win that I have right now started from you guys My question is for both you DJ and you Andy uh when it comes to having to make your dreams a reality What are the one or two crucial things that a person has to have uh, uh and no matter what industry Is it routine is it work ethic is it consistency discipline effort Which of these just stand out the motion hit heart um so that the average person can become the person Love what you guys do and just know the black community is with y'all Andy for president in 2028 Oh, he speaks for the whole black community, huh apparently Yeah Well, you know the boy there's a couple of us on the okay you on the board too. Yeah, all right Are you like a junior board member or are you like on a big board? I'm like I got like 30% sake. All right I did easy easy answer dude the most important thing that you have to have Is the ability to execute when you don't feel like it which is otherwise known as Discipline Everybody thinks it's about motivation everybody thinks it's about feeling like I'm so powerful And I want to go run everybody over today. Yeah, that comes and goes, but what about when it's not there Okay, so being able to execute when you don't feel like it when you are tired when you are Doubtful when you are frustrated when you would rather do anything else than do the thing Is a superpower because 99.9% of people lack the ability to do that so if everyone else can't do it, but you can think about how much further ahead that puts you over the course of your life a normal person Who works you know Monday Tuesday Wednesday and then goes the happy hour on Thursday then goes out Friday night Fucks off on Saturday. They don't these people can't understand why other people get there But when you break the math down and you say okay, there's that lifestyle then there's this other guy This guy executes every single day. He gets his five tasks done seven days a week And by the way, he doesn't have to wait two a week and to have some time off because he gets a little time off every day Because he's become very effective at getting his five critical tasks done That guy over the course of five years ten years ends up opening a gap over everybody else That is insurmountable because time is always diminishing So when you think about what skill can you build that will give you an advantage over every single other human on the planet Because I am in a competition with other humans for those placings and you are It is disciplined and the ability to adhere to a plan Where would you be in your life right now if all the plans you ever made for yourself in the past You had executed on without fail Stop and think about that first no matter where you are no matter how old you are Stop and think right now If I had executed on the plans I made in the past a hundred percent with a hundred percent effectiveness Where would I be currently and think about that? Okay, because most people would be in a completely different place living a completely different life And the reason they aren't in that completely different place living that complete different life It's because they don't have the ability to adhere to a plan That is where it's at it's not that people don't know what to do It's that they can't fucking do it when they don't feel motivated So if you're going to ask me what I think a Super power skill is it's always going to come down to discipline grit Mental toughness fortitude the ability to push through when you don't feel like it Which is the entire reason for the existence of the live-hard program All right, and if you haven't done that you can get it for freed up episode 208 It is a lifestyle program that helps you develop the skills that we're talking about right here Which gives you a tremendous advantage over everybody else It's not just about getting lean it's not just about getting in shape. Yes, you will get shaped however You will learn this skill in a way that other people will never have it And when you possess that and they don't How the fuck can they compete? Yeah, I feel like most people they look at something like discipline As more of a an actual like character trait rather than something that gets built for sure Right, and so like what's the dynamic skill? Yeah, what's the dynamic then then like just like simply? I mean like how how do you build discipline man? Well you build discipline by practicing discipline You build patience by practicing patience Okay, these things are things that you have to build Most people including me have always thought that discipline was a trait You look at people who can who can stick to a diet You look at people who constantly get their stuff done who keep themselves in great shape Who seem to have it all together and you're like fuck Why didn't I get that why did he get that why didn't I get that but the truth is you did get it You just haven't developed it yet And so you have to switch your framework from looking at these things as like traits or gifts They got that you didn't get into these are skills that they invested in that you haven't yet All right, so when we think of discipline grit fortitude Perseverance self-belief self-confidence, okay? These are things that you build and you build them day in and day out by sticking to what you say you're going to do Which allows you to build trust and belief in your ability to adhere all right? That is the entire live hard program That's what the purpose is of it because most people don't have that most people don't have the ability or the understanding That discipline is a skill set when you tell them this and they have never experienced it before they're like that's That's not true. I know this guy. He was born that way. No, you don't you haven't see what he did behind closed doors You don't see the way that he works when you're not there. You don't see the things that they do You don't know what happened in the past to help them develop that skill set most people are never born with that Maybe they're around parents that are routine discipline Maybe they had a sport they play that taught that to them But these people picked it up along the way they weren't just born with it and you weren't born without it You just haven't put the investment into creating that and once you figure out That discipline grit fortitude mental toughness You know all of these things are skills that you have to polish and invest in that are perishable And what that means is is when you stop polishing them and you stop investing in them Your ability goes down once you start to understand that the game changes because now you know That if you make the investment in these areas of skill they go up and you become more effective So it's really a game changer for people to change the framework from These are things that people were born with to these are things that they developed and I can develop them too And you can millions of people have done this. This is how it works. So it's a skill. It's not a trait. I love it Guys 80 Yep, go pay the fee Shot case closed
