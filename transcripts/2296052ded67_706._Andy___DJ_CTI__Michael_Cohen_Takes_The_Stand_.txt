after making misleading claim about Biden not checking watch at ceremony do you remember that yeah what you wrote a book about it um so MSNBC host jen socky said she will alter future reprints of her book after being called out for downplaying president Biden looking at his watch during a 2021 ceremony for us service members who were killed in Afghanistan uh socky who was Biden's White House press secretary before joining MSNBC initially claimed in her new books say more uh that Biden never looked at his watch quote during the ceremony uh but a report by axios noted that socky's version contradicted pictures and gold star families firsthand accounts now uh socky the article continues who initially declined comment changed her tune after online backlash and told axios quote the detail in a few lines of the book about the exact number of times he looked at his watch will be removed in future reprints and the ebook uh the soon to be removed uh removed version of socky's claim quote the president always read your book anyway yeah i was about to say that i mean she only got it like you're fucking idiot it's like five copies i saw more books in fucking two hours and you'll sell your entire life it's true just quit it's true uh but yeah so she claimed that he only looked at his watch one time and like we've all seen the pictures this piece of shit like while the bodies are literally coming off the plane yeah all right of service members from the afghan withdrawal um this is him checking yeah second is watch this fucked up but you know it was what it is yeah uh she's a

know you can make fun of me what i'm not what you are what you do yeah all right let's move on guys let's get into these headlines uh remember if you want to see any of these pictures links articles videos go to any forseller.com you can find them linked there with that being said headline number one uh let's go check in little trial one on the new york that's the big topic everybody wants to talk about today uh trump's trial in new york um michael kohen uh began his testifying today on the stand um and there's some interest stuff coming out about that um quick facts on this um so prosecutors with manhattan d.a. album brags office called on their star witness um x lawyer michael kohen uh to testify in the new york v trump case on monday the prosecution is nearing the end of his witness list at which point lawyers for trump will present the main thrust of his defense now kohen's a documented liar right this is a guy who was in the trump's organization uh who was you know allegedly supposed to be close to trump um but he's a he's a liar he's purged yourself on the stand multiple times um he's been convicted of of of lying in testimony before um so they and this is supposed to be the prosecution's like star witness right so they bring him in and and almost immediately uh senator jadey vance who i like this guy he's out of Ohio um he's a good dude seems like it seems like it seems like a pretty decent dude um but he's been ripping this guy apart uh he he said today quote this guy is a convict and felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer that he only did it once allegedly uh and that this was supposed to help donald trump does any reasonable sensible person believe anything that michael kohen says i don't think that they should vance ed um so what's he talking about uh apparently kohen uh secretly recorded a conversation with trump back in in uh in 2016 um kohen testified today that during trump's 16th day in court that he secretly recorded trump on his iPhone on september 6th uh 2016 just weeks before the general election um regarding a payment to farmer national inquire publisher david pecker according to the testimony pecker had paid former playboy model karen mcdago mcdougal $150,000 to purchase her story uh that she said uh that she had an affair with trump and to subsequently quiet her claims ahead of the election um the recording was played for the jury which included kohen telling trump he needed to quote open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend david referring to pecker quote so what do we got to pay for this 150 trump is heard saying uh kohen argued in this testimony that trump new pecker had purchased the rights to mcdougal's claims of an affair and agreed to pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars quote he already knew based upon conversation with david which is why he mentioned the number 150 um now that's not the only shady part uh they got you know kind of exposed today uh this piece that came out uh the testimony reads album brags office deleted phone calls of michael kohen and stormy daniel's lawyer so a paralegal from men had an attorney general album brags office testified on friday during former president donald trump's hush money trial that some phone calls between michael kohen and steffney cleferts aka stormy daniel's lawyers uh were deleted raising questions about evidentry uh integrity and a bit to challenge some of the evidence being put forward in president trump's business records uh phosphication trial and man had an trump attorney uh imma bove uh axed paralegal jaden jimal Schneider um in court on monday on may 10th about roughly three pages worth of records that the attorney claim mr brags office had deleted now he confirmed those deletions uh he acknowledged that some phone call records uh from 2018 between mr kohen and keith davidson uh stormy daniel's lawyer uh have been deleted along with some records of conversations between miscliferts manager jena rott regas and the national inquire editor dilland howard about stormy's claims uh that she had an affair with president trump uh trump attorney alleged that the deletions were significant prompting mr jimal Schneider to dispute their character characterization though he acknowledged that some of the records had been indeed deleted um and not just like deleted but they knew they deleted them submitted a paper with all of the call logs with those call logs off for court records so i mean lot of bullshitt happening in there i still think the players for trump to just do violate the gag order again and call the judges bluff because i mean the cases almost done they probably got about another two weeks or so before this is all over um i say you just get it over with and done with any what's your thoughts on all of this stuff i mean look dude and all of these cases that have been going on with trump it's been already you know the integrity of the investigation and the charges at hand uh it it's not even to the rank of questionable it's it's fraudulent and it's insane and you know they put these buzzwords out there you know 191 felonies so that the normies will pick it up and just use that as a talking point right you know when we see people talking about trump we're like these are felon he's got 191 felonies blah blah blah and they're not paying attention to any of the details and and these people know that right like these people doing this corruption they know that all they have to do is charge him for him to be guilty in the public eye amongst the normies picking up the msm sound clips right this is what happened during covid it's what happened during your crane it's what happened during uh what's going on right now in the middle east the me too movement the me too movement like all this shit like these people are literally like some of the dumbest motherfuckers on the planet and you can see that because when you go out in the street like these people who do investigative or conversational reporting out in the street and they walk up to people and they say what do you think do you do you like I saw this one this morning do you think that men have more privilege than women in society oh absolutely okay well tell me one privilege that they have that you don't have not a single one of these ladies could come up with a fucking thing of a to back up anything they say and this is a consistent theme with the progressive left and these these young voters especially or you know and and the white middle class women voters who just see a news bite or they see a headline on CNN and they just repeated over and over and over and over again and so we have those people who will believe that but then we have the common sense crowd and then the Trump supporters right which I would characterize you know there's basically three different pie slices of people that that are what I would call common sense there's people in the middle who probably identify with libertarians more than anybody else there's people who are conservative who may not agree with everything that Trump says but they're going to vote his way anyway and then there's people who are pro freedom slash mega people who are going to uh you know see right through this and what's happening here um is that the more they lean on Trump and the more they push on Trump his poll numbers are going up because it's exposing the corruption in the courts so I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing that he's having to go through all this because what it's doing is it's it's exposing how messed up our our justice system is and how bias it can be and people are starting to realize especially the black community they're starting to recognize this uh and say dude this is what they've been doing to us right and so I think that's the biggest segment of America that is actually shifting over to Trump because they recognize the corruption from their own experiences right so um you know the more they push and the more they do this shit and the more they lean on them and the more they lie and the more they make up shit the more likely is they're going to lose and I called this from the beginning when Alvin Bragg first started this shit up I said bro this is going to blow up in their face I was having a conversation with our boy Steph from New York about this when it first happened and he was telling me he was a smart kid I like him a lot he he uh he was like man Bragg's a bat and and Steph is by the way Steph is typically identified with the left and we were having a conversation in uh DMs and he's like Bragg's gonna fucking get him blah blah blah I said dude watch I said it's gonna blow up in their face and that was about a year ago you know when all this shit started happening um and it's blowing up in their face and and I think the more they lean on them the more they persecute them the more they judge them the more they drive nails in their own coffin that's that's how I feel about it you know what do you think yeah and I mean same I think I think the part that that this is the part that bothers me is I'm at a point now where I feel like the the integrity of our judicial system at all levels local levels state levels federal levels has been completely stained like beyond repair levels right and so you know the part that that concerns me it's like man how do we how does that get fixed how do you fix something that is obviously broken you know I'm saying like we know there's there's there's there's processes and procedures and and written law and all of the I mean you got there are precedences that are being set right now that that really concerned me man and that that's what I don't I don't know what this looks like what does what does our legal system look like continues yeah what is it well what is the reformation look like it's needed right you know how do you get these people out who are willing to you know all of these attorneys and all of the people involved in in the Georgia case in the agorian case and in this case and uh the the fucking fed raid case bro every single person involved deserves to go to jail you know all of them bar license the street no completely barred from law if you're an FBI agent to put the top secret folder on fucking shit that wasn't top secret took the photo did bro this is all conspiracy it's really like Rico okay and they all deserve to go to jail and they go they deserve to be made examples of go to jail for life for what they've done because the disruption that it's caused inside of our republic it is significant and when we look back at you know the election in 2020 which the majority of americans believe was fraudulent not the majority of the right the majority of americans meaning the democrats and the republicans believe that there was massive fraud when you pull them okay and if you watch the media and you watch CNN and msnbc they act like it's absurd to even say that but when you pull people even the democrats they all say that this is what they believe and when we look at that and then we look at the economic damage that's happened because of covid because of the economy because of this administration getting in we look at the societal damage the cultural damage because of the open borders and what's going on like dude this is this is treason this is treasonous shit and for this to be fixed every single one of those people has to be held accountable and they they will only be held accountable if people start demanding accountability these people do not deserve to just go out into the into the world and what I really think here dude is I think this is good this is happening to trump that they're doing this because I think it's going to allow these people to be held accountable because that's the presence being set right now right no that he's not getting immunity and he said like a hundred times the presidential's deserve immunity and if you don't give it to me and someone else gets in you're gonna have to play by that rules and he you know I've heard him said no no yeah bro and so like he's trying to protect them no I don't think so I think he's just pointing out yeah that if they do this to them he's gonna do that to them and they deserve to have it happen to them you know you know Hillary Clinton on TV saying this man plans to jail his political opponents yes because that's what you're doing you're doing the same shit and these people come on TV and pander to these you know this isn't 2016 anymore bro like there's not this massive support for Hillary Clinton and because she lives up and you know fucking in her ivory tower and comes out dressed in you know fucking Empress outfits and shit some cult shit pantsuits are so bad bro she were did you not see that thing she she wears these things that are like robes yeah like she thinks she's a fucking like a yeah fucking some sort of Empress Pharisees yeah I don't know what the fuck she thinks but she believes it she thinks that she is up here and we are all down here and there's not support for her and the reason she can't identify that is because she's up in her ivory tower so she comes in and she says these things and everybody's like no that's what you're doing it's very obvious that's what you're doing and the more these people try to gaslight what they're actually doing the more people are waking up so I actually enjoy when they put Hillary Clinton on TV because it wakes more people up like dude I have people in my family who are hard core Democrats and they're like bro this is fucked up you know this is bad shit I didn't realize how bad it was and these are people coming to me and my dm is being like dude and these are like my cousins and my family and people I know and they're like dude I thought you were crazy dude I'm like no man I like you think I don't care about you and everybody else like people are waking up dude and for her to come for these people to her and these other people to come on TV and say these things it's just opening up the eyes of many more Americans so you know so I actually think it's a good thing I think dude too on top of that I think one point that people kind of kind of miss at the bremen like this is this this what's happening right now without legal system and all these charges and all these you know pending felonies that Trump has on them 91 and 94 something like that indictments this is election interference bear minimum well Andrew Bailey sue him for the info on that yeah you know I'm saying like it's bare minimum is that it's the same thing they did for during the 2020 elections like I remember I think the vape also said it too when we had him on you know he's like you know I do believe the election was stolen but not in the way that people think it was right because you know any said I don't have the evidence of all the battle harvesting and stuff like that but bare minimum with the stuff that they did with the Russia collusion right and like the in the Biden laptop all of that stuff like that that that was election interference right like they're doing the exact same thing and like we I know we've shown that there was you know that little a little a little post of like it's like a chronological order where it's like you know there would be a Trump win something right and then you know this indictment pops up yeah the this right like or you know charges against underbiting like they always have this like rebuttal on the bullshit and it's like it's not it's not a coincidence that all these charges kind of came out at the same exact time yeah it's not a coincidence that we are in an election year that Trump is running for president he's he absolutely absolutely has the Republican seat you know and it's not there's no coincidence here this is election interference bare minimum you know and just because if he wins that doesn't make this shit going away either they're still going to be they still have to be held responsible for yeah well I think a lot more about this is going to come our way real soon yeah so we'll see man we'll see you guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think with that being said let's go check some of these out man we got some of the comments today that's like these out guys this first comment comes from at definitely not DJ 69 I will 100% be voting for Biden if win they roll

your thesis what's the thesis the thesis is very simple we have a box that people stand in front of with three feet away from their fucking face while they're hot pocket turns and circles so is it while their food is injected with radiation then they open the box where the radiation has just been shooting at their faces all in the face yes and and then they eat the food that's been like bro I'm with you now my question is all right we're talking about you know the opposite so does that are you saying that like passes through I don't fucking know bro people get sick from that shit who knows dude what we can we made a magic box you just hit a button to shake its hot does that make sense to you shouldn't it like dude we we're we're talking about that's a fire in there you know what I'm

I get it yeah like it doesn't seem it was just like a no no okay the reason I laughed guys is because it was it just seemed like you see the thing about the cell phones like cause and fucking brain tumors of people I did see that that people holding their cell phone of their ear and causing brain tumors and they see their head head and x-fucking brains all right apparently in France they banned certain cell phones because of it that's bro I want to get like a old school no keyo I just want that I don't I want to get like a old school like before cell phone cell phone right I'll have one oh

hit that bill notification and get up to date on the latest episodes coming out as well with that being said man let's keep this moving tell on number two did you see the did you see that that rally that Trump held yeah man and fucking with Jersey yeah holy hold on dude he held a rally like that every day leading up to the 2020 election for the 30 days before yeah for the whole month of October so so so if we go back in history for the whole month of October in 2020 he held a rally just like that were 50 70 thousand people showed up every single day for 30 days so let's remember that yeah I saw this yeah so the final official estimate uh the official estimate is up to 100 thousand people yeah in New Jersey yeah that's the the shocking part for me bro because New Jersey is is like is it was it maybe it was is it I don't know if it is anymore hold on is it yeah because we don't really know bro I also saw a report about the dominion's executives that the dominion machines being controlled out of Canada by Chinese executives who were on the board of dominion have the ability to change it came out this weekend so yeah I don't know man we don't really know who is what who is for what because of the amount of election bullshit these people have been able to you know fucking like dude if you go into California and you know you talk to people they're sticking this shit you know you go to New York you talk to people they're sticking this shit so how come California and New York are always fucking blue who's to say they haven't been doing this for years in those areas because they had to get those votes in order to even be competitive you know that's true you know like just because this happened on a national level allegedly allegedly doesn't mean it couldn't have been happening in those two places for the last 30 fucking years yeah so like we don't really question everything well dude that's what I'm saying we don't really know how people feel where you got you know what I'm saying like bro did you see that video where they were at Venice Beach and and there was it was like an old man and this guy was standing on top of a one of those like concrete burial pillars and he was asking people who they were going to vote for and this old man started saying I'm voting for Biden and the guys like well why are you voting for Biden very civil you know the guy couldn't give many reasons and then all the sudden dude there was like 50 people walking by and they all started to like circle them around all of them voted were one Trump you know I'm saying that's in fucking Venice Beach bro yeah you know so like I don't necessarily believe that New York and California or New Jersey I don't necessarily believe that they're all these progressive left people are Democrats I I think in some of these states like Michigan uh where you know the the auto industry has traditionally been Democrat because the democratic party has been for the working class 30 years ago right but without those guys realizing like hey that's that's not the case anymore and I think they're starting to get it now so you know fuck dude I don't know man yeah I mean do the hundred thousand people is insane here's a couple of people that's a shit ton of people hey shit ton of people yeah that's a lot but then it comes out we got polls and I promised you this is not a Trump rate I got something to cover on this but but leading up to this um we got some new polls that come out that this yellow reads New York Times poll Trump continues to dominate swing states sores with Hispanic black and young voters former president Donald Trump maintains a strong position among key swing state voters and has made historic enroads with Hispanic black and young voters New York times see NFL adelfie and choir polling found Monday Trump leads in five of the six swing states in four of the five states excluding Pennsylvania Trump's lead is outside the margin of error, meaning that if you were to fucking run the election today, Trump wins. No doubt he gets all 270 plus some. And these are in key states. Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump is dominating. Well, he remember he was dominating in 2022. He was. He was. Listen, he had the election won at fucking 12 o'clock in the morning. Hold on. I was watching it till late. Yeah. I went to bed at like 12. I wake up by doesn't winning. The fucking curve goes straight up. Remember that? Yeah, F. Yeah. Yeah. Now, with all of this stuff going on, right? Here's the interesting piece that nobody's talking about today. This headline comes out. This article comes out report Biden campaign floats virtual convention to avoid pro-Palestinian protest. Okay. Well, that's not why that's not why at all. Come on, man. Come on, man. Same reason he was in his basement during 2020 because he can't get anybody to show the fuck up for him. And that the thing, all right? So like in 2020, we use what did they use to do that? They use COVID. Yeah. Right? That they push that they can COVID was the excuse, right? Now here we are in 2024. We got all of these protests all over the country, pro-Palestinian, you know, this whole middle east debacle that's going on. And now they're saying it's going back to the basement because of those protests, which we just reported his donors are the ones supporting it. This is great. You can't make this up. President Joe Biden's campaign advisors seem to be afraid of the Democrat party's voters. As some are reportedly pushing for aspects of a virtual convention to avoid protests over the administration's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. Political politics, bureau chief Jonathan Martin reported Friday that some of Biden's closest advisors are looking to synthesize portions of a traditional convention with 2020's iteration, which was conducted virtually during the coronavirus pandemic. Good gosh, man. We're good, man. I mean, dude, this is why they don't have them campaigning because no one's going to show up. Well, not only that, Brody, that's why that's why Trump did those 30 appearances right before Election Day in 2020 because he wanted to show the physical draw versus Biden. Yeah. And they were like 15 people and fucking jeeps. Yeah. Right. And Trump's got tens of thousands. Yeah. This insane. They were in a school GM with six foot circles so they could have nine people there. Right. And so they saw again, so they pushed the COVID stuff. They enforced a lockdown to save face for Biden because you can't pull an audience. And here they go in 2024, they're about to do the exact same thing because they're scared of protesters that they paid and supported. I mean, look, man, it's a good game play. No, it ain't. It's bullshit. And everybody's going to know it this time. Yeah. You know, but I don't think that's going to stop them from trying to cheat, dude. I think they're going to fucking cheat. I don't think there's any way, any way possible. They're going to allow him to win whatever it takes because they know like I've been saying, they know what that's going to mean for them. Yeah. And it's going to mean accountability for a whole lot of people. Like a whole lot of people are going to get arrested and go to jail, including probably former presidents of this country. So. Yeah, there you go right there. This guy fucking ruined the country, dude. Well, there's a 100% Barack Obama 100% yeah, I don't even want to claim him anymore. I mean, he dude, the guy's a piece of shit. I'm going to call the committee. Yeah. Anyway, yeah, I mean, you know, they're going to run the same play, man. Yep. They're going to run the exact same play. And so I think it's just important. What would you say is we know when we actually talk about the elections themselves, right? Like what would you say is the important things that that people, we the people could be doing, both in like prep for the election and then actually get into the election day. Well, what would you say are the important things? Well, I think the first and foremost, most important is that everybody votes. All right. Like here's what happens a lot of times. A lot of people think because the candidate might have a ton of momentum, right? And they think it's an automatic. They're going to win. And they're like, well, fuck it. It doesn't really matter if I vote, you know, I got shit to do today. Blah, blah, blah. And because they think everybody else is going to vote. But when you have everybody thinking like that, that causes a problem. So I think it's very important that everybody realize that they have to vote. And if you're one of these people who believes that the election doesn't matter, and you shouldn't vote, you should still go vote. That way it can be proven that the election was fraudulent. So it's very important that people vote. I think the second thing is it's important that people make sure that there's checks and balances in their community, you know, and watching these polling centers so that people aren't dropping off, you know, 50,000 fucking votes at 4 a.m. You know, I think there's going to be a need to literally man the polling stations with people. And that could be of both parties. I think that's, you know, it's not just one party. Like people from both parties should be watching the polling stations to make sure that doesn't happen. And you know, I think I think those are the two main things that need to happen. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, do like one, I know one simple thing too. Shit. Sound off to become an election judge. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? You get a little, you get, you know, I think it's not enough for gas money, but you know, you get paid or things like, you know, you get like 200 bucks or something. So it won't be enough to cover your gas. But, um, yeah, sound off to be an election. Yeah, I think a lot of people just opt out of being involved because I think other people are going to handle it. And we can see where that's gotten this country. So anyway, if you guys remember that, yeah, right. You know, I'm saying, yeah. So I mean, those things, I think ultimately, it's a civic duty, man. I think, you know, in the time that we're in right now, you, you, you can't just trust that, you know, Joe Shmo, your neighbor is going to take care of it. Well, I really, I really believe that that's what's happening. I believe people get overconfident. They, they believe that everybody else, there's no way we can lose this. It's no different than a football team going out on the field that's 11 and 0 facing a team that's not one of game. You still got to play the fucking game or being up 30 to 0 and half time. Yeah, you can lose that game, right? And so when people start thinking, oh, well, you know, we got it in the bag. This and that, that's where bad things happen. And I think that's what we've been suffering from for quite a while. You know, people just refuse to do their part and refuse to get engaged. And I think it's important for everybody who listens to this show, regardless of how you vote. Now, you know, I think we all know most of the people on this show are going to vote for Trump. I think it's important that you go talk to people legitimately about the issues. Because I could tell you this, it's the Biden administration stays in and they somehow cheat. Our country will fail in the next four years. Our economy will collapse. You will be destitute and there will be starvation happening here. And we will be at their real country. That's, that's reality. We won't survive it. And people think that's extremism or alarmism. It's not. It's just facts. And that's coming from a person who runs multiple companies who understands the economic factors at play here. Okay. If there's no customers, there's no business. There's no business. There's no economy. And that's, that's where we're headed right now. And we got all these little communist fucks running around demanding that, you know, they get part of your wealth that you've worked your entire life for. Or, you know, if you have big dreams and you haven't created wealth, they think that you should go work for them so that they can have what the fuck you're having, even though they're not doing a goddamn thing. And this comes back to the thing that I keep talking about. People who don't pay taxes, who do not file a tax return, should not be able to vote. Most of these people don't fucking contribute. They run around waiting for the government to forgive their loans or give them some benefits or pay for their shit. And in the meantime, they don't do anything. They don't file a tax return, dude. So why the fuck are we giving them the ability to have any say in what we do? I don't think those people have, dude, I think it's a fundamental change in the voting system that needs to happen if we want to have a productive, prosperous country. You know, I also think that a lot of the financial aid that, that I think we need financial aid. I think we need programs to help people get on their feet, but I think, you know, being on those programs for your entire life is unacceptable. I think we have to, we have to have restrictions around that. And I guarantee if you put restrictions around those things and made it so people didn't weren't able to milk them for 30 years, people would figure out a way to fucking survive or they won't. And it won't matter. So like, dude, I'm, you know, at this point in time, dude, we need to get back to the capitalist roots of this country because, you know, they say trickle down economics doesn't work. No, it fucking does work. It does work when the government's not taxing the fuck out of businesses and individuals and taxing them to the point. Just below what would actually cause them to financially break, which is where we're at now. It does work when you're actually involved in the system. It does work when you're, when you work hard and you dedicate yourself. Does it work for people that don't file a tax return and sit all around all day on welfare and fuck off? No, it doesn't work for them. Okay. So, but those, those, there's enough of those people that they make an impact in the vote. And so I don't believe that I don't believe that if you're on public assistance, I don't believe that. If you have not filed a current tax return that you should be able to vote. And I think we have to put real restrictions around who can vote, you know, you know, not just voter ID, but like you're approved to vote because you filed this. You know what I'm saying? Contributing members decide that's correct, dude. We cannot allow our country to continue because why do you think they're importing? They're importing all these people, not just because they want them to replace, you know, or change the demographic of the country or just vote for Joe Biden. What's they are doing? Well, no, but they know those people are going to struggle financially. So they know that if they bring in all these people, that those people will vote not just for Biden, but they will always vote to take from the people who have earned their lives for themselves. And if they can outnumber the amount of people that are producing, they will create a true communist system. And the problem with that is that our economy will collapse privately, home business will collapse, which is what they want. And then all services, all, all goods, everything will come from government, which we've seen over and over and over again throughout history does not work. Millions of people starve and die because the government's so efficient, the government would never so inefficient. The government would never, ever, ever, ever be as efficient and effective as a privately owned business because a privately owned business has motivation to earn a profit. The government doesn't. There are bureaucracy. They don't, they don't get rewarded for doing a good job. They get what they get no matter what. So, you know, something has to change there. And if we changed it to a situation where, you know, these people that are importing, you know, now if you had someone who's paying taxes, even if they're 15 years old, I don't give a shit, let them vote, right? If they're a woman and they pay taxes, let them vote. If they're a this and they pay taxes, let them vote. You know what I'm saying? Like for real, like, I don't care, but that's fair. Yeah, because we can't have these people who aren't working, who aren't providing, who aren't contributing to the country, having a say, especially when there's becoming more and more and more of them because they're importing them now. It's a conflict of interest. It totally did bear minimums. It's not right. Yeah. Yeah. Well, guys, jumping on this conversation down in the comments, let us know what you guys think. That being said, let's get to our third and final headline. Hadline number three. Hello, number three reads farmers will now get paid to test their dairy cows for bird flu. Now, this is an interesting one. Stay with me, guys, because I want to, I want to, let's connect some dots here. Sandy, headline article continues. Federal authorities on Friday pledged nearly $200 million in an attempt to control the spread of bird flu on dairy forms. Some of that money would go directly to forms to help them reduce the spread of the virus, cover veterinary and cost and compensate farmers who've lost milk because of sick cows. The money is also intended to encourage testing of both dairy cows and the people who work closely with them. A key step experts say in understanding the true scope of bird flu also known as H5 and one across the United States, in sensitive work very well to get a better understanding of epidemiology said, Caitlin, Jenna Lena, who tracks illnesses for a website called your local epidemiologist right now. There is no requirement for dairy cows to be tested unless they're being moved across state lines, according to a recent federal order. Otherwise, the decision is left to the farmers. Now, during a press briefing Friday, agriculture, secretary Tom Vilsack said around 80 cows had been tested since the order went into effect. The USDA spokesperson later clarified that since the order went into effect, an additional 80 test have been conducted daily as a Friday, 42 herds in nine states, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota, Ohio and Texas had been affected by the outbreak. Quote, those 42 family farm operations are suffering and we want to make sure we're there to provide help and assistance of Vilsack state. The USDA will offer 98 million dollars to affected farms over the next four months, which could equate to as much as $28,000 per farm Vilsack set. Now, again, farmers will now get paid to test the dairy cows for this bird flu. Okay. Now, we got to go back. We got to go back to like 20, 20, 20, 21. Do you remember people being able to get paid to the new COVID test? Right? Yeah. A decent amount of money, almost $200 a test. Some places, depending on what state you guys are in, this is actually from straight from the Department of Health and Human Services. Their own HHS.gov website talking about this. Now, what was the, that was an issue with with the COVID test. What was it with the the the the PCR test, the cycle rate and the PCR test was turned up to such a rate where if you even had like one little molecule of a virus, not enough, not enough viral load to actually get you sick, it would still test you positive. Yeah. It's almost a direct code. And then they stuff. Yeah. And then they took the case numbers and made the so what they did was, if you guys remember, they incentivized doctors, offices and organizations to PCR test their people. And then they took those test results from the cycle rate that was turned up super high, which like I said, would detect an amount of virus that didn't have the viral load to actually get someone sick. It would turn out as a positive COVID test. And then they took that and they created the hysteria around COVID. Okay. So what this sounds like to me is they're doing the same thing with bird flu. So they're going to they're going to provide these tests. You know, they're going to cycle the rate up. They're going to say, look at this bird flu outbreak. And then they're going to create a massive fucking situation where likelihood, what they'll probably do is they'll say, it's time to kill all these animals, right, which will create a fucking situation where we're starving. This dude, the fucking paintings on the hall. Yeah. I mean, listen, like I mean, and that's not just us saying that. I mean, this is I wouldn't be surprised if they put the fucking virus in the mother fucking tests. Dude, to get them into the fucking system. We'll saw this and there's some interesting things with this. By the way, this is the article from New York time or New York, yeah, New York times. Your coronavirus test is positive. Maybe it shouldn't be where they go in detail when they talk about that specifically. Stating how in three sets of tested data that included cycle, cycle thresholds, right? Compiled by officials and Massachusetts, New York and Nevada up to 90% of people testing positive carried barely any virus and care though. They just wanted to scare the fuck out of people and create hysteria so that they could justify the state of emergency, which took away our rights. Now, and let me ask you the question. When you incentivize the behavior, what do you get? The behavior more of it. Yeah, right? And so if they're incentivizing, now, now let's pay attention to who's actually being affected by this. Cause I think that's also very, very important. We're not talking about, you know, these big mass of, you know, corporate forms. What are we talking about? 42 family farm operations. Small business, small family farms where I'm sure that these cows are, yeah, they're going to go through and they're going to say all these little farms got to destroy their cattle, destroy their livestock. They're going to put them out of business. They're going to leave the court, the big corporate farming operations out of it. And then when the farmers can't pay their fucking farms off because they can't pay their property tax, the government's going to recompensate the land, which is what they're doing to create the idea of you will own nothing and you will be happy. This is how the government reclaims, quote unquote, property. It's not really reclamation in the first place because you don't own your property, right? Like even if you have your property paid off, you still got to pay the government to own your property. Fuck that. Yeah. Okay. No, but here's the scheme. It's a scheme. Yeah. We don't own shit as individuals, right? We pay fucking 40% income tax plus all the other tax we pay, which equals way over 50% when we add it all up. Then we pay if we decide to build something with our life, they want us to pay a 40% capital gains tax, which means if I build a billion dollar business, I got to pay them $400 million just because it means that they're my partner. Fuck you. You're not my partner. Then out of that 600 million, I get to keep when I die, they get 65% of it. Okay. This is the system that we live in. People do not understand the tax code. We are not free. We are fucking slaves. And this is just another example. It's almost in the exact parallel example of what they did to small businesses owned by the middle class during COVID, but now they're doing it with farms. And so, you know, this is what they're going to try to do. And four years ago, what they tried to do and they did this in Canada and they did this in Europe to a lot of people until the farmers fucking got sick of it. They increase, they remember the supply chain issues. Well, they caused massive fertilizer increases and massive feed increases and massive fuel. These farms barely make a profit, bro. They pay it in a good time. Yes. And these people understand that if they turn up the expenses on these farmers, that these farms are going to go out just like these small businesses were, and the government's going to actually end up owning them again. So, you know, that's that's how I see this playing out. Dude, and it's so interesting, man, because they're running this play right now. And again, guys, like, listen, this is a specie little show, right? We just try to connect the dots. How we see him. But that, that makes sense. Yeah. It's what? Well, that's because that's what they do. Exactly. It's not a conspiracy. They fucking do this. Like, this is what the fuck they do. Like, this is what they do. This is what they're doing. They're doing this is other play. We are part of the world economic forum agenda here in the United States. They're already doing this all through Western Europe. That's remember all those farmers that revolted. That's what the shit's about. Okay. It was all the farming restrictions that were creating a situation where farmers couldn't operate. And they were going to lose their fucking farms up in Canada. They've been doing this to farmers for the last four years. And many of these farmers have lost their land, had their land reclaimed by the fucking Canadian government, which is total communist government already. And, and dude, now they're trying to do it here. And the reason that we're behind everybody in this agenda is because we are fucking guns. So they can't come in and just force us like they've been doing in Europe and like they've been doing in Canada. They have to inch it forward. And so yeah, dude, I think this is a much bigger story than people are paying attention to because what will happen is that when they start testing these cattle, they will say, there's a huge massive bird flu outbreak on all these family farms. And then they will say these big corporate farms are immune from it. And they were fucking straight up do that, bro. And they'll remove the ability to get truly farm grown, farm raised beef. And then I will be able to get is their bullshit. And then if we don't want to, if they decide they don't want us to have meat, all they got to do is stop selling to us. You know, and by the way, we all know what the kind of meat we get from those fucking places. We get the bullshit. We get all the fucking chemicals and all the shit injected into them, right? Like dude, but it's a big move to do it. Like I know a lot of government should not be involved at all in your ability to buy locally grown food or meat at all. They have no right to be involved in that. No, no, no, no, I know, I know quite a few people. Um, that that have done the whole, you know, like local, own locally sourced stuff like the raw milk and stuff like that. I don't know to meet people like local to me. I would like to do that stuff. Bro, it's all over. Is it my tailor? Really? Yeah. Cause I mean, like dude, there's a big movement. You know what I'm saying? But now this appears to be like the threat to kind of kind of quash that. You know, most people have never even had like a fault, like an actual state, bro. All they've gotten is these bullshit antibiotic fucking hormone and do steaks. They've never had a real steak. They've never had a real steak from a real cow that has been raised the right way. They've never had an elk steak that someone just like shot in the fucking woods and brought it straight to the table. Like dude, I'm not a hunter, but I've had good elk steaks for my buddies. They sent them to me. Fuck. Well, you guys are like dude, and this is shit. We can provide for ourselves, right? And this is this is the biggest case for hunting in my opinion. You know, you guys know, I'm not a hunter, but mainly because I love animals. And if I have to and shit gets weird, I'm going to go kill some fucking animals. Cause like, I'm not going to starve. But, uh, but at the end of the day, you know, these people shouldn't be involved in the, in the ability, it should be total capitalism. It should be, if you want to buy it, if I want to buy my, my cows from my father and law out of his farm, I can do that. If I want to buy them from the grocery store, from one of the big global corpse, I can do that. And when they should be allowed to compete on even playing field. And because these motherfuckers have so much money, they're creating all these rules. And dude, nothing about this is good for us. And so we have to get into place where we all understand what's actually going on. There is a very anti human. It's not just anti American. It's anti human being agenda that part of the population is like, just screaming and support for like, dude, this is not about green earth. This is not about like, dude, we had a, uh, curse powers on who's written two different, produce two different very, very good movies, agenda and agenda too, which you can get on Amazon, talk about the, the green movement and the, the, uh, what the fuck do they call it? The eco movement or whatever the fuck that, you know, Greta Thumbert, what she call it like the new green deal and all that fucking idiot shit climate change. Yeah. Bro, do you understand that if we eliminate all the carbon dioxide production, do you know what happened to the plants? Like, do you not remember like in the fucking first science class you ever took where it said trees make oxygen. Humans make carbon dioxide, which feed the trees. Like if you really want the fucking plants and the, the trees to grow properly, you need carbon dioxide for that to fucking happen. And like these fucking idiots who are, you know, they're being straight up lied to, you know, cause dude, everybody cares about the environment. We all care about the environment, but you fucking it is just don't know how it works. So like, I want to save the planets, but save the trees by killing them off. That's whatever, dude. Like, but that's it's just the whole environmental movement is a, is, is a vessel for communism globally. And, you know, and people buy it. Yeah. Yeah. Guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. And that's not down there. I like cows. I like to eat them. I grow up. Listen, yeah, I fucking get to take up. Yeah. I fuck you. Bro, I like him as animals too. But I'm not gonna stop eating them. I want what's the, what's the, what's the, the hairy one name like the curly Helen? Yeah, the island. Yeah, I want a high one cow. Yeah. They're like cool. I'll tell you I'll take the pull out. I would have a cow. I would have pet cows that I wouldn't eat, but I would eat other people's cows. Oh, I'll eat somebody else's cow in a minute. Yeah. It's the way it is. Those are my cows. They're all my fucking squad, bro. I'm not eating them. Yeah. But I want one of those high one cows, man. Those things look just cool. Yeah, they do. They look so cool. Yeah. I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be opposed to getting the dairy cows and shit, but you know, I'm lactose, bro. Milk fucks me up. That's it. My bad. You're a pretry at whole milk, bro. Well, I use the, the, the fair life shit or the raw milk, I mean, we'll see. That's what I was about to say. Cause like I heard people say like, but like I'm still like bro, listen, it's bad. Yeah. Well, like I go listen, I will clear this whole building down. You know what I'm saying? Can you give me some real milk? Yeah, I know. You're the only guy I know that takes shit to last over an hour. Anyway, yeah. Well, you know, this is very dangerous and people should pay attention to the story because this is how they, they recompensate land and eliminate food supply and create dependency on the government. And maybe a few of you have a good idea. That's right. Yeah, that's real bad. Guys, that was a third and final headline. Let's get into our final segment of the show. As always, thumbs up or dumb as fuck. This is where we bring a headline up. We talk about it. It'll get one of those two options. So that being said, let's get into this. Andy, let me ask you a question. Are you a, do you like pranks? Well, as long as they're not on pranks on me. Oh, okay. So you like, I like them on other people. Gotcha. Yeah. Have you, did you, because I feel like, like, where I know the high school, you may have my fucker. Everybody ever prank me. You know, anybody that's ever prank me? No. I don't. That's because they're dead. I feel like I feel like I know the high school you went to. Did you all do any like, like, like senior pranks and shit? Did you have a, they did, but I didn't do that. You didn't participate. Is that just like you pleading a fifth or like, no, I don't, I mean, like this. Shit's not like dude. Not a big prank guy. No, the prank dude, did you see the one I sent you that fucking deer in the golf course? Oh, that's funny. And because that's exactly what I got here. Oh, this is fucking good. Bro, this is how I read the get the fuck out of here. Golfers just about killed their paupal with the fake snake on the string. Now this is one that I laughed my ass off. But if it had happened to me, you'd all be dead. No fucking question, bro. I do not fuck with fucking snake. I get it. I get it. The headlight article reads, it says, there's a fine line between pranking your paupal and elder abuse. So the golfers in this video are writing that line with this fake snake on a string prank. This officially, it's a little cruel to do something like this who an older gentleman who is just trying to enjoy a day out of the golf course. Unefficiently, this is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. This is one of those videos where you laugh, your, you know what off as you simultaneously feel bad for the person. That's the butt of the joke. When the footage first picks up, the older man is giggling about something. I'm assuming he just got done wrapping up a world class dad joke. But he stops laughing pretty fast when his friends warn him that a snake is going after his feet. In reality, one of the golfers had attached the snake to the man's pants with some fishing line. So I was dragging behind him. It's tough to tell that though when you are the person getting pranked in the heat of the moment, here's a video. Here's a clip.
