What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the realist thing about the show. We have a very special guest here on the show today who's been on the show before. Mr Curtis Bowers what's happening brother? Not too much thanks so much for having me back. Yeah it's good to see you. What brings you to town you guys are touring huh? Touring is speaking at some different events and things. Yeah. How's that going? It's going well really great turnouts and so many new people kind of awakening to all this. Something's going on man. Yeah so they're wanting answers and so it's been great me able to communicate with them. That is interesting. People do seem to be waking up to I was going to ask you that. Like do you feel like people are starting to realize what is actually going on? I think it's been so dramatic for several years now four or five years of just thing after thing coming up that it's just shaken people to to awaken from their sleep and yes I'm shocked. I go back to the same places I've spoken before and when I ask him to raise their hand if they've seen my movies or anything three people out of 400 people have even seen them. So they've they're just newly awakened people going something's going on man. Yeah this tells you what's going on it. It's been going on for a long time but a lot of people didn't notice it until it just was in our face like it is now. Now for those of you guys who haven't seen Curtis on the show before he's been on and he produced and developed two films that are based around the communist subversion and the communist revolution that is happening worldwide and here in America and the films are called agenda and agenda too and I believe they can be found on Amazon correct. That's correct. Yeah so if you guys want you guys should watch these films they are super super super impactful and really break down a good job of what we're seeing happen in society. So when you meet these people these bigger crowds one thing I notice when I because I have a lot of clips from the show you know go out on the internet and you know when I talk about communism a lot of people are they will say things like you don't even know what communism is you know this is this is so ridiculous you're so far off base like open a history book you're the fascist yeah right yeah and so you know can we talk a little bit about that about why people have such a hard time recognizing in your opinion what's going on. Yes that's a key thing what happened is in 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down and then in December of 91 the Soviet Union dissolved the whole world said communism's dead it's done it's over we won and so it's the most clever strategic scheme that's ever been done they literally were able to convince the world they no longer exist so they had free reigns to do whatever they want and they knew anyone that said I think these people are communist or Marxist would be laughed at by society because they say what are you talking about the Berlin Wall came down that that thing's over a lot of people don't realize in 1984 five years before the wall came down a KGB agent that had defected to America and a totally Galitson he had written a book called new lies for old and he said in the book five years before the wall came down I wouldn't be surprised if they take down that wall because they're trying to convince you communism is no longer around and and he said this and then when it happened we're all oh man this is awesome but he said no they're going to do this because they want you to believe it's over so they can keep marching through the institutions and and and breaking down the structure especially in America so they can have conquest of the world and it's what's happened and so yes so it's they were so effective that most people even on our side that are conservative minded that love this country thought communism what are you talking about man that's overweat even though today there's still almost two billion people living under communist rule in the world and they're slaughtering their people they're abusing anyone that stands against them in China all the different religious groups the Christians the fallen gong the uh weger muslims are there are concentration camps they're being their body parts are being sold to the highest bidder and they're harvesting their organs this is going to right now today all over China and yet we buy all our products from them we prop them up all the funds they're getting from all of our products and all of our is going to build their military and it's it's just something that again I think some people are ready to hear that now they weren't five years ago what are you talking about but they're more and more ever since I made the first movie in 2010 uh when I kind of laid this out and I showed the hundred year agenda of this this isn't new it's just they've been so successful we're seeing the fruit of their work we're seeing hey well why are they teaching this junk in the schools and why is this going on and why is our own state department totally anti-American and everything they do what what's happening and and so that's what people have awakened to see but that that's the main reason why is because that most people don't understand to set up that communist society when you're trying to take over free enterprise capitalist system that is so productive you have to first transition the size of government to be big enough to become socialist before you can actually be communist so Lenin himself said the founder of the Soviet Union said socialism is the road to communism we have to first go there why because in a free enterprise capitalist system like we have today you own the business you have the wealth you have the employees you have all the the means of production and they know it's hard to come against those people they have a lot of power but if we can keep growing big government to slowly regulate more and drive up the cost of things where we slowly start and getting big business you know to be monopolies where it's hard for anybody to compete and we we do this slowly as the government gets those rains of power then once you're kind of a socialist system it's much easier to step into communism because then the government's already got the healthcare system it's already got the you know the check that everyone's dependent on it's already got access and so slowly then it becomes totalitarian quickly and if you study the 20th century and look at all the countries that the communist took over that's how they did it they didn't just march in with the troops most of the time they stirred up the young college students and things to push for socialism and they complained about whoever the leader of the country was he's not perfect we need to get rid of him and then they would put up their puppet like the perfect example is Cuba with Castro they put him up no he's for the people and the people vote into power someone that has different plans but they don't let you know that until they've already got about six months into power you've got all the levers of control now the fire and squads come out and that's exactly what happened in Cuba in every single country they took over and so right now that's what's happening in America they're just getting more and more control through the environmental movement of different things where the governments in charge of energy it's in charge of healthcare it's trying to get a digital currency a digital IDs where they're just more and more controls it has so then you have a podcast that doesn't go alone to get along with the narrative they just go you just lost your bank account good luck and we signed Canada a couple of years ago at the tracker convoy so it's the model there's several countries that are further down the road than us and we need to wake up and realize no that's where they're taking us to those are testing grounds okay how are we going to do this when we close the bank accounts how much backlash is there how much you know they're studying these things carefully because they absolutely have the goal that Lenin said set back in the 1920s he said we will have world communism and these people are so committed I've read their books and things I'm shocked just totally satanically committed to this cause of world communism and that's what we're seeing the fruit of it all these things that don't make sense it's these Marxists that have embedded themselves in these institutions and and and they're pushing everything anti-American things that will take America down you know so so this is to tie this together if we zoom out on this you said it doesn't make sense to people but it does if you zoom out you're right absolutely when you look at what happened during covid where they put all these small businesses out of business okay and they transferred all the wealth to the wealthiest people when you look at what they've done in terms of inflating the currency you know since 2020 the dollar has lost 25% of its buying power in the United States okay and then you look at what's happening with the housing market where we have these big huge funds that are buying up residential houses to create an artificial uh scarce scarcity bubble yeah around the inventory which is driving the price up and making homes unaffordable all right and what then when we see on top of that and we see this in Canada and the US where they're making farming supplies so expensive that farmers can't operate their farms and if they can't operate their farms they can't pay their notes or their taxes and if they can't pay their taxes the government re-confinscates their property so if we look at all of those things together that's the people are like why is this happening why is this happening why is this happening well it's happening because the next step of what communism is is that they confiscate personal property and people have a hard time connecting all those dots but if you zoom out and you watch over the last five or six years and then you zoom out even further and you watch over the last 15 20 years it becomes very apparent what they're trying to do when you look at the removal of competition amongst young men especially okay participation trophies when you look at cancel culture this culture that they've been still that if you don't tow the line we're going to fire you from your job when you look at political correctness we can no longer speak facts because it offends people all right when we look at silent majority we can't speak up because you know we're the silent majority all of these things fit together to create a situation where you have to tow the line and we remove personal property from the equation forcing 100 you know tens of millions of middle class Americans into poverty who are now dependent on universal basic income type programs which makes them a slave to the government and it's very clear to me when when you look at it zoomed out but people really do have a hard time connecting the dots yeah well I mean I think that's the thing too it's like you know what the saying is you know the greatest trick that the devil ever played you know what's convincing people it exists bro and also they move DJ you know they've been they've been you know they're are fucking kids can't even pass math tests they're like one of the lowest education systems in the world people people are like oh it's this woke shit yeah it is but that's intentional because they do not want people to come out and be able to provide for themselves because it creates more people for dependency on their programs which allows them like you said for the government to get so big that they can create a socialistic state that's right no that's what it is and so they're all purposeful but yeah if you don't if you're looking at individually it's like why are the school such a failure I always tell it's not a failure it's accomplishing exactly what it was designed to do exactly right that's the thing people need once you see that though then it really helps you engage in this battle rise though these are enemies of our country that are purposely working and that these strategies were all drawn out in dark fill rooms in the 30s and 40s in America if you read from the Frankfurt School the founders of that there were geniuses of strategy in an evil way how are we going to take this thing down in the country and they talked about okay we're going to do this with the educational system and dumb the kids down we're going to work toward getting rid of the one room schoolhouse so we want to age segregate peer group everything a lot of people don't know this Karl Marx came up with this idea if you age segregate peer group where your whole life you're just with your age group it makes you uncomfortable with anyone that's older or younger and so it separates you out but we're all by yourself and you're hanging around people that are simply as dumb as you are because if you're 12 and you're all your friends are 12 when you ask them something they're going to I don't know I don't know what do you think we also see this with the end of desegregation okay like when I was in school they had desegregation programs where the inner city kids would come out and they would they would blend the school together so that you all learned each other's culture and you learned how to get along and they took right after I graduated high school they took that away at least here in Missouri they said that was a nice thing it's like and then you look at what happens when they try to bring it back with things like you know school choice it immediately gets removed day one by and well now we have a generation of young people that believe they're fighting some sort of civil rights movement because their whole life they've been kept away from the black community and they don't realize that the older generation has already we've fought these battles right like we've we're cool like that's right yeah I think to the more important I mean a very simple question you could actually self you know for anybody that you know is not able to zoom out and look at it from macro level is like okay well like let's say this the whole point of all of this stuff everything we just mentioned was not communism let's say that was not the thing behind it right but if it was would anything be done differently all the steps that they've made would anything be done differently would you do anything differently no it don't you wouldn't at all but but what I have loved studying is when you go back you see they did write this stuff out which is shocking even to me where you can find the list in the communist goal right you go wait a minute in 1958 goal 17 was use the schools as transmission belts for socialism and soften the curriculum so you go oh 70 years ago they're talking about we got to soften this curriculum dumb them down and then start teaching socialist ideas where they sound good like that's fair that's just who's not for that we want socialism but that's so as you see that that's what it's kind of like wow it was so purposeful you mentioned Andy political correctness that's from the Frankfort school in 1930s America and they called it back then cultural Marxism it's where you hamstring the culture from speaking and saying things that are true because you make them off limits and you change the definition of words so it's hard to communicate with people or you're you're saying one thing and then it sounds racist to someone else you're like no I'm not racist what are you talking about but they've they changed the definitions they teach the kids that you know justice is bad but social justice is good and so it just confuses everybody where it's hard to communicate and it's hard to pull the kids out of this dream world they've been raised in yeah to let them see the lot it makes it makes them ineffective adults yes that's it's a it's a super handicap that's right you know um it's sad too man because because when when someone's you know we can argue all day long about what's fair what's not fair this that the other but at the end of the day the reality is the reality and if you handicap someone with the mentality that everything should be fair and everything's never been fair for thousands of years it's never been it's never worked it's never been fair for so you think that you're gonna pout your whole life and it's going to become fair because you want it to be fair it's not fucking fair man and you got to work hard and you sometimes depending on where you come from in life you got to work a little harder and that's just the reality how it is yeah and and America has proven though as it works it works even people don't speak the language they come here from you know Vietnam or whatever escaping communism and in 10 years they're wealthy successful people and they didn't even know the language yeah they didn't have a dollar in their pocket when they came but they said I'm gonna work hard and so that's what I love about America and that's why I hate when the liberals in the left preaches the lies you can't make it it's unjust it's unfair to the people the young people in our country you need a government handout you need when they don't need anything you need to get to work you need to have character they need to build skill sets exactly and be diligent and it's still the land of opportunity but they're trying to dismantle that as quickly as possible because they hate that yeah that's why we're in the the race war thing that's why they had to do that Marxism always usually was based on class and he'd always hit the poor people against the rich people but in America they learned back in the 40s and 50s they can wait a minute in America it's so easy to change classes it's so easy to yeah you may be born poor but then you start a business and now you're wealthy we're losing our people so we gotta go with something you cannot change and that's when the 60s they really started going after the black community and say okay we need to make them disgruntled and discontent and try to stir up this tension here because those are going to be our foot soldiers if we can get them to be involved what we're doing it and so that's that's what they've done in America that's why we see so much of this when we'd really battle through the racism that was there and really by the 80s and 90s when I was going up no one even thought about that kind of stuff yeah at all everybody was cool yeah and we and we admired the black community they're great in athletics they're great at music they're great at everything yeah we know we admired that we didn't like oh black person we like we love the black people and that was easy to do because United States is one of the only multi multi cultural countries like that you know most countries quite honestly because people don't travel they don't understand that most countries are way more racist the United States most countries do not like people from the outside coming in and they're very vocal about it no you go to Europe and you talk to people in Belgium or you talk to people in Italy or you talk to people anywhere they're like dude fuck them they don't belong here this is our fucking country and that's they're very open about saying that and so because we have a melting pot of cultures that was obviously a a soft spot for them to attack right because we're one of the only countries that has that in America is the only country in the world when you move there and become a citizen you become an American yeah you go move to France and you're not a French man you know are you moved to Canada you're not a Canadian yeah they would say no you're not Canadian you might live in Canada but you're not a Canadian and you know what's interesting to do and I'm thinking about right now when you're saying this about the the propagation of fairness in the school system is that if we take into account human nature and people's want and desire to find excuses for why they haven't made it a lot of these gripes and complaints about racism and you know class warfare they are made by people who are unwilling to try they are made by people to justify their position in life and so human nature lends itself to that to that sort of cultural weapon yes and then the school system is preparing them to fail right because it's not even a good education it's teaching them to wine and complain and being active as for the climate or for this or for that and so it's setting up the parameters where they know they won't be successful because they don't have character they don't have the ability to be successful because the school system hasn't prepared them for life like it should in a healthy school system where it's rigorous reading writing arithmetic and you're being challenged and you're being motivated they took all that out purposefully because then they know these people and then really through in the immorality that's back in the 30s the Frankfurt School talked about that extensive I want Republic yeah in Germany yeah you just you get the you get the the citizenry really immoral and everything starts collapsing the family structure everything and so there's no stability there and everyone's thinking about themselves and so but but the school system why are they teaching all that garbage turkish it's a purposeful agenda to make them people that are simply not capable of providing for themselves you know what's interesting when you talk about the 1930s Germany is that when you talk about that and people people and you say okay they were doing this they were doing this they were doing mother daughter prostitution child prostitution the first trans sexual operations total moral decay at the at the deepest level right when you talk about that and then you talk about 1930s Germany people associate that with Nazi behavior that wasn't the Nazis that did that bro that was the communist that did that and people don't understand that communist did all that crazy shit and that's why Stalin and Hitler were at war so people don't know their history and they don't really understand that you had a fight between the Nazis and the communists going on in Germany that's right yeah and that's why then John Dewey who loved the communist he the founder of our government schools he brought the Frankfurt School which were all communist but they were in Germany once Hitler was getting power that he brought them all over to America and put them down at all of our top universities bring them here and their stated purpose as it says in the movie but it's shocking when you hear it if you're not aware of this Willie Munsonberg said we're going to make the West so corrupt it stinks yeah that's a quote from what fuck dude you mean a San Francisco yeah yeah no it just it collapses on itself eventually and that was the point all the the people that had been set on world government set on totalitarian control new a hundred years ago if we whoever want to achieve this America's got to go we we have to dismantle this city on a hill that is making the whole world going to be like America instead of want to just wall or you know around in socialism yeah I think we are the last stop too oh yeah I mean yes because I mean most other countries like you said a lot of other countries are much more further along that path than we are I think we're like the last you know we're the big boss fight at the end of the video game you know why you think that is in what ways what do you mean what's because we got guns man oh yeah well I mean yeah I mean more than other things I mean that's a big big reason to help stop some shit yeah yeah it's in real life you look at our founding the Christian foundations whether people are Christians or not you should be grateful for Christianity it gave people the moral framework to be faithful in families to raise the next generation to to see the life is much more than about yourself it's about the next generation the next generation to think selflessly for the future like the pilgrims when they first came half of them died within four months of landing here you think what a failure they said no no no if you read their diaries which I have they said if our grandchildren live free and are able to follow God like we want them to we're willing to sacrifice our lives I mean they were just thinking about the future they were not thinking about today and so but that framework and then the guns of course because our founders knew you got to have a way to protect these rights yeah or they're meaningless those two things have preserved that's so much longer than you would think we would have lasted with the attack that's been going on for a hundred years yeah wow man wow I'm gonna do some cruising yeah yeah let's get into it let's get into it guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to any for seller dot com guys can find them link there before we get to our headlines man it's a sad day is it yeah I would say died yesterday technically did you see this I would say something died no I hadn't I bet on the road traveling yeah I would say something dead at 76 after cancer battle yeah just sucks he was innocent man you know was he there's no there's no way for that's always just to say that it piss you off yeah oh J Simpson dead man oh J Simpson who became one of the most infamous figures in the US during his murder trial in the 90s has died after a cancer battle the former NFL star died Wednesday in Las Vegas his family confirmed he was 76 they put out a statement on Twitter quote on April 10th our father or in thought James Simpson succumbed to his battle with cancer he was

you see this this is real bro that's absolutely real you never seen that no though that's real bro that was a fucking like a CNN interview or something I'm gonna tell you this though he's having a bad day right now he's like shit man it's a lot hotter down here and I thought it was yeah maybe I shouldn't have done that yeah he's like you gotta send me a window unit from a room down here I know AC down there bro yeah oh man no anybody that was alive back then to watch that unfold of course he's guilty you don't run when you're talking guilty you don't do all what everything he did it was crystal clear yeah you think they'll do the procession like his you know recreate the should be a Bronco bro that's what I'm saying make the hurts like a white Bronco man we're gonna be down there with them make it fun of some do the did you died oh fuck man you're going to hell man yeah we are we'll see you OJ see you soon oh man yeah RIP OJ I didn't realize he was that old yeah he looked good yeah I mean you look good it doesn't even look like him though no yeah maybe yeah maybe I don't know guys just let us know down in the comments what you guys think did he do it let us know or just what do you think you think you did it yes oh man guys just keep moving got headlight number one let's dive into these head line number one this is an interesting one headline number one reads we'll be Goldberg Republicans want to bring slavery back yeah it's always something you know and I think I got some context here because I think it's important to kind of piece these things together so let's dive through through headline number one we'll be Goldberg told her co-host Wednesday on ABC's the view that some Republicans would like to bring slavery back during the panel discussion of the Arizona Supreme Court rulings reinstating in 1864 abortion ban co-host Alyssa Faragriffin said quote I believe a lot of elected Republicans are completely out of step with the sentiment of the country because we've seen in Kansas a very red state Ohio and Kentucky the Republicans turned out to protect access to abortions so this is a big win for the Democrats I believe in the election here's a clip take a look at the things that they're rolling back remember I said ages ago you know they in their minds they want to bring slavery back they're okay with it because you see things change you know one of the good things about the Supreme Court is you can fight to make sure you make stuff better you don't generally fight to make stuff worse or to me or to roll back and to me if you're okay rolling that back when things were not even a state when we had no say yeah so how's that going to roll how's that going to roll what what's the next thing because you know on this with all of this comes birth control right with all of this comes everything that you need as a woman to have have have had put in place to make sure that we were doing better than we were yeah so slavery and abortion pretty much the same thing now it's interesting because that's all this string she can't even she can't even articulate her point no she can't even articulate why she thinks abortion should be allowed she's sitting here and she's like because women need the rights before and then she moves on because the answer to that question is women need those rights because they don't exercise restraint with their sexual behavior okay that's the truth but the fact that she's she's stepping around the whole issue it's 80% of plan parenthoods her in minority neighborhoods potential is a intentional plan to eliminate the human weeds as Margaret Sanger the founder would say and she which she's she's right out Margaret Sanger's referring to black people yes of course and but then this sell out to the black community this people like that's like no that's we have a right to kill our own children so we depopulate herself from off the earth it's so crazy it just it's it's but that's what when you when you have a worldview that is nothing but lies you're just in a mess yeah you just have to keep digging the whole deeper and deeper and deeper but yeah I I see it's also offensive to me how the the black people they do put up to represent the black community are always imbosols like that yeah yeah they don't put up the Thomas soul or the Alan keys or the these guys that are geniuses yeah yeah geniuses Ben Carson's and stuff they put up a shame those people no they're do it that's shows how racist they are they know what they're doing yeah 100% they're laughing they're mocking the black community by putting these people up as here's the best and brightest of the black community when it's the lowest level you could possibly get yeah 100% man and they're there though that's bad news man what slavery's coming back yeah you don't listen I'm just I was just getting used to this like you know being free being free and stuff not as oppressed but you know you could you could take care of the papers are right huh you can get my papers I don't think I'm a lot of comment on that I ain't going back man it is I'm right listen bro I love you man I love AC yeah you know I'm saying I got a pre-fat check with you know I'm saying we ain't gonna let that happen hey we better we better go vote for Biden then it's like we's coming back I'm saying that's what it's about yeah that's what it's all about right there what you just say it's just a mindless meaningless attack because that's all they have to offer they can't tell you what they're for yeah how they're gonna make the country better yeah it's just attack opposition anybody believes this shit for real that's the interesting thing so I mean this is the end of the day we got we got to recognize this for what it is it's propaganda yes right these are she's a fucking traitor bitch yeah 100% and I can't fucking stand her here that's not even what we gober is not even her fucking name your name's Karen which is fitting her name dumb ass oh that's moving dumb ass but there's a trend here right because this was a push that just happened all at the same time let's connect some dots here for you so you got what we goberg saying that Kamala Harris she comes out and agrees the 2024 could genuinely be the last democratic election if Trump wins yeah and she puts that out and then you got Cory Booker Trump has created unimaginable chaos and suffering in our country now let me let me look at these people talking about let's do a poll let's see something okay so you got you got we'll be gobert Kamala Harris Cory Booker what do they all have in common they're dumb as fuck outside of that they're black are all black right this is a propaganda guy's purely black well yeah I mean yeah he's yeah but uh this is a you a black it's a propagation push right and and their goal is to try to fear monger the black community like they always typically do because they know that a lot of black communities are a woken I'm a woken to bullshit yeah I'm a fallen no more man not falling for it and uh and and we got some proof uh this we go to this first uh headline black supported to Donald Trump at Chick-fil-A stop I don't care what the media tells you we support you this is an awesome video uh former president Donald Trump was greeted by enthusiastic supporters at a Chick-fil-A in Atlanta Georgia of all places while on the campaign trail in order 30 milkshakes and chicken for everybody video shows the former president speaking to workers at the location um here's the clip you know and it's not it's not even just that that way I mean it was my everybody likes Trump man yeah let's let's go to grandpa g everybody starting to everybody starting to like him again like they liked him before 2016 I think it's even more yeah it's even more let's check in with grandpa g to see what he has to say like Joe Biden came hard to remember what the fuck he just said Trump coming at you had rear Trump on chair at the end this is the United States y'all ain't fucking nothing over here y'all don't fuck with us we don't fuck with you if you fuck with us I got something for you hey and don't come here to butt too when Donald Trump was in the end of the niggas fight with the swan whoa every bitch with ease huh you know he's telling the truth dude because of that outfit oh bro listen that outfit that is

spell beoch bee och let's hear it that's that america that's a question system that's a question are you on team whoopie or team Andy yeah that's what I'm saying team Andy and DJ and Curtis yeah guys jump down to the comments let us know what you guys thought or think and with that being said let's move on to cruising some comments we got a couple of them here for you today okay uh this first comment comes from at uh j tetra 83 hey Andy I think it's about time DJ gets another trophy he's made you laugh pretty good at least twice since his last trophy stop being a hoe and give that man his reward much love to you both you wrote that shit I did not write this yes this is a real comment that is not real it's real no the people are spoken just saying what do you think madat madat's a judge of the trophies bro I've had some fire why am I having to defend myself right now well you know what it is what's that I know exactly what it is it's systemic it's systemic in nature it's systemic Bosnia and he's black I'm sorry Curtis I'm sorry these guys man these guys this is not you uh we got another comment this comes from at Justin Anderson uh this is actually a suggestion let's see what you think about this one Andy uh I think what would be hilarious is for Andy to have a segment called soft af where he wears glasses and a cardigan and speak real softly into the mic to answer some of these questions being super passive aggressive and fake catering to these soft people I don't know if he has that acting capability but I'd enjoy it no fucker I can do anything I'm from Missouri dude we can do anything throw him a metal light I hope my beard I like this yeah hold my beard I like this you might see soft af coming up real soon all right all right well there you go you have to participate too though I gotta do it's gotta be both of us oh that's right yeah okay we get costumes what do I wear huh what do I wear I don't know probably something that like one of these you probably gotta put like purple hair on or some shit get some I have to put the purple hair on why do I gotta have pronouns that one that's not part of the planet I got it why do somebody has to have him somebody's gotta have him I can okay no this might work I can read the questions as that as that person as the she she she she's ham should as them yeah this is easier what it Curtis what should take all those pronouns and shit it's it's another just how many of society it's it's nonsense yeah everyone is XX or XY and every cell in their body and coming from Christian boy view they're perfect the way God made them and they've got a plan for their life he has a plan for the life and so it's just it's this hijacking it's insulting and it's to confuse children will you tell a four or five year old it doesn't understand other world works hey little boy you might be a girl oh I might I mean they they trust you yeah that's why to do it is so vile it's so evil that you would confuse a little child's mind they should be in prison for pushing that dude and I mean it's just it's been nice acceptable a thousand percent yeah the fact that the little kids are having their childhood taken from them that they will like dude we got people right now on the internet crying about the trauma they had because their parents got divorced or you know they they got spanked once in a while or whatever right like do you it does anybody ever stop and think like what's going to happen to these children in 20 years and what they're going to be like my parents I got my dick hold on the calmness know exactly what that is it's exactly what they did in 1930s Germany and people do not understand that go read about the YMR Republic it's YMR Republic when it starts with W go read it it'll tell you this is all happened and it's all already been done no and it's final destination is collapse yeah you cannot do that you cannot destroy the future of your country the children and think everything's going to be okay and the future yeah so you know it's a sure collapse when that is allowed to be taught but I just I encourage parents get your kids out of those indoctrination centers private school homeschool anything is better than than having them subjected to that age segregated pure grouping where it just makes them a puppet the rest of their life they're just this pure pressure they do whatever they feel everybody else is doing instead of what's right or what they should do or whatever and but it it the future their future is going to be so limited when you grow up like that because you you just you you've been so brainwashed um it's just it's devastating well that's why they lose their shit when you say anything about it that's why they they lose their mind because they cannot comprehend like think how hard it would be to accept that you've been completely lied to like for these detransitioners right like think how hard of a mental bridge that is the cross to be like dude you know my teachers and my counselor and my parents they all allowed me to do this and now I'm like messed up forever that's trauma permanent bro trauma yes trauma no we're gonna see the suicide rates off the chart yeah it's not gonna be 46% it's gonna be like 70% at least no and that's but that's as we see that that's why we have to stand against it even though they say you're hateful for standing against it we have say no we're not no we're not no we're not those kids we love and we want to protect them from your deceptive just brainwashing um that yeah they're gonna have regrets yeah there's so many videos out there Tucker interviewed from the detransition yeah and you hear the stories and it breaks your heart he's hard to watch man you know uh it's just anyway yes yeah and it's just like oh my goodness but that is people that are wicked that are manipulated in using our children's father in this war to collapse America that's all that is no one would think that's a logical thing to do how a little boy cut off his private parts and it's gonna be okay I mean so it's but that's but the they've got the school system you know 50 60 70 years ago to just keep moving it slowly further more radical more radical less education less education more indoctrination so they're they're getting close to the stage they thought they would arrive at someday where you finally right raise up a generation that they have to have big government take care of them they literally cannot do it and then you got it then you got that social system and then you can turn it you know to tell it to her whatever you want when she get to that stage yeah thanks a lot man um yeah guys we appreciate your comments though thank you guys for being real fans we appreciate it uh with that being said let's keep this show moving we got headline number two headline number two reads uh us will require background checks for gun shows and online firearm sales uh this is a big one coming out today uh a lot of interesting things on this when we'll start diving into this uh the sale of firearms on the internet and at gun shows in the US well in future be subject to mandatory background checks the justice department said on Thursday as it announced a quote historic new action to keep weapons out of the hands of criminals the closing of the so-called uh gun show loophole which exempts private transactions from registrations that apply to licensed dealers has long been a goal of the Biden administration and is specifically targeted in the rule published in the federal register today quote under this regulation it will not matter if guns are sold on the internet at a gun show or at a brick and mortar store if you sell guns predominantly to earn a profit you must be licensed and you must conduct background checks the attorney general mayor garland told reporters on the press call announcing the measure quote this regulation is a historic step in the justice department's fight against gun violence it will save lives in quote um now the rule which clarifies who is considered to be uh quote engaged in the business as a firearms dealer uh will take effect in 30 days time and follows a three-month consultation period uh that attracted almost 388,000 comments to the website of the Bureau of the Alcohol Hall tobacco and firearms and explosives or the ATF the White House estimates that 22% of gun uh guns owned by Americans were acquired without a background check um and that about 23,000 more individuals will be required to be licensed as a dealer after the rules implementation um so 22% of guns owned uh were uh were acquired without these background checks i wonder how many of those guns or how many guns were used in crimes by those same people without those back oh sorry um my bad what's wrong with you now oh my god in there see now you and your fake you you and your fake you on the internet are gonna ask for a trophy for that fake DJ hey brother hey don't ask if you're offended ask if it's true that's a fact all right but quote there's a large and growing black market of guns being sold by people in the business of dealing and doing it without a license and therefore there are not running background checks the way the law requires the ATF director Stephen Ditto batch said uh quote it's not safe for innocent law-abiding Americans in fact it's dog on dangerous now this push of taking uh of trying to restrict remove limit uh lower the rights of gun owners in this country it's been it's been something they've been doing for decades right um do you guys know you know David Hogg right the guy who said park park uh you she yeah so the parkland survivor right yeah you know and he has a history of being escorted out and doing all these protests and stuff and uh well he finally got he finally got some pushback and i thought it was pretty awesome and kind of ties in this conversation because at the end of the day a country that is unarmed uh they're gonna fall subject to whatever the country decides right and if you have no way of protecting yourself you have no way of keeping tyranny in check um and so he decided he did this little town hall meeting or whatever um and a very uh interesting voice came up and had some interesting questions and comments and i have the clip here here it is hi my name is Lily Tom Williams welcome to my leafreel die state actually i am a chinese immigrant who survived communism and under mile you know 40 million people were starving to death after he sold the communism to them and 20 million people died murdered during his cultural revolution so my question to you David is that can you guarantee me a gun owner tonight our government in the us in dc were never never become a tyrannical government can you guarantee that to me there's no way i can never guarantee that any government will not be tyrannical well then the debate on gun control is over because i will never devolve my guns never never and you should go to china to say how gun control works for dictatorship of CCP that's awesome so awesome great yeah people that have been there done that yeah talking to some little nerd yeah they don't fall for all the little buzzwords and clever sayings and things like that they understand anyone that would ever try to disarm a law abiding citizen for any reason is evil that's right period and the you want the more crime goes up you want more law abiding citizens to be locked and loaded and maybe start a mandatory if you're a law abiding citizen you must carry this country maybe have a little big government in that direction um but you don't disarm the people that would only use it to defend the defenseless or to protect their family people they're responsible for their wife their children but in the communist countries if you study the 20th century that was always one of the first steps slowly pass some gun laws and restrictions that's what Hitler did in germany yeah he had to get the guns because he knew his plans but he goes i can't tell people my plans until i disarm them so there's nothing they can do about it and so it's what always happens to the left is always flapping about this at the same time they don't prosecute most gun crimes they don't they're not tough on crime that would help eliminate crime they don't do those things that really do work instead they know no let's disarm everybody and then crime is going to drop which again the cities that have done just not true crime like like Chicago places where it is against law the crime is off if you compare Chicago and Houston Chicago and Houston are sister cities okay the crime in Houston is disproportionately lower than the crime of Chicago because everybody in Texas is fucking carrying nobody in Chicago is because you go to prison for it right right there's so many loopholes you gotta go through and you know put your right arm in right arm out spin around do the dance to even have a concealed license and even after that the restrictions are still dude how is this guy relevant i believe he's i think he's one of these democrat influencers they pay him to do this this kid's this kid's arguments are so terrible and so ridiculous and he's so punchable like his face dude dude real talk like he speaks with like this authority and it's like bro you're a fucking peon nerd it doesn't know shit like what the fuck are you talking about nothing you barely have pubic hair on your fucking nuts you know i'm saying and you're out here lecturing people about shit because you happen to be which is terrible in a school shooting that does not make you an expert on fucking anything that makes you the victim of a traumatic experience and i can respect that i can say man that's terrible yeah at every school shooting if the teachers would have been armed they would have ended really quickly yeah so you the again the solution to those things people are going to do bad things sometimes especially when you raise the young people to to believe there is no right and wrong there's a doesn't matter your breathing is destroying the planet you're we so depressed them with all these lies and they play video games all day just killing people so you don't think they're gonna act out every now and then i'm shocked it doesn't happen ten times what it does but the solution to that would be to have schools that are guarded and they're protected and there are people there in the second you see the guy walking in he's done yeah we're not putting up with that you you will not kill a child under our custody and and so it's just it's again hot another problem two Curtis you know you have all these veterans who are trained who come back and they have these mental issues and the source of these mental issues that most of them have is not in this let people are going to get pissed when i say this but it's not that like they had some sort of traumatic experience for having to kill people if that's not what it is they come back and they don't have a purpose they don't have something to do they don't have something to protect they don't have something to fight for and if we would just work these people into a position of keeping these kids safe and every single school in the country it wouldn't take that much money to employ these people we would have safe schools and we would solve a big problem with the mental health of the veterans by giving them a actual purpose to stand for so yeah vote for me just saying no listen that that's fucking great you know i think at the end of the day people fail to realize it doesn't matter how many laws you make doesn't matter how many restrictions you try to put down criminals are going to be criminals that's the definition of a criminal that's what it is so nobody who does that I don't get by the laws correct you know and so it's like we keep trying you know and like that's the thing that's always laughable to me because it's like I know what the more sinister motive is here right but it's like it doesn't matter what law you put down they're not gonna like a criminal is not gonna find that you you could remove all the guns off that's right that no you're already illegal and guess what it still happens that's right though yeah no they'll use a knife they'll use their forward truck to drive over people whatever you make for it's in their yeah we'll make for the legal that's right no that's the bottom line is they they're policies if you follow them logically to their conclusion every man is in a cage in a prison so they can protect you and they have the key to it okay now you're safe there's no abuse there's no crime there's no yet it's just more control but you see from history the policies don't work they make things worse but that's what they're all about yeah yeah that's insane man it's insane guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think with that being said let's get to our third and final headline how long the three headline number three reads show he oh tiny was a victim of fraud and his interpreter will be charged or midfiers he stole more than 4.5 million from the Dodgers star to cover illegal gambling debts with the 700 million dollar MLB man and exonerated this was a this was an interesting thing man we I don't think we covered this a bunch I think we mentioned it maybe one time in our episode have you been following this we've seen anything I have a bunch no so show he a tiny I mean it was at the largest salary I think and the MLB ever given 700 million dollars yes but you know he can't really speak English so he has this translator and it comes out that there was like four and a half million dollars that was being used to gamble on illegal gambling bets and everybody tried you know thought it was him it was actually his interpreter so yeah show honey show he a tiny is set to be officially cleared of any wrong doing in the investigation carried out by federal authorities into the gambling scandal that rocked the 700 million dollar Los Angeles Dodgers star according to TMZ sports oh tiny is a victim of fraud and his translator uh leap a mouserada is going to be charged any day the New York Times meanwhile says mousi hara is in negotiations to plea guilty a move that will likely see him face a more lenient sentence um but here's the problem that I have with this whole thing again they acted on accusations and completely destroyed this man's career potentially right like he was fired from the Dodgers his contracts been ripped up like does he get any of that back is there going to be any restitution to him right he was fired by the Dodgers back in March amid the allegations he stole four and a half million dollars to covered debts um the investigation began soon after well three weeks ago in an hour period at the 29 year old Japanese stars that's before the exonerated um TMZ well hold on what do you mean i'm confused so the interpreter did this the interpreter did this yeah oh tiny didn't get fired from the Dodgers no he got fired no he did not he fucking played against the cardinals like two days ago oh really yeah you're no otani is still on the team dude oh okay the interpreter guy he was hired by the Dodgers yes so the interpreter was paid by the Dodgers for otani got it that's what happened so got it no he's not getting his job back and otani's lucky he's not banned from baseball like Pete Rose got hmm real talk okay so you're telling me that otani you know nothing about this new nothing about four and a half million dollars missing from his account that his interpreter took no that's not that's listen this is an honor sacrifice for this okay now you're getting it good all right uh so to say this potentially in this speculation another way could be that otani was gambling and had a gambling problem and betting on sports and baseball which you will get you kicked out of baseball and banned for life like Pete Rose and otani had to pay this this gambling debt and they paid it through this dude his buddy okay that's like me and you you're my interpreter bro like we spend all the time together like and i say hey DJ bro like i'm the one making the bread here you got to fuck and take this fall we're fucked yeah i got you you see what i'm saying please guilty that i'm just saying that could be what's going on it makes sense i'm listening i like otani he's great for the league yeah i i am a fan of his he's fucking amazing i'm just saying there's other things that could be happening they're probably not but they could be you know i'm saying that's my take yeah because you got anything on the you make are you make sense uh i a little bit i watched them would have been able to but that makes sense to or i could see either way or you're not gonna let him take the fall no matter what so you'll never really know was it him or the other guy but he shouldn't be fired just have a less there was proof for sure that it was him yeah now what what's the deal with the illegal betting like why is that such a because bro if you bet on baseball games and you're playing in games you can throw plays to create the outcome of the game that okay yeah i didn't okay yeah of course that makes sense or if you're betting on other games right like like let's say you're betting on uh you're not betting on your own game but you're betting on otani is betting on the cardinals game right he calls up one of his buddies on the cardinals and says hey i got a two million dollar bet that you guys are gonna lose this game i'll give you a quarter of it if you fucking look you see what i'm saying yeah like that's how i agree real quick yeah yeah yeah huh i mean listen he is young that that is a lot of money at your disposal three quarters of a million look man i hope he learned his lesson here and stays away from that shit gambling is one of the most dude i don't gamble like people are like why don't you gamble why don't you gamble because and i was just talking to Emily about this the other day i mean i might bet a hundred bucks right like between me and you or five bucks or something just for fun you owe me like two thousand but yeah what do i owe you for there was we had some type of bet yeah you owe me oh yeah so so shit yeah so that's exactly right too and it's three grand yeah i got them i should the bro i don't do it to leave that yeah so so so like dude i'll do that like right if me and my daughter sitting down we're watching ufc i'll say all right five bucks on this guy for the best you know gentlemen bet but like dude i've seen gambling completely white people out and i'm talking about people with big money in fact i think it wipes people out with big money faster and does with little money because people with big money have lost the sense of what money is they like for them and this is hard to like understand but like do when you have seven hundred million dollars you're gambling two three million dollars not even thinking about it yeah you know i'm saying you don't and that two three million dollars with two more three million you do that enough you're in big trouble quick you know so i hope he gets away from that guy i don't do i work too hard to to for my money to to gamble it's not fun for me you know if i'm in Vegas i might go you know i might take five hundred bucks and we go to the roulette table and play for six hours like we did mean you went was that wasn't you that was mean Chris yeah wrong black yeah that was christ a black crazy little christ god but we've not yeah christ is fucking so so dude but like we might you know i put five hundred bucks on the table you know in little increments and play for four hours i look at that as like entertainment yeah like that's my entertainment for the next six hours right so i'm paying the five hundred bucks for the six hours of fun but like dude i work too hard to game a wash it away man like i've given too much it's cost you know maybe it's easier for everybody else but it ain't been easy for me and i value that you know that's yeah but usually when you work hard for something you it's precious to you like i'm not just figuring it away especially when you know it's already getting away it's the house is going to win i mean i gonna appreciate the game right i gonna appreciate it but i just don't get carried away with it yeah there's so many other fun games you can play with not losing yeah work so hard for it's like go play a pickup game a basketball or something but don't you know to yeah it's just not it's just a dangerous thing to get into especially when you get into that that high dollar stuff there's just never been my thing man yeah i get asked to like play big poker games and stuff i don't even know how to play poker i'm like dude i'm not showing up playing poker with you fuckers take all my money you know it's real shit man that's real shit guys jump down in the comments let us know what you guys think uh that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up we're dumb as fuck this is where we bring a video up or a headline and article and uh we vote on it gets one of those two options so with that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads social media is horrified over video of waitress grabbing fries and putting them back on customers plate after they spilled off as she served hmm i'm gonna have to see the video it's bad dude it's it's bad i know you like potatoes i think potatoes are the best food ever made because they're so versatile you can make anything with potatoes like you know how you seen forest comp you probably haven't seen it i've seen forest okay you know how he talks about shrimp yep seven hours dumb bow barbecue shrimp shrimp pop i could talk about potatoes like that i love potatoes i fucking love them anyway there's not a way you can make potatoes i won't like them hmm and and i think they're the greatest food ever made if i'd eat one food for the rest of my life forever it'd be potatoes hmm i lived in Idaho for many years you know it's a staple there and they're you guys got good potatoes yeah they really do and uh yeah no it's uh yeah i would like to see if you could only off the floor off the table or if you could only eat one food forever what would it be what's tough it has to be some versatile yeah right yeah potatoes is one of those staples i think they said i read article once you could live on just milk and potatoes if you had just those two things between both of them you have all the things necessary to survive and i know i wouldn't have much protein in my potato diet in my physique would suffer but i'd be happy you'd be looking like baby hog bro i'd be looking like a potato yeah i mean looking like a potato but you know what i'd be happy yeah because that's those good yeah all right well let's let's see let's dive into this what would your one food be steak steak all steak bro really oh bro easy you can only prepare steak a number of ways though oh there's a few different ways you can do it i know but not as much potato that's fine if i had to pick one protein in one one carb i would pick a steak yeah so i'll bro listen i will eat steak breakfast lunch in

right here you got that butthole g spot that's that's what i was diving to this man so a waitress wasn't able to keep all of her slippery little fries on a plate for a guest and social media was horrified over the servers next move Kelly Murphy posted a video on tick tock of her experience at a restaurant after she ordered sweet potato fries quote throwback to when i ordered it sweet potato fries but was served slippery suckers instead Murphy wrote in the clip his video oh thank you all it's hard sorry yeah i'm supposed to sweet potato fries anyway Oh This is somebody is dying fucking

That's my friend It's a problem I gotta watch over time hold on It's a problem Slippery suckers Ha ha ha She must be a new waitress or something Yeah, shut it down. Yeah, of course. Can't eat those Sure you do no you you cannot touch people's food especially in front of them Um, and as a server in the kitchen your food gets touched yeah, that's fine I don't want to see it, but but it's you've washed your hands or you even have gloves on yeah, that's that's someone that just Out of touch. Yeah, it seems it seems like she that's a new that's a rookie mistake I think that's a rookie move I think she I think she is I think she's probably new and Learned yeah, that's right. It's what it seemed like to me your mind me of that scene from scary movie You know where he makes a cool aid No, the match between you have a CV original version of that you wouldn't know you would know have you seen national ampune's vacation What she had to chase maybe years ago where they make they go to the cousin Eddie's house and they make the cool aid And he sticks his hand in and she's the daughter sticks her hand in and mix the cool aid. Yeah, it's gross Now don't do it to my cool lady. Yeah, there's a problem. Yeah, it's a problem. Yeah, I mean look I clearly this is a This is not good, but I don't know she seemed like it was a like just I don't know she seemed like a rookie. Yeah I was you giving the grace I am yeah, I think people make mistakes bro. She seemed like she's learning on the job Listen man You got to have grace for people in their eye co-cats. Yeah, she wasn't being rude or anything. Yeah, she just Didn't know what to do and just the sin is a sin I'll touch them off the fucking table when I got it. Would you eat them off table?

I don't bro I don't care Joe would you Bro, Joe don't lie. What do you say her weapon of choice looks like a pool needle? Pool noodle oh Yeah, she's yeah, maybe it's possible, but if that were the case she wouldn't have a job. It's true. Yeah, it's true She would be out doing antifist stuff Biden's economy she had to start working. Well, that's what I'm getting at And I think times are hard and she's probably a new waitress and it's probably I'm trying to like be real larpen See this these guys are mean I have to deal with this every day bro. It's tough. Yeah, I gotta be the voice of reason. Oh, man All right, that's not that's come on now you guys ain't right All right, I'm giving the thumbs down, but I I'm giving it a soft But you give us some grease. All right, we got girders Uh, yeah, I guess thumbs down too. I mean it was it was too too far, but she didn't do it in a Um, a rude way or what you know, so rude servers like the worst whatever they're doing I can't stay in work, sir. Yeah, but someone's trying to oh, sorry. Yeah, so That was definitely gross, but She's new I can tell no grace straight straight to the gulag straight to the Straight to the really wood chipper No, just the gulag. Okay. Yeah, just the gulag. All right. Yeah, well guys. Well hold on I got I got one more question for Curtis before we go and I was thinking about this so in your opinion With all these things going on what what can people do on as an individual? What do you think the best course of action is for people to People that are waking up to what is really going on because when we talk to people about it They're like well, what what should we do? What do you what do you think? Well, I think they need to you continue to educate themselves so you're not sucked into something that sounds good But it's not good and then work to educate Those around you family friends neighbors slowly just expanding the people that are awake The bigger that pool gets the better we all are off We have more and more people that the next time they try to do the lockdowns whoever say no. Thank you We're not interested in the mass. We're not interested in the six foot social distancing or whatever it might be And then I mean as as families You know to try really work at Sincerely, you know, keep in the hearts and minds of your children and your grandchildren Make sure they're not getting brainwashed by this culture That is just purely lies out of everything all the institutions of whether it's the media the Hollywood films the Educational system It's just most of what you're being told is not the way the world really works And so I would just say just start building that group of like-minded people around you That do understand what's going on and do understand how serious it is and that things Have always been fine in America, but they're not going to be if we continue on the road we're going down period And I guarantee you this I have studied this for decades So I'm not just saying throwing this out there But we are going to get to the destination we're headed to if we don't turn around And it is a Marxist communist future Period and it is a nightmare. I've interviewed hundreds of people that grew up in communist countries ever since I made the films And then the stories they have told me about what it was like to actually live in those Is so sobering. I mean it just like I sit there and go I don't even understand this and they say yes, you're Curtis you don't even know you've studied this you don't know what it's really like When you are in fear for your life every single second I mean you're just nervous you're gonna say something you're not supposed to say do something You're it's like the book 1984 by George Orwell You're just in this a big brother. You know, it's watching you But today we do have this technology that is watching us We all carry a microphone and a video camera around with this and those things are being gathered so they'll know Whenever the the net is tightened around us enough. Okay, we do have control of bank accounts now because we have a digital currency or whatever Okay, I don't like what that person said. Oh that comment here. So instead of just being censored like we are now or cancelled Which is just a precursor to what's coming it'll be no you're deleted You don't own that home anymore. They're even working. I mean it's so deep as you dig into it But they're working right now at the world bank Of getting a ledger that has every asset in the world on it everything every car you own every bicycle every piece of property Where it's digitized and so the titles are digitized for every asset in the world Where so they push a button and all said and someone else's name is on your title It's like sorry. That's not yours. You need to move. This is private property And so that that's you can see they're setting it up for like oh my goodness. Yeah, it's just you you eliminate all opposition And we see in the Soviet Union. We see in red China today Yes, they eliminate all opposition by executing you there's creating the circumstances where they won't need to do that They might still do it anyway because they enjoy that But they can just delete you You'll starve to death because you don't have a place to be You have no job your bank accounts at zero you're everything's been deleted your your that sounds people hear that nice I don't they say bro that sounds crazy It totally does but when you know something I didn't hit on when I said when I was kind of connecting the dots for people Is you know the reason they're hyper flip there because listen our currency is going to hyper inflate people don't understand that And if you don't know what hyper inflation is go back and look at what happened in 1930s Germany and what they're going to replace it with is a digitized currencies And that's for what you're talking about and that was something I left out earlier But part of an inflate the the hyper inflation that they're trying to create is About not only making things unaffordable and pushing people into poverty But also being able to replace the currency with a trackable digital currency that is basically permission to buy things That's right and they decide what you can buy and they've already talking about that again These are I'm not talking about I think they might do this. I'm talking about whatever they say Here is what we're going to do where then if you've already had too many hamburgers this week DJ you will your money will not be good for that Because it's your carbon footprint is too much. I mean they this is an exact example This is a problem for you bro. How do they're thing where they will dictate what you eat what you're able to buy And that you have to spend your money all currency will have an expiration So you can't save up to have that wealth to be able to do things to make a difference And that's again, they're talking about this so anyone not Understanding this or having if you haven't heard this before it sounds crazy, but this isn't Some figment of our imagination It's what the elites of the world at the world bank the international monetary fund the United Nations It's what they're talking about right now as you read what they're doing But so that's the prayer of so yeah at the right moment They will collapse the currency Because they know we kind of don't want this digital currency But if they collapse our currency where it's really not worth anything like it would enjoy what are we gonna do Yeah, then all of a sudden they say hey if you sign up and get a digital ID For this currency will give you a thousand dollars a month for free just to be part of this and everyone The expression when you're in dire straits you're like that sounds pretty good And so it'll suck the people in just for self-preservation where I need to I need to feed my family So okay, I'll sign up and then you're in the system and once you get in the system Then you start to realize I better keep my mouth shut if I don't agree with what's going on Because I'm gonna lose The I'm gonna slap the hand that's feeding me that's what they told me want where you're just dependent on them And then like in the Soviet Union they kept everyone in poverty where you literally had to go wait in line for six or seven hours every day To get your loaf of bread for your family and when you're in that situation You're not gonna rebel because you're like I don't have enough energy to rebel one Because I barely and have enough to survive but I know if I rebel My family's not getting that loaf of bread my kids are gonna starve to death and I don't want them to so it's just it's just this forced um submission and forced obedience and that's what they're trying to set up right now. Is it all there yet? No, it's not so we need to use the freedoms we have right now to continue to build systems that are parallel systems that are apart from the way they're doing things I encourage people to get to know where your food's coming from and get it local if you can so if the if they Crash the the markets and things or they you know clog up the system with another Pandemic or whatever no, I know where I get my the farmers markets or the local farms or I'd grow some of my own yard Things like that we need the necessities of life and then we need to educate others, but especially my heart as a father um, we got to keep the the kids on our team I telling them these things and teaching them the truth So they're not deceived and so we will start building up our side and then they know If enough of us wake up they're in trouble because they don't have the force to actually make us all do what they want Um, that that's why they make an example. Anybody to stamp we got to destroy them so everyone's in fear So they won't rise up because they know if enough people rise up and this is just an interesting point real quick That is encouraging to people If our government was to take all the police in America entire military National Guard everything I think it's four or five million People total if they were to take them and try to lock down America That's only enough to lock down six cities So that's the force they if they're even able to do that and I don't think they could talk about policemen and all the Considering zero resistance from the Exactly, and so I'm saying it's really an illusion But they want that illusion to be real and the more they can digitize things Then it becomes real because then they can literally strip things away from you where you like you were saying where you'll own nothing and be very happy I mean people hear that and they laugh. That's a world economic form goal But I heard it instantly thought wait a minute The first plank of the Communist manifesto is the abolition of private property That's right that's all this is is Marxism communism Repackaged for today so people will willingly accept it because oh we're saving the planet or whatever it is and they will Force themselves and they will allow themselves to be moved into the city so they can be watched And they'll get a bike so they can just ride to work and back and they can get rid of their cars and they can And so that's what I think they realized with the progress they made in the educational system over the last 50 60 years They realize you know what These people will do what we say if we just make it urgent enough Create enough fear in them They'll and I think the pandemic was a perfect example. Yeah, there's a test These idiots are wearing mask when all medical journals say mask do nothing for stopping the spread of a virus You know in the six foot thing which they've even admitted they made up now I knew they made it up Because everybody knew a virus if you sneeze in a room everyone in the whole room could get that virus There's no leash on a virus six feet. Oh, yeah, you know, you know, if you could walk in restaurants and why you know If you're heads too high when you're walking in you can catch you but when you sit down the table You're below right where it actually goes plexiglass. Yeah, you know So it sounds like what you're saying Curtis is awareness the spreading of awareness non-compliance and personal excellence around yourself and the individual in your family. That's right That's what it sounds like that's right and where you just you realize As I've realized the more I enter people I've interviewed from communist countries It is truly it would better to be dead until I've under communism. Mm-hmm. So you're willing to go no I'm willing to stand Um, even if it cost me my life because it's the right thing to do I think it's important to point out that the sooner that people stand the easier the fight will be exactly right And the more we stand when we feel like I might be the only one standing It's so vital because most of the time that one person standing is all it took for other people go Oh, I was thinking about that too, but I just didn't want to be the first one Yeah, so it's so important to be the first one you be the first one I'm sorry. I'm not gonna put that mask on because it's it's a lie You know you're being lied to and try to educate the people that are saying these things But yeah, just we need to do that because otherwise Um, if we don't stand up as they slowly keep in crocheting and crocheting and crocheting Like I said before if you're on a road that ends That we're ending and coming that's where it's gonna be If you don't get off the road you're that's where you're gonna arrive at your destination and uh It's so brave, but so many people we've had such a nice life in America Are still kind of really you think it's possible and it just is you study more. It's happening It's happening right before our eyes. Yeah, and I think also it's important to note on this one last point You know a lot of people think to your point of going first That their voices are relevant and people have to understand you have been propagated in brainwashed to believe that All right, if your voice is irrelevant then why do they censor if your voice is irrelevant? Why do they propagate if your voice is irrelevant? Why do they have political correctness and cancel culture? If your voice is irrelevant Why do they spend billions even trillions of dollars to create systems For you to silence yourself. Why do they shame you? Why do they do these things if your voice was irrelevant? They wouldn't do that. They wouldn't spend that money. They wouldn't spend that effort They wouldn't work so hard to try to silence you So you have to break out of the idea that your voice doesn't matter your individual voice matters Way more than you think and they understand that it's just you that doesn't understand that That's right in Alexander Solzenyzen He was a famous writer from the Soviet Union This spent almost all of his life in the gulag there because of the things he wrote against the government He in his last essay before he left the Soviet Union He he titled it live not by lies He said we have to refuse what has allowed them to get this control over us as we have submitted to the lies We've been silent when someone said something that was a lie and it made everybody else think we condone that lie And he said when he no longer can do that He goes you have to refuse to ever be silent in the face of a lie You must confront it and you must say no that is not true I'm sorry, but you're wrong on that and and as they started to do that more and more in the 80s Many there started to be many protests in the Soviet Union after the his essay circulated around Because people realize that's right. We've got to even hear where we're going to there's a high price We're going to do it anyway And so that that's the key just live a life that's the truth Live the things you say you believe you live those don't just talk don't just you know Always want to do something or be go do it and just be committed like you said to excellence in every area of your life As a father as a husband as a as a friend as a if you go to church at your church at your neighborhood and wherever you are Just be the person they go that guy's all here He's all in and he does things the right way every time and that's who he is And the more we do that the more our light shines into the darkness expelling their lies and I think there's great hope if we can just Continue to do this individually and then pull others alongside of us because it is lies Just like all the little clips we just listen to just people just foaming at the mouth about nothing It's just lies and nonsense and little buzzwords and things that's all they have to offer and we need to say no We have a lot to offer here. We have a different way of doing things. Why don't you join us and what we're doing and I I just I'm hoping and praying that God will bless our efforts to do that, but that's He will the course the here's the here's the silver lining to all of this When we get through this we will have the freest country that ever existed in the history of the world That is a fact because by people waking up and recognizing what's happening We're in a situation where people are going to start to recognize all the other forms of tyranny and oppression that we've been lied to about That we'd be conditioned to believe Little by little by little and we will continue to attack and remove these systems of oppression that keep our Capitalist free country in a place where it's not really free There's no reason for you and I and everybody listening to have to work until the month of august until we start taking home our own money There is no reason for these politicians that are in Washington DC to come into office worth Zero and leave worth hundreds of millions of dollars There is no reason for our tax dollars to be sent overseas when we have the infrastructure that we have and we have the homeless that we have And we have the societal plight that we have we have to serve American interests first and by people becoming aware of what's actually going on We're creating a scenario where people are going to recognize all the other things that are wrong After we win this major battle that's happening right now So I'm very optimistic as long as people do wake up and they do speak up and they do realize the power of their voice And they do take the message of personal responsibility and personal excellence and leading as an individual Being first to stand up and say no, I'm not doing this no I'm not doing this because this is wrong and this is bullshit I don't believe it and you will inspire other people to do the same That is all of our mission that is our individual mission right now to Resist what's happening and preserve the future of America which I believe is brighter than ever as long as we can get through this point So I appreciate you coming on brother. Yeah, it's really good to see you man. No, it's great to be here I appreciate you and and those that if you enjoy this at all this what we talked about um The movies I made are a great term a tool for that and I just encourage you to go you go watch my amazon if you'd like or we have a website agenda documentary calm where you can get a physical copy if you'd like that But once you watch it several times and get the info down. It's great tool We've had hundreds of thousands of people have showings in their home when they invite their family and friends over Make popcorn and it's a simple way to educate others We don't have to give them 50 books to read or whatever You just say hey come over watch a movie and they'll start to see the purposefulness behind America's decline and hopefully then join us in this battle to to preserve what's left That's agenda and agenda to guys should be required watching if you want to have an educated opinion What's going on so Curtis? Thank you so much man. It's really good to see you Right to be here. Yeah guys any Curtis. That's all I got all right guys. Don't be a hoe We're from sleeping on the floor now my jury box froze fuck up. Oh fuck a stole counting millions in a coke Each booted slow got a own bank row can't fold doesn't know here shot case clothes
