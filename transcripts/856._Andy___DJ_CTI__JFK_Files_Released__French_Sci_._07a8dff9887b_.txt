We need you to help us grow the show all right So don't be a hoe show the show all right, so what's going on for real? Let's start over What fuck up man, I know let's fuck up. Yeah, you know, I see the board fucked up Let's start the show All right, all right, man. Well got a lot to cover today dude. There's a lot out there. There is a lot going on man I got some new theories dude. I do too you got some okay? Yeah, yeah, we're gonna bounce these off man I got some did you see the thing about the pyramids? No, I didn't see that you just brought that up to me before you didn't see that though before that No, but I mean so listen they scan so Egypt will not allow people to explore the pyramids. They don't allow it So these guys this group decided to run a scan from outer space with satellites to scan below The surface of the pyramids okay, and the pyramids According to them and I would look at the scans and so did Joe we were talking about it Are not tombs like they say they are at all and all three pyramids have the exact same structure on the inside Okay, but below the pyramids they all have six or eight cylindrical tubes with little staircases that swirl around all the way down that go down 1.6 miles Into the ground into a cube that is 250 foot per side so 250 high 250 wide now imagine how cute imagine how big that is that's nearly half of the height of the arch here in St. Louis massive okay and For years and years and years were told their tombs and they're this and they're that and Egypt won't let us Explore them because you know it's the claim to the powerful and the creativity of the Egyptians Well when you look at this There is no Pass we all thought like hey man how they build the pyramids, you know I we didn't even know because the blocks are so huge and so heavy how did they do it and there's all these theories You know they rolled them on logs they flooded the desert they did all this shit Bro no way no way there's no way that a human being Built the pyramids there's no way after seeing what they're showing yeah, there's no way You know not humans what are you so you're saying like I Don't know I mean look man. I don't know, but I know this we couldn't build them now. No no, you know I'm saying so Dude I saw the pyramids is a weird combo like I saw this one thing They were talking about like because they try to say like the pyramids are so old and all that but like the material that they're May out of didn't exist until after a theoretical great flood would have happened to actually create the limestone That they used to fucking build it with well, dude they found the fucking hall of Noah's Ark. That's what I'm saying So that's like in Romania bro Dude it goes back to what I said it goes back to the two biggest lies that we have been told as humans in the history of our existence by the tyrants that we love so much on the show They all lie to us and I believe they have lied to us About two major things one What humans are actually capable of with their mind being metaphysical quantum physical ability to create reality with your brain I believe that is 100% true because I've experienced it over and over and over and 2 I believe they have worked very very hard to cover any evidence of God or Jesus or any of that and they want us to feel like it's like some metaphor You know bullshit right when in reality we're starting to find actual archaeological evidence and Anthropologists are starting to find evidence of This being real. Oh, it was real. Yeah 100% bro. Dude. No, I don't mean like Okay, like a lot of people will argue Jesus was real most people, right? But they will say things like well know as arc wasn't that was just a story You miss that right well, they're starting to find evidence of all these stories 100% So every city in the Bible they find it like I mean, it's all there It's all in like dude. I look at like there's way more evidence right now That says that he was alive lived and that a lot of the information that's in there is factual not not metaphorical Stories not just fucking yeah talk right it's real stuff which I mean think of just the implications on mankind that that has You know, I'm saying like well it takes the power away from them Why why would they not want us to know that they would only want us to not know that to give them more power over 100% man It's wild stuff. I got you say you got to send me that link so I can see that shit on the pyramid But you know, I mean it actually kind of does go right perfectly I was gonna bring this up before we got to our headlines The fucking astronauts came back from From a how long what's the longest you ever stayed in the pool of water in the pool water? I mean, you know honestly dude pretty long time In the pool drinking yeah, that's pretty long time nine nine hours. I mean I get out to pee But you know, that's it. Oh, you don't get out to pee fucking Don't invite DJ No, bro, why? Fucking pool next self bro has chlorine and all of that shit cleans itself All right, man no more pool for DJ All right, so I'm beating your pool before I bet Dude listen That's gross. Well, what is warm bro? I guess no way to like I don't want to talk about I Don't want to talk about it. Talk about my time. Sure. I'm a peeing your pool. That's well, okay, let's talk about that So no astronauts in space. Yeah, I mean Here's what I thought was weird about this Look I question everything man. Yeah, if something isn't right I Notice it okay, and When they showed those people in space Their hair was gray and it was all grayed out when they got out of the the little cell yesterday That woman's hair that was gray and all the videos is now black And right before they pulled her out of the little pod the people were saying well, you know when Someone's in space for a very long time It could change the way that they look and it could change the way that their faces look And it's just like are you telling what the fuck is going on? Yeah, so I don't know what's going on But it feels real weird and it feels really weird especially that that woman who I don't know how old is she I mean she's old, bro. Let me see with the article. She's got to be 60s 59 59 years away hold on let me see Which one is she's really she's 59 okay, I said 60 She her hair In the fucking that look Okay, then when they pull her out of the tube she had black hair So what should you dye her hair before she got pulled out of the fucking while she's in the space get ready for camp Yeah, I Mean dude is Hollywood brother got to make sure you look good at all times, bro Listen, it's weird to me. There's a lot of stuff that don't add up. I don't I mean I don't know I just thought it was weird dude, you know, I don't know dude. I Don't believe anything these people say I Mean even though suits like brother doesn't look like something ever but like what happened to the big fucking, you know Well, I'm basically just evolved. Yeah, does it? Space doesn't I mean fuck. I don't know out of space is still out of space bro It's just the whole thing is weird to me the whole thing she does not look the same like not even remotely the same Like this would like me this is her and him before and then she does not look the same. I don't know at all It feels weird it does it does man It does I want to know the truth just tell me the truth What's really out there like did you see that shit like apparently there was a the United States Air Force and like coordination with the US Space Force Like sent this mysterious fucking, you know ship That was up there for like a little bit over a year or something that just landed a couple of the weeks ago Like a week ago or something like that. I didn't see that yeah like nobody like I was people on there like what where do they go do like I mean Dude it's weird. Yeah, it's fucking. No, it's it's fucking weird to me man. I don't know guys you tell us down in the comments Is that a stunt double? That's kind of my like can I ask a question? Yeah, of course. Why why would we send? Why would we send 60-year-old people in the space for a fucking year? Hmm at all. Oh, I'm just saying why would we do that? Oh? What's the point that doesn't just doesn't make sense yeah Anyway That lady looks like she's a hundred fifty Bro, you know what a remind me of you ever seen an interstellar? Yeah, it's a good movie, but like you know like you know you guys all like that movie. I think that movie's Ridiculous. No, I think it's great. Why it's great. Well, I mean bro I was great about it the cinematography of it the fuck I mean, I get to really do you do understand that cameras were different in 1985 right Like when you said oh, I don't like days at thunder the cinematography was bad. Well no shit They're shooting it on a fucking camera. This 40 years old. Yeah Okay, that's fine. Yeah, but there's a scene in an interstellar We're like they go down to this planet and like every minute that they spend on the plane during the ocean Yeah, right is like fucking like fucking 15 years where they get back the black dudes all shriveled up like that's what she looks like It's like they fucking left room. No, that's for yeah, it does kind of look like that. Yeah I don't know guys tell us in the comments what you guys think I think it's bullshit though. I do But yeah, let's get to some of our topics today guys We got a lot of stuff to cover remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos Go to Andy for some of that calm guys can also come check us out on YouTube We have a nice little screen here set up and you guys can follow along the show and see what we see See not about you. Yeah, look man. I just have a hard time believing anything at this point like I feel like we live in a Culture and society where it is universally accepted by All the people who run the governments that Everybody else on earth is stupid and doesn't need to know the truth and I believe there's There's a culture up here and there's a culture down here at the bottom that we're a part of and These people don't feel like they need to tell us anything or or anything we can't handle the truth Yeah, and and and it's it's ridiculous. Yeah, and I'm getting the point where You know, I don't think they're ever gonna fucking tell us. I don't think they're gonna tell us anything I don't think I don't think the disclosures that were promised to us By Trump and the team are ever going to happen I don't think we're ever going to know what it is. We were promised that we would know we will be given bits and pieces and Business will continue to go on as usual that now now I said and I stick to this You know 90 days, all right And we are not fully to 90 days yet, but that's the direction that I So I've had like in the life and this goes right into our first headline is what we're gonna talk about obviously There was a full Unredacted release where talking 80,000 plus pages of documentation on the JFK files was just released and I've been doing some digging on this because I mean here's one of the here's the truth like there's not a lot out there A lot of people are offering like what it is some news agencies aren't even covering it I have a very interesting theory well, well dude. I mean first of all to 80,000 pages second of all Let's be real clear Grok was Analyze the document. Yep, okay, I'm also doing that too. I'm okay. I'm just sorry everybody knows the end of the document Yeah, at the end of the analyzation After all the bullet points it said tell me one word Who was responsible for the assassination and it said Israel, okay, and? Whether that's true or not true. That's not the point But the point is that I'm making is that none of the quote-unquote conservative influencers talk about it We'll talk about that because they're afraid to talk about it. All right, so I know we will But my point is is that there's very few people out there, you know, we have we live in this this polarity on the argument, okay, we have conservative people Who are will not acknowledge anything negative about Israel, okay? They won't say anything That criticize Israel at all No matter what all right, and these are most of the people like all the people that got the fucking Binder now stupid. They look now. They're like fuck. They look oh we came out with the binder and We got the fucking files before you know you didn't because you were just used and Now you guys have lost all your credibility because it shows that you're just the little seals that clap at every fucking thing so That happens and those people will not talk about they will not criticize Israel no matter what all right, which isn't right everybody Nobody's above criticism. All right, it doesn't matter if you're Trump. It doesn't matter if it doesn't matter doesn't matter And then we have the other side of the equation which is like it's the Jews and they just scream that shit over and over again and Because of these two polar opposite arguments we can never Dig into what the truth actually is and the truth You know can't be talked about by these guys and the truth can't be trusted by these other guys because they blame everybody so What's the truth and and this is why we are not having any of the real shit? Sort of decipher the right way in my opinion 100% 100% now now like I've been digging into this I'm doing that same and you're I've did my own work, but I also I'm conducting that same kind of experiment with Grock to see I tried it with chat GPT You'll be interested to see what that response was they they literally I had had it You know decipher all the documents took some hours and And I'm all right now list out, you know the major countries that were involved right and it's like oh, you know United States CIA SSR so get Union Russia put in quotations Mexico Cuba England right and then the last one it listed was Israel, but it put in parentheses Although there's no direct relationship can you know Saying that Israel is directly involved or you know saturday like why would you say that for that one? But like you don't want to say it for any else yeah, interested But I got Grock doing the same thing will process that that'll probably be on Monday's release We'll check on that but But you know, I do have a different opinion. You know you're you're I was agreeing with you in the party I probably won't get anything. I think I have a new light on this now and like you know on how this is gonna go down It's just a DJ theory. I don't know But yeah, let's dive into the to the JFK file. So this is marine Callahan. She she's I got to give her credit She's awesome. We've covered a lot of her work before She's an investigative journalist. She dives into these things and she's been pretty spot on last couple of years And you know she she's from the Daily Mail She she wrote this article here the hidden bombshell and the JFK files that changes everything marine Callahan decodes the document dump and Exposes a cover-up to shock the world She starts off saying the JFK files apparently say nothing and that says everything No mystery in American history Compare so what really happened in Dallas on November 22nd 1963 the day president John F. Kennedy was assassinated the release of 80,000 unredacted documents on Tuesday evening ostensibly every remaining piece of paper relating to the investigation Though that now seems doubtful promise to give the world the unfiltered true story And of course president Trump you know he put an executive order and to release this Most part of his campaign pledge But she says continues saying quote instead we got the mother of all document dumps uncategorized Unprioritized countless pages of unreadable with fading type many containing interviews with people who seem at best Tangentile To the only question at hand did the CIA the FBI or the mafia have anything to do with it the ghost of J. Edgar Hoover The cross-dressing FBI director who despised JFK laughs And she kind of dives into this whole thing right now Here's my theory and how this correlates to Trump and even the Epstein files now and you tell me what you think all right But I think we all can agree Trump's very strategic okay and I think any moves that have to come they have to come from the will of the people Right we say something is bad. Yeah, well, I mean listen to people want it right so natural leader mentality, right? How I look at this whole thing because here's my understanding of the JFK assassination Lyndon B. Johnson was corrupt Corrupted before he was vice president What we call now is APEC right which has been talked about I know sent a massive talked about it Everybody has an APEC guy right well before it was called APEC It was like the American Zionist movement or something like that and They had LBJ in their pocket, okay? This before he was VP and You know he gets VP art cool everybody's happened now JFK wanted them to have to register With Farrah the foreign agent as a foreign agent right which prevent them from lobbying our politicians and all of that They were not with it. They changed their name shortly after the assassination But Israel wanted nuclear weapons they actually FK to sign off and help you know kind of support their movement JFK said no right and That's from my understanding how I look at this is that Israel then got Messiah involved and like hey We need some that we didn't have they didn't have dirt on JFK they had nothing to really like bend his arm So they got Messiah involved say hey, we need to get this guy to fucking go with us right Messiah then in coordination with our CIA hash this plans like look we got LBJ and you know in our pocket We can use this guy to like he'll force it right well. How do we get JFK out the way? There was no plausible you know plan That really resulted in this Other than the assassination and literally getting him out the way they you know They thought about impeachment and all these different things nothing really concluded and gave them a silent way to move other than getting him physically literally out the way and They hashed this plan Lee Harvey Oswald was a former US Marine. He had contacts with the USSR The USSR told JFK that hey Like you know there might be some weird chick going on and I don't know if you guys know this to this was in a document dump This isn't new But the assistant to JFK was in the room with JFK that morning we're in the hotel together was it was him the assistant and and Jackie and JFK said quote apparently something to the effect that like you know It wouldn't be that hard to kill a sitting president It just takes a shot from a sniper while I'm driving in the motorcade. He said that that morning Before they even did the parade route right like crazy shit and that was a testimony of the assistant The hash this plan Lee Harvey Oswald told you know his USSR contacts They told him like he was well aware that something was happening just didn't know what And knew that LBJ was somehow involved in the situation They go through the assassination even things like change it very route the driver slowing down It is confirmed that there was actually two shooters audio analysis verify two shooters four shots four shots the Jack Ruby and leave Harvey Oswald met Two or three weeks before the assassination in Dallas and also Jack Ruby whose I believe his name is Rubenstein Rubenstein, okay told a friend That he had to kill Lee Harvey Oswald Under the threat of his entire family being killed right so he said he had to do it Otherwise his family was going to be killed 100% 100% so they go through the assassination 30 minutes after that the first and the second the driver slowed down they threatened him he slowed down and Do you know what happened to the car right afterwards they flew the car straight back to Washington DC Put it in the fucking garage and you know what they did they fucking strip the interior out and Took all the crime scene all the evidence was going immediately Well 30 minutes after the shot the fatal shot LBJ was sworn in right shortly after that a pack changed their name to a pack now The armament deals went through with Israel. I mean there's other thing I read to is the firearm used in the assassination which purchased from a sporting goods store in Nebraska or Maybe a Chicago in Chicago that was owned by the guy Who was the CIA's in country arms dealer? Okay, so so the guy who's selling the CIA black market arms to ship across the country owns a retail establishment in Chicago Mm-hmm And that is where the rifle came from right 100% 100% Right and so you have all that happened and you know we all know what happened shortly after that, but it's just like you know I'm sorry like there's some direct like the mafia that's you know talked about like the guy the shot Was also attached to the Jewish mafia that kind of had a run down in Dallas like all of that stuff's there Right, but we can't why can't we just okay? Well like hey, I think there's warrants Some investigation. I mean there's clearly some political diplomatic issues that would arise after this if if if any Countries involved and then assassination attempt on a sitting US president you would think right now Here's where my hypothesis comes in of how Trump's looking at this on their own a grand scheme of things right What's more palatable to say if you're trying to get the American people to wake up and realize who you know Potentially a real danger and threat to the United States is what's more palatable to say that you know a country is implicated in killing a sitting US president or A country is implicated in a massive blackmail pedophile ring globally. What's more palatable to start with? 100% yeah, so you're saying what you're getting to is you think he's stepping into I think it's a fucking step It's an escalation. He has to right because it's gonna be more palatable. Okay, cool now We need to look at this at this country that's potentially involved and You know, okay, that's at least gonna open the the public's eyes to allowing them to you know Could be right and then drop this fucking you know, it could be right look None of what we're saying here when I'm saying or what you're saying is Saying that we know yeah, but Because we're not given the real data. So all we have to do is all we have to go on his speculation and brush it down I was thinking about this and I think that's a good point. I don't know if that's right or not Yeah, 100% I think that's that's the reason but how I like it how I look at it man He's very strategic as a reason for everything You know, I'm saying to like why would we put this out? I mean like yeah, it does implicate that country We need to talk about it, but that at least starts a conversation is more palatable So like if you didn't have to touch the people right you didn't have the temperature You'd have to figure out how to do it to where it's palatable It's possible, you know, that's just how I look at it. I don't know. It's possible, but I don't I don't That's not how I would do it. Yeah, I would let it rip. I'd be like you guys have been lied to Here's the deal. This is what it is and I'd let him it be like pulling off a mandate Just do it. Yeah, I don't disagree with that piece, you know, man another interesting thing about all of this bros again It's like how mainstream media attaches you know or kind of tries to handle the narrative most places don't touch it But the ones that do what what they're interested in is Completely irrelevant shit like oh social security numbers and other private information on mass and JFK files Like that's what they're worried about they're worried about people who are already fucking dead By the way, did you see that in the JFK files? Did you see that he called a certain government official a trader? Mm-hmm. Did you see who that was Joe Biden? That's right. Yeah, I saw that dude. I saw that I mean now now what have we been saying about Joe Biden is a fucking trader? I think I would have liked JFK that went into be clathic that was his brother that said that Robert yeah, that was Robert who called Joe Biden was in the files. It was always the files. Yeah 100% The other thing too. I mean this article also comes off from Dave. I think it's very clear that he was a trader He took unnoticed amounts of money from foreign influence To make decisions that we can America. There's not a decision he made over the last four years that didn't make our country worse No, and then everybody that was in on it. He fucking gave preemptive part in Not only that they and what they played off as oh, he's just a seat-out old man. Right. What an effocusing now No, no, not at all But this other thing the you know the other thing that came out with these JFK files Is that you know this headline reads JFK assassination files show conspiracy theory pushed by Trump is true Journalist says and what they're talking about is what we always talk about is the fucking deep state It's absolutely true some people actually call the CIA as a state within the state who who thinks the deep state is conspiracy I mean fucking everybody CNN. I mean all mainstream media. I don't think that they just They have to say that. I don't think anybody truly believes it's not the guy we listen We have state-run media. Yeah, okay. This is no different than fucking China or fucking anywhere else Our media is state-run. They are greatly supplemented financially by your tax dollars to say Propaganda propaganda was made legal technically under Barack Obama Okay, so since Barack Obama was in office Everything is switched from news that had to be backed by fact to Storylines that don't have to be backed by fact Yep, and so when you watch the news CNN MSME speed Fox News as well You have to realize that they all receive millions upon millions tens of millions of dollars over the course of a year every year to say certain things, you know and People still aren't aware of that now if no deep state exists that who is authorizing the the promotion of propaganda and who's paying for it? You know the other thing to that came out with all it is there was an FBI agent That basically was watching all of this shit play out and go down and like saw it He tried to whistle blow and two days later he got shot six times and they ruled it suicide. You were the fucking suicide. Yeah Rule it a suicide. I tell you what if I ever commit suicide. I am pretty sure it didn't hit me six fucking shots You know I mean, it's just like it's like What the fuck well listen, it's not gonna take long for the people like look There's a lot of really smart analytical people are here. I'd say you give it a couple more days I'll bet you by Tuesday when we when we air the show I'm in this episode. Yeah, yeah, the next episode we record for CTI when it comes on Tuesday that will have a pretty Solid framework of what actually happened. I would agree. I would agree Now other things I want to bring up here real quick outside of the JFK files and I sure if you saw this Talking about a state within the state Natalie Windsor's obliterates vile russia gate hoax or Christopher steel in an epic tour to force have you seen this? I don't think so so Christopher steel tried to he went on pierced Morgan and tried to do this little panel in a v-tank thing and she's a War Room co-hosts correspondent Natalie Wenders she fucking obliterated this guy on National TV. Let's see it. It was fucking great Let's check this clip out. Well, I know Christopher steel probably wanted to go down in history as someone that colluded with the Clinton campaign to take down President Donald J Trump But I really think that you represent probably the ultimate grifter in the American political space for you to even come on here Obviously, you're trying to sabotage what President Trump is doing when it comes to Russia and Ukraine But to sit here What is it nearly a decade after you tried to smear President Trump as a Russian asset to then say well? I think he's a Russian asset But even though I'm really good at my job and create all these intelligence reports It's just sort of a feeling that I have I'm sorry What stones do you even have left to turn over to try to corroborate your claim that President Trump is a Russian asset? You what weaponize? Fies accords surveillance warrants not just domestic spy agencies International spy agencies to the entire DNC apparatus a bunch of political operatives and registered for an agent here in the United States The American people would really appreciate it if you would stop injecting your efforts to curtail and totally tank the America first movement by smearing anyone who doesn't want to get involved in forever wars or continue the needless and ceaseless Dying of Ukraine and Ukraine and in Russia just so you can sit there from your nice perch and just continue to defend the Globalist world order by continuing to fan the flames of conflict in Russia and Ukraine and you know what the same people that you Allie yourself with here in the United States. You think you're so good at gathering intelligence Last time I checked it was the 51 intel agency officers spies who said that the Hunter Biden hard drive which I've reported on firsthand It's legitimate you want to talk about presidents sons who are involved in businesses with foreign countries Well, I'd like to introduce you to Hunter Biden right when those 51 people that I'm sure that you know all too well You were probably likely involved with the drafting of that letter said that that was rust Russian disinformation Well, it turned out that that was true in shame on you for the last decade trying to inject the idea that smearing President Trump is a Russian agent or Russian asset Is somehow going to take the magma movement? It's about putting America first and the fact that you can still sit here and you have no actual evidence beside one random Russian meeting And oh, we need to just continue to get more evidence You're a complete political hack and grifter and I wish the American political scene didn't have your voice in it All right, well Christopher still you're about to leave us because you're only here for this part of the panel, but your response finally to that My response is that I'm a professional intelligence officer an expert on that part of the world. I'm not a politician Was the Hunter Biden hard drive Russian disinformation that if you're such an expert So I've been in my question I've been in the United States for probably most of the last 40 years I've worked extremely closely with Officials working for administrations both Republican and Democrat I have a very strong US client base for which I've worked and produced information over many years None of whom have ever made any sub-salagation against me and is palpable nonsense to claim that I'm in Pop with the Clinton campaign didn't say that about you Well, I never worked with a Clinton campaign. I never had any contact with the Clinton campaign. That's the reality of it Ractor I produced reports Apart from a firm in Washington and the results of that report made me as an ally of the United States as I would have expected An American counterpart to do to report back in what I've found to the context I had in the FBI at the time Okay, I was right do and I'm proud Say Thank you for joining us. You see as fucking smug face. I mean, it's been proven time we've covered all of this on the show You know I'm saying the He was a subcontractor for the Hillary Clinton campaign and fucking tasked with finding evidence and he just gave him back bullshit that they used to go off of it The court in UK found that he was fucking lying about all of it I've never got about this story that the FBI offered him a million dollars to prove that the dossier claims are real He couldn't he couldn't fucking prove it. Yeah, he never got the million dollars Well, did you notice his response had nothing to do with answering her question at all It was all a deflection of what I had done in the past and the relationships I have and how connected I am and how much Intel I can get and he says oh well Nobody makes these accusations against me. Yeah, because if you're that connected and you get that much intel And you're able to make up intel that implicates a United States president and Ruins this country for eight fucking years straight. I'm pretty sure you could make up intel about anybody Okay, so you want to know why nobody calls out Christopher Steele of the people that he has worked with it's because they're fucking afraid of them We're just so happy with the job he's done right Yeah, man, it's crazy but more everybody We'll stay tuned on these this situation with the JFK files and We'll see if that theory comes true man guys Let us go down in the comments what you guys think about all of this with that being said Let's go cruise some of these comments.

You don't have they don't get their hose up there Right, let's keep it moving. Let's talk about some deportation stuff little updates on that This is interesting. So you remember all the shit France was just talking right taking the statue liberty back and all that Good stuff. Well, we just denied entry to one of their scientists And because Officers found a hateful text messages criticizing Trump during search of his phone. I got diving We got diving to this a little bit. I don't know why they went through his phone I don't think that's a typical you know TSA clearance customs clearance side thing But let's let's check this out So you got a French scientist which was denied entry to the US after immigration officials discovered hateful text messages criticizing Donald Trump on his phone the space researcher Who has not yet been named was subject to a random airport search on his way to a conference in Houston, Texas Officers found text messages which conveyed at hatred towards Trump and could be considered to be terrorism According to AFP while another source suggested they felt the messages were quote hateful and conspiracy So that's interesting There are Philippe Baptiste. He's the France's minister of higher education and research condemned the US authorities for taking action over a personal opinion In a statement to Le Mone, he said quote, I learned with concern that a French researcher who was traveling to a conference in their Houston Was denied entry to the United States before being expelled this measure was apparently taken by the American authorities because the researcher's phone Contained exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration's research policy So I mean, I don't know I don't know I mean, I don't think that's a typical search thing though, right like going through somebody's phone I've never had my phone go through but I'm an American citizen, so I don't know I don't know. I mean, I don't know. Yeah, that's weird. I mean, I think it is weird I Mean unless he was saying like hey, it was like a threatening thing. Yeah, right. I don't you know That doesn't sound very American. No, you know, like I'm saying like like I mean I mean like my personal opinion like fuck you. Yeah, right. You know don't come here. Sure, but I Think we get into dangerous waters when we start to say Um, you can't criticize the president of the United States. Yeah, sounds like that's the whole point of the United States Yeah, you know, and it is weird. It is weird. It's weird. Yeah, it's weird. It sounds a little Chinese It does yeah, it sounds not right. No No, it doesn't now the you know pure blood American fucking male. Yeah Once to say hey fuck you Frenchy. Yeah, fuck out of here. Fuck you in your french fries. That's right. Yeah, I keep those though Give me your french fries. Yeah, fuck out. Yeah, well we could too because all those French people are like five four Yeah, yeah, and the only reason they still exist is because we fucking went over there and saved their fucking asses It's real okay, so let's be real show some fucking respect. They will be speaking German Yeah, which you know, that's a whole nother argument. But the point is You know like let's fucking not be assholes. Yeah Um So we will take the french fries. Yeah, we'll take the french fries. So um, yeah, I just I saw that I thought that was a little interesting You know, but other stuff going on, you know, we got these mass deportations going on We've talked about this the judge tried to stop it. I thought this was interesting Florida city council members tear up at vote over ice partnering with local officers So some fort mires city council members were in tears monday over a vote on a memorandum of agreement between us immigration and customs enforcement and local police of florida city council met to discuss the agreement for city law enforcement To receive the training and authority to act as ice agents to detain and arrest legal immigrants among other functions But during the meeting council members Darla bonk and Diana Geraldo teared up as they voiced their opposition to the agreement check this video out Thank you for what you said Thank you for your comments I cannot begin to imagine how difficult the this for you The argument And I know there's no malintent to it That we would risk federal or state funding if I don't sign up for this It is a tumultuous day and age and this is a day I hate sitting in a seat That my city is not per seal it's the atrix that's terrible Okay, sign the paper lady shut the fuck up Okay, like you're the days of this progressive liberal crybaby bullshit or fucking over Okay, you're not appealing to anybody and by the way What class of people does this woman fall into oh? She happens to be the same one that we talk about all the time she's a bronzer baby The upper middle class white woman who wants to seem virtuous and apologize for never having to face any hardship in her fucking life well lady Some of us out here have to go out into the real world and some of us have to deal with these issues in the real world And some of us don't like risking going out in public or You know taking our wives or girlfriends out in public and being harassed arrived or car jacked by motherfuckers who shouldn't even fucking be here So save the tears and sign the fucking paper and shut the fuck up It's great. Yeah, that's great. That's great man. That's what I would say if I was on the fucking council Which is why I'm probably out on the count. That's probably why yeah I think they do got a vacancy bro. Well, you know what? I mean look get the fuck out of here with this shit Okay, go cry that shit to Lake and Riley's family see what they fucking say about it. That's real. Fuck you. That's real bro Well, I mean here's the thing I think here's a piece that I think most people kind of forgot about these all these illegal migrants that came here Of like the true intentions that a lot of these places were trying to get them to do right like you know the so point of dumping You know hundreds of billions of dollars into these NGOs But so the left could rip use these fucking people As voters who maintain power forever As rappers who they gonna vote for they're gonna vote for the guys that want a reporter Where they're gonna vote for the people that want to stay it's very simple right and it's so funny Dude because I remember we coincidentally New York just passed a lot today. Well that said that citizen No, they can't vote. Yeah, oh you have it. Oh, I have it baby Because dude, I remember all the shit we got when we first shot to cover this concept of like you know the fucking Replacement theory and like oh, we got shit for that. Oh, fuck yeah I mean, I mean, it's just like this ring the shit bitches. Yeah, I don't even fuck a feel it I still drive home my nice ass card my nice ass house. Yeah, you know nice ass dogs. Yeah, okay. This is what it is It's pretty ducks. Yeah. Yeah, no, but it's just like it's just so funny like I remember we said like hey They're bringing these people here to fucking replace us, right like they're those are the spurs to theory you're an anti-Semite Uncle Coons Shut the fuck up Yeah, he had New York City's law they it was actually a law that allowed non-citizens to vote Um, it's dead because the state's highest court shut it down Um, in a six to one the New York Court of Appeals how could and why Would it ever be allowed That's someone from another country be allowed to fucking vote in our country. Yeah Our voting laws are too open anyway as they are there's lots of people that should not be allowed to fucking vote as I say all the time If you pay taxes and you have a job and so you are paying into the piggy bank Then you can have a say if you're 15 and you have a part-time job you pay tax vote The problem that we have in this country is that there's too many people who are Completely on government aid with no job with no tax being paid Who have a say What are those people going to vote for they're always going to vote for more free shit for them That comes out of your pocket So until we fix that problem until that problem is fixed to where unless you pay taxes you do not get to vote That this will still be been be able to be manipulated like this. They're 100% man That that's the easiest solution. It's not an age. It's not it's not a gender. It's not a sex. It's not anything Do you pay tax in or do you not very simple? Yeah Now another New York City news that just come now you remember that court case against Trump for you know line on this yeah right for for for lying on Is a mortgage application? Oh you mean the one that was uh that you know every single person in the history of Applying for mortgages could be convicted on because the amount of your property is up to debate. Mm-hmm that one Yeah, you know you know you said something there like that everybody does on the mortgage applications every single person Yeah, including the person that Trump is fucking prosecute Trump for doing it Oh We fucking said this we said this whenever this all came out. Yeah, I said I guarantee you do if you look at Latisha James's uh mortgage application you could argue that what her she put on her application is not the actual value of her property you could do what I'm saying here guys I'm not saying that everybody lies. I'm saying that no matter if you put the most accurate Assessment of your net worth on your mortgage application and that includes the price of your property that price is up for Discussion and interpretation and debate depending on who is valuing the property Okay, if someone who owns the property, they're gonna say it's worth more if someone's buying the property They are clearly going to say it's worth less right, okay, and so that is that is is not It's coming prog and the banks know it dude the bank knew the Trump did it's they said that no It's in the fucking fine print that these numbers Represent to the best of your knowledge right? There's no certification and an appraisal does not equal the value of your home, okay You could put anything you want on there. You could say it's worth I could go say my house was worth a hundred million dollars Because houses in California that are similar to mine are worth a hundred million dollars now does that make it worth a hundred million dollars No, but you couldn't fucking prosecute me for saying that because it is up for interpretation Well, here's the thing though Littity James she did one worse than this Okay, and we got the documents to prove it She it wasn't it wasn't about the cost of the house for her she lied about the size of the fucking house Because there was a special loan program like let's just let's dive into this for over two decades Latiti Jones James Repeatedly claimed her Brooklyn apartment building was a four unit property on mortgage applications despite official records Proving it had five now All right, I mean what's the big deal? What's the big deal here? Well the big deal she probably could before you even tell me I bet she couldn't qualify for special financing if it wasn't if it was bigger than four one hundred percent One hundred percent and the documents again, they all listed here. Well, that's much bigger fraud than what trump did way bigger Yeah, you're literally learning about the size of your fucking place. Yeah, I mean that's that's not knowing No, it's not even you are Doing it intentionally, right? You know that you will not get the financing unless you lie So you lie and then she has the nerve to go on the TV and say I'm getting Trump Do you remember that guy who said hey if you don't get off this case? I'm gonna throw your fat fucking ass and jail. Oh, did you ever see that in your view? Yeah, I did one of the one of the attorneys like literally said that She said he told her he said big-tissed James if you don't Stop this shit. We're gonna come down there and we're gonna throw your fat ass and jail like verbatim called her that That's awesome. That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, here's a filing You know, this is the Department of Building Certificate of Occupancy, which you know, you see there at the bottom it clearly says it's a Total there's five to five unit family dwelling, okay? Well on the mortgage application She says only four family and again, yeah, it's a specialized loan program that she was trying to to get and She lied about it And apparently there's also some other stuff she lied about yeah because properties with four or fewer units qualify for more favorable Residential interest rates while those with five or more classified as commercial properties often subject to higher rates Yeah, I mean, it's straight up fucking fraud Um, but there's other things. Well, I mean, that's definitely more fraud than what Trump did. Yeah, for sure. Yeah for sure Right Um, you know, and that's it. I don't think Trump did any fraud. No Dude, he paid the loan back plus some look the bank said they were fine about they fucking said Mara Lago's worth 18 million dollars Mara Lago's worth like a billion dollars. Mm-hmm. There's Houses across the street on the ocean There are one acre lots that are two hundred million dollars or more Okay, so to say that Mara Lago, which is an entire fucking I don't even know how many acres it is it's massive though big Yeah, with water on like two sides. Oh man, like It's totable shit. No Um, there's some other stuff too that apparently she's uh, she also lied. What's what's what's what's Mara Lago? The size of Mara Lago Acre-wise 17 acres okay, so that's one point seven billion dollars of of value considering that the comps of the other yes, yeah Yeah, that's crazy, man Um, but there was also some other stuff that she lied about too on official fucking documents Using her her father like here she lists this guy Robert and James and latisha James his daughter Right, but then on another farm to get again some more financing They're married Robert James and latisha James his wife same people But that's her dad, but that's her dad Again, special financing special tax incentives. I mean listen. I hope Littini James goes to fucking prison. Listen It's illegal what she did dude that hit the only thing she's done in to legal Everything she did the false prosecution all of the shit she deserves to be in jail for the rest of her life Dude to bring false charges against someone because you don't like their political ideology or you hate them so much or whatever Bro jail for life. Yeah, that's that's no different than a woman accusing a man of rape that didn't fucking do it Actually, I have them. It doesn't matter if they're guilty or not the accusation alone will fucking ruin his life Yeah, man, it's fucking crazy man guys jumping on this conversation down to the comments. Let's know what you guys ponder Why doesn't that's new before me ponder yep, that's a good one. Yeah, all right cruise keeps cruising. We got headline number three um Let's get into some some business stuff There's some things that are changing on the business landscape Uh headline number three reads Ben and Jerry's for a long time. They've been on some wild communist leftist bullshit They just fire their CEO saying that it was all him. Oh, that's well, that's not true because Ben and Jerry are both like super whips Well, the thing is like they don't they don't like so unilever own Ben and Jerry's the brand. Yeah, right and that's a culture That's been set out from that brand from those guys, but like bro real talk those guys are hippies. Yeah, okay, and by the way They make a great product. Oh, I love there. Okay, now that's there is a there's a business lesson Hold on there's a business lesson. Yeah, here's the business lesson If your product's good enough people don't give a fuck about what you say or what you stand for they'll buy your product. Yeah Dude, I'll tell you know how you do that. I've had struggles bro Because they make great products. Oh Ben and Jerry's milk and cookies. Yeah, they make great. Yeah, no doubt. I'll be the first one to agree to but I'm just saying You know, that's a culture they installed in their company for a long time and they have the right to do that Sure, but when they're when they're making posts that are legit like borderline aggressive towards the other half like dude there was a Tim walls was on TV yesterday. Yeah, it's how about Tesla. Yeah, and and they said Whoever was interviewing my camera who it was said something to the effect of you know You know most of You know here he was talking about how people were saying he was gay and not masculine and you know wasn't a football coach And dude, we're all like Yeah, yeah, okay so He said something to the effect of like whoever's interview him said something like um You know a lot of men are Voting for Trump and you know what his response to that was Those are v- those are bad those are bad guys those are bad people Like you think that's an effective strategy bro to get on TV like it just shows the disconnect of what the temperature is And the more they say that shit the lower their influence goes and the more people that go over to that side, bro It's weird dude Well the other piece who that I actually love about what he did is because like most people understand like they're Bash and Tesla Tesla stocks are doing too good, right? But like here's the thing Like the majority of your workers in your states that have 401k's are tied To it's a companies like Tesla and publicly traded assets and their stock portfolio So like you're you're literally hurting your own you're you're having your people Get all riled up to destroy these fucking like and fuck this company up And it's it's hurting those same people And more more American sue everybody has 401k this type of fucking Tesla stock too But it's just like it's like what do y'all do with man? Uh, you know, look dude um I think it's common sense and it doesn't matter what company it is Uh, no company wants to associate with things that are not accepted in the current culture no matter what And the way that that movement has gone It's gotten way too extreme to the point where even the organizers are starting to understand that the product has become inappropriate for anybody. Yeah, so you know, I it is what it is bro. Yeah, yeah It is what it is by the way before we move on because I think we're gonna really move on aren't we? I'd like to I'd like for you to throw up that uh That Chuck Schumer clip from the view. Did you see that clip? I know here it is And you know what their attitude is I made my money oil by myself How dare your government take my money from me. I don't want to pay taxes or I built my company with my bare hands How dare your government tell me how I should treat my customers my The land in order water that I own Uh, or my employees they hate government governments a barrier to people The barrier to stop them from doing things they want to destroy it. We are not letting them do it and we're united this clip Is the epitome of the attitude of every single government official in Washington DC? Okay, when you watch him say that Do you notice that they were putting the music on to get him off the fucking show he was going off script that no He was not going off script. He was going perfectly on script for what they are actually about They feel entitled to the money that is earned by the American citizen And that is the way that they get their money. What is Chuck Schumer's net worth and how much is his salary and by the way Where does the money go that you tax us for oh? It goes into organizations like us a ID Which then funnels the money across the world to fund all of your little NGOs and your political movements And your propaganda machine. So Chuck Schumer is using our tax dollars to propagate Against us and make our lives harder and he has the fucking balls to sit on national television And talk about how people like me who for the first three years of my business I didn't make a single Fucking dollar the next seven years of my business I made $58,380 total Okay, that entire time I had to pay taxes on top of that I could have made more money working at McDonald's okay, and now we provide literally Thousands of people with income we fucking Create jobs we drive the economy we sponsor things in our communities We take care of causes in our communities and we're the fucking problem Get the fuck out of here, bro. The guy's net worth is 81 million motherfucking dollars How do you do that on a government official salary? How do you do that? Oh, you don't you end up stealing people's tax money over and over and over again And he's pissed off because his water faucet that comes off the labor of people like me and all of you is now getting fucked with Okay, so Chuck Schumer fuck you and fuck everybody like you you guys deserve to be in fucking prison For the rest of your fucking lives and honestly that's being fucking generous It's real shit man. I fucking dude. You want to know? Did I saw that please people fucking hate you? They hate you you are peasants you are you are the little worker bees and little worker ants that they Live off of and hope that you never figured out well guess what Chuck We figured it the fuck out and there's nothing you can do to stop us from figuring it the fuck out from here on out Fuck them. They're stealing your money. They're they're impoverishing you on purpose They're intentionally making it hard on you and they are supposed to be making our lives better not worse And they get mad they get mad when they can't fucking punish you anymore Think about that. It's crazy. They get pissed off that they can't financially handicap people the way that they did just 60 75 days ago Fuck these people, bro This government for there's some there's a few good people in it, but most of them they exist to legitimately stifle and And and and force Americans into struggle for their own benefit Okay, guys jump down in this conversation Let us know what you guys think Um, but I can't believe this motherfucker's on TV saying it dude. I saw that. I was like what did he just do? Yeah Yeah, dude. I mean fuck man you and your little fucking just hop out like blatant red red reading glasses like dude Fuck that guy and fuck all those people all of them 100 people that love him and fucking support him Fuck him and by the way The people I'm not talking about the citizens who are ignorant to the truth of what these people actually do like How could you be on their side after hearing that yeah Yeah, where was you at all? Where were these guys? Yeah when I was dying to get my business to run Still to this day they take so much money out of companies. They make it virtually Impossible To to do what it is you're trying to do they allow you just enough room that if you work the right plan in the right way You might be able to squeak through and make it work when in reality if they didn't tax us the way they tax us That rate of success vlogs per newers that we talk about all the time on Monday show which is one percent of the eight percent That would be like 20 percent total There would be so much more wealth and so much more success and so much more good things in our country But these people stand in the way of that and he's bragging about it on TV No shit. We don't want you to take our money. No shit. We built this with our bare hands something that you would know fucking nothing about I don't understand how you guys in Washington who acclaimed to be for the people aren't destroying this motherfucker I Do you think if you want to know the truth of what they think of us play that clip over and over again Because that's the truth. Yeah, they hate you. They hate me They exist to make it as hard as possible on all of us so that we cannot have that much power Because it makes it easier for them to control us when we are too busy Wondering how the fuck we're gonna buy groceries not that I have a problem buying groceries But the reason I don't is because I've worked for the last 26 motherfucking years on the same project As shouldn't have taken that long and it shouldn't have been as hard and I shouldn't have had to sacrifice everything I did to get here the reason I did and the reason it it took so much out of me is because of people like that Taxing everybody to the maximum degree they can to still call it freedom Which by the way isn't free because when you add it all up we actually work for them more than we work for ourselves Yeah, guys, let's know what you guys think man down in the comments That being said man, let's get to our final segment of the show. Yeah, that's fine It fucking pisses me off dude. Yeah, people are not pissed off enough about the amount of about the amount of fucking shit these people do to us I mean, that's the only thing they just don't they either don't understand it all or they're complicit in it like you like at this point You can't I think there's a lot of this understand look The system they have works it makes people struggle to the point dude if you're worried about Being able to afford fucking raman noodles and pay your rent and take care of your fucking kids And how the fucking you notice that there's you can't yes, that's what I'm saying That's how the system is designed. Yeah, the system is designed to make the average person so financially oppressed and uncomfortable That they cannot notice how much is actually being stolen from them But I'm the problem. Yeah, it's actually more. Yeah Yeah, guys with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck It's where we bring a headline in video articles something like that we talk about it and we give it one of those two options So with that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline rates Four-year-old boy calls police to report mom for eating his ice cream.
