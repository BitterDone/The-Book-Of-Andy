And so we gotta go back a little bit Because a few weeks ago We covered this on the last show But people tried to Like, oh there's beef going on Because Elon Musk is leaving the administration And it's like, no, that was just his government contract It ended on May 30th And it was really a big deal Right? But then shit got heated So on June 3rd Elon Musk tweeted this out He says, I'm sorry but I just can't stand it anymore This massive outrageous Porkfield congressional spending bill Is a disgusting abomination Shame on those who voted for it You know you did wrong You know it So that's what kind of kicks you off And then you know Musk kept going Because Trump said that he knew About the bill he knew the insides and outs Right? And he lines like The fuck I did Right? Then it keeps going Right? And Musk and listen And I wanna talk about this piece real quick Because I think there is a lot of truth in this So Musk tweeted this out on June 5th He said, without me Trump would have lost the election Dems would control the house And the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate It's hard to argue that It's very hard to argue that I mean he dumped what $400 million or something like that I don't know, I mean a lot Like it was a shit ton of life Yeah, I mean look dude, I don't think he's off base saying that No No, I mean like you gotta be able to state the facts man Like Musk did some work Yeah, Musk did some work Now then shit got really weird And I'm sure you guys have all seen this tweet Okay? Elon Musk tweeted this out Saying time to drop the really big bomb At Real Donald Trump is in the Epstein files That is the reason they have not been made public Have a nice day DJT Ooh shit Ooh shit And then he replied to that tweet saying Mark this post for the future We did We already right now Fuck Dude that's hot That's hot and like it didn't stop there It kept going Russia even jumped in on this Apparently Putin came out and said that he would Give Elon Musk a silo If he needed to like political asylum Because like you know Must didn't kill himself all that shit starting to circulate And that's cool right And then Musk Put out another video like i mean do they been hammering back and forth This video comes out This is an old video of Trump party And with some NFL cheerleaders and stuff Have you guys seen this clip? No, do you guys want to see the clip? Let's check it out Of a Mar-a-Lago party shows Trump giving Epstein his personal attention Donald Donald Donald Donald The footage shot in November of 1992 Trump opened the resort of the club Showes the future president surrounded by cheerleaders for the buffalo bills and Miami dolphins Capturing Trump's fun loving bachelor lifestyle For an appearance on Faith Daniels NBC talk show I'm going to get great ratings in your show Trump is surrounded by women as music players in the background After a while Trump goes to greet three new guests Among them the financier Jeffrey Epstein More than a decade before his guilty plea on state prostitution charges Later in the footage Trump is seen talking to Epstein and another man As women are dancing in front of him Trump alternates between dancing and pointing out women to Epstein and the other man And telling Epstein about the cameras Though exactly what they say is difficult to understand as they discuss the women and their appearances Trump gestures to one and appears to say to Epstein Look at her back there She's hot And then Trump says something else into Epstein's ear that makes him double over with laughter But as the president said So yeah, I suppose Yeah, I mean I Okay, that's the question What the fuck is that hairstyle though? I don't know dude Like, would that the thing back then? I fucking don't know I was like 10 I'm not that fucking old man No, I was just saying I mean I bet I bet big German had that haircut Yeah, I guarantee So Alright, yeah, where are we going? Yeah, let's talk about it Alright, so I've been thinking about this And at first I was like, alright I wonder what's actually going on But I think I figured it out Okay, first of all What the fuck doesn't matter if he's at a party with the Buffalo Bill's cheerleaders I'm pretty fucking sure that most dudes that are worth billions of dollars Who are single at that time are going to be at the fucking Buffalo Bill's party Yeah, alright, I'm, you know, the Buffalo Bill's party You can question this sexuality if they're not But This Elon thing It's pretty well known that Trump kicked Epstein out of his club Worked with the FBI to get him arrested With the first set of charges So there's that That's at least what we know Yeah, that's what we've been told So like when I look at this You know, these are two very smart dudes Alright, Elon and Trump And they're both very strategic And Everybody's jumping on saying Oh man, you know, what's going on this set? But dude, if I was them I would be thinking strategy And I think they both think that way Yeah And yes, Trump has a big ego And yes, Elon has a big ego Massive But I have a hard time believing that they would let their big egos get in the way Of what's going on with our country Yeah Maybe I'm wrong But if there was a better way To get The left To scream for the Epstein list It's not weird Yeah, I can't think of a better way So When I look at this, I'm start At first I was definitely taking a bat But now I'm thinking like fuck dude This seems like a play they're running To get something out And dude, by the way You're going to tell me that for the last Four, five years Eight years that this has been going on That they're not going to drag Trump for being on the Epstein list That they knew he was on it That would have been dead You see what I'm saying? So you're saying they're still boys And then Like if they're not And then what's that say about Elon If he knew the whole fuck of time and say shit Then yeah So like there's all these different scenarios of play And I don't know, I think these guys are pretty smart I think it might be attacked to try and drag this out And make people all demand for this list Because dude, if the left had If the Biden administration and the media And all this had this information You don't think they would have posted it before the election They would have for sure They would have went on and on and on about it Yeah, because they didn't want to mend Right, they didn't want to mend that makes sense It makes sense So I'm not, I mean dude, I'm not sure But like, I don't think it's what it appears to be What do you guys think? You think Trump is him with Epstein? You think? It's okay, it's all right You think Elon and Trump had an ego falling out for real You think they're playing him? Yeah Dude, because I'm saying like when you start giving away fucking like This came out, Trump wants to give away or sell his Tesla back That's like Dude, this is like some baby mama drama You know what I'm saying? Like it's almost so absurd Yeah, there's no way And like Elon Musk is African Americans I mean like it makes sense It's like, it's Trump's a racist That's what I'm saying, it makes sense You know what I'm saying? But like, dude, I will say this If it is an ego thing, if that really what it is Like if that's really what this is And this is a big ego thing And it's a true falling out It's terrible for the country right now It's closed right now I'm f***ing a cl渊 Yeah, ahh I mean Cuz it's not just awesome Um, so I'm like growing up Almost gonna lie with bullshit How that is But image Peach Ghost that you get I guess we're just gonna have to wait and see what happens. Yeah, the crazy thing is, man, like, because it has started some conversation, all right? With this Epstein stuff, the pedophilia stuff, right? And I don't even, they tell them themselves. Because now you got the left talking about it, right? Like the Democrat Twitter page tweeted out about it, right? And now you got these guys coming out from all these, you know, crazy fucking pito places. And they're weird. I would like to introduce you guys to a guy named Peter Schiff, okay? This is his Twitter, he's a chief economist and global strategist for EuroPack. Okay, he's chairman of Schiff Gold, founder of Schiff Sovereign, host of Schiff Radio, never heard of it. He's supposedly a best-selling author. Sure. All right, Pete, what you got, Pete? Pete made this tweet yesterday, okay? FYI, pedophiles are attracted to pre-pubescent girls and boys. I'm not defending Epstein, but he had sex with teenage girls, 14 through 17 that had physically developed sexually. They were under age, so criminal and immoral, but that does not make him a pedophile. Yeah. Check this one for his hard drive, bro. What you're doing? I agree. Straight up. I'm sure anybody own what chip is right here? Yeah. We got contact right here? We get some. All right. Yeah. And here's the crazy. That's a fucking weird thing to say. It's super weird. I'm provoked. He just, now this is now deleted, but nothing's deleted on the internet. Oh, yeah, check his hard drive. That's true. The crazy thing is he doubled down on it. He doubled down on it. He said, what's your point? Can somebody call them out? They're like, what the fuck? He's like, what's your point? I clearly wrote that I was not defending Epstein, and that older men having sex with under age girls is wrong. I just don't like it when people redefine terms. That's not what it sounded like you said. No, it doesn't. Yeah, there is a definition if anybody needs it. What it sounded like you said is, I don't even want to say it. Somebody go clip it. Look at me like, look what Andy said. We have a funny said. Yeah, dude, it's weird. What do you think that black guy was about with Elon too? Second, that was weird. You think Trump and him got into it? Right, they might listen. They might have a little tussle, man. I mean, because I'll also say this, like, you know, when you got passionate guys that care about each other, it's not unusual for things to get a little heated. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? That's cool. That's how I get to fight like once a year. And this parking lot, that's a care. Yeah, like shit happens. Yeah. You know, but I don't know, man. I don't know, man. I don't know. Guys, tell us down in the comments what you guys think, man. With that being said, who wants a thumbs up or a dumbest fuck? Sure, yeah, we did that. Yeah. Final segment for CTI today, guys. As always, we're going to do a thumbs up or a dumbest fucker. So we're bringing a headline in. We talk about it to get one of those two options. Let's go to Florida. Yeah. How many Florida people? Hey, who's in Florida? Yeah. All right. You all got to leave. Yeah. Don't drink the fucking green one. Yeah, go drink it anyway. Yeah, fuck man. We don't have enough drywall for you. Yeah, fuck. There's Florida people get wild. Yeah. Wild. Let's go down to Florida for our thumbs up, man. Our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads Florida motorcycle is injured after hitting six foot alligator on highway. I don't think you can get more fucking Florida than that. Yeah. And there's a video drinking a mound. That was a video was drinking a mound. It was a little more Florida. I'm crossing here. Yeah. Let's dive into this. So it was two motorcycles were hospitalized over the weekend after striking a six foot alligator on a Florida highway. According to state highway patrol, the bizarre collisions took place Saturday around 6 p.m. on interstate four in Volusia County, according to Wofl. Everybody catch that? All right. Orlando based Fox Philly. So 67 year old Cameron Gilmore, who sustained a broken foot and toes after hitting the alligator, told Wofl that he and the 25 year old Brandy cross gross were riding with a larger group in the farmer noticed a big blob on the road. Let's check this clip out. On Saturday, two motorcycles collided with something they never expected to see on their lane. I felt like 10 feet in front of me and I just, you know, I thought I knew it's going to hit it kind of just had so quick. I didn't have a second to do anything couldn't put on the brakes or not. And I just had to hold on 67 year old Cameron Gilmore flew off his bike. One of the riders in front of me said he went by the gator, looked in his mirror, saw me hit it and I flipped over the handlebars and landed on my head on I4 and rolled. Ooh. Was the gator okay? I did. Our gator is really that bad down there. Like there's just on the fucking highway. Like we have crack heads on the highways here. But we have different problems. Same thing. But different. Same thing. That fucking environmentalist. That's what it is. That's what it is, man. I think the gator is fine. Like, no, I don't think so. I think they covered his head because he's dead. That's true. Yeah, I don't think he made it. Yeah. Let's dump down for the gator there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think? I'll be fun. I tell you this, I've run into some shit, like some final destination shit on my bike a few times. Never a gator. Not a crack head either, but I ran into some stuff. Like what? Like, dude, we were riding the Pac-Wants and we have a guy that's in our club and he like, I can't say it. He Jerry Riggs. His Jerry Riggs is bike. And he breaks his bike. And do we ride and we're probably doing like 90 miles an hour. And you know, motorcycle says that, you know, it's like it was like 15 of us has at home, right? And all of a sudden you hear me, he's fucking exhaust pipe comes off. And it starts like doing that fucking slow motomble, right towards me. Hit my fair in the shit, but we didn't fall. We were fine. And like you have like very limited time to fucking make some decisions there. So I mean, I couldn't imagine running to a six-foot gator, but we're a crack head, but yeah. It's too bad. It wasn't an environmentalist. Dude. Like their hands glued to the pavement. Fuck. Fuck those guys. I want to see some of those people in real life. Like who are you real? Like what the fuck is wrong with those people? Like you think you're really solving something by gluing your hands to some shit, you know? Do you remember they did the Starbucks counter? Yeah. Or the art? Yeah. What's that group? It's just stop oil or some shit like that, I think. Run him over. Comey-ness. Run him over. Anyway, I feel bad for the gator. Yeah. I like the animals, man. Yeah, that's real. Don't carry as much for the people. Sorry, Brandy. Yeah. You know? Yeah. So I'm giving this thumbs down because the gator got hurt. Yeah. All right. I'll be gator. Yeah. Yeah. I think they say they nickname that guy. Yeah, they call them gator Gilmore now. Yeah. Yeah. Why is that? I guess he killed the gator. I guess. I don't know. Yeah. Happy Gilmore. Happy Gilmore. Kill the gator. No, that's his. I think that's his last name. Did you see happy Gilmore? You gonna put me on the spot on movies about like right now. Did you see it? No, I don't. I think. Wait, wait, wait. All right. All right. All right. Is that that's Adam Sandler? Yeah. Right. Yeah. With the golf shit. Yeah, that's right. You're trying to play golf now. You don't know happy Gilmore? No, I've never seen it all the way. This guy gets dressed up in all the golf shit. I'm wearing this golf shirt tonight.

My shift starts in 20 minutes. All right, so how are we doing this bro? Yeah, so we're gonna we got we got some Q&A So we want to you know guys know how we do it right so business life person development really anything really anything We just want to do some some live Q&A with you guys that work Is this where you want them to come yeah, so you go ahead and pick out who you want to pick out? Let's get right here right here. Yeah All right All right, before you start telling what you did all right. Hi everybody. My name is Joe Back in June 1st 2022. I started 75 hard on day 50 I listened to the 1000 day podcast and then I decided to do a thousand straight days of 75 hard So back in February we got invited out to HQ. I got to meet everybody So yeah, my question is you know usually my days start at like 3 30 and I am I say I And then they usually end around like 9 10 11 depending on the day and You know that's been going on for years now So I know you talked about there was a time where you had your biggest Epiphany about business when you were sick with pneumonia Yeah, you know, I know Goggins talked about how he was massively injured before he reflected on The ultramarathons the hell weeks and everything else like that. So how do I Go through that reflection period without Going through a massive injury or a massive illness Dude, I think those come at different times in our lives man I don't think it's something that we control other than practicing the idea of you know gratitude and where we're at What we got going on what we've accomplished I Answered this question yesterday. I'm drinking bros because I thought it was interesting but You know, I try not to Attach myself too much to What I've done. I try to stay focused on what we're doing and when I've seen Someone go beat that guys. Yeah, it's really as a small PB. Yeah, it's cool. It's cool if I do it But Anyway, he's still going. Yeah, so so dude. I think You know, it's very when I see people fail and I've witnessed people fail in life and business it's It's not because they are Hard on themselves. It's because they celebrate too much and they start to give themselves too much So I think it's very difficult balance between you know acknowledging your achievements and how far you've come and also being dissatisfied with where you are and You know if you lean one way too hard You know towards you know, I'm a piece of shit. I need to do better. That's not good and if you If you go the other way too hard you're gonna lose because you're gonna think you don't have any growth to have to have so I personally think You know as far as those times of reflecting I don't know that you can manufacture them the way that that you're asking but I think that Consistently auditing where you are and what you need to do in a very unbiased way is the best way to serve that along the time You know a lot of us get caught up in one way or the other right we tell our internal self-talk is Fuck dude. I'm a piece of shit. I haven't done anything. I'm not doing no matter what we've done And what you guys got to understand is that anybody's that are trying to achieve anything Anybody's that trying to do anything? We're gonna always feel like we got more to do that's just the way you're fucking wired and you should be grateful to be wired That way because most people are not most people have a win and they hang on to it their entire lives They got MVP of the soccer game back in 1987 like no one gives a shit, you know what I mean? So You know those times are gonna come dude, and I think they're gonna come for most people when We don't have the ability to do the things that we really get fulfillment from and I think we got it Because I talked to David about that too and myself that came from us not being able to do the thing that we want to do and Dude, Joe, there's gonna come a time where you're gonna be on the fucking sideline bro And it's just not it's gonna be out of your control That's gonna come for everybody in one way or the other and I think when those times happen is when those reflections start to happen We start to find bigger purpose. We start to look at bigger things We start to realize that the things that maybe we are obsessed with and concerned with are only a small tip of the big picture not that they're irrelevant, but there's more and I think you know depending on where you are how old you are what you've gone through what you're going through currently Those things come at different times. So all right Okay, so I want more statement on November 8th 2022 you posted like some projects that you were doing I know one of them was like the official 75 hard live hard community Yeah, and I'd love to be a huge part of that. Oh, you're gonna be yeah, I already got you locked up, bro All right, I know where you at about Joe is a stud a Freakin stud all right next question. We want to go Z let's go. I'll I'll hear her right here. Wait for me. Hi. There you go. She might be there bring her up Right there is he's trying to blue no no one more behind one more behind She I got you. Yeah, we got your next we got you. No, you're good. You're good. We'll do both Hello, hi, how are you good? How are you good? Um, my question is about AI. I work for This manufacturing company and I'm in charge of all the audits and I using AI it cut the audit like a Prep work for two weeks and my boss is really happy that I got it done But I don't know if I should share like hey, I'm using AI to cut my job like in half So it makes me a little nervous like with all AI stuff. Yeah, yeah, for sure So you're asking how do you let them know without being devalued? Yes, okay, I got it. So the way to do that and by the way This is gonna be relevant. Great question. It's gonna be that is a great question. It's gonna be relevant for all of us all right The when I first started talking about AI. I was definitely very Terrified of it and you guys know I've been warning against this for years and years and years But you know Sometimes shit comes and there's nothing you can do about it and that is the reality of AI. It's here You know when the internet started there was companies that said I'm not gonna use it those companies are out of business When social media started people said I'm not gonna use it those people are irrelevant um AI is gonna be the biggest thing of those things and And the way that people should be looking at it Is how to exactly how you are by the way is how do I equip myself to be the most productive with this tool right? It's and we should look at it as a tool. It's no different than using a A hammer and a chisel to carve some stone. It's a tool and the better that we can carve the stone The better we use the tool and so What I would do now how familiar is your boss with AI very or not really not not really So what I would do is I would come up with a presentation of Okay, this is how I'm doing things and I want to show you because if we could get all of our employees up to speed with this skill We could increase productivity like this Instead of going at it on a on a with fear like he's gonna see that I'm cheating and I'm That's if you if that's the way your boss sees it you should find another place to work um But this is a great time for you to take initiative and for you to say hey I'm working with this tool. It's helped me this way. This is how we can use it We should train everybody on how to do this and it'll make us grow this much more instead of us Having to cut all the employees because there's going to be two kinds of companies all right There's going to be the companies that try to eliminate humans with AI and I believe That those companies will ultimately fail and the reason I believe that is because Community and connection with people is a human need all right And I think the companies who will win and by the way I've talked to Gary V. I've talked to all my friends that you guys hear about They all feel the same way that I'm that I'm going to explain this they feel like It is Something that we should equip our employees with and then use the people as the forward-facing user interface We're still going to talk we're still going to communicate But all of my back-end work I'm going to be freed up from to build better relationships with my customers And everybody I've talked to that knows anything about it That's what they're saying So this is a good opportunity for you to be a leader and to say hey, here's what I got here's what I can do Here's what I think we should do and here's how we could grow with this And I think if you were working for me and you came to me with that I would say this is fucking awesome So that would be my advice for that Yeah, I literally cut my work two weeks and we passed the audit with an accident literally I just uploaded all the SOPs everything that the audience requesting and then I say is there any gaps within the audit And then formation I provided literally just like Yeah, and then I go in there and all the gaps and I got to fill the gaps and make make it work But oh phenomenal Listen take the initiative. This is a big deal because like dude these opportunities to really stand out Don't come along that often. So use it to your advantage You're welcome, so my name is I love by the way All right, let's go blue sir. Yeah Hello, my name's Tony. I'm from Pittsburgh. I coach on 12-year-old softball players And I share the show with them because I think what you guys have to say is really important As if you could go back to being a teenager as an athlete what would you say to them because they're 13 so Like I don't really I don't want to be that I'm a non-parent too. So I don't want to tell them what to think or how to feel Look man at well listen just because you're not a parent doesn't mean you don't have advice to offer You're also a grown adult who's experienced lots of things and sometimes Kids don't like to listen to their parents. They like to listen to other people All right, as low kids. So there's there's a good don't ever feel like You know, you can't offer because you're not because that's bullshit Here's the thing all right. I grew up in sports. How many of you guys grew up in sports? Okay Team sports and individual sports offer us a unique perspective That is reality. It's parallel to reality. Okay, it doesn't matter what the teachers say in the classroom in terms of how things might work It doesn't matter You know when the the feel good parents want to give 20 plates trophies to the fucking high school team like That none of that shit's real. It's all fucking bullshit Okay, when you get out in the real world and tell me this isn't the truth When you get out in the real world nobody gives a fuck. Okay, is that true or not? Okay, they judge you on your performance They judge you on how you can lead how well you work with the team What you can execute on and the the the high the level of your work all of these things can be learned in team sports and dude I Almost everybody that works for us is a team sport or individual sport player and the skills that you can learn From that are completely parallel with the skills that need that you need to have to win at life And that's something that I would work to as a coach I would work to tie that into their brains now, right? It's not just hey We've got a work hard in practice because we got to win the game. It's hey We got to work hard in practice because when we make a habit of working hard We take that other places and it rewards us in other ways. It's tying the lessons into The reality for these kids and you know, there's the best coaches in the world are very good at doing that Even the high level coaches like Nick Saban and these people that we know as the best coaches They don't just talk to these these are grown men that they're coaching and they don't just talk to these men and say hey This is about football most of these guys coach on character and life first and then football and it's just a great instant lesson for these people to learn On the spot about how life really works and and I think you know coaches how many you guys coach teams All right quite a few of you I think coaches are some of the most important people out there So like just because you don't have kids don't feel like you like you're gonna serve a massive Purpose in people's lives and and dude real talk like the most influential people for me besides my parents Have been coaches that I had and and also real talk The ones I hated the most that's one of the ones that I'm most grateful for now So and I'm probably that guy for some of you guys So uh, so yeah, man. That's that's what I will work on doing Yeah, thank you so much. I appreciate it. I'll get some more there. We got some time. Yeah, let's get some more where we go We'll go here. See? Yeah, like shirt And he first and foremost 75 hard completely changed my life back in November of 2023 So I would like to thank you first and foremost for creating the program And exposing it to people like me to be able to do what I've done to this point Which is nothing in comparison to what I plan on doing so thank you. I bear. It's all you dude This question is more on the personal side of for me Growing up my parents gave me everything that I needed in order to pursue the things that I wanted to do At their own expense of not being able to pursue their dreams my dad Being a business owner in his early days Was unable to pursue those because depression and anxiety at a very high clinical level very deep Was not able to sustain that business without feeling like he was going to kill himself. So he brought himself out of it At this point in his life Thank you. I appreciate that At this point in his life I guess I should say in my life. I've started to pursue personal excellence Becoming the better version of myself and seeing where it can take people like myself other people That are at this event as well He is at a point in his life where he feels that he's done. I believe he's he's about 53 And is essentially waiting to die It kills me to see him like that And I understand that living the example is the best way to bring people up to you to inspire them that they can do something I struggle to see how he could get out of the place of these in Just by me leading as an example in that way because he seems so adamant about his life essentially being over Ultimately my question for you is what is your perspective on that because I know you've struggled with a lot of these things yourself And what do you think? What do you what do you think of of that in the future for myself? actions I could take Even just perspective shift for me and how I can even see it as someone who's gone through that yourself. Yeah, so By nature of what your parents sacrificed for you to Do what they wanted you to do or what you wanted to do You could tell that your dad is likely a very caring man and Very much so willing to put himself Second to what it is that you Need my right on that Okay, so he say yes, so Here's what I think you should do okay Whatever it is that you're working on you need to like a hundred X that vision All right, and then you need to look at him and be like dad You're fucking 53 years old, bro. You're not even you're barely halfway done Okay, I know it's hard and I know that you feel the way that you feel but I need your help to do this and I would plug him into that mission Because he's already wired to serve And if you could give him most people with depression the reason that they feel that way is One, they lack purpose they can't think of what the fuck they're supposed to do and two They're so frustrated with their lack of action that is demoralizing They're like looking up at this massive mountain and they're like fuck if I hadn't had done this in this in this I wouldn't be here and the idea of climbing that mountain is overwhelming all right, so Not knowing anymore than what you said what it feels like to me is that he needs a fucking purpose, bro And the reality is is he's you're your his biggest purpose by the actions he's already taken So whatever it is that you're working on whatever it is that you have going on You need to think way bigger and then you need to like look at him be like look dad I can't fucking do this without you man like I'm gonna need you to get off the couch and help me with this And when people start to feel needed and they start to recognize a purpose They will get in a in a in a rhythm of action which will help break them Out of that spell that they're under if that makes sense. So that's what I would do if I were you All right, thank you very much. Yeah, I appreciate it. All right. All right. It was a good another one We got anybody in the back blue shirt blue shirt with the idiot. Yep. Can we get to him That's a big head right there baby Look all in brains Where's your head? There we go You're they all right my head's a little weird shape on that one man Like that in real life. It's like an eggish. It's English. Yeah beard looks good though Oh Looks like a potato Hey, I don't believe it. He's already got damn it. I don't feel real I would I would think it was you were more attractive if it looked like a potato. Thank you. I love potato But you love potato. Yeah, that's true. Thank you Potatoes I do like them All right, yeah, well that's why he's on swamp still here. Yeah All right, what we got first of all man, you your message here and it when I did change the entire trajectory of not just my life For my family's life so like thank you from the bottom of my heart Um and just for some context I used to be over 500 pounds. Holy shit, bro. Yeah That is fucking That's fucking off. What are you at now? Like around two 15 damn dude. Oh my god Nice Well, that's fucking crazy. Yeah Did you break my mic So um For for context this is this is my I'm currently on uh phase three of my second live hard year Um, fuck yeah, man. Thank you. Thank you. So I mean, I know I have the ability to follow a plan and do hard things. Yeah Um, is that what got you happy in the first place? You couldn't do those things? I just like comfort man That that was my thing is like I just when it came to money anything I I just want to be comfortable with like the phrase I said not not like getting uncomfortable. Yeah Asking a question in front of hundreds of people. It's uh, that was a problem Um But when it comes to my business like I can't follow the plan I'll do it until I get to that point of comfort where like I hit that number in the account where I feel okay And then uh and then I stop so my question is like I I know what I want to do I've like through this process and like all Keep breaking it and how about let's try this one All right We got a new one. There you go Don't let me touch it All right, cool So my my question is like I know what I want to do and it like through all the time of like losing the weight and walking Rukin um, I've thought a lot and like is it time to like scrap the old business plan and Move to this new thing like the purpose that I feel like I'm really here for Well, I mean, I don't know what that purpose is. I don't want you broke So for context like I got 19 years clean to him recovering addict that I like Bro I fucking love this guy. Yeah, so I mean the warrior the the plan is like I want to help people who are like me like when When uh, you know, I was an addict from being a little kid It was just food that I took a little reprieve to get on drugs and then like I went back to food when I got off drugs But I want to help like other people, you know, maybe start it but like stop it before it starts like helping kids with nutrition Or just help other recovery addicts with their nutrition. So they're just not white knuckling Trying to not be a fat fuck Well, let me ask you so you so you want to make a living doing that? Yeah, I want to do like recovery houses and like you know See where it goes all right, so why don't you do it? You've already got the fucking experience. You've got an amazing story people are gonna be inspired by that I what what is your other business real estate, okay? Well, can you not do both? You can all right. Yeah, I was I was gonna ask you to ask about people do real estate and something else. Yeah, okay um Listen dude Success is relative. It's not just about how much money you make, okay? There's also fulfillment involved all right and it's very important And I believe that if you are more fulfilled with your work, you can make more money. I've seen that a million times Do you like money? I don't know because every time I get uh, dude, uh, so you got a limiting belief bro. Yeah, do you like fucking money or not? Yeah, I like fucking right who likes money All right, so it's okay to say you like money first of all because it's true and anybody that says they don't is lying Okay, and they say that to be virtuous But if you offer them a hundred bucks, they'll fucking take it all right So for me 20 all today with every time every time you hesitate to say I want money or I like money Money gets further away from you all right, so remember that secondly You are going to be much more effective at making money if you care about what you are doing as the product meaning If you care about actually changing people's lives, which it sounds like you do You're going to be successful at it because you're going to be so fucking good at it That people will pay you anything to fucking do it, okay? So my recommendation is is for you to maintain your real estate business spend Go develop this new career and take the money that you make and invest in real estate And that's how I'd be looking at it bro And if you're scared to make the jump just imagine yourself for the next 50 years doing just real estate You already know the answer bro you guys fuck you all motherfuckers know the answers You all just want me to hear it say validation Yeah, bro, here you say go fucking help people man people need help. Oh, yeah, you know how to help them Oh, yeah, so go do it and DJ 20 bucks is 20 bucks man And listen 20 bucks is 20 bucks bro. Yeah, he's about a hundred bro. This is cheap One more let's get one more Let's go up the young buck right here Joe young buck right there Fuck he looks tall I'm gonna have you move right here Thank you Hey, I'll tell you dude. I like six one and a half. How old are you 19? All right So what's up man? So I'm 19 years old and I'm in college right now and I don't I won't really want to work nine to five I don't want to be reckless, but um I just keep wondering like should I be in college or should I go all in on Um, how do I know and it's time to bet everything on yourself and just walk away instead of what doing Everyone else's is like the safe path. What are you going to college for uh business? And what are you what's your vision of what you want to do? I want to start something with my dad. Uh, I've seen my dad. I see your dad over there Yeah, so my dad he started a business about five years ago and he got it. You went through one of the hardest things I've had to see yeah bro, it's hard Hey brother You're doing good man. Hey, hey Listen bro, being a warrior's hard to fuck. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? Like that that's that's why most people don't do it Um, so he did 75 hard five times and he came back stronger than ever and I want to start something with him And build something really big and I just like wondering if I should be at college or if I should Stay at a college and save money and try and build something from scratch. Okay All right That's all right. I know it's a great question I just don't want to step on your dad's toes But here's the deal bro At this point in time and the way information is flowing and the way information is available If you go out and put yourself in a hundred to two hundred thousand dollars worth of debt And I said for you to go do that I would be giving you wrong information. Okay, that I don't feel like that's the path anymore I know I know it's not And if you were my son, I would say hey look there's all these ways to learn. There's all these things you want to do You don't need to go to college and put yourself in hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt You need to start learning about those things right now. Okay, because information is happening so fast An evolution is happening so fast in business now by the time you start a class and the time You end the class in a semester the information is different That's how fast the environment's moving now and you're not gonna you're not gonna get a complete scope of what you need to know Now you're gonna learn some basic skills and also there's some value in learning how to socialize with people Oh, yeah, all right. That's that's a real thing. Yeah, but I don't know that that's worth 200,000 dollars to fucking do that so Yeah, here's what I would say here's what I would say I would say before you do anything Do not quit until you have something specific to do because what will happen is you'll quit and then you'll float and then it'll be one year two years And you'll be saying I want to do something Pick something it doesn't matter what it is And start doing it and even if that changes you're gonna learn skills that are gonna apply and whatever happens During that time of starting that business even if it isn't your long-term business That will be much more valuable than any education you could pay for at school. Yeah, okay, so There's there's so many good resources to learn from I would be I'm still a very ravenous learner. I mean I read I try to take it. I watch all the the business Shows on YouTube trying to see where the trends are and what's like I think as long as you're a lifetime student and you're always willing to learn brother I don't think you need the college thing But I think you do need to get specific on what you want to do because when you're standing there and you say I want to do something and I understand bro. I when I was 19. That's when I started this, okay Just get something specific in your mind that you want to do before you before you go You see what I'm saying that way you don't get caught in the float Okay, thank you. Yeah, thank you. You should be proud of your dad bro. It's one of the hardest fucking things ever man So and it sounds to me like you're inspired by that yeah, yeah and bro listen dude That shit's hard It's hard man and ain't for everybody, but I could tell just by the way you care That you'll be just fine bro. I promise you so let's go fucking do it all right All right, so thank you Just some more Let's go some more all right guys make sure you hand straight up not not the angle you get us you're gonna get us Fucking fired up here all right We get that Elon Hey, he's let's go over here. We got a I like the bike same best on bison hat right here. Yep. Yep Right here Joe right here. No black hat. Yep. Like it Oh, well, I the bison hat. Yeah, fuck. Sorry with the words. Yeah, he's good. All right First off how you guys doing. Thanks for having us here This is my wife and my first year at summer smash. Oh sweet super cool. Where you from thank you guys We're from New Mexico. All right, so My question. It's not a super deep question, but I'm a I'm a former police officer current firefighter I always generally like to ask what is your guy's opinion on the current climate of law enforcement? Oh, we're about five years. Yeah, post George Floyd. Yeah, it was COVID obviously shit hit the fan for a good few years there Have you guys noticed in general support going up or down or yeah, I'm just curious So you went from real guns to water guns? Unfortunately, yes, there wasn't by choice I mean look dude. I think I think people have always supported the police. Yeah, I think Where it dipped was when they were arresting people on the fucking beach for Covishit and I think some people had always assumed that every police officer would stand With the people with overreach and when that didn't happen. I think a lot of people questioned I feel like that's coming back I feel like people I feel like what people really want to see is for police officers to be allowed to do their jobs and to be allowed to arrest criminals and The criminals be prosecuted and I think the frustration that ever that if we have frustration with the police I think I think it's not at the police. It's that people started realizing it's at the system So and when you talk to I mean, you know when you talk to the guys they're all like fuck dude. We just want to do our jobs you know, and I think that's where most people are you know most people that I've talked to If there was any dip at all like I said it was because of some of the shit that we saw During COVID which represented a little minute tiny bit of police officers. So That's kind of what I'm seeing. I think a lot of that too You know, I've always described it like you got law enforcement I will always say man like everybody wants bacon, but nobody wants to see how the shit's made All right, and making bacon's not a pretty process right it's ugly right and the reality is there's evil fucking people out there Bacon's got a big name, you know I'm saying people want to be able to go to stores. They want to go out to their cars and it's still there or their bike for some of us um and and The process or what it takes to achieve that sometimes is not pretty right And I think we're a law enforcement just in general has struggled and then it's night and day where it is now But I think one of the other bigger issues was just lack of transparency or the speed of it Right, and so and we've seen this over time, right? Like you know, go back to George Floyd It was you know a situation would happen It'd be weeks before there was any actual transparency from that agency And during that time high emotions just getting burned down and I think Departments across the country again, they have gotten way better at this But just the speed of transparency Moving a lot faster, right? So now when a situation happened within 24 hours, we're getting a real The real truth of what actually happened and oh, okay, yeah, little JJ was fucked up, right? Like that's a lot quicker and easier to get to that point, right? And so it's not in day now all the defund the police shit. That's all done nobody nobody's with that now There's still a lot of departments that were actually affected by that too, right? Like I mean we got we got great men and women in uniform here in St. Louis Um, and you know our two biggest agencies here They're both are down by two 300 officers each, you know, and so that's still a piece of that But why it's because they fucking these guys go out and do their fucking jobs And they put themselves in danger for not a whole lot of money And then when they do their jobs the dudes back on the street in a fucking hour Like that's demoralizing bro, and like that's why we're not having people to sign up for sure for sure I think I mean like is this this somewhere going to fix today. It's not going to fix in five years even But I think when you have the community that Allows cops to make the bacon understand it has get made right we have to let them do their job. We got to pay them more, right? I And as long as on the LEO side they continue the transparency the speed of that process And just keeping it together man. I think we'll just we'll slowly but surely get to a much better place I think we're closer than we were five years ago for sure. Way closer for sure. Yeah, I mean like look I want to see some asses get beat. Don't we do you know? I do we call it a customer service. Yeah We call it just good customer service. Yeah, I gotta happen. It is what it is. All right. We got time for one more. Let's do one more. Yeah Let's go black. I'm gonna stop saying black hat guy right here For you. Yep. You yep right there That's one so no pressure. You better. I'm gonna have you come right here if you're not on last one maybe Hey guys Andy. I'm Andy as well. So great name there first of all. Thank you We appreciate you guys having us the main thing is that we always talk about in life nobody really owes you shit Nobody owes you their time their money And when you my question is that when you do have a mentor or some people call them a life coach that has Gone more than above and beyond for you literally change the projectory of what your future holds with finances family physically mentally emotionally spiritually you name it How can we make sure that number one that life coach or mentor is Understanding that we do appreciate it and number two What can we make sure that we're doing to give back and not take advantage of the opportunity that's being presented to us Well, look, I think there's a lot of people that do life coaching that are terrible and they're doing it just for money assuming that this person is actually Genuine and gizofuck You know, I think most of the people that I know that are genuine what they care about is that people carry the torch All right, and that they they up their leadership They up their standards and then they turn around with people that they can lead and the people that they can help and pass that down I have people come to me all the time there say well, what could I do? I'm like bro just live it Just fucking turn around Teach the people around you hold the standard let them see it and And that's that's the reason That's the reason I do this because I look around at the world and I see tons of Wasted potential. I see people very unhappy lacking purpose. I see an attitude of you know, not even good enough like I see like a fucking attitude and That's not conducive to a civilized Excellent culture, which is what this country supposed to be so one of the things that I care most about is That we leave behind a better place than what we got and right now That's not fucking happening and so when we look around and say well, why is that not happening? Well, it's it's not happening because we're not living it properly and the men that came before us and the men that came before them and the women that came before us and the women that came before them all had a very Strong understanding and obligation and sense of duty to pass that down and that's not just here in America, dude That's that's in culture She made it as you made it. Yeah, it's the elders passed down the lessons to teach people how to function and I think we have gotten off track In a very selfish Society where people think it's just about them. It's just about their own lives and it's about what they're dealing with and it's like fuck, dude You know, you're not the only one deal with shit, bro. You know shit fucking it's hard and you know these young kids coming behind you They're dealing with that shit, but they don't know how to fucking address it at all. So I just think the dude the best way to ever Repay someone who has helped in the ways that you describe is to help other people do the same things I think that's why the people with the right hearts do those things and and I think it's needed. I think it's a real duty You know when I talk on the show about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion That's because it is bro. They want us to be complete Completely dependent on them and if you look at how they treat us and how they Panner to us. That's very obvious, right? They want you to sit at home They want you to watch Netflix. They want you to consume all this food with all this bullshit in it They want you to be fucking fat. So you have to take their medicines They want you to be depressed. So you have to take their medicine You think these motherfuckers don't know that When you get locked up in your house for two years and you can't go outside and you can't go play basketball And you're told all this crazy shit that it's not gonna not cause a mental health problem like they know that They did it on purpose and we have to fight back on purpose through the way that we live and Yeah, sometimes that's looking someone in the fucking face and being like hey bro You're being a fucking bitch like you need to grow the fuck up and be a man and you know I just got viral talking about that shit last week grimace. Yeah, the grimace is bro, but that's the truth is truth We have a standard to hold and we need to be holding it. So my advice to that is Live it bro teach the people around you make them ask you what you do You know when you're living a different way than everybody else. It starts like this Hey, man, you're gonna eat some more of that health stuff We got your health stuff there today and then all the sudden dude you become like Home guy here for homeboy who lost 500 fucking pounds and they're like shit, man. What'd you do? It's like I ate all my health stuff You know, and then all the sudden they're seeing that they can do stuff You know, I bet if you ask that man right there I bet you've affected a lot of people who have lost weight already haven't they Yeah, so people will do what you show them and that's the biggest misconception That we all get off track from because dude the reality is We all feel all of us me included. We all feel like our shit doesn't matter sometimes. We're like fuck dude It does not matter doesn't matter what I do. It doesn't matter. I'm not I don't have a big I hear this a lot I don't have a big following No, it's actually more important for you like you're it's more important for you because people will look at someone like me And they will say well, he's living a standard for this reason or that reason or this reason when When you're just Dad and you're doing these things it hits different with people people say fuck dude that guy's a strong motherfucker, bro That's Joe bro. I know fucking Joe. Yeah, and he holds it and so dude. I just think you know I think passing it down the line bro carrying the torch pass down the lines how you make people understand that you took it serious You know so oh yeah, man. Yeah, and by the way you guys do a fucking awesome job at that You know, I don't say that enough You know, I talk on the internet a lot about people who don't hold the line But there's a lot of motherfuckers that do too Okay, and now there's a lot of people here today and this weekend that aren't even here That have been living that standard for quite a long time. So Don't think that we don't appreciate that too because dude. That's what's gonna actually change shit It's not gonna be a president. It's not gonna be fucking Putin or Trump or Elon It's gonna be you in your own household and your own community and your own neighborhood taking charge of yourself And then showing people how to do the same That's what will change the world and that's why they work so fucking hard to keep us feeling like we do not matter That is why they work so hard to make it seem like our voices don't matter Well, if our fucking voices don't matter then why the fuck do they censor all the shit? You see what I'm saying they're afraid bro They're afraid that once people start to figure it out and they understand that it's about living a standard It's about speaking truth. It's about holding a line. It's about being healthy being intelligent everything help everything the opposite of what they tell us They understand and once people figure that out that they are fucking fucked Okay, so our job is to do that. That's it's very simple But it just takes everybody understanding that we all have a role in that so It is what it is bro. We gotta do it Well guys Andy That's all I got me. All right guys Hey If the show makes you think make sure laugh it gives you a new perspective If it's something that you think needs to be heard Don't be a hoe Share the show Thank you guys so much All right Yeah It's kind of cold over here though. They're jacking We're from sleeping on the floor now my jury box froze fuck up, oh fuck up stole counting millions in a coke bad bitch Booted slow got a own bank row can't vote doesn't know here shot case
