Let's give Daniel a call Hello, Daniel can you hear me? Yes, I can. Hey, what's up brothers DJ Hey DJ, how's it going good man? You are alive on the air. I got Andy big dogs sitting right here. Yeah, what's up Daniel? How's it going Andy good brother. So what you got for us today? Yeah, so first of all I just want to say thank you both for doing the show I've been listening a little bit over a year and it impacted me and helped me a lot So I just turned 20 a few days ago and I have pretty much like ambitious goals for my future And uh really simply just what would you guys say is the best ways to just maximize my early 20s to just set myself up for a long term success and happiness Well, I mean, I think that's a great question, dude And I think a lot of people struggle with that especially your age, you know, you have all different kinds of advice that goes on the internet Tell them people, you know to to have fun in their 20s and you got other people that say take it serious in your 20s and um, I Think the biggest thing that you need to do man as uh, you know a young man your age is to cultivate the skill of discipline make sure that you are Working to become a disciplined human being because when we have as you know from listening to the show When we have the ability to make the proper decision That serves our goals long term There's really nothing that we can't do most people do Things in their early 20s that really get them off track, okay? One they party too much to They think they have all the time in the world three They never work on becoming disciplined and because of the ability to uh, not make the proper decision That gets them off track long term. So if I were talking to myself at 20 years old I would say handy look here This is what you got to do bro You got to figure out how you can make the proper decision in the Inconvenient circumstances so that whatever plan we lay out We meaning Andy They then right? We lay out We could stick to the proper choices moving forward and uh, accomplish that plan You know, most people have dreams uh, that they can never really accomplish bro because They don't have the discipline to make the proper decision and if you could cultivate that discipline at 20 years old You're gonna be 18 years ahead of where I was brother because I didn't really cultivate that till I was in my late 30s And uh, you know, once I figured that out and once I started really working on that with Livhard and 75 hard lifestyle Everything even changed for me and I was already doing very well. So That would be the first thing I would do and then after that You know, I'd really do some searching about what it is you you think you want um, what is it that you do want? Are you asking Was that yeah, I'm asking you. What do you want? Uh, so my brother has a pretty successful business nothing compared to you So yeah, but uh, he does really well from self. He's been his 30s. I mean, he's just great overall You know, he you make some money that I want to make one day. He's a great father You know, he's able to just like you said kind of the discipline part He kind of just dealt his life to kind of be what he wanted by doing when he wanted um, but uh Yeah, I'm kind of like an analysis paralysis mode. I mean, I have a good job right now But it's definitely not the dream of any sort Well, listen bro, you know everything that we do when we're young serves us a purpose, okay? Even if it's not what you want to be doing You're gonna learn lessons at that job even if it is what not to do or what I don't like doing and that's valuable as well But it sounds like you have an awesome role model ahead of you, which is a great thing Um, most people don't have that no, they don't know They don't have someone in real life that they can look and see and touch and know um And bro, I would just you know I would stay away from the major mistakes man, you know the major mistakes are you know too much fun too many girls Drugs and too much too much alcohol, you know, I'm saying and uh, you know, I've been on order. That's it Usually they go together But uh, but yeah, bro, you know avoid those mistakes Decide where it is you want to go, you know, most people you're a I think your way ahead of the game brother because You're already thinking about where you want to go and you're willing to take it serious now Which is going to give you a tremendous advantage, you know um You're gonna hear a lot of your friends and they're gonna say hey man, you need to take it easy and you're gonna you know You're working too hard and you got these big dreams Bro those people when you're 40 are gonna be doing the same shit that they're doing now So it's super important that you understand that Your way ahead by just being aware that I want a certain kind of life. So take some time redefine that Like you know get more focused in on what it is you want work a plan backwards from there on how to get there And then just start shipping away at it brother, you know There's really no secret to this. It's just making a decision about what it is you want forcing yourself to go and Figuring it out along the way, you know when I was your age dude. I always thought that people were gonna come along And sort of you know give me permission I thought like you know some of these successful guys that I looked up to we're gonna You know call me on the phone or tell me I was qualified or give me permission to do the thing and bro I'm gonna tell you that never comes and you don't need it, okay You have every right and and every Available skill set available to you to build whatever it is you want and there's no there's no gatekeeping There's nobody keeping you out bro. You just got to go and if you go now you're gonna be way ahead I mean that's when I started I started when I was 19 so you know I didn't have anybody telling me who we could do this shit. They all told me I was fucking crazy So I would I would work on developing that discipline and then use that discipline to execute against that plan of Where you want to go bro and and really it is that simple. There's no magic. There's no luck It just appears to be luck to people who have been watching you work. So So yeah, man, that's what I would do if I were you Yes, I make perfect sounds. All right brother. I appreciate you man. Thanks Daniel your first caller ever on real AF bro Really? I was the first one. Yeah first one ever. That's awesome. Yeah No, I see what you do if you say everything guys do I'm always I'm always tuned in I'm excited for I'm not see it to come out that'll be huge when you when you're the first part of it Um, I was I was still a little kid so I didn't know about it, but now I'm aware so I'm excited for to come out All right brother. Well listen dude have a great day. Uh, let's get this going right now, right? Yes, sir. Thanks so much, Andy and DJ All right. Yeah. Yeah. That was good. Hey, I like it I didn't know what to expect Kind of like that first time you know All right, well, we got a little longer to my first time That was good. Sure as long as his first time. Listen Daniel. I love it bro You got it all figured out you're 20 years old you're already thinking about it You're not worried about all the crazy distractions and it's good. It's it's good And really sharing to hear that from a young man. It was good though He actually had somebody with him. You know what I'm saying? Like I think that's one of the biggest Like if you call it a setback, I guess you could call it a setback that like young people face now is like yeah But nobody around them is fucking really doing it. Yeah, and dude There's a lot to that man just being able to witness it. Yeah Even if you don't know the person just being able to see it Close, you know what I'm saying? Um what it makes sense why so many people fall for these fucking gurus now Yeah, I'm happy to look at 100% maybe real people next to him. Yes, 100% That is why because they've never seen it in real life and dude. I was very fortunate to know I knew I knew of two people that I was able to like see their life, right um And being able to touch and see and and know that those are real people that did real things That was a big deal for me. Yeah, for sure because it validated like, you know, I have enough confidence in myself to understand like well For the most part if if that person can do it. I could do it too. Sure. You know, and I think that's That's where we we need to understand and and to have paralysis of analysis and over analyzing Daniel is very common, bro And even it's it's it's it's common even if you're experienced you can get caught up in it I can get caught up in it, you know, we want to analyze analyze analyze analyze To make sure that we're going to do the best thing while somebody else is just starting to execute And they figured out as they go and that's the game of entrepreneurship man You got to go and really life too. You got to go and then you figure it out as you go Yeah, I love it man. I love it. We got next calling Technically, we're calling them I mean technically, so we're gonna figure this out. We're gonna call our next person Yeah, let's get Chris on the line Here we go Hello Chris Chris, what's up, buddy? This is DJ Oh man, what's up man Let's go over we got Andy here with you What's up, Chris? Oh, no, for real. Yeah, we're so good man. Yeah, this is this is Phone number it's a call your time This is crazy. Oh, I will. Oh, well. No, no man. Oh My god Damn, this is the real man. You don't even know I've been listening to you guys since mfco I found you during COVID all that bullshit And it changed my life man, you know, I started earning a lot better my job I started getting focused. I knew what the real was Thank God at the time it really helped me get through a lot of the bullshit out there um And just navigate life and my family. So thank you guys for that. Wow bro. You did that. You did that Yeah, what you got for us today? What's the question man And my question is how do I take time for myself without feeling guilty about it? Um, I'm just struggle with this You know, it's a dad and a provider. I feel like You know, you want to sit down on the couch after a long day or if I want to chill and go and do something like get in my mind I still hear that voice like hey, you should be doing this. Hey, you know You need to get up and do that. Hey, someone's got to take that take that out, you know Like there's always something and I just I don't know how to kind of be okay With putting me first. Okay, my question. Yeah, dude listen I think anybody who's driven and has massive amounts of responsibility struggles with this as well if they actually care and The reality is dude is you know, you got to think about it like this um If you're on an airplane and Something happens and the masks fall out of the top of the airplane Uh, and then what do they tell you to do? They tell you to put the mask on yourself first And then help everybody else around you and the reason for that is is because if you're incapacitated Can't help anybody so you have to think about that expand that thought process out across your life Okay, you're doing everything you can it sounds like um You know if you were just sitting around and uh, you know, being a dead bee and not doing shit I'm gonna assume that's not the case, but if you were just doing that, you know, we'd have another problem Uh But you wouldn't be feeling I don't think you'd be feeling the way you do if that's what what was going on so Um, right We have to understand that like dude sometimes you have to be selfish to be selfless All right, and what that means is we gotta take care of ourselves We've got to make sure that we make time for ourselves to develop mentally physically keep those things fine tuned uh, and you know Having some time to ourselves is a very big portion of that Because that's the time where we get to audit and the time where we get to you know think and analyze and you know decompress um Yeah, we're in the heat of every all of our obligations You know, it can be very difficult to take that time to Think about what's next or what actually needs to be done or if something needs to change and what that could create brother is a spiral You know where your life is just spiraling and you have no control at all. So You know, I I would Start accepting it right now that you Need that time. It's not a it's not a luxury. It's something that's required and it should be part of your routine and uh just like You know Everybody else in the world, you know, we have to understand that you know while you're carrying a lot of load on your back You're still going to need to have that time and start looking at it as an accessory To what you're doing not something that you're taking away from what you're doing does that make sense Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see that I can see that now it just a shift of perspective. I guess it's just you know The inner voice in my head Keeps kind of like hey man should be doing this you'll be doing that I can't relax Listen First of all, there could be worse things all right there could be right there could have nothing going on up there like most people all right, so But the fact that you know you're overstimulated a little bit man, you know that that's even more I think the reason why you need to make that a priority dude because at the end of the day You know even the most hardened discipline people are gonna need that time. They're gonna need it. So I yeah, I think you're right. I think it's a perspective switch I think it's starting to look at it as it's required instead of it's a it's icing on the cake and And I think that'll help alleviate some of that guilt Yeah, you know, yeah, the other thing too dude is Do you use the power list as a daily tasks? Tool yeah, I do I do it every morning or every night than the day before well remember dude Once you get those five critical tasks done the rest of that time is to be used living your life You know what I'm saying that's the purpose of it the purpose of it Is so that you can be successful and continue to move forward While not having to do what all the gurus say which is work 27 hours out of 24 every day right so Just remember dude. There's only so much we can do in a day and once we do those critical tasks You know the rest of our life Is meant to be lived in the rest of that time Yeah, that's yeah, that's powerful. Thank you. Well, I mean I appreciate you man. What do you what do you think bro? Yeah, no, I think you're right. I think well What what's it all for us? We're not enjoying the journey right? I guess You know, it's just Yeah, I think I think you're right. I think it's you know, you put in the work. So you can reap the rewards I think just maybe a mental shift. I need to make that like you can enjoy The fruits of your labor where you don't have to feel like Okay, I still got to do this. I okay, well, we got to get home because I got to do this like be in the moment Probably something I'm trying to tell myself right now. Yeah, and uh, yeah, we got it. I'm rushed through You don't want to become the guy that works all the time and lives no life You know what I'm saying? Take that in mind the purpose of what we're doing in our lives here is not just to work work work work work It away it is to work so that our life is at a higher quality that we want and as an ambitious person as somebody who wants to be successful You know sometimes that can get clouded, you know, we it gets clouded for me bro. So Just remember uh, yeah, you got to take that time for yourself and Dude honestly if you're having trouble add that onto your power list as one of the tasks that you need to do You know what I mean until that becomes a habit. Yeah So I'm gonna do that All right Chris anything else for us bro Dude, I mean, you know keep keep keep shining the light boys. I mean, you know, thank god We made this shift and I'm so I have a lot of hope for our future now I mean, I was worried there for a minute. I was getting ready, but um You know I want to see the wood shipper out there. That's my last wish. That's the only thing I'm Remember dude. That's that's gonna come down to men like you And and I and yeah, all of our listening here. So you're doing good work brother and we appreciate it I hope thank you guys. Thank you. I appreciate the call. I mean, this is uh Yeah, I really appreciate it. I appreciate you guys. All right Chris take care bro All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, see you brother All right Dude, you know, I was just thinking too like I feel like a lot of people Because there's like it's like dude. We live in these like this world where it's just too extreme These either work all fucking day or play all day You know what I'm saying? I think I might like I think a lot of people have issues with that piece too where it's like Well, I'm in fear if I relax even just a little bit. Yeah, lose them momentum I get you know, I get really upset with the way that that's presented in entrepreneur culture because it is both It's it's one or the other. It's I work five minutes a day and make $50 million a minute or you know I work my ass off and you know 27 hours of 24 and you can't keep up with me because I'm a fucking machine which demoralizes everybody So there's a there's a middle ground which is the truth and the truth is this If you execute on your critical tasks over and over and over again consistently and you use the powerless method Which is available for free at episode 16 on the audio feed, okay? It's called win the day It describes my entire productivity method. I have an app getting ready to drop on this too by the way so that you guys can just use it Which is it's fucking awesome, but The the main thing that we have to understand is the reason that we do all these things is so we can have a And as you know, let's say you're an entrepreneur um, you know You're gonna have a little bit less of a life or you're gonna have to make the business part of your life That's just reality, you know like we talk about here on the show the more you want the higher the price to pay And that's just natural order everybody knows that it's that way in almost every area of life so We can't you know We can't forget that the reason we do all these things is so that we can actually have a life that we love and that we enjoy And that we're fulfilled by and um, you know that looks different for everybody, but I could tell you you know I Chris, you know, I'll tell you this dude like you know, I don't show my whole life every single day But I promise you once those five tasks are done for me. I'm in complete Fuck off mode Yeah, like well, some days you don't get that though. Yeah, some days I don't ever get it right some days It's till 11 12 one o'clock in in the morning. It was last night. Yeah I was I was doing shit to 1 a.m um Some days, you know, it's I'm done by 11 a.m. You've done my new and yeah and and dude I'm you'll see me smoking a cigar 12 30 You know what I'm saying? So we have to understand that and like dude I could tell you from being around all these people like all these people on the internet. I know almost all of them and Yeah, there's a few that you know Really do it the way they say they do it, but most of these guys They're they're fluffing it up for the internet. Okay, like people You should not I guess what I'm trying to get to is you should not feel fucking guilty for Having some time every day to to live. I mean, that's that's the point of doing this So 100% man 100% well, we got another one. Yeah, I want to the next So what's up, Joe? How's it going? Yeah, we're live. Maybe we got 80 dollars right what's up brother? Hey, how's it growing? Doing good. Doing good. So what's up man? What we got what you got for us? Yeah, so I work in a healthcare facility and I Successful in getting rid of contract agency staff My main goal now is to get my overtime down. I'm spending about a hundred hours a week on overtime I did a wage analysis and We're averaging about five dollars an hour Lower than all of my competition. I brought this up to my corporate They are interested in hearing that they told me you got out of agencies figure it out. So Those are the hands-on-bilt so I'm focused on engagement and culture my So far I've been doing monthly cookout town hall meetings with raffle Different competitions with the staff I have an anonymous box for Staff that don't feel comfortable talking in public about any issues Employee of the month and five dollar gift cards for staff members that receive positive user reviews What are some other Strategies I could implement to help compete with these higher paying competitors well look first of all When you make the atmosphere I think you're on the right track by the way when you make the atmosphere fun and rewarding and you know something that people want to be a part of you can you can overcome That issue that you have with the wage being less however It's going to take more than you know just doing a cookout or giving a You know a special gift card for review or something like that What we have to do is we have to get clear on what the mission is for these people all right and then Reward them based around what the mission is and how they accomplish the mission instead of talking to them about the money all right There's an old saying people will work for money, but they will kill for recognition But the recognition has to be genuine and it has to be real and it can't come off as corny or We're just trying to do this fake culture to appease you It has to be real and To make a real culture The culture drivers of the department or of the business Need to make sure they're building real relationships with the people that they want to buy into the culture How many people are we talking about here? I have a total staff of 130 and on average I have 40 to 45 staff members in my building at the time Okay, do you know all these people by name I don't and that's I've identified that as a massive area that I need to improve on like I talk to them But I need to get more in depth with my communication with them a thousand percent Okay, you got to know who they are you got to know what what their story is and You have to build a personal connection with these people and then facilitate an environment for them to build a personal connection with each other That might look a number of different ways, okay, but how it's really gonna look is you guys spending time together Uh in a genuine way So when we think of And really dude and I know you're in health care and this might not suit what you're doing But the quickest way to build camaraderie and teamwork and culture is through mutual suffering Meaning yeah, you know, we work out together or we go on a run club or we do something like that I don't know if that's a real thing And what it is that you do or not, but uh, I would think along those terms because bonding happens in uncomfortable situations and if you want a strong culture The quickest way to do it is to create intentional situations where people get uncomfortable together Because that creates mutual respect, it's vulnerability people learn to see each other as Equals not as positions of power inside of you know, uh power structure ecosystem of a company And you end up having tight relationships form from that some companies do that in different ways You know, they do social functions Uh, it sounds like you're really trying hard to find out what that is But at the core of that broke It's going to be you making sure that you know who these people are Having regular conversations with them making sure that you're checking in on them personally And uh, this is really what separates great culture from You know, fake culture right every locker room Of every losing team ever Has a sign in it that says we stand for this and we we go out and do that and You know, we play hard or whatever But the difference between the good teams and the bad teams is that the good teams Actually spend time together cultivating that guideline of what the mission is and what the values are so Do you have core values established? Does your company have that? My company does not I've actually been working with my directors on building internal values because My company's not involved to a stance where they're going to stop me as long as those core values are What most companies would want in the core values? Okay, and I base I base my structure off of first forms core values for my rough draft. Okay. That's fine I would encourage you to analyze those core values and make sure that they align with who you are as a person Because it's impossible to live those core values if they're not authentic to the leaders of the value Driving position, which is you so So you know take some time reflect on those make adjustments where you need to make sure that they're authentic Set a an overall mission for what you know The your team here is trying to do And remember this is not our mission is to make money You guys being in the healthcare business your mission. You know, how would you describe your mission to me? My Mission is to help These people to come into my rehab facility get back to their highest level of care Because I don't want to see them living inside of Self-care facility their whole life. I want them to give back out into the real world And then we'll be there for them when they're ready to come back But let's get you back to your highest level of function. There you go. I mean, dude That's extremely noble mission that would be easy to get people to rally behind Okay, because what you're actually doing is you're giving people their life back All right, nobody wants to come into a healthcare facility and stay there their whole life So stressing that importance over and over and over again if how important it is for us to do our jobs To make sure that we're giving people their life back because here's the reality, dude People are tired of working for a paycheck. They want to work for a purpose They want to work for something that matters and the more that you can articulate that and build that The more buying you're going to get from the team and honestly the more fulfilled You're going to be the more fulfilled. They're going to be and through that fulfillment the business will offer a better product Which will you know naturally Increase revenue and profitability as long as whoever's making those decisions about profitability can do math, okay? So You know, I Commend you for where you're at. It sounds like he cares. Oh fuck yeah, bro. I mean you can clear it yeah most I've been listening since 15 so like I've literally structured my whole core values and just my upbringing on the podcast I try to implement that in my facility. How old are you? 28 okay, and how old are the people on your team roughly? They're about in their 40s and 50 okay, that's what that might be a little bit of a challenge just because they're You know, you're the young guy trying to do the new thing But the way you get those people to buy in man is to say things like this because this is true Hey, look guys You guys got into this industry to make a difference. That's why you're here You're not here for a paycheck. You're here because you care about these people and you want to get them back out Doing what they do in life and let's get refocused on why we're here. This is why we do this This is what makes us happy on the inside, you know, if it were me I'd ask them to say how many of you guys get excited when we see somebody go back out on the street and live their life and they're all gonna raise their hand and Just get them realigned with that mission and that purpose and then learn to communicate when you correct and when you guide Inline with that purpose and then when you do correct, you know correct in terms of what the value system is right? Hey, Bob. This is why we don't do this this way, you know, this goes against our core value of x And this is why that's important and dude if you do just those things you're gonna be way way way further ahead than most people and Yeah, and then build your reward system around cultural Ideals not necessarily performance if that makes sense. Okay. Yeah, I understand. Yeah, because my goal like that personally my goal is to help you CNAs go to nursing school if they want to I just promoted a CNA that like a top performer to a director position I was like hey, let's try this out this building's meant for new upcoming directors. So That's that's like my personal goal one of the things I guess I can Go ahead One of the things that I think I could really focus on is talking to the CNAs and finding out who wants to go to nursing school and helping them navigate The process of applying to one of the nursing schools in our area And especially navigating the financial aid card so that way they don't end up with a ton of yet. I mean not right out of nursing school And they'll find for grants and just other ways I can invest I guess And I have brother that you're hitting on a very important aspect of culture building and which is They need to know that you care and you should look at it as you here's what I tell the people In my companies. I say look dude. I'm teaching this because whether you stay or whether you go You need to know this skill all right, and if you end up going and moving on to something else I want you to look back on your time here and say that's where I learned the most and so I take pride A lot of pride and developing people Making sure they're learning skills and when these people start to understand that you actually care about them Then they really buy into the culture and you start to get the team To really move the direction that you're looking to move it So I mean bro honestly It sounds like you're right on the cusp of really putting this together and making a really good recipe for your own culture And I think you've got a good framework and a good idea of how to do it Just keep these tips in mind man and uh, yeah, you know and just keep out of dude a good culture takes time You know, you're gonna have people that are gonna wash out because they don't fit to the evolving culture But as those people wash out the new people that come in that learn that you're trying to help them get their career together Get their life together those people are gonna be very grateful for that culture So just keep that in mind as you go brother. It sounds like you're doing really good stuff Perfect. Thank you so much. Yeah bro. All right. So thank you brother Thank you Yeah, I was just thinking about that too like what he's gonna You know, I don't want to like pop the bubble right but like what about the people that don't want to get on the board like they Don't I mean look that's the natural occurrence of business okay people don't like to adapt and they don't like change Especially when they're a little bit older They're setting their ways and You know, they think they it's an ego thing they think they know well you you know But you know what you knew from X amount of years ago Things are changing things have to evolve this isn't the 1980s where we just you know Had a price and people came in and paid it we didn't give a fuck this is real shit and there's so many options for people to Produce income for themselves That if you want to collectivize a group to accomplish a mission you have to remember that they could probably be making more money Doing something else so the mission has to be real and the mission has the matter and it has to be genuine It can't be made up it can't be some you know fucking abstract bullshit the leadership of the the organization or the department or the team whatever we're talking about the church whatever right Has to be genuinely bought into that mission they can't smoke screen people and say oh, I really you know Care about this and then not really care about it because all their people are gonna see It's gonna come across in the culture people won't buy in it'll be inauthentic and you you actually end up with something worse Than doing nothing because what'll happen is people who Have been either you know customers of yours or Employees of yours will leave and be like yeah, bro. That's that's all bullshit. They say out in public They don't do any of that shit. I was foolish. Yeah, it has to be It has to be lived on the inside and that starts with the leadership and that doesn't mean you're gonna be perfect But that means you have to make a really strong effort like everybody else. So Getting culture aligned you know, that's a That's something that literally you know like if a company wanted to pay for that it would cost them seven figures for someone to Realign their culture Uh, it's a very valuable in-depth skill That I could talk about and teach about for probably a week straight twelve hours a day But uh, that's the gist of it of what we covered here with Joe And if you're struggling with the same thing, you know, I would just keep all those those little things in mind Man Extra sauce. We got one more man. Yeah one more what a call another call. Okay. Yeah, we will call all right here. We go last call Lucky calling number four Oh Hey, Jerelyn, this is DJ Hey DJ, how's it going? I'm good. How are you? I'm good. Well, I got uh, I got twisted steel over here How are you? I'm good. How are you Andy? Good. Good. Well, how can we help you? Um, so did you read the whole message or should I just kind of start from the get go? You know, he has not seen your question. He is flying blind right now. It's all on you. Cool All right, um So just give you a little background um 30 years old female kind of endow Texas Been here for about 10 years now after my undergrad Um originally from California and then did my inner island this Texas right after Sorry, I was saying sorry, sorry, I started to hear that Okay horrible jokes Yeah, I they are pretty bad Thank you So anyways, I'm just kind of at a cross there right now. I like Texas. I'm happy I moved here after college, but I don't know if this is the You know, geographical thought for me. It's pretty flat and dry um and I just miss mountains and nature and all that um so I my issue though is that I love my career um, I have a really great job here great company and great people um, so I'm just trying to figure out what the next step is and um make my move so question is you know, how do I weigh the comfort and growth of a solid career against this? Because I had to live somewhere that feels like home um Take the label. I'm single and it's quote-unquote easy or First they put and keep building with a company. I respect and could see up, you know long-tap in um Even if that means sacrificing Family convenience and a place that doesn't only fit my life so Let me ask you this what mine or work are you in? I work in financial services um, I work for private equity firm But I work on the operation side. So long term would love it to kind of see you know something in that seafood Thought operationally um, but it is pretty open Okay Well Look you kind of already understand the choices you have you have a choice where you can stay somewhere where maybe you don't feel uh is Where you want to be necessarily your whole life, but you've got a great career and then you Are weighing the option of moving somewhere else and sort of starting over um With the skill set that you've earned right uh not not starting over but you know starting over um I think You know i think When we weigh these decisions If you would ask me this Ten years ago I would have told you that you've already got a lot of progress Maximize your career Make sure that you get everything you want out of it um and maybe that is the right answer for you right now uh, but we have to understand Also that there is more to life than our career um I personally value my career as one of the main Most meaningful things that I do I find a lot of value uh in it for myself A lot of fulfillment for myself. I feel good about what I do and I like it a lot and When I'm honest with myself is there other places I would like to live? Yeah for sure But I've made the choice to stay here for that reason so I can really relate to your question uh Fast forward 15 years from 30 to 45, which is where I am I might give you an answer and say hey man, you know You're still young enough to go live the life exactly on your terms and what you want to do And you've developed a tremendous skill set at where you're at and I don't think you should be afraid of moving on to something to You know a place where you could see yourself living and enjoying and and enjoying the other parts of life besides your career So I think it just depends man. It depends on you know is And by the way is there not an opportunity for you to do better in your career at one of these other places? I think it would be open. I you know have a really like I said great companies. They are very supportive um And the great thing about my line of work is we do have a lot of connections especially since we work with a lot of companies um and so There's An opportunity there to Move that somewhere else um and I think that they would be supportive about it, but you know it is taking a gamble. I Really you know appreciate the fact that my Company the people here really challenged me intellectually and I you know Frankly, that's hard to find really is it really is So That's my fear. I Am young enough that I you know know that this is a time where I have this flexibility, but at the same time Like I said, I'm single. I'm young like if I'm going to make that move right now It's going to be easy versus starting a family and then trying to uproot them and move it to where I'd rather be Do you think that if you don't make the move that you're going to always regret it? I think I'm pretty I You know I think I make the best of where I'm at so I can't see myself holding myself to this regret. I've You know picked up and moved several times at this point of my life, you know, so starting over doesn't scare me um, but It is just a gamble as a gamble of losing somewhere that you know, I could Myself really losing up in this specific company, but then just in general like they would support kind of every aspect of me and To rewrite that grip somewhere else can be difficult um But yeah, there's just I just don't have any ties here all my family as well Do you think it's The reason that you want to move is because you're in the habit of picking up and moving? I have thought about that um To a degree that could be it you know right now. I'm just in a Sale place aside from just my job um, so it could be a factor of that um But I think I moved here specifically with that in mind and that's why I ended up in Texas um because it doesn't always at my lifestyle I'm you know, I'm over my party days. There's just not a lot to do here on the weekends um Outside or just in general and so I'd rather be in a place where I can actually you know Enjoy the quality of life I think you're answering your own question here. Okay. Here's what I hear I think you've developed a tremendous skill set where you're at I think you're going to be equipped to succeed wherever you go I think that you are young enough to make the change with the least amount of friction and life disruption and it sounds to me that you know The lifestyle that you're after is not going to be found where you are and that's going to dictate a lot of our happiness. So um You know from what I'm hearing and not knowing anything other than this five-minute conversation we've had it sounds like you know You should really consider making a switch now So that you're not in a situation later where you're like shit I wasted all this time and I could have been climbing mountains and kayaking and you know skiing and doing all this stuff that you want to do um And and then the other thing is too Is if you're in an area like that you're probably much more likely to find someone Then it's also into those things that you're going to jive with and and and connect with and and build a life with so uh, you know It's probably the more difficult thing and I found I found in my life that When I'm presented with two choices that the more difficult one is usually the right one um So that's that's what I'm hearing from you and knowing nothing else So yeah I appreciate that um yeah Yeah, you're not wrong um well I wanted to say that here's what's holding you back dude I think what's holding you back is and tell me if I'm wrong, but you know having to to start from scratch in your career and There's options here you could talk to your company about remote positions You could talk to your company about working in a in a in a company that's vertically integrated with them um There's lots of ways to keep that and I agree you know It's hard to find Good places to fit in Uh, and you know what dude Who's to say you couldn't move for three years and say you know what I was I liked it. They're better and you could come back I'm sure they would take you back so For sure Uh, uh, uh, Jarlin, I would I do want to say I saw your comment about your movie suggestion What she said interstellar was terrible. I thought it was terrible Yeah, I'm wrong with y'all man. It was terrible. It's a great movie. The fuck you talking about it's a great movie All right. Well, yeah, hope you figure out your life Well, listen, I think this is a tough decision that lots of people struggle with Uh, and you'd rather struggle with it at 30 than you want that you would at 45 or 50. So um, you know, we only live once It's you know, making money and having a career and the company is very very important Having financial means is very important But at the end of the day, you know, we have to be happy and we've got to be a place that we want to be and doing the things that we want because dude at the end of the day Where it would be arrogant for us to assume that we have unlimited opportunity To do the life the way that we want it. We just don't and a lot of people get to that They get to an age of you know 50 60 70 And they're like fuck. I wasn't doing anything of what I wanted and uh, you know And at that time to change it you're talking about a massive Lifaltering fracture That usually has to occur. So um That's that's my take you know, I can't tell you what I think but or I can only tell you what I think But what I'm hearing from you is that you're asking for permission to go do this and I personally like if we were friends Which I guess we are now I would tell you to go go out there and do it and don't be afraid and I think you're gonna you're gonna be rewarded by that Can I ask you would you you know if you had the same situation with a guy that you know is a little bit more Professionally driven would you give him the same advice? It just depends it depends on it depends if he would say if there was a guy saying the exact same thing that you're saying And I could hear in his voice that he's not happy where he's at yeah for sure. I mean, I don't I don't think I would You know, I think it's important for all of us to be able to financially take care of ourselves. I don't think that that's Uh, you know exclusive to to anyone's gender The more financial control and the more career security that we have The less we depend on on other people and I think that always gives us the freedom to live our life on our terms So I mean no, I would give someone the same advice that that was a guy Yeah, I can hear it dude like I can hear it. Can you hear it? I can't yeah, you want to go You know what why don't you take a couple weeks off and go do that stuff and like you know, you know regular regular trips Do a lot, you know what I mean? You get away for a week or two weeks You know, it can it can scratch that itch too. Maybe you just need a vacation. Yeah Yeah, no, I do I I might like they're very flexible and I'll take off and kind of whatever Go remote off the mountain, but it is yeah, yeah, you guys are saying the same thing. It's Clear that that's kind of the next step for me Yeah, my my thing for you is just to make sure that it's not a grass as greener on the other side thing, you know um When we're in when we're in it and we're living it it doesn't matter how good it is We're always looking at how things could be and when we look at how things could be and we focus on how things could be We lack the appreciation for how things are even if things are exactly how we want them to be So I would just make sure you know that this is why I asked you do you want to move because you're in the habit of moving Because like for me like I could tell you this is just reality like if I live in the same house For five or six years. I start getting stir crazy. I need a new I need a new Uh, I need a new routine and a new change your pace and a new visual aesthetic to look at and live in and So I understand what that's like and I've had to really adjust To where I live now because uh, I found myself Starting to want to move and do other things and live in other places even though it's not a different city But then when I think about it, I'm like Why would I want to do that? I got everything that I want here, you know, and so it's I would just Make sure that you're not Just bored and uh, because eventually do we're gonna get bored with everything right like if we if we move to the mountains the mountains It's become our day-to-day Life and eventually we don't even notice it anymore. You know when I first bought the house. I live in Uh, I remember I went to talk to the guy who owned it the first the first I went and saw it in person And I couldn't believe it dude. I was like this is I was telling him his name was Jay I was like this is the most fucking incredible house I've ever seen in my life like well and I asked him I'm like, why are you selling it and he was like I don't see it anymore, dude And I'm like, what do you mean? He's like I don't see it anymore. He's like it's just my house and He's like I don't appreciate it the way that I should and I just feel it's time to move on because I'm used to it and You know sometimes that's that's what we need sometimes we don't need to move across the country sometimes We need to move across town So you know you got a lot to think about I'm not probably making it worse But at the end of the day, man You know you've really got to understand that You know when you die You're you're gonna feel a certain way about your life and I think being in a scenario and living a lifestyle that you Feel called to live is going to be an important part of that It's a great way to put it yeah So well, thank you so much. I appreciate it You're welcome good luck with the decision Watch understand and hey, I know it's terrible um I've met a handful your first form crew. They're awesome by the way, so I wanted to shout out to them. Thank you. Yeah, we we are uh I feel I feel every single day It's just like what you said about your company every single day. I'm here. I feel fortunate and blessed and extremely Excited to come here because I am around great people and they do challenge me and they do fulfill me in friendship Ways and you know, there's just There is a lot to be said for that. So I understand that um, I feel like I get to come to work with the best people on the planet. So I understand that part of where you're at too It would be hard to leave Yeah, it is it will be definitely good. I appreciate y'all. Thank you so much. All right. Thank you Thank Yeah, I think that's a that's a that's a core piece which you mentioned too on just even just the gratitude part Like I tried to tell myself to like that was a point in my life where I wanted to be exactly where I'm at No shit. I prayed for it. Yeah, I think that goes for most people like do like that That's in a very very important piece. Yeah, forget man like yeah, the grass ain't always green, but you ask for this Yeah, you are where you wanted to be. Yeah, what if you ask for something bigger right Something to think about yeah, that's true. You know, that's what we tend to get what we ask for Yeah, that's real man, you know, you might as well ask for everything you actually want not just half of it You know, I don't know if you heard it, but in my opinion it sounded like in her voice She felt like she wanted to do it and just needed some permission validation to go yeah, and you know Unfortunately when we're 30, you know and older You know, really people don't give us permission to do these things We just got to believe in ourselves and you know, she's got a she's got a skill set that she spent the last you know 10 12 years building and That's going to be valuable anywhere but The one thing that I'm concerned about for her is you know, she does like all the people she works with and like she said That's very rare and you know if you go out and you know if I were to go Right now move to fucking veil which I love veil And you know, I would never ever ever be able to replicate the amount of relationships and friendships and camaraderie and team that I have here It would be impossible and that would be the price of moving there. Yeah, so there's a trade-off. Yeah, it's a big trade-off too Bro, you know because as frustrating as I can get When I walk through the doors here, dude, it changes my mood and I feel better and I like being here and the people here matter to me and That would be that would be I couldn't do that. I couldn't just otherwise. I would already done it You know, that's real man, so that's real guys Andy. Yeah first call it in the books. Oh, it was cool. Yeah, it was a good time Yeah, it was good.
