right and if they can do that to me they could fucking do it to you and they can do it to anybody yeah well guys let's get into the let's get into some cruising man before we get to our headlines our dumbasses of the day a headlong reads botanist are scouring the u.s. Mexico border to document a forgotten ecosystem split by a giant wall so stay with me here okay so i'm not sure i'm dumb enough to so so near the towering border wall flanked by a u.s. border patrol vehicle botanist sulla vander plank heard a quail in the scrub yell yelp quote chicago which ironically is the same same noise that the illegal aliens make when they're when they're crossing the border wall oh shit um be uh the sound of the bird's use the signal they are separated from a mate or group uh then silence um a quail on the mexican side called back contugering a back and forth soundtrack that was both fitting and heartbreaking an ecosystem split by an artificial barrier so so there's a group of botanists okay about a thousand of them okay they all got together and and between all of them they have a not enough braze to figure this out bro so they're concerned about the ecosystem about the wall right in all the surrounding plants so what about all the other walls and houses and fences and shit all over the world are those are those immune they are quails not able to like your quails not to fly over the wall like are these special quails they can't fucking fly like what like they discovered a new fucking species of quail bro lightless quail yeah they're running around with the headphones and they're taking pictures and documenting all the species this is how fucking stupid people are bro hold on this is how dumb these motherfuckers really are my it just reminded me of this meme yeah right it was like you know the dog singing the birding house that says this is fine it's like everything like that that's the part that I I gotta give them credit to these to these leftists people man because you know the worlds on fucking fire there were my fucking quail but there's still time to stop and smell the coca leafs well I mean bro listen these people are fucking delusional bro they're delusional brother they've been indoctrinated into a system of complete lies about everything everything they think they know as a lie like they think carbon dioxide is bad for the environment what the fuck do you think green shit breeze in right what do you think that what do you think that does right remember that's like a little poster you learning like third grade yeah it's like a it's a cycle yeah but they just focused on the mystery bro these people are just dumb as fuck they're just dumb yeah yeah I'm like they know they've been dumb must be nice to have all your basic needs taken care of to where you could worry about botany you know I'm saying like I wonder who's paying these oh that's us we're paying for their sandwiches and they're fucking right of a counter toast and they're you know we're I forgot I mean look at their fucking faces like your faces look fucking stupid meanwhile look at that one in the middle we're getting fucking invaded yeah look at that hold on go back look at that one in the middle bro yeah like you I'm sorry dude now I got the same fucking stupid ass they got the hats they all got the same hat because they it's part of the uniform man everybody knows you're not a botanist unless you have one at least fucking idiots they look like they haven't how long you think it was the between their last shower in this picture oh it's been a minute at least a week at least a week you can tell by that greasy hair yeah it's trying to produce in those natural yeah the natural oil her hair her hair smells I can smell it from here bro I can't stand these people these people are the reason that all this shit like these are the same people that will speak confidently about fucking geopolitical issues and fly their fucking Ukraine flags and they're fucking you know George Floyd and all this shit that's the same people whatever it is this week yeah like these people are dumb they're morons the fucking fucking quail can't fly over the fucking wall fucking quail it is yelling Chicago there's a fucking group of dudes right there that are thinking about raping you and they might if you didn't look like such a fucking weird house but I wasn't a bird saying that shit there's a fucking migrants they probably fucking would have to look Sula did you hear that I think the birds communicating must be sad to kick it over to the other side why it must be an invisible barrier up there New York City that's what the other ones just say I hear New York goes fault it is though why people fucking and Trump yeah for sure it's 50% why people and 50% Trump 100% white men specifically oh man I love it nice little start man let's just keep it moving because there's some other stuff happening you know guys remember bro what is it with these people that talk like so confidently about they about the things they know yeah it's like you're a little moron I don't know man that's what I hear when I look at that picture look this plant's actually native to native member it's vegan to vegan to vegan probably I they're all vegan are they eating the species that they find of course they don't they don't correlate that's a one thing about vegans that really it tastes to fuck out of me what's that is like they all want to eat plants and shit plants are alive too fucking animals you guys just do us a favor and stop eating forever like the problem will take care of itself the horses are cool though apparently there's like there's there's wild horses that roam the border down there yeah probably separating the families of horses horses in the in the mules not the drug mules just the actual mules yeah that you know it's getting real for the horses I feel bad for the horses because I got to be around those people yeah bro it's real shit it's real man well guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links or videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them link there with that being said you want to get into our first headline yeah headline number one headline number one reads Iranian president ibrahim Razi the butcher of taran killed in helicopter crash in remote region now this is interesting when we got of course we got some you know supporting evidence and stuff going on here let's try to paint the picture and so our colleagues Iran's hard line president ibrahim Razi was killed when the helicopter carrying the revealed leader known as the butcher of taran crashed in the remote region of the country sunday officials and state media said Razi who is 63 his foreign minister and the other passenger's were found dead after the rescuers recovered discovered the helicopter crash site early monday state news agency mur reported quote all passengers of the helicopter carrying the Iranian president and foreign minister were martyred supreme leader aliyah kameenie who holds ultimate power with the final say on foreign policy in aron's nuclear program said first vice president mohamid mohame would take over as interim president of the states irna news agency reported quote i announced five days of public mourning and offer my condolences to the dear people of aron kameenie said in the statement a senior Iranian official had earlier confirmed that razi was killed in the wreck after state media reported there was quote no sign of life at the crash site now everybody has jumped in a lot of world leaders have jumped in offering their condolences messages of condolences have been pouring in from my rants allies including the leaders of Saudi Arabia Syria Egypt the uaqatar Jordan Iraq Pakistan Russian president Vladimir Putin called razi quote a true friend of russia while indian prime minister nirada mohdi said he was quote deeply shocked and saddened now let's check in with whatever people say uh israel for example israel they took the uh the oj approach uh saying quote it wasn't us that's an official statement and that's all it was what not i'm sorry guys you know what that means they're niggas did it they killed that man man they did they killed them um yeah they jumped in on there now interesting we enough uh former Iranian official partly blames united states uh in our sanctions for the helicopter crash the killed its president yeah but only the white man right and in trump um iran's former former foreign minister mahamid javad zirif said the us sanctions which prohibit iran from purchasing us built aircraft could be partly to blame in a phone interview with state tv on monday zirif said the sanctions prevent iran from having good aviation facilities that's not our responsibility motherfucker um why don't you build your own shit it's true we start selling any of our shit to any of these fucking fucks i'm cool with all of that yeah um but these sanctions they've been in place since 1979 they were lifted in like 2018 um i believe um until we found out that you know they were building more news and put it back in place right um so that's what i'm talking about and right now like they can't own or or have any uh helicopters or any aircraft that have like more than 10% of us made parts is the sanction i'm how that plays out well that might be a good thing we're Boeing shit bro oh it's funny say that uh so razi was flying a us made bail to twelve helicopter at the time of the crash um state media reported iran's official news agency iran r aain r a said razi was traveling in a convoy of choppers when his went down near the city of jolpa about three hundred and seventy five miles northwest of tron um now early footage and images of the crash site showed scattered debris and detached helicopter parts according to the new york times roiders also reported the helicopter was completely burned after it crashed uh the crash comes at a time of growing descent with iran over an array of political social and economic crises now a spokesperson for bail did make a statement quote very unfortunate uh that was from abu hill it been clinton mohami tonne made that statement about the yeah we hope you know the u But but in all seriousness, what does this mean? Like I mean, you know, we got the global stage that is currently shifting right up underneath us. So This headline comes from Fox News says next I ran president will follow the nomad supreme leader Commandy support for terror says XCIA official yeah or his helicopter crash too, right? Says quote, I think we're going to see the continuation of the general contours of Iranian foreign policy meaning domestic repression carrying on support to Hamas and their so-called access of resistance against Israel and the United States and then fortifying their relationship their alliance with this new access of tyranny Russia, China and North Korea. And that's from Dan Hoffman who was a former station chief CIA operator. And with all of this stuff happening man, what's your take on this? What's your 10,000 foot view here? You see anything changing? Is this really going to mean you thing? I don't know man. It's it was interesting because the people who Are starting to support Russia seem to be starting to get targeted that guy from Serbia last week got fucking shot like 20 times and he lived Now all of a sudden this guy crashes in helicopter who's next right? Right? So it's like, you know, oh these I don't know I don't see this as a this doesn't seem like a coincidence and then I'll think at all and And If it comes out that this was shot down or there was some sort of activity from Israel, it's gonna start a big war Like was what we talked about and it's what they want. Yeah, I mean, I think the timing of all of this stuff is weird too You know, I'll say this like I know why Ryan is not the you know the world leader when it comes to technology and all of this stuff And you know, there's talks of having this is the act. This is a photo of the actual helicopter itself here You know, but it's like For real like who the fuck you should be fine at old pieces shit. Yeah, you should be fine, but again Bro if that showed up right here today you don't you ain't happening. I'm fuck no, I wouldn't let you happen bro I'm looking at that and I'm saying yeah You guys go ahead They went in that motherfucker anywhere you look at that listen, dude, we got to stop Here's what I will say. I don't know, but I know this Mm-hmm. I bet there's gonna be more guys that start falling out because the world cabal is not allowing these people to resist What's going on you crane and what's going on you crane is not a simple war there's I don't know what's gonna happen dude these people are fucking out of control criminals. Yeah Yeah, I mean, it's it's sad. I'm like I mean those videos right now apparently Like and there's some weird stuff happening. I saw this Alex Jones actually tweeted this out apparently None of the weather data because that was one of the first things that you're trying to say was like there was some shit going on with the weather I find it. They there is zero history like they've deleted the weather data that all of the data from from that day I don't think like twenty five years prior to that. You know like so that's some weird stuff that's definitely happening here You know, but here's here's what I was gonna say though The United States is to stop Providing any weapons or any technology or any military equipment to fucking anybody for any reason Yeah, like dude fuck these people. They don't fucking like us fuck all these people like dude any of these motherfuckers Let them build their own shit Let's see what the fuck you guys could come up with oh And a shit, right like I'm like let's let's be real dude America The American people have built more shit and came up with more technology than any other Civilization in the history of fucking earth, okay, and that's not black people that's not white people That's American people and we have to stop Giving our technology and our weapons and our this and our that there's no reason for that other than they want to fund Their fucking they want to line their pockets because of the war profiteering. All right, so That's my point of view like stop giving these motherfuckers anything no, I mean like we're so little off Yeah, it's not even making a fucking dent Yeah, like it does it makes no sense. There's zero sense to do it There's zero sense and especially when you look at the fact of the majority a lot of our stuff like when there's time for the new stuff to come out A lot of the old stuff gets where it goes it falls in the hands of the same people we call our enemies How does that happen? Intentional no shit because they want the wars that they got look bro if these military companies just made military equipment for the United States then Eventually we'd have enough military equipment Mm-hmm, and nobody would be able to fuck with us because they didn't have the equipment right so For them to stay in business and make money they got to sell the equipment over here so they can fight with their equipment against our equipment Exactly that's how they make money and then they kick back the politicians all the politicians get rich That's why there's a war and every generation of men and then they use the war to eliminate and Handicap and traumatize the strongest Men in each civilization in each culture. This has been going on for hundreds of years. So All of this is a scam all of this is bullshit all of us peasants are used to fight these people's war so they can make money and And that's wrong These companies shouldn't be selling their equipment over here and then positioning a war so that they can make money and the Politicians can get rich while our sons and daughters and brothers and sisters go fucking fight and I'm fuck that That's bullshit and the America people and the citizens of the earth whether they be in the Middle East or Asia or Western civilization in Europe Whatever y'all need to stand to fuck up and say we fight in these bullshit wars for you fucks That's what needs to happen and we need a world revolution of non-compliance. No 100% man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys Without being sent let's go check some out Let's do it. I feel like where's that coin at oh, it's right here. What's it on it says mercy? Okay, we'll see we'll see we got we cruise the internet on this one. This comment comes from it No tech nomad There's plenty of money to help Americans and help our allies the problem is Republicans block every single program and tended to help Americans they then they use their work hurting Americans to say we should help others Actually, this is what this guy looks like Guarante actually anyway, we got on this. Yeah, I don't know you're fucking This guy's brain doesn't work Like you shouldn't be allowed on the internet Like you honestly shouldn't be allowed to fucking talk to anybody because you're so fucking stupid. You don't even know how stupid you are actually, yeah Actually, there's plenty of money to help Americans and our allies. Yeah, all right So we should all work our entire first of all look at this guy's thumbnail You need this guy doesn't even fucking work. He doesn't even file taxes. This is don't this is legit shit Problem these fucking losers don't pay any money into the tax system and then they talk about all this shit No, there's not plenty of money to help every American and our ally because we get taxed at over 50% of our fucking income Asshole, okay, what other country do they tax their citizens into poverty to send the money elsewhere? None Where is our aid? Where's our tax dollars from fucking Kuwait? Where's our shit coming in okay, so you're this dude is so fucking stupid He can't even realize that all we would have to do to fix the situation with Americans is stop sending our fucking money over there And stop taxing Americans into poverty because we're not sending the money over there All right, but people don't think like this because they don't pay tax so they can't think of it They can't think oh man life would be so much easier if I only paid 10% all in tax They don't think that way because they don't fucking work and they don't contribute all right There's no reason for us to send a tax dollar of any amount to anywhere but here until this place looks like fucking The greatest place that's ever existed man like ever in the history of earth So like dude the To his point on the Republican shit to like yeah, it's the Republicans fall We are this the Democrats fall like you're so fucking stupid. You don't even know they're same fucking people Not only that bro, but the problem is like where people don't get you know It's how they it's these fucking massive bills that they push through too, right? Like you got you know this bill you know 2003 and on the surface everybody's like oh, well It's you know whatever you feel like a portion wall or whatever you want to you pull in but like but they don't tell you that on page 5,000 out of 7,000 You know 200 million dollars is going to fucking do botany research at the border which ain't even going to them It's going a million dollars is going to them and 199 million finance way back to Democrat fucking packs bro exactly there's a reason why the Democrat party is funded at 10 times the amount of the Republican party Okay, it's like to sit here and say this is Republicans and Democrats issue at this point in time is such an ignorant statement Like bro go back to doing your yeager bombs and your fucking shitty bar and shut the fuck up You ain't ever paid taxes. You're not paying taxes. You shouldn't have a saying anything about our financial Or any of the rules that we vote on here in America unless you pay taxes Okay, I don't care if you're a woman.

Legally deep blue allegedly deep blue Allegedly um where he held a fundraising event and delivered more houses More house colleges commencement speech Says quote if a presidential motorcade passes through town But absolutely nobody cares did it really pass through town rnc research Accident follow-up question accompanied by video footage showing largely empty streets dotted with some people filming the motorcade his a clip So No, so no apply any one million votes baby Anyone million votes see This is the important shit to pay attention to and it's It's very indicative of the actual support that each one of these people has and if you would have paid attention 2020 you would have seen this in 2020 But people were distracted by covid they were distracted by the six feet of salsa district thing Which by the way it came out this weekend that it was completely made up. Mm-hmm. They admitted it was made up They used that six feet of social distancing to Their advantage by not allowing people to witness Are come to Biden speeches or his rallies or anything right remember they were doing them in high school gymnasiums and shit All the while trumps out there were the hundred thousand people for 30 days straight And you guys legitimately think this motherfucker won the election in 2020 that was a coup We're dealing with a fucking rogue government We're dealing with the fucking government that is compromised through foreign adversaries The proof is on that hunter Biden laptop This guy is compromised by China by foreign interests That's why all this shit is happening. That's why the borders open. That's why our currencies being Devalued and massively inflated intentionally. That's why We're in these conflicts. That's why we we have all this crime in these cities These people's mission is to destroy this country and they stole an election in 2020 and now we're dealing with the consequences and a lot of you guys wouldn't hear it You would say, oh, that's bullshit. That's what he how is it possible That truck gets a hundred thousand people to show up at his events Day after day after day This guy can't get fucking 20 20 people 20 people Not 20,000 20 people That's not possible and anybody who thinks it's possible like they're fucking brain dead. That's only like 10 They listen it was a fucking yeah no shit It was a coup bro. It was a fucking coup Bro, fuck these people man. Yeah, listen, they got into it But you let him tell it George is the reason he's president right now. Yeah, because you cheated the fucking stolen motherfucker you fucking broke the water pipe quote unquote right we all went to bad trumps winning in every single Fucking swing state we all wake up oh Biden's autumn. Oh, and then you can't question it Oh, and then let's put anybody who question in jail with no charges for four fucking years You guys better wake up dude Yeah, that's sad man. I want to show this last little clip. So like I said, he you so he went to he's in Atlanta, which is Uh, I want to say it's majority black. It's a pretty big. I mean, it's it's a lot of black people there All right, let's just say the crime rate's high All right, is it? Huh? I've always I love Atlanta. I thought like the crime rate or the no, I is a crime rate like it's not like St. Louis I mean, it's up there. Is it yeah, Atlanta's hot Yeah, a lot of a lot of There's a lot of there's a lot of LGBT people there too. I don't know every time I've been in Atlanta It's been nice. Yeah, they're like undercover cops though like you don't you don't know I don't know um, but yeah, so so you know, he's in Atlanta and then he makes these so he goes to more house, which is a HBCU covered that Um, but before Guess where he went before that Andy? He's got to stop at the NCAA CP the NCAA The NCAA and NAZP he's got to stop there But I want you I want you guys to see this see this clip. Okay, this is him and just just watch this dude man. Just watch this Join the democrats. Please join me and giving a warm welcome to the 46th president of the United States of America He has no fucking clue what's happening. No He has a debate in about a month Yeah, there's no fucking way these people are the most rate We've been saying this for years and now it's finally like people are starting to finally figured out But these are the most racist fucking people on the planet for real You guys like to point the figure and say racism because someone makes a joke or said something But real racism is fucking actual oppression of people and what's been going on in this country for Decades is that they have somehow convinced black people the democrats are the only people With their interests in mind and that is not the case these people have a track record They have a history. They are the party of the KKK The radical Republicans are the party that free the slaves in this country and somewhere along the line The narrative got changed and Black people have to wake up and they have to realize and they have to look at the track record of the democrats They continue to vote for every two years every four years These democrats come into your cities and they promise they're going to do all these things for you And they do none of them. They say they're going to fund the schools fix the infrastructure take care of all these problems Squash crime etc etc etc They don't do any of that in fact They fund the projects that they promise and then funnel the money back to themselves All the while coming back every two and four years to say the same story The Republicans are racist white people are racist We're the party that stands with you And if you don't vote for us you ain't fucking black Okay, so all you got to do is pay attention guys These people fucking hate you democrats hate fucking black people. It's not even it's not even a one inch off of that mark that is exactly what the fuck they think That's why Joe Biden goes to these black families with fried chicken That's why he says shit like you ain't black and black people in America need to wake the fuck up We are Americans. We are not black Americans white Americans Indian Americans Blah blah blah blah blah we are fucking Americans. They divide us at every single point of contention for their benefit All right, and for this to ever get changed the black culture in this country has to wake up and realize who the real enemy is And if you look back over the past 50 years and look at the actual facts of what democrats have done to the black communities The answer will be very clear if you vote for Democrats and your black you are making a very poor decision for yourself and for your community and for your culture And that's the truth So facts man. You guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think I was that being said. Let's get to our third and final headline headline number three Uh Checking what I buddy. There's a real buddy Uh headline reads new jersey court throws out 80 charges against brave gym owner Defying governor Murphy's tyrannical lockdown orders Suck my dick Phil Murphy. I can confirm that he actually said that. Oh, he actually said it Oh, yeah, that's an accurate quote. He actually said it. Yeah, uh Ian Smith Um, this uh bearded Savage hemath. Yeah Man look at that. Look at that. How he's got that's old school right there. It's one of the original I remember when he sent you this picture when he was fucking signing this one of the originals. Yeah Um, it's like an Ian man. Look at this guy. He's awesome Um, Ian Smith co-owner of a Tillis Jim and Belmarnie jersey has achieved a monumental victory A new jersey court has dismissed all 80 charges against him Charges that stemmed from him from his bold decision to reopen his gym And direct defiance of Democrat governor Phil Murphy's tyrannical COVID-19 lockdown orders The saga began in May of 2020 when Smith reopened to Tillis Jim challenging the Murphy administrations mandates which he and his supporters argue are unconstitutional and detrimental to small businesses The confrontation escalated in July of 2020 when police officers forcefully arrested Smith after he continually violated the state shutdown orders Here's a video from Metaress Yeah, you guys at a rest of him should be fucking ashamed of yourselves I know you're all still have their gun. They're the jobs now fuck Oh, we're just doing our job man. We're just do we're just you know, this is what they told us to do Yeah, that's how fucking not my orders. That's how that's how genocides happen you fucking pussies Have seen a fucking learn to stand to fuck up to this fucking bullshit You took a oath to not do this shit. I'm just following my orders. Yeah Yeah, so the state's aggressive response to not end with the arrest and the controversial move governor Murphy and his administration seized $165,000 from the Jim's accounts funds that Smith claims were amassed through donations and apparel sales To support the Jim's legal battles This act was a punitive strike meant to cripple the Jim financially and serve as a stern warning to others who might consider similar defiance quote governor Murphy seized 100% of our assets today 165k all of which came from donations and apparel sales This is done in the middle of an ongoing litigation defending ourselves against these fines are already charges The revocation of our business license and the unconstitutional health department shutdown This was never about protection. It was always about control Set Smith in a video statement in January of 2021. This is what he tweeted out Just just talking about this case. He tweeted this out And of course ending it with suck my dick Phil Murphy Um, I like what he says here, too. He's you know more update and there's there's still some more updates There's you know, I think they're trying to go after the court fees and all of that stuff now But he says nobody is coming to save you save yourself spit on your hands and hoist a black flag no quarter Um suck my dick Phil Murphy quote in Smith And DJ And Andy and Andy yeah, fuck you Phil Murphy Um, but that's what you want Phil Murphy sucking your dick, though man bro. He's got a fucking snaggle teeth bro What is that yeah, he'll fuck you shit up. Why does he look like a Rothschild because he probably is Don't need that like like real shit. He looks like one of them. Bro, the guy's such a fucking douchebag. He looks English He's a fucking douchebag Go about whoa. No, he dude dude. You he this guy this guy's out of control. I hope he ensues the fuck out of him Yeah, he should everybody who did this shit should be who dealt with this should be suing these people non-stop Look at that fucking bitch ass cop. I love how his beard just like under the man I love dude. That's a wild time man. That's a wild time And it's like it's still a wild time today man because again We talk about all the time that people so often we're so quickly can just forget about the shit like that video bro Like I remember when they fucking lock them up. Yeah, you know, I'm saying the arrest them and like you know people forget All the BS that was done during these times man like and it's just insane and because they can you know Switch your focus over to something else You know make you wave that flag and get your mind off of what actually happened man like that stuff happened It was real stuff and this interesting because now there is seem to be a massive change in tune We've already covered the vaccine stuff. I'm not gonna beat the horse Uh covering that stuff. We've already covered that stuff. There's there's still a lot of stuff developing with that But one of the biggest updates that we we do need to address This headline comes from uh New York Post Uh, Helen reads Elon Musk demands charges against Anthony Fauci after NIH comes clean on funding gain a bunch gain a function research All right, so this just came out Um, Elon Musk demanded the arrest and prosecution of dr. Anthony Fauci on Friday after the NIH came clean to congress and admitted Funding risky gain of function research in Wuhan China prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic there Quote prosecute Fauci the billionaire CEO of Tesla um And uh and and ex Elon Musk he posted that out Um with the headlines sick lies So so what happened was NIH principal deputy director Lawrence tabit confessed Thursday at a house subcommittee hearing That the US government had indeed funded dangerous research at the Wuhan Institute of Erology Which modified back coronavirus is shortly before the outbreak began in late 2019 Quote dr. Tabit did NIH fund gain a function research at the Wuhan Institute of virology Through Manhattan based nonprofit eco health alliance acts representative Debbie Lesco out of Arizona of the select subcommittee On the Corona virus pandemic quote it depends on your definition of gain a function research tabit cancer If you're speaking about the generic term yes, we did Tabit answers conflicts with Fauci several fiery denials quote the NIH has Not ever and does not now fund gain of function research in the Wuhan Institute of Erology Fauci now 83 testified To congress in May of 2021 Which he testified many of times under earth under oath Yeah, they didn't do it. Yeah, we did do it. They absolutely did it. Yeah, there was emails. Oh by the way You and I fucking talked about this in June of 2020. Yep on the podcast Here we are four years later now what's Well, why would all of this information be coming on now like what what's the importance of this shit coming on now You know You know is it is it because there's an election is because they're gonna do whatever they got to do to get the other guy out yep Not only that out. I'll further what Elon saying Every single one of these people who not just lied but didn't tell the truth should be prosecuted and executed Every single one of them This this fucking ruined people's lives these people should this should be over for them One of my best friends had to watch his dad die on fucking zoom Okay, and there were millions of people that had to do that How many businesses were closed? How many lies financially ruined look at the state of the world now because of what they did then And these motherfuckers are smuggling walking around and then the people who knew the truth They were arrogant enough to think the truth was never gonna come out the truth is going to come out more and more and more and more And as we see it come out more and more and more there's gonna be more rats that jump shit This was fucking treason It was it was crimes against humanity and the punishment for crimes against humanity should be death. That is my opinion 100% man, you know, I was saying something the other day you if you fucking know what happened you better come out now Because this is coming out it's coming out dude And if you don't fucking come out and tell the truth You're probably gonna be held accountable with the people who fucking did it That's the thing when I was I was I saw this thing the other day You know, they were talking about like you know like because everybody's now they're on this bandwagon talking about the co uh the the cancer rates are up right Uh, I made like because we're bringing up that Kate Middleton shit again And the thing is it's like okay, like you could argue the vaccine and shit. Okay, cool like in that the very may will be a real thing right But here's a reality if we go back three years ago You know how how many cancer screenings they canceled or denied people from doing because of this COVID shit That's right Right so like it's not that the rates are sporadically high now. No, they were not screening these fucking people now these people are three years later That's what I'm saying. Yeah, like but now you know, here we are three years later These people did not were denied to get cancer screenings and like oh well you had like it's like it's fucked up man It's fucked up these people deserve the ultimate punishment man. Yeah, the ultimate punishment with zero mercy man Zero mercy anybody who organized it anybody who who went along with it at I'm talking I'm not talking about people who were manipulating on the ground level. I'm not talking about your average Neighbor who fucking flies the current thing flag who's just dumb, okay? I'm not he's just I'm not talking about the person Bro, they got to pay their own price like these people went and got this fucking like in my opinion I consider those people the biggest victims of this because those people believed everything these people said And they went out and got this shot now a lot of them are sick a lot of them are fucking dying a lot of them are terrified That they're gonna get sick or die. I mean do think about walking around the rest of your life being like holy shit Fuck what did I do you see what I'm saying and That's not what I'm talking about but the people who the people in the media who fucking lied the people in the government who fucking lied The people and in these organizations like the NIH The WHO world economic forum who fucking lied and orchestrated this they deserve death. They deserve death penalty Okay, so when all this shakes out and all this truth comes out That is the punishment that the people should be pushing for for these people. That's the truth. Yeah No 100% man guys Jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think Oh, that thing we don't demand accountability. There will be no accountability So you guys should be fucking very openly vocal about what the fuck should be The punishment for these people and think about what they did They didn't make a mistake. No, this was not accurate. They did what we told you they did for the last four and a half years They fucking orchestrated it. They built it. They released it. They put it out It caused all kinds of major disruptions and problems for people including costing people their lives killing their families killing their businesses killing the fucking economy in America Okay, your Millions of businesses will never reopen that were open for fucking decades. Okay Families were destroyed All right, people are still sick. They're walking around with this shit Okay, this was crimes against humanity and the death rate According to insurance companies which do not fucking lie because their insurance premiums Depend on it and they want to pay out the least amount possible And when you look at the at the overall death rate across all ages over the last Two years it is up nearly 40% for all cause death rates across the globe What does that tell you this was crimes against fucking humanity, bro And these people need to be held accountable for real And this like going to prison or getting a slap on the wrist. No, they need to be made an example of So that for the next fucking 500 years nobody even thinks about this I don't even think it should be death. I think it should be Porture is death by quartering them pulling their bodies apart Dissecting them because it has to be so brutal and so fucking fear inducing that people for people will never do this again Don't even think about it. Why don't we think about doing it You know shit man guys jumping on this conversation and Fauci's running around with that smug ass face He's on the cover of vanity fair sitting by a shitty ass pool like he's some kind of sex people is calling the sexiest man alive man This is fucking bullshit And if you want accountability, you all better start calling for it It's real shit man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments.
