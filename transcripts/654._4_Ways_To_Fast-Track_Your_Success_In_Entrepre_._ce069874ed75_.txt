Yeah, we're from sleeping on the floor now my jury box froze fuck up Oh fuck up stole count it millions in a coke bad bitch. Oh, it's woke got a own bank row. Can't vote doesn't know Here's shot case clothes What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real and sick about the lies the fitness Delusions from our society and locally the mother fucker reality guys today. I have a real talk All right, I'm just gonna get right into it You know I Look all over the internet and I see all these people young people especially trying to be successful Trying to go out and build something become something create something and Everybody seems like they're super confused and I want to give you guys a few points Four points that I think will drastically Improve the speed and the quality of your journey when it comes to becoming Successful and whatever it is that you are now most of the people I'm talking to are here We talk in terms of entrepreneurship or entrepreneurship But the reality is is these principles apply to almost any area of life and it's something that you guys need to hear all right So here's the deal The first thing you have to understand is that we live in a society where success is villainized Winning is villainized Becoming something greater than everybody else is villainized all right that's reality It is far easier for people to sit around and do nothing be nothing become nothing and create nothing and Criticize every single other person on the planet that's doing anything outside of that Then it is to actually go out and build it it takes time to go out and build things it takes effort it takes literal blood sweat and tears it is real you have to give up things that other people get to do you have to Sacrifice your time which is really an investment because there was a return on it And that's one of the biggest fallacies that we don't understand is that this is an investment and there will be a return There will never be a return for you if you buy in to the poverty propaganda do not believe the poverty propaganda that is out there, okay? What is poverty propaganda? Poverty propaganda is this idea that you don't need any money All right, and that is somehow humble or noble to be less than what you could be To give up on your dreams and just be a poor little me and Stay right where you are and do nothing create nothing contribute to nothing Build nothing and then you get to judge everybody else that's doing other things and say they're not humble Well, that's not how it actually works because to be humble you have to actually be good being humble because you haven't accomplished anything Doesn't mean your humble it means you're making a justification for your lack of results All right, so poverty propaganda is a big problem and culture right now It is glorified it is amplified it is something that is pushed out and when you understand what you Were hearing and what you were looking at it's much easier to ignore and do the other thing All right, a lot of you guys you look at your friends You look at the people that you're surrounded with and they're out doing all these things and they're telling you that they're gonna You know go live their life in the mountains and they're gonna tour the world and they're gonna do all this shit But here's the thing guys and that's okay to do those things That's what you really want go do those things But what I'm gonna tell you here as an ambitious person is that if you buy into it at the expense of your actual true authentic self dreams and goals for what you actually want out of your life You're going to regret it all right, which leads me to my next point Okay, you have two options here You can have a hard life with the result or you can have a hard life without a result But either way life's gonna be pretty hard all right You can choose right now to become the kind of person that is going to invest all of their time All of their resources all of their energy and to becoming the person that lives the ideal vision that you have for your life And it's gonna be hard Really hard you're gonna have to make investments to other people your age in your position are not going to be making and They're going to judge you and they're gonna make fun of you and they're gonna laugh at you And you're gonna have to keep going because if you don't you'll never realize that version of yourself But in the end you get a reward You get to live a life that others can't you get to do things they can't you get to become things they won't you get to make impacts they don't Your entire existence Will be a reward for the effort that you put in on the front end or You can believe the poverty propaganda and you can go live your life, right? And then in 20 years you're gonna be working at fucking Wendy's not because you have a passion for it But because you have to All right, so you could choose is it gonna be painful now with a reward later or is it gonna be Fun now with pain later, but those are the only two choices So if you buy into the idea of the poverty propagandist You're going to be in the latter of those groups You're gonna be the person who has a great time now who fucks their life away and then in 20 years, bro You're gonna be making fucking double deck or tacos at Taco Bell on the midnight shift wonder what the fuck happened to your life And then blaming everybody else for it. No You have the opportunity right now to change your life. Are you going to change it or are you not going to change it? Okay, the third thing is this you have to stop over complicating it all right You guys look at this as if it's a fucking Nuclear Rubik's cube is not that complicated and I know there's all these people out here trying to tell you all their secrets 99% of these motherfuckers haven't done a fucking thing That's the truth and if you want a coach and you want someone who is actually gonna help you Yes, they can save you years of your life But only if they have done what it is you're seeking to do if they've already been on the path That's a great value that could save you years. I could save young Andy 15 years off the journey by having his ear for a year right now But what I can't do is go listen to someone who's never fucking done it and get ahead at all All right, so save yourself the time and energy and understand that if you're gonna have someone help you They better have fucking done what it is you're trying to do But here's the thing about everything Okay, this all comes down to two basic simple concepts anyway No matter what anybody else says you could hear the best speech you could take the best program You could go to the 12-hour seminar and jump around and say hey, I'm a different person It's always gonna come down to the two fucking things that it comes down to for everybody one You have to become the kind of person that can push through the hard times most people can't do that Most people cannot push through the challenging the draining the frustrating times that make everybody else quit and every time you push through one of these barriers You're leaving all of your competition behind and you're moving forward without that and most people can't do that So you have to build yourself into someone who has the discipline the fortitude the grit the perseverance To push through the hard times to become someone who is literally fucking incapable of quitting Okay, that is the first thing you need to do that's why we talk about the live-hard program That's why so many people live that lifestyle because it builds you into someone who cannot fucking quit and it's important Okay, and the second thing you got to have is you got to have just enough intelligence you got to know just enough That if you make a mistake to not make it twice and if you make it twice Definitely don't make it three times if you're someone who makes the same mistake three times over and over you're gonna lose Okay, so you don't have to be a genius you don't have to be a Buddhist monk You don't have to fucking have any of these special Superpowers that some of these motherfuckers claim to have all you got to do is be able to identify Okay, I messed that up what did I learn and then keep moving forward with point one Don't quit because every time you make a mistake and you learn a lesson that is a new skill and so when the situation arises again You're able to recognize it. You're like oh, man You know what I've seen this before Okay, last time I did this it didn't work out, but now I'm gonna do this and then you start to get ahead and Every time you come up to a situation like that based upon your previous experience You're able to make better decisions than the people you're competing with who haven't been doing it as long So this is a tremendous practical advantage that you have over everybody else if you don't quit So not quitting and being able to learn from new mistakes and apply the skill set to the next Situation that comes down the pipe is what success is all about we could do all the morning routines We could say all the affirmations we can attend every fucking seminar we can go to every single fucking group Therapy set. I don't fucking know we can do it all, but if you don't do those two things you can't win Okay, that's what it comes down to and the last point is this Learn to think for yourself You have to become a student of the game you cannot just pretend You have to learn how to think if you do not learn how to think you cannot play the game of success Because there are too many people that know how to think playing the game of success and you can't copy either Because if you copy you're unoriginal if you're unoriginal Nobody gives a fuck All right, so you have to understand if you're copying someone else All you're going to be at the maximum level is a water down version of something that is already recognized as the best So you have to figure out who you are What you stand for and you have to have enough courage to live that in real life The reason no one cares what you say is because you never speak on anything that you actually care about This is most of your problems Most of your problems with your brand have to do with you Analyzing everybody else's brand and then trying to be like someone else and what you're failing to realize because you don't have the Experience of understanding this is that what you're seeing in someone else's company or brand or persona Is actually the result of decisions that were made two three four years ago that have come to Materialize themselves into what you see today. So if that's the case and You're looking at the result of ideas that are three or four years old if you copy You are automatically three or four years behind at every given point and the only way to defeat that is to learn to think for yourself To become authentic to stand for what you believe to speak for the things that you care about and be original This is the secret sauce that most of you can't grasp we have far too many people chasing relevance for the sake of relevance Chasing relevance for the sake of relevance is a guaranteed way to be irrelevant You have to have original ideas. You have to have authenticity You have to say things that you care about so that people feel them when you speak about them You have to create things that make a difference It's not about you. It's about them and it comes from you deciding who the fuck you actually are Stop chasing the likes stop chasing the comments stop trying to be like everybody else and start working on becoming the best Passable you because when you're the best possible authentic you nobody can fucking copy it It's impossible. It's the biggest strategic advantage you will ever have in your entire life I see it on the internet. We see it every day. We see all these people out here trying to become a social media personality They're saying the right shit. They're doing the right things. They're doing just what everybody else does and that's the fucking problem It's already been done and not only hasn't already been done. It's been done better than you can do it So what is it that you can do that anybody else can't do and you have to figure out what that is and that's gonna take you Thinking for yourself Deciding what it is you are and becoming that in real life Okay, you have to be authentic Authenticity is the superpower of brand building the reason people ignore you is because you're trying to be something that they've already seen Elsewhere, okay? Look out for this in the real world. You'll see it everywhere now that I'm pointing it out Look at other people's personal brands. Who are they trying to be? Who are they pretending they are? Where are they taking their influence? It's very obvious if you look for it and none of those people actually win long term They might get a pop in the short term, but they don't get one in the long term So guys if you're a young person and you're out here trying to be successful You're trying to build something create something become something These four points will serve you greatly all right never believe Poverty propaganda there are almost zero situations in life that are better with less money Point two You have two decisions you can have a hard life with the result or you can have a hard life without the result But either way it's gonna be hard So decide what it is that you want and start working towards that Number three stop over complicating it. It's very simple, okay? One don't fucking quit and build yourself into someone who can't quit and Two learn from your mistakes fast figure out where you mess up Take the lesson apply the new skill to your little tool belt and the next time the situation comes around be able to recognize Where to apply it and make the right decision and four Become authentic Do not happy learn to think for yourself Otherwise you will be ignored forever Never sleeping on the floor now my jury box froze fuck up. Oh fuck a stove counted millions in a coat Bad bitch, who did slow got a own bank row can't fold doesn't know
