like my bike started shaking in the front and like I felt like something like kind of like fly off I thought it was like a boat or something right or like I maybe I ran over a rock or something you know like what the fuck is this and my bike started like shaking on me and so I pulled over off the side of the highway you know I got off did my little like you know check and I'm like oh I'm good like you know everything's loose right so I get back on the bike and I'm riding I get back up to my my cruising speed and something else fucking flies off right and like I'm in a construction zone now it's a one lane construction zone on the highway and like like my bike's like violently fucking shaking you know I'm saying like fuck man what it's happening and there was like a loves gas station like two like two miles ahead and like I Lord Jesus just get me there you know I'm saying because like I got semi-truck behind me bro like if I could like this tire fucking exploded on me I was going down you know and I get to the to the gas station and like I'm looking I'm checking everything there's no bolts missing and like something told me just like the roll the bike back a little bit and I rolled it back and sure shit enough giant chunk out my tire there how do my front tire man so I'm just glad I'm still here and not not in Mississippi or somewhere else where's hot yeah you know well

know and ready to ready to you know bro for names on the list how far stupid is the internet oh bro it's wild right now dude it is crazy man it is hot right now it's hot but it's it's nice to see though man there's like listen man it is so it is so nice to see that like I'm like the our narratives of things that we talked about in the show like we do not get the credit that we deserve it's out there I'm just saying it's not saying yeah man well let's get it to this cruise man we got we got some shit here we got we got a lot of stuff happening today uh so let's get into this but before we get to our headlines dumbass of the day oh show it all right you want to take a guess hmm Joe Biden no not not not today I get a hint uh her name rhymes with um lancie linozy yeah yeah how'd you get that bro did you see that shit okay go ahead yeah do you see this yes she's she's she's trying to say that Trump likely I think she came straight from brunch we'll see the thing yeah well the thing with dementia bro you forget things like this like you forget like forget things that's dementia she she forget she forgot that she's the one with dementia well listen dude she forgets that she had it do you have a clip oh yeah I got the clip yeah yeah yeah and like listen this is not funny dementia is a real thing right I know it affects a lot of people no everywhere no it's funny yeah here right now it's fucking funny all right well uh yeah representative Nancy Pelosi she said on CNN state of the union that former president Donald Trump likely has dementia uh so it was hosted by database one of the moderators real quick I don't think we cut that how do you think the moderators did from that debate like actually real fair like I mean dude look I thought they did good I thought they listen they did way better than I thought it would be yeah and honestly the uh the pause thing it it actually I think it worked out worked out good and I think it worked out to Trump's favor because Trump gets so emotional and he's such a smart ass which I love because I'm that way too yeah um but it kept him from going there and it made him focus on just the points yeah and I think it produced a way better Trump yeah that's not what I thought was gonna happen well they actually could I think they cut Biden off more than they could Trump oh dude when when Biden was stuttering like there's two or three times where he was like really bad yeah bro they stopped it they saved him that's enough yeah yeah dude when he was talking about like uh what was he talking about some sisters raping their kids or some like bro he's telling on himself some weird shit he was telling on himself with the abortion thing if you go back and rewatch the abortion clip where they cut him off it's crazy he was like telling on himself and then they cut him off dude you have to watch it under the context that he's telling on himself go watch it it's crazy it's crazy man but yeah so uh let's see let's check out what what uh miss Pelosi had to say this is an opportunity for Joe Biden to go out there and show he has the stamina and the rest and by the way while the press and for some reason they don't there are uh healthcare professionals who think that that uh Trump has dementia stop that his connection of his thoughts have not gone to who who are the healthcare professionals can remember no these i'm so tired of these people just making shit up there who who doctor who yeah doctor who doctor who else house what's a healthcare professional because bro a fucking like a fucking CNA is technically a healthcare professional you have like who are these people who are they his thoughts if you not go together and uh you know well like while he may be saying we're enablers we see Joe Biden up close we know how uh a tune to yards to the issues how inform to you guys are i debate with him about legislation and the right not debate but discuss it with him he's right there so in any case it was a bad night let's not still post that was a bad night it was a great presidency wait wait what the fuck was that wait wait wait wait debate with him about legislation and the right not debate but discuss it with him he's right there so in any case it was a bad night let's not broke look at her eyes look how glassed her eyes are was a bad night it was a great reason she's for sure fucking toxic no doubt for sure no doubt what do you think she drinks like is she sure might be like a she's a peanut whatever they got a brunch oh man she's a bruncher hmm she looks like she drinks box wine what's the box now bro she drinks the listen these people are losers who come from fucking nowhere who become ultra wealthy and think they're royalty she's drinking the most expensive fucking shit that they got no matter what it is hmm just whatever the most expensive these are these are not these people do not think like you and I they don't think like oh what's good everything they think about is about what the optics are to them you know like look at her earrings bro i was just about to say that bro anyway uh the point of the matter is is these old fucks shouldn't be managing anything and could you imagine them too having a discussion you couldn't understand be speaking their own language like tablers you know i don't know dude i'm real talk like i'm tired of old people yeah i want them to die yeah in our government they should not serve in our government you old motherfuckers ruined in the world for everybody for everybody else and you're going to be dead in two three years five years fuck you everybody should be tired of these people yeah that's real man yeah that's real like if you're they want regular people to retire at 65 but these people are serving in office in their 80s that's not right man no it's absurd not right and and hopefully America will finally wake up to this and you know because the reason these people have been staying in their positions of power and gotten their wealth and their fame and all these things is because all the regular Americans have been out here either trying to build their lives or struggling to survive we've taken our eye off the ball which has allowed these people to destroy everything great about America you know and like dude real talk now i know trumps are guy and i know like you know it's what we got right now but trumps too old to be doing the shit okay and i like trump and i don't think trump has an intubed dementia i think he's smartest fuck but at the same time we need to have rules around how old people are because dude there should be some interest into what country these people are going to live in themselves not just what are they leaving behind right so it's it should be a mix of both you know right now trumps are making all these decisions and bro this is not a knacket trump i'll knock trump when i'm knocking him i'm just speaking in general we wouldn't hire an 80 year old person to come in and run my company we wouldn't not even we wouldn't even think about it for a second and so like you know while i obviously i'm voting for him i think you're voting for him i'm pretty sure most people listen to probably going to vote for him and i'm pretty sure after the debate a lot of the people that were going to vote for a Joe Biden are going to vote for him too it's weird to me how many people aren't like we're surprised that he was that bad you know that was crazy to me like how many people just immediately like flip like right dude we'll flip that on dude i had no idea that these people were like you know listen i i knew these people were like indoctrinated but i thought i thought these people were just evil thugs bro they they just weren't paying attention because a lot a lot of these people who and now you look back at how they behaved during covid and you're like man well that kind of makes sense like if you're not paying attention at all like you would buy into all this stuff well it's deeper than that too and what are they allowed to be like to what are they what are they actually seeing you know i'm saying like we look we we know what we we are seeing like we have all those pages and shit but like you got to think most people rely on CNN CNN doesn't show the bad side of Biden i think that was the first time that CNN had done that that's a whole another thing you know what i'm saying so it's like like they're not bro are they actually even physically seeing this though listen man that was a coordinated media effort the second the debate was over bro the second it was over MSNBC CNN all the big papers every news outlet was saying Biden needs to resign Biden needs to resign Biden needs to resign they flipped on him before the fucking debate was even overdue that was completely orchestrated for sure completely orchestrated and that should be waking people up too for sure you know like i don't know well we got we got a little bit more of this to talk about in a couple of headlines um it was absolutely orchestrated though yeah but she's drunk dude look at the look at the fucking interview bro her eyes are if you were a fucking police officer and you've been a police officer would you ask her to get out of the car oh fuck yeah look at her eyes bro fuck yeah oh man bro look at the she's got an inch of glass on her fucking eyes dude yeah yeah yeah what's it what is that she's got four eyebrows what is that is that the cracks in her alien mask like is that what that is bro who drew that shit on there oh fucking go away lady oh man jeez man well yep dumbass of the day that goes her she takes the cake and the wine guys that being said let's get into our headlines uh remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them linked there that being said let's get into our first headline this is the biggest story of the day um let's talk about it let's walk through it a little bit here um headline reads suppose you didn't do it bro headline number one you can do it you gotta say it oh headline number one you say it like say like you say it how do I how was that that was like how I would say it we're trying to jok my nuts bro be yourself I told you he says like a dodge hell can't charge you yeah yeah yeah no no bro I got this fucking scat pack for sale you see that you see that dude on the internet Doug Thompson uh-huh he sells the scat pack dude that guy's fucking joe you know I'm not talking about how funny is that dude what he's the most underrated funny dude on the internet I didn't see it I'll show him to you later yeah send it you know what I'm talking about bro he's fucking funny dude I'm done all right well uh you're a man bro I buy a scat pack from you I still went from you guys headline number one that's one reads supreme court of firms absolute immunity for official acts in trump case now I got a little nervous when I first saw this right because we know the point of why president trump was even forcing the stuff to the supreme court right because it was going to set a massive precedence right and I got worried when I first saw this I'm like well shit he's not gonna be able to hmm the soul loopholes he's like like treason sacks not only that let's just dive into it now yeah not only that they they specified it's for presidents now you gotta think a lot of the shit that Biden has done or set up was done when he was vice president immunity doesn't cover so that's loophole there but yeah so let's dive into this the US Supreme Court ruled Monday that former president Donald Trump enjoys absolute immunity from prosecution for official acts during his presidency although it left the exact extent of that protection for lower courts to decide the high courts six three ruling vacated an earlier decision by a DC federal judge and cleared the way for more appeals by trump's legal team that could set the trial schedule in the 2020 election case against him back for months or years if it ever happens quote the president enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts and not everything the president does is official chief justice john robert's wrote for the majority quote the president is not above the law but congress may not criminalize the president's conduct and carrying out the responsibilities of the executive branch under the constitution the president therefore may not be prosecuted for exercising his core constitutional powers and he is entitled at a minimum to a presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts robert's added that immunity applies equally to all occupants of the oval office regardless of politics policy or party now that part right there is what made the life flip for me because they're specifically talking about the occupation of the oval office which the vice president does not occupy which I thought the I thought you pay in your electric bills what made the life flip that's what you said earlier are you guys laughing because you have to all right that's cool i mean for effort i mean that's neat yeah all right but uh yes there's still a massive loophole here uh that i that i'm happy to see but this wasn't the only win i think came out of the supreme for that was another one here um supreme court jenny were six ruling downgraded the insurrection that you know thousands of people have been charged with this point um they downgraded it to just mere trespassing that's really really big um there's going to be a lot of overturn conviction they let these guys out of jail yet it's coming it's coming it's coming are they going to pay these dues for the last four years of their life you would think ruin their lives ruin their marriages ruin their income their careers jobs held them in a fuck the psychological abuse of bro not only that it's there's a lot of rumors and i don't know how much truth that these people are being tortured in there yeah well i mean listen like there has to be there was all kinds of people that were like you know that's what they deserve they deserve that how they fucking didn't no they didn't no they didn't and and and like now listen like where there are a few shitheads that were like you know truly fucking shit up and breaking windows like i mean they were called the police uh huh exactly yeah exactly that's my point i feel like the the people that are called actually i fucking up this stuff they've been left out yeah they have not been convicted of anything they haven't been interested there's videos of that one guy saying hey storm the capital storm the capital let's go storm the oh turns out he's an FBI agent not only that well there's a video of the guy that was in cuffs that they literally pulled off to the side showed his badge they on cuffed him and let him go back in no no no they are in cuffdom and then they fist pound the cop then he went back in like what'd we do it yeah you know some ease of our own fucking country bro so this was cool to see this was cool to see this was this was this was a thing of wind and we're gonna see a lot of those guys hopefully guys and women because it's both hopefully getting getting released and i hope there is some form of restitution for these guys because there needs to be because it's fucked up now one of the only other things i don't really count this a win i'm it's not a win however it opened the door to more more action that i think that's a pretty court you know they rule in quarters they you know bring all their cases and deliver their ruling so this is what we're seeing and while we're seeing so many rulings come out from the Supreme Court but this last one um it's definitely a little weird a little offsetting here i'm gonna have to do with the social media um Supreme Court decides major social media censorship case uh in blow to GOP led states uh so the Supreme Court issued a nine to zero decision in a major social media censorship case dealing a blow to GOP led states the republican led states of texas and florida passed law to restrain big tech giants from moderating quote unquote objectionable material on their platforms uh the states said that the social media companies unlawfully tampered the free speech of users particularly with conservative posts so this law was actually passed back in 2021 where then uh all the big techs file lawsuit to you know stop it and put the injunction on it um in the supreme court finally just ruled on it um now you got to turn in general kim packs and he was kind of pissed off by it uh he tweeted this out saying this year i went before scotus to defend our landmark texas law that forbids social media companies from discriminating on the base of viewpoint uh big tech censorship is one of the biggest threats to free public discourse and election integrity today scotus sent this case back to the lower courts i will keep fighting for our law that protects texas voices new americans uh should be silenced by big tech oil garks um and uh you got the agia florida actually moody she also tweeted out she was a little bit more more happy because basically the supreme court ruled that hey this is not for us to decide and they pushed it back down to the lower courts um and she said quote we are pleased that scotus agreed with florida and rejected the lower courts flawed reasoning and validating our social media law while there are aspects of the decision we disagree with we look forward to continuing to defend state law um and they basically said how like hey like you got to give more evidence exact same thing they did uh with our ag here in Missouri uh ag baila like hey we just need a little bit more evidence of the actual damages and things that you guys are alluding to um and that's what i think this is i think this links up with that ruling for sure and what i see is very consistent yes and which is which is good because what they're saying is you can't just make an accusation and us rule in the favor um they're saying you have to have approval standing that people have done the things that they've done we have to have the evidence once we have the evidence we'll make it we'll make a ruling right so they in rule against it so to speak they rule that there hasn't been enough evidence presented right um that's one thing to watch out bro because yeah but isn't there like some sort of and i don't know this but is it is there a rule where once the supreme court rules that they don't they don't see the case again no it can be it can definitely be brought back up for sure yeah just like in this case right here with florida and texas they're sending it back to those locals i'm not sure can you look that up i'm not sure but all i know is that from what i talked to i talked to the a g baili after the ruling and he said yeah it's it's misleading because what we need to do is show more evidence he agreed that they already showed enough but apparently not according to a little bit more yeah man it's i mean i don't know what we got them all of this man i i think that handing the well first of all for the trump case um i think that's that's always been kind of assumed like are you going to prosecute braco bomber for all the bombs he dropped or George bush for the million people that he killed in the middle east you know wheat what do you you know i'm saying where's the line so i always thought that was assumed but apparently it hasn't been you know with them trying to push this j6 narrative to get their way it really puts a big hole in their game plan of making trump look like you know how they're trying to make them look in the history books right you know what i mean and that's that's where where i think it's an important message is you know it really drives because what they've been trying to do and we've pointed this out for a long for a long time you know if you notice like the candlelight visual on the year anniversary of j6 then you had Kamala Harris up there saying you know dde 9-11 January 6th Pearl Harbor yeah Pearl Harbor like trying to line all these things up and make them linked and it was just pure theater like they had a whole theatrical intro and outro and it was crazy and people were like this is insane dude like nobody even died except Ashley Babitt who was on the side of the quote unquote insurrectionist which were protesters um and they try to make it and people were like why are they doing that while they're doing that for the history books they're doing that so then in 30 40 years they could say look what this this crazy insurrection that happened in the United States of America back in January 2021 you know they were trying to make it a historical event and this ruling really throws that out the window because they can't make it stick to them anymore so that's a big problem for their side um and yeah like you said dude Biden has done a lot of shit when he was vice president most of the shit that he's done the quid pro quo yeah and by the way the treasonous acts acts that can be proven that are you are compensated for that are in the interests of other countries and you've abused your position of power to serve those countries over ours that could still be prosecuted for sure so it says it's usually the final decision but there are circumstances in which they could bring it back up yeah like a re-hearing but they have to file petition within 25 days of the course decision if there's new evidence uh constitutional amendment amendments and uh legislate legislative action so it can't be brought up but yeah all right yeah well yeah uh so guys jumping on this cover well I want to definitely watch this a lot because I feel like there's more to come out now some of this stuff might not like they might just wait until the next session to release the new rulings on this is possible um but this is definitely stuff we'll try to stay up to date on and uh keep you guys up to date but let us know down in the comments what you guys think uh about all of these Supreme Court rulings that just came out let us know down in the comments and uh with that being

has been utterly destroyed in the unexpected snap election he called just three weeks ago with lapin's party looking to nearly treble its seat holding uh polling has closed in France for the first round of this week long parliamentary election while actual seat distribution won't be fully known the exit polls following this knockout round uh have given a confident answer that marine lapins nationalist populist national rally or rn um won the day per the exit polls her faction gained 34% uh of the vote while the left wing coalition founded for the purpose of this election picked up 29% um and president uh macrones ensemble looks at just 20% um so in terms of seat any one party or group would need 289 seats in the 577 seat house a series of extra polls suggest that by the end of next sunday lapins party could have as few as 250 seats uh but could get as many as 310 depending on second round voting this is uh a simply enormous leap uh for lapins party given lapins party has uh had just 88 members of parliament last time so this just goes to show you they went from 88 members being represented in france's parliament to now potentially seeing over 310 right like that's a massive swing um and speaking this evening uh marine lapin she urged voters to back her in the second round to give the party an absolute majority in the house so it can choose the next prime minister um and begin the end of the manual macron presidency she boasted her faction has practically quote wiped out the macron camp um more detailed results will continue to come in overnight and into monday uh there now follows a week a further campaigning before the final heads of head rounds uh next week now what's the response for this what do you think macrones responses well it's very very clear this is a tyrant um who is has to maintain power because he's been put in by the elites who put him there he has to maintain the seat so what's he start questioning do you remember Biden had a couple of clips a few times right where he references this you know if you want to take on the government you're going to need f-16s and you know deer with caviar vest or the fuck he says um it appears macron is kind of taking the similar action here um he actually made a very very veiled threat to france um saying that there's going to be civil war um if the public votes for the pins party between who that's the question between everybody and you and your fucking ten people that like you okay it's weird man it's fucking weird it's not weird bro these people these people believe their own headlines they believe that everybody is with them joe Biden believes America is with him you know i'm saying or is it always at them like speaking like saying the truth of like you know kind of foreshadowing their own demise right like are they saying that they're you know the other sides are going to start the civil war against us if we don't win because of the shit that we've done to this country well they should is that we'll say this foreshadowing this since we're talking about france and not the United States it would you know what should happen is the people should rise up and decapitate this motherfucker on public TV he's ruined your fucking country he's let in fucking millions of migrants i can't see he's ruined france france culture why would you tolerate that and why have the people uh you know like if he hangs on to power and he doesn't move when this happens or he tries to pull some shit i hope the people kill him because dude this is a globalist dude this is someone these people have raped and pillage and destroyed western civilization and now the people are rising up and their answer to that is to cheat or figure out some way to hold on to power or threaten and uh you know people need to be made an example of so i hope people france will do so i hope so too man now like again we're talking about france here let's talk about the us and what's what's actually happening over here so like i said we started talking about a little bit earlier with Pelosi she was recapping on the debate um just a few updates there um apparently the Biden's are blaming literally everybody else but uh but themselves for the failed debate um explicitly uh calling out uh Anita Dunn who's the senior advisor uh for president Biden um Anita Dunn's husband Bob Bauer who's the president's attorney um who apparently played Donald Trump in the rehearsals for the debates at camp david um and Ron Claim the former chief of staff who ran point on the debate prep in previous cycle sessions um and apparently they all got back to camp david after the debate and uh Biden Jill Biden and even Hunter Biden apparently they all lashed out of these guys now there's been some interesting reports that have been coming out since the debate um and again there's been a lot of people kind of surprised at this right like that's been the reaction like a lot of people didn't know that he was that bad um but now you got some top aides coming out of the white house um blowing the whistle talking about how bad this dude actually was um and saying that yeah it was their fault because they've been hiding this man from the public we talk about this all the time they did it the last uh campaign year right back in 2020 they hit this man in his basement they're admitting that they've been doing the exact same thing but they took it a step further this is one thing i thought was weird um or a little interesting um apparently Biden has been closed off from all of his aides from all of his uh his normal people that would be helping him uh for quite a while now and apparently there's business hours and then closed off hours and apparently from like 10 a.m. to like 4 p.m. Biden has been completely unavailable though either lock him up in his residence of the white house um or and basically keep everybody away and apparently there's only a couple of people um who actually have unfiltered anytime access to Biden with special permissions to the residence which is typically reserved just for actual white house staff you know the mage and shit that help out up there um there's been a few people uh who had easy access to the residence area um and they got special marks on their their passes you know the band the badges that they have to wear uh which apparently it's unusual uh political staffers typically don't have access to those areas um but that's how it's been for a long time um and again we know these people try to protect them right like i mean here i got a clip here this is the raw unedited clip of the debate as soon as it ended watch what happens here they don't have to do that for Trump and that interesting now even time magazine is is trolling them this is their new uh new uh front cover of their magazine that they're putting out um but for some reason they're still holding onto the fact that apparently Biden's the only person that can beat Trump now there's been a lot of talks a lot of rumors here in the where do you where do you have on this well i mean i think it's pretty clear that this guy is not capable of doing anything and i think it should concern everybody who is surprised by this that you voted for him and i think it should concern you as to who's actually running the country because of the presence and capable of running the country then who is running the country and we have a bunch of people around him who have decided that they are the end all be all for the united states of america and they can do whatever they want make whatever rule they want why about whatever they want and they're all being compensated by other foreign interests so that's the other part people think is bullshit like people think oh yeah you see now but that him being affiliated with these foreign governments that's bullshit no it's not this guy's on the payroll of these other countries every decision this motherfucker's made allegedly has been to destroy this country all right and if you go down the list it's pretty easy to see but people don't want to admit it or they don't want to you know address it and you know now we're in this crazy situation dude i heard from someone who's very very very very very close to this whole situation that hunter and jill are the ones that are keeping him from resigning because jill loves the lifestyle of being the first lady and hunters afraid he's gonna get prosecuted even worse than he already has if his dad gets removed from office which will happen yeah a hundred percent and so you know you've got this babysitter who has now grown up to be the first lady who's probably a big deal for the first time in her fucking life trying to like like bro this ain't about you this is about our country these people don't care about us no that's what we got that's what we have to accept like these people do not care about us they get to fly around on jets and helicopters and everybody kisses their ass and we're their little peasants and this is a big fucking game to them and it's ruining people's lives no yeah it's about to do belongs in prison listen the do belongs in prison for real both of them do I think they all do yeah dude when it comes out what they've done as far as taking the money for and decisions they made like dude that's all gonna come out the problem is it's gonna come out when this dude's like ready to kick it you know what I mean yeah I don't care do it yeah whatever whatever and like dude you see that you see their attitude in the way that they they they feel like they're entitled to stay in power like the fudging of of you know the mail-in votes the non-pracikution for people who have been stuffing ballots who were caught stuffing ballots the entire vote flipping situation like all of these things they they feel completely justified to set up activist groups to do these things and that's fucked up dude so think about what that actually means that means that these people are in this position of power and they know that they're not legitimate in their position of power so they're completely okay doing whatever they can to maintain their power which cheats everybody else which is you know the antithesis of what that position is supposed to be it's supposed to be a position of service and all these people do is they come in every day and they try to divide they try to fearmonger they don't have a way forward all they do is talk about how Donald Trump's gonna ruin the country and while they talk about how Donald Trump's gonna ruin the country most of the working class Americans are in a far worse place than they were four years ago so how do they think you're you know they're tricking people they're not going to trick people into ignoring their own bank account or their grocery bill or their inability to make the ends meet they're not gonna trick people into that and all the while they're up there on the stage saying America's never been better our economy is great by dynamics we've done the best job of any president in the last hundred years and all these media talking heads have been saying it too they've all been lying they've all been covering they've all been lying about Trump the whole time like dude there's so much corruption in this system and in this media like machine the media it's it's fascism okay the media the government the the financial institutions they're all working in coordination to create this illusion that they have things under control and that they serve the people and that they have our best interests in mind and it's very clear they know and I don't think they can fool people anymore that that's the case and the fact that this guy is up there on stage you know basically losing his mind and that people are shocked about it is um is incredible to me it's like dude you guys who do not pay attention to what's going on shouldn't speak about what's going on like look how many fucking idiots in 2020 we're talking about how Biden was the savior and he was gonna fix the country and the same people you see him on Instagram now the same people are now saying yeah fuck dude I don't know what I was thinking man I just didn't I thought Trump I believe what they said you know like dude there's a big awakening happen you know and that means the space between where Trump was and where Biden was before that gap is now way way way wider and if they try to cheat at this time which I think they're gonna do because like I said over over and over and over their asses are on the line Joe Biden's asses on the line even with this presidential immunity thing his asses on the line because a lot of the stuff that he did like you said was when he was vice president also a lot of the stuff he's done has been treasonous in my opinion there's a huge reckoning come in these people know it the gig is up and they're willing to do anything they can to maintain and it seems like all the people around Biden have figured out like oh shit this dude's gonna blow it for us but the people that are closest to Biden they are the ones that are gonna get persecuted first so they're the ones that are like saying no you can't leave because we're fucked if you leave right so that both parties are trying to accomplish the same thing it's just that if Joe Biden leaves his family is a sacrificial lamb which I believe is the point that's why the media totally flipped on him right after the debate it wasn't he's had a million moments like that yeah he's had a million stutters like that he's falling down he's made a ask for himself he's done that so many times in the media back to him why this time bro just a week ago there was college at cheap fakes why this time why this time why now well together well why I think this time is because they realize now that they cannot win with this dude so they're trying to throw him in his family under the fucking tracks in order to save themselves which isn't gonna work people have woken up bro people are tired of the Obama's they're tired of the Clintons they're tired of Joe Biden they're tired of all of these people who have made our lives harder and harder and harder since they came around and they've gotten richer and richer and richer and richer people are awake to that so it doesn't matter if you throw Michelle Obama in there it doesn't matter if you throw Gavin Newsom in there it doesn't matter people are tired of the quote unquote leftist establishment that is Marxist communist bullshit that represents the world economic forum and their 2030 agenda and doesn't represent America and the patriots of America and the people of America and people are woken up to that in my opinion I think they've woken up so what we're gonna see what happens but dude I think they are gonna cheat and that's puts America people and the military and the police in a position to put up or shut up and I I think that I we are going to be asked and called to the line at some point of holding our ground and saying no fuck you and and it's gonna be interesting how that happens I don't know how that's gonna happen but they're not just gonna peacefully walk away it's not gonna happen they're not gonna Trump's not gonna win the election and they're just gonna drift away I don't think they're gonna allow them to win the election no we're in July means we got July August September October we got four fucking months left I don't think there is any chance that these people allow Trump to win the election no matter what they have to do it doesn't matter what it is it could be it could be the most dramatic destructive action they will do it because they don't care about you and I in fact they despise you and I and all of you guys listening because you won't stand with them that's what I believe is gonna happen and I could see them turn off the power I could see them turn off the power and blame it on Putin saying he launched something from I could see them drone striking fucking Mar-a-Lago and saying Putin did it from his submarine I could see them doing all kinds of shit dude all and I think I think Trump needs to be very careful because I think these people are very dangerous now you know when you get a wild rabbit animal back into a corner that's when it's as most dangerous and and the tighter the timeline shrinks the more in the corner they are and the more disruption that we could potentially see so yeah that's my take zero options mentality yeah that's what they're going through right I don't think their smart move would be to fucking back the fuck up and say all right we're not winning this isn't gonna work let's back up let's make some same statements between now and then well graciously lose we'll we'll recalibrate we'll regroup we'll try to come back four years yeah but dude americans got a fucking remember this man you cannot let these Marxist communist people in here you cannot let Hillary Clinton's who claim that Salo Linsky is one of her fucking mentors get into power no this like whatever happens here in this next election it's gonna be volatile you know what I'm saying yeah it's gonna be you know like it's a real change why what I hope happens is that Trump wins and all these people come out in the streets and throw their fucking tantrums into police just roll the fuck over that's what I hope happens do and a lot of people are like oh so you're rooting in for a police state yeah kind of kind of right now I am yeah like I don't know I just did this in state we can do it why I'm just saying dude like why we should be forced to live in this country with all these people who don't contribute they don't have jobs they don't do anything but create disorder destruction drama chaos disruption in our lives you know like these climate activists that are in the road these LGBTQ you know extremists who are walking around with you know naked in front of kids and shit bro we need to rid our society of this shit it's real man here it yeah guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think without being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three you'll never get you this one is I could have said I saw it coming I didn't see it coming this um headline number three reads uh former world economic form staffers accused founder Claus Schwab of sexual harassment zee wants the boobs you all hey mouse wants to get in the blouse it's not just that it's not just that bro hit your boobs belong to him like everything else that's what these people think these people think that everything belongs to them including your fucking titties yeah clouds more clouds wants in the blouse community titties that's what it is community you're gonna say that third time make it try funny bro it's funny okay clouds wants the blouse all right there you go put the shirt hey that's good that's good see that so look dude you're not funny it's fucking funny no it's it's funny I wish I had all day to think of my jokes you know the thing is though dude is like that's what these people think these people think of it they think that it's community whatever your kids are our kids your money's my money yeah your food's my food you owe nothing including your wife including your own body yeah that's real man like like I mean listen this story is deep man let's dive into a little bit so we got various female employees of the world economic form have gone on record to accuse its founder clasp Schwab of sexual harassment according to an investigation by the Wall Street Journal Schwab is facing accusations of sexual harassment and creating a hostile work environment one of Schwab's misdeeds allegedly involves targeted employees aged over 50 for dismissal to lower the average age of the workforce when his HR chief Paola Gallow refused to comply with this directive without valid performance related reasons Schwab fired him you're five as the old woman well I five as you like bro this dude don't give two fucks uh you know that listen this guy should be executed yeah um apparently uh allegedly back in 2017 Schwab reportedly dismissed a young woman leading a startup initiative after she informed him she was pregnant he expressed displeasure that she wouldn't be able to uh she wouldn't be able to work at the same pace and subsequently let her go after a brief trial period many other female staffers also reportedly reported being pushed out or facing career setbacks after becoming pregnant or returning from a time to leave meanwhile other female staffers said uh they were victims uh sexual harassment incidents involving suggestive comments and inappropriate behavior by senior managers some of whom remain at the farm Schwab who formerly left his role as executive chairman last month himself was described as uh setting a tone of sexualization and objectification from the top with multiple accounts of him making women uncomfortable uh with his remarks and behavior quote I knew he liked me and I knew he found me pretty said one woman by the name of Miriam uh Busina uh quote every man with a lot of power they think that they can get any woman and they are not ashamed uh another quote said uh quote there was a lot of pressure to be good looking and wear tight dresses adding another woman um who worked at the World Economic Forum in the 2010s quote never in my career have I experienced looks being such an important topic uh as in the form um it's crazy they got that much emphasis on looks they also look like shit yeah no shit just being honest but what was the policy on the hair dye that's my question um apparently another staffer claimed that Schwab made suggestive comments and even physically pose suggestively in front of her uh one mentioning he was she was Hawaiian to see her in a costume quote I need to find you a man and if I were not married I would put myself on the top of that list Schwab is reported to we have said on multiple occasions um now of course he is the vehemently uh denied all the allegations insisting he behaved professionally at all times the official statement said quote Mr Schwab does not and has never engaged in the vulgar behaviors you described the form spokesman said adding uh that the journals reporting would quote mischaracterize our organization culture and colleagues including our founder um that sounds a lot like the Bill Clinton statement um Andy what do you got on this what else you got me I mean look dude this is the this is the shit that they breed you know this is feminism uh me too cancel culture fucking political correctness you know black square you crane flag you know you better be with Israel or you're a fucking anti semi all of the shit comes from these people it all comes from the world economic form and it all gets pushed down systematically through DEI and ESG initiatives that go through the biggest companies in the world to the medium size companies to the small companies they have figured out what we talk about regularly when I've said to you guys for years is that business culture dictates home culture home culture dictates community culture so if you want to change the world you change the culture at work and you make it illegal to do anything else otherwise they won't qualify for their financing or their tax breaks or they can get sued and so they've put in all these rules and all this behavior code of conduct where you know these kind of things get called out to the front and so like it's it's his own this is their own initiatives eating themselves you know to say to a woman um you know if I wasn't married I put myself at the top of that list that's sure a lot different than grabbing by the pussy right or like some of the shit that is really said where it's like hey uh why don't you get under the presidential desk and give me a fucking blow job right so it seems like you know these people are creating their own demise that's that's what it means because you think this is just a massive backfire yeah they're solving a backfire on everything's gonna backfire on them real quick oh Jay question did he do it do you think this guy's a horny pervert yeah he kind of strikes me as well I could see it though I think he likes little boys too I think he's a little I think these guys are all pedophiles dude the more and more and more I look at this and the more and more and more observe and the more and more and more we see all this crazy shit come out and the more and more and more these social initiatives and one of them is this far left progressive initiative that pedophiles and quote unquote maps get to hide under the LGBTQ label this comes from these people no so why are they trying to protect pedophilia because they're fucking pedophiles dude why at this San Francisco pride thing that just happened this past weekend why are grown men allowed to walk around with children present with with erections or nude or pissing on each other or sucking each other's dicks all things that actually happen and there are some pictures of it on fucking Twitter okay with kids around and then they asked the police to do something about it and the police legit says well this is kind of one of those situations where you got to pick your battles you know we're out here on the outskirts to make sure it doesn't get disorderly and whatever they do in there you know we're not going to do anything about and the guys like well there's children in there and he's like well it is what it is that was basically his response and dude that's fucked up okay like we're not protecting our children from these disgusting fucking pigs and it needs to start happening dads need to start taking a role in fucking taking care of these people you know woodchippers you know stop drinking so much a great first four minutes you drinks and get back active in your kids life I've had to do the same approach by the way now bro I'm like the same funny dude like these people are ruining the earth these people are the people that pay Joe Biden that fucking figure out all these corporate deals that push this shit down through they're you know they feel like they should own everything and you will own nothing like when they say you'll own nothing and be happy well who will own it then oh they will own it and we see these initiatives happening like dude why is black rock buying up all these fucking single family homes across the country why is it that in every area across the country the price ranges from 200,000 to 600,000 you can't find a fucking house except nobody's making any money and the economy shitty and interest rates are fucking eight nine percent but you can't find any inventory why is that oh that's because the biggest funds in the world are buying the inventory so that they can rent it back to you right it's not because nobody's that's correct yes cellos market right now yeah man bro it's it's crazy this all comes from this dude and listen these guys are fucking crying this is crimes against humanity let's not forget they engineered covid they engine it wasn't Fauci on a book on it hold on it wasn't Fauci the engineer covid Fauci's the guy they're going to blame for covid this motherfucker and his homies were the ones that engineered it it's just fucking it's it's it's insane dude yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments let us know with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show guys thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is where we bring a headline in we talk about it it'll get one of those two options so with that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck hell on reads Andy let's go to Florida okay we're going back to Florida Florida man yeah Florida man thumbs up a double spark out on reads drone hunt man shoots and destroys Walmart delivery drone arrested so yeah you got a Florida man shooting down drones Walmart drones let's dive into this man was arrested after the neighbors witnessed him shoot a Walmart delivery drone that was part of a demonstration showing off the new delivery vehicle police responded to a call at a Walmart parking lot on Wednesday when two representatives from Walmart's drone delivery service called 911 with reports of one of their drones being shot down now the pair said they were promoting the delivery drones by demonstrating mock deliveries they stood in front of a suburban home with a group of people interested to see the new technology but when the drone began its descent the representatives reported a loud sound that they thought could have been a gunshot one of the representatives claimed to see a 60 year old man in a blue shirt and blue jeans standing next to one of the homes and pointing a gun at the sky where the drone was the drone eventually made made it back to the store but after an inspection the representatives realized the drone had $2,500 worth of damages upon learning this officers returned to the home that the representatives reported seeing the man with the gun this is they found they met Dennis win 72 years old who was living in the home they asked if if he had an incident with a drone and when said he did according to an affidavit when noticed the drone flying over his home and believed it was watching him he subsequently grabbed his 9 millimeter pistol and shot had it the late county sheriff's office put this put this out this was their their public statement that they released so he was charged and taken into custody charged with shooting at an aircraft criminal mischief damage over a thousand and discharging a firearm in public or residential property I would have shot it too well I mean I would have used like a shotgun like a shoot like some bird shot yeah yeah I mean 9 millimeter he hit it too that's pretty fucking good ahead yeah that's what he off my lawn he looks like that look at him dude I mean bro I think he hates you for sure he fucking hates you probably with a black drone that's what it would oh but bro listen my listen don't fly that shit over my house listen dude I seriously do we really want to see a gazillion drones going all over the sky it's like pollution like dude I'm so sick of this sentient on homeless people in the city I'm so sick of this fucking pursuit of technology for the sake of technology like when are we going to start questioning what is the cost of this technology what does it take away from us you know that question should have been asked before social media was brought in or before smartphones I think that most people that have smartphones that were alive you know and an adult age in the year 2000 to 2005 look at smartphones say this greatly diminishes the human experience I think it does social media makes it worse now we have AI now we have drones you know this is all just a part of the plan to keep you in your fucking house and you be a fat little plebe and take what they give you and do nothing create nothing become anything you know be a fucking a cog in their machine it's like being in the pot of the matrix without actually being in the pot and we're not actually supplying like electromagnetic energy but what we are supplying is you know the constant money flow the cash flow for all of these big corporations you know they bring you to your food so then your fat and because you're fat you got to take their medicine and because you take their medicine you got to take other medicine all right then you sit at home and you stream all day you know you stream Netflix you stream Amazon you're making a money like bro they're creating mega consumers on the downfall of humanity and that's wrong and we as human beings should start to ask is this a good idea is this a good idea to allow AI to get my robotics and replace soldiers and workforce so what so we can stay home like when did the idea of staying home become the peak goal of humanity like I understand people want to have a day off or they want to have a little bit of work life back I can get that but you want to be completely useless and you want to be subjugated to the allotment of goods that the government's going to dictate to you because that's called communism and that's where we're headed and it's going to be forced on us by all of this technology that we are getting mesmerized by instead of critiquing and saying hey this is not a good idea okay and I wish people would have a little bit more foresight and understanding to ask questions around should we do this as opposed to just running full steam down the you know pro technology lane you know and it comes like dude people just aren't smart enough to see what's happening and then when they when you when you tell them what you think is happening they say oh you're just paranoid well no I'm not paranoid in fact I've been correct this last four years about almost everything I said not paranoid and if this continues you it's just gonna promote more and more and more of the shit that they want and that's why I tell you guys that the ultimate rebellion to these people is to become everything they don't want you to become if they want you to sit at home be fat you should be fit if they want you to sit at home it could consume their bad food you should get good food if you if they want you to consume their medicine you should try to find natural remedies if if they want you to sit at home and could be a mega consumer of their info and they're streaming and they're this bro get outside do some shit with your fucking friends and family you see what I'm saying like bro if you're if we if we become the opposite of what they're trying to groom us and and funnel us into becoming they don't have a profit center so that means they can't pursue this technology you see what I'm saying but like dude people people are fucking so brainwash now to believe that the goal is to do nothing like look at what they look how they paint retirement to the average person you know I can't wait till I retire I want to do anything and then you talk to people who are retired and they hate it they don't have any friends they don't do anything they don't have any family they don't really go anywhere you don't have saying it's it's it's a trick dude we need to be living our lives and producing good solutions and pursuing passions pursuing worthy projects passions don't mean I'm just gonna sit at home and you know be passionate about taking pictures of the flowers like it might mean that for you but I mean that's dude we we are we are builders we are creators we are creative beings we are we are people who have to have a mission and have to have a purpose and all of this technology that we're seeing being pushed onto us is removing that which is ultimately going to be the downfall human the human race and and dude like this these drones this should be illegal and if I see one you fly one of the motherfuckers over my house I'm shooting it too that 100% yeah free my boy Dennis bro free yeah even if you don't want me to be his boy you know we want me to be his other boy he looks angry but I don't blame him bro I don't blame him he's he's recognizing what's going on in the world and he fucking don't like it he probably thought he was getting invaded bro who knows how we thought we'll talk to guys probably a nice dude he's probably like dude what the fuck is going on we don't have any community we don't have any family we don't have any conversation we don't have any meaningful relationships they've all been interrupted by technology and dude it's just fucked human race man it really has and like dude very few people have benefited from it very few people have benefited from it at the top level you know what I mean 100% so dumb as fuck on this one dumb as fuck on Walmart yeah I think thumbs up on what's the name Dennis Dennis yeah from a boy Dennis man hashtag free Dennis good name for Dennis it is it looks like a Dennis he does all right well who got's 80 oh god all right guys don't be a whole show show
