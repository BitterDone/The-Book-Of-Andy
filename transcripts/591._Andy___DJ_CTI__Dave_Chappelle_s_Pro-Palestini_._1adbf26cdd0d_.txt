Just five to 20 minutes of me giving you some real talk that I think needs to be said Sometimes we have full length. We actually have a really good full length for you coming up this week That's where somebody comes in who's interesting and we have a conversation with them pretty much like every other podcast you've ever seen ever And then we have 75 hard versus now 75 hard versus is an occasional podcast that we do we bring someone in who has Done 75 hard the program not the challenge the program and has taken their life from a bucket of shit to a bucket of Non-shit, okay, you can get that program for free at episode 208 on the audio feed is not on YouTube All right, we were not doing YouTube until the beginning of this year Tremendous support on YouTube by the way, it's been amazing.

We call that paying the fee so if you give value out of the show recognize that I'm Funding this show out of my pocket. I come on here every week saying very uncomfortable things talking about uncomfortable things It's not that much fun for me to do I do it out of obligation and I ask very simply that you share the show So don't be a hoe sure the show now There is a very important announcement coming up this week that I would like to hit and that is the the bison hat A lot of you guys has asked about the bison hat what it means what it stands for etc etc. How can you get one? well, I have Hezotated to make these available to the public because quite honestly I don't feel like a lot of people live up to what I believe that it means however I have come to realize that we have a whole lot of people in this community that are trying very hard to live up to the Standard of what we talk about when we talk about personal excellence You're starting to speak up more you're starting to do more and I figured it would be a good time to make these available So Wednesday night we're gonna have a special announcement seven o'clock. I believe it's seven o'clock seven o'clock Wednesday night Central time central time, okay? We're here in the Midwest So central time We will have an announcement And if you want to get in on that pay attention to what's going on pay attention to my Instagram stories Look in DJ's Instagram stories and we'll have the secret to getting in on that So we're gonna make those available on Wednesday night With a few other things and some pretty important messaging that goes along with it. So keep that in mind all right I think that's all the housekeeping. All right. What's up? Oh nothing much man, you know It's over here doing some DJ math making sure my shit added up. Oh, yeah, yeah, I checked it like Yeah, yeah, I hope so we'll find out Oh, some stuff for the show there's there's some There's some some numbers I had to put together just to on the back end and make sure got it Yeah, we'll see you here sure. Cool. How are you man? How's everything good? Yeah, good man. So really fucking sore right now Yeah, yeah, I don't know why I think it's because I got a guess Oaf baby. That's where it is that oldest fuck. Yeah, it's possible. Yeah, I've been training hard man Yeah, training hard eating perfect trying to get into the I'm trying to finally surpass The place I was when I injured my shoulder mentally and physically like I'm very close But I have never been able to cross it yet and when I got injured back in September of 2021 I I felt I was at my best physically and mentally I'd ever been to in the last two years have just been Very very difficult both physically and mentally for me and I'm just now to the point where I can train with proper intensity again And so I'm really looking to push past that point and I'm pushing real hard It's interesting. It's interesting. You brought that up man because we just had the Q&A that's dropped Where you talked about mind-body reality, right? It's but like in this situation, you know, we talked about getting back into the best mental and physical shape Is it still the same like does that physical shape come first? Does the work come before the belief or like what what is coming first like you have to get your mental right? Is that back in the best shape and then body comes I think there you know, I think it's there's a Injury we're talking about yeah, this wasn't like I sprained my shoulder, right? I tore every single thing in my shoulder that can be torn even my bicep tendon so like It was a big injury and at 42 years old, you know, that's an injury where we question, you know, can you come back to a high level of function functionality with that what it took him to the barn. Yeah No shit, bro That's right along so You know, it's I spent a lot of time the first I mean that first year When I didn't know if I was gonna be able to train together was mentally very mentally challenging because I just didn't know You know, and then the the second year Which is you know, we're wrapping up the end of that now because my surgery was actually December 13th of 2021 so we're closing in on the two years of the actual surgery I've been able to train but I just haven't been able to push hard, you know what I'm saying And for me to get back where I was I have to push really hard and so I've just been able to start pushing somewhat hard again and You know, I'm I'm starting to believe I can get back to that if that makes sense So it's a little of both, you know You you have to like have some faith to push But then you see some result then the result reinforces the belief which makes you push a little harder You know, and it becomes this little machine of work and belief that add to each other and I'm at a good place now where You know, I've pushed enough to where I know I know for sure I can get back there and pass that So I have total belief in it now. It's just about the work. Yeah, so that's where I'm at I'm excited for you, bro. Yeah, I'm excited to see it man. Yeah, everything else is good man Little baby Addison went to a chiropractor today really what happened? I was kind of nothing. That's well She had like some gass and shit, but like we've been watching these TikTok videos I didn't know babies could go to chiropractor. Yeah, it's like a whole thing Yeah, and yeah, apparently she should herself. So that's good. Oh, I gotta work it out man She's gotta work it out, but like did you know those videos that like I've been going around I'd like the chiropractor like the fake chiropractor with the fucking skeletons. Oh, yeah I just break that off. That's all I could imagine so like this whole time I'm like, please don't make me hurt this doctor. Yeah, you know, I'm saying but not apparently it's all good. So that's good Yeah, and I'm gonna a little bike ride yesterday, huh? Yeah, yeah, do those are always great. Yeah, I got up pretty early And just drove as you know wrote as long as I could on a full tank and the turnaround come back now come back man, it was about a four out four or four and a half hour trip five hour trip. So that's good Yeah, it was good plus you know riding seasons coming to a close so trying to get some in yeah, just get a little bit in you know I feel like I kind of feel messed up sometimes though as the ride and teases over because I call my insurance and change about policy go to the cheap man's insurance because I'm like sitting my garage for five fucking months I'm not paying this they don't penalize you for that. No, no, that's a smart move. Yeah, they encourage it capitalism baby That's called being economically responsible. That's it. Yeah, save a shit time. Yeah, yeah, man got a good show guys I've got a lot of good stuff coming up. I wanted to bring this up man because it's kind of been everywhere Well, I can't even fucking watch like I can't like I've been like off social media for the most part the last few days because like Watching you people argue Like after all of these things over and over and over again that we've been through for the last three and a half years Watching you fall for it over and over and over again It drives me insane and when I say you I mean the whole entire fucking world Like if we're gonna ever defeat these people if we're ever gonna like be actually free and have a life That isn't like constantly Shit because these people are stirring it up. We're gonna have to realize who the enemy really is And it's not your fucking neighbor and it's not some random dude on the internet and you do nothing But their work when you get wild up and attack these people and attack each other and do all this shit like so I'm just like yeah, it's just been like every other thing that we've covered that we've been right on right? No COVID black square fucking Vaccine you crane All this shit you name it. Yeah, we've spoke on it and Then it's like you got to watch people unravel and then finally, you know Now the windows becoming short right where it COVID it was years and now it's a month You know where people are gonna figure out like oh this is what's happening no shit, dude Yeah, like it would be nice if you kept if you were quit following for the same play over and over again Yeah, those like this aha moment of like realizing that the jar was shaking But now the dry shit well, they're not shaking the jar this time this has to be real. This is real People can't understand the fundamental reality that these people are willing to kill actual human beings to make these things happen Yeah, because good people people like dude Think about this Most of the people out here in the real world are really good people do they care man And like when they see people die or or be be killed or murdered It's beyond their comprehension to consider that other people have no problem doing so to advance an agenda at all or Or to or to relieve themselves of any type of accountability that could come from them Doing these things. Yeah, they don't care dude and people people because they're good and they have good hearts and they have you know Common sense and like there's no way they would actually allow people to die over it No, that's what these people do and by the way you're on the list of the people that they would allow to die to advance their agenda In a moments notice fuck man, like how do you guys not get this by now? No, this one's in by this is real. Yeah, it's like yeah, it's real, but it's also real bullshit Yeah, if you look at it man, did you see this old fart? He did interview so you guys remember his freezing episodes right so he did an interview With CBS Senator McConnell fires back at CBS host for peppering him with health questions Um, so he got he got a little pissed off actually after he got done defrosting This is this is a quick video from I just I just thought this was funny to share people wonder about your health How are you feeling? How are you doing? I'm fine. I'm completely recovered and Just fine You and your office felt the need to to share and disclose some of the details about your health because of some of these public incidents and the doctor He said there was no evidence of Parkinson's disease or a stroke or or a seizure And I wonder is there anything the public should know that wasn't disclosed? I'm in good shape Completely recovered and back on the job. So does that mean that you think You are able to continue serving and you want to continue serving here at a time when we are talking about incredible dysfunction in Washington I think we ought to be talking about what we were talking about earlier rather than my health I'm fine. He just keeps like bro.

Oh god. By the way, there's literal biological functions inside your body that stop operating when you are a certain age And if you are of the age of 35 and you're not considering test-testing replacement Especially with what's going on in the world and the chemicals in our food and water etc You're a fucking idiot Yeah, test for everybody. Yeah, would that be that guy that guy needs extra would that would that be one of your initiatives? Huh? Yeah, all the men put them on a fucking On a straight getting teed up. Yes. Yeah, that's our biggest problem right now. It's a fact man Everybody's out here in their feelings when they should be out here conquering the fucking world You know why you're in your feelings because you ain't got no testosterone in you bro That's real shit. I know you're all full of estrogen You're reading all this bullshit on the internet about how to get in touch with yourself my fucker go take some testing I'll conquer some shit. Holy shit Well, that was a study that was done. They took like some liberal men. I will side it What will give you your eyes the the fact checks and sites on it They took tests and they became conservative. Yes. Yeah. Yes Wild Interesting. Yeah, so let's get into the show, man, cuz we got some good stuff. So our first batch of headlines Hello, whatever one reads Report Dave Chappelle goes on pro Palestinian rant cheers of free Palestine Jews leave Yeah, so I just thought this was interesting to throw up. Obviously we got some some more pressing issues going on But I just wanted to get your take man because Chappelle I feel like he can always be applauded as one being a fuck Unfuck withable. He says what he wants to say and he stands on it, right? That's the whole key to being unfuck withable. I can respect that. Yeah, right? Like you know these people that are just you know, wavin, you know, like plastic bags and the wind or whatever issue comes along They don't actually believe what they're with their standing for So I can respect Dave Chappelle just for that simply But let's go into this man because he's been getting some some interesting Pushback So comedian Dave Chappelle went on a pro Palestinian anti-Israel rant at a show in Boston on Thursday evening And was cheered by the crowd causing Jews present in the audience to walk out This was a Facebook post by a guy named Andrew McGorley's this guy here And he posted this saying he needs some test I'll be a fucking honest wait see what look what he says in his I don't even know what he said, but I can tell you that guy's lacking the testosterone He even put the emoji attached to the I'm feeling disappointed. Yeah, well see he's in his feelings. Just need some tests, bro Ha ha ha, shit I cure everything But uh, yeah, so he put this on on Facebook he says Quote hello for my friends. This is my first Facebook post in nearly seven years with that said It is also the only social media platform I have so I hope people still use Facebook I would like to share with you an experience I had last night Allison Cohen McGorley's and I went to Dave Chappelle stand-up comedy show at TD Garden with three other couples Let's start it out as a funny and enjoyfully evening for the eight of us ended with disgust and fear Towards the end of his act Chappelle mentioned the war in Israel. How he has a Muslim denounces the Israel denounces Israel for its treatment of the people in Gaza and started to add in lots of false and unsustainitated claims A gentleman toward the front yelled out quote You should shut the f up Chappelle lost it on the man yelling quote you do not tell me to shut the f up at my show Chappelle then started on a tirade of his beliefs leaving comedy behind and focusing purely on the politics While that was awful in itself when made my heart sink and started to invoke fear was when the crowd of nearly 20,000 people Started yelling out go Palestine go Hamas And other Related hateful jargon the audience was cheering Chappelle on during his tirade. I was sick. We were sick I turned to my friends and wife and I said I think it's time to go We walked out and met up with many other Jews leaving the show never in my life have I felt so unsafe and so fearful of what I was witnessing Um goes on and on about it You know the Wall Street Journal they were they they did an official article on it Saying that Chappelle first condemned the October 7th attack on Israel by him most militants but criticized What he said were war crimes in Gaza according to people in attendance. So it's like again It's what we've been saying right the separation of people understanding there's a difference between Amos and Palestinians and there's a difference between the government of Israel and Israelis right like the the American people and the American government right He separated that out clearly. I didn't see what he said Well, so the videos haven't surfaced just yet. I'm sure there We doesn't lock cameras at his shows for this reason But I'm sure he'll probably release him foot is just though, you know, he can defend his side of the argument man about what he got on the so far Well, look dude. I think it's a delicate situation and like I said the beginning of the show I think a lot of people are falling into the intentional division. It's being propagated by our media and the reason they're propagating it should be thought about you know what What is being gained by the division being caused around this issue? Okay, well Joe Biden's out of the news Hunter Biden's out of the news crime is out of the news the borders out of the news uh The economy's out of the news You know election integrity's out of the news Transshade is out of the news pretty much everything that everybody's been arguing about that's been closing in tighter and tighter and tighter Over the course of the last six or seven months. It's now out of the news with this one thing being the news right um So when we engage in these in this divisive all or nothing mentality All we're doing is playing the part of pawn on their behalf. That's what they're counting on and so you know This is a delicate situation for a lot of people involved um You know error people in Jewish people specifically Because you know this is there's a direct connection there right and so it's important for us to be able to have a civil discussion Around these topics so that we can unwind the intentional propagation that's happening and there is a difference between The elite Israeli government and the regular Jewish people of Israel or America there is a difference between the Elite Zionist cult that seems to be behind all of the bad shit in the world at the world economic Forum, you know the constant Adjutation with all of these issues across the globe, you know soros etc etc etc um These guys are all working in unison to achieve an agenda and then pretending like it's all you know when you criticize them That it's all Jewish people that you're criticizing that's not true Okay, so we have to be able to have real conversation There's a difference between Americans and the American government There's a difference between regular Jewish people and the elite Jewish Class that's running Israel. There's a difference between an innocent Arab Palestinian and Hamas and these are all very clear differences and if there's nothing wrong with saying Hey, this doesn't seem right and this I'm not for the slaughter of innocent men and women and children for no reason No matter who they are and there's this narrative that's being pushed out um ironically from the conservative side now that if you don't stand with Israel You're at anti-Semite and that's not true at all Okay, what the truth is is that there's some things here that don't add up that we're questioning and it's Absolutely okay to question these things, you know when we look at Israel and we consider what they're known for their surveillance I covered this a couple weeks ago And then they allow and I'm using that word intentionally allow all these Hamas terrorists to fly in on paragliders and slaughter their own people You know and and then we look at the response what's the response been the response has been the flattening of you know Fuck dude a place where millions of innocent people live. Yeah, and so You know if we want to put this in some in relatable terms for us This would be like the patriotic community here in America being targeted Uh as a threat to Russia and then Russia say you know what fuck it We'll fucking kill the entire fucking country all the men, women and children and fucking exterminate them right And so people are upset about both sides of it, you know Like people who can be you can be upset about the attack that Hamas was allowed to execute against Jewish people in Israel You can also be upset about the excessive death that's being caused by the excessive response and You know those things do not mean you're one side or the other thing I think it means that like we're critically thinking we're asking questions and we're saying okay Well, you know, it's not okay for innocent people to die no matter what country Therefore and I think the way to think about this is more so You know At what point in time are we as humans and let's just call it what we are The peasant class of humans. That's us. All right. That's what they believe we are Um At what point are we gonna get smart enough to realize that we are being Literally moved across a chessboard amongst you know different organizations for a purpose We're being killed to promote narratives. We're being attacked. We're being divided. We're being Uh, uh, yeah, I mean dude everything our lives are being made miserable Across the board when they don't have to be and that's a scary thought too Because people are starting to accept the misery that's being put down on us as the reality of life And that's not the reality of life If we didn't have these elite tyrant scumbags making our lives extremely difficult, bro Most people are good people most people are caring people most people are good neighbors and people of different religions They care about you too like most people have this this very basic Citizen of humanity Respect for other human beings and that's global that's not that's not you know exclusive of Jewish people or exclusive of Arab people or Exclusive of Russian people or American people or Chinese people most people are like that It's just these elite tyrant governments that have fucking robbed and pillage and made our lives difficult that aren't who continue to use us for their own propagated narratives and You know so like you know, I didn't hear what shapel said. I didn't hear what he said But you know, I would disagree with people chanting like pro-Hamas shit But I would also agree with people saying hey, we shouldn't kill uh Palestinians that are innocent You see what I'm saying and like that we're we're falling for these lumped together all or nothing Yes, there it is and it's causing us not to be able to dig into the problem and find any real solution So you know, I can understand why that person's upset like that would be upsetting right? Like if I went to a fucking if I went to a Dave shapel show and He said something that was pro black and the entire fucking Audience started yelling like fuck white people. I would be uncomfortable. No, you know, so like let's put ourselves in that position I think it's important for us to remember and by the way I think Dave shapel is actually trying to communicate what I just communicated. Yeah, I think that's where his stances But I also think that like these people who are resp like that guy the guy the guy who wrote this post I bet that's the same mother fucker that's all for flattening fucking Palestine You see what I'm saying? So there's all this hypocrisy happening. So it's okay for you Sir to say let's go kill millions of people for because they attacked us But if people say that they support that side it's terrorism to you like there's a double standard here That is ridiculous and it needs to stop and so you know the only way It's ever going to stop as if we have real conversations about the scenario and to be completely honest Like I still stand on what I said two weeks ago when this shit first started happening I give a fuck about the people in this country I still care about those issues that are no longer being talked about because those issues that are no longer being talked about are going to be the issues that think our country And allow us to be conquered in the long term maybe even the short term okay? So like when we talk about you know what's happened since this has happened well Joe Biden's been come out. They've actually have printed checks. Okay, you got in the show. Oh, yeah, okay So we have issues that have been unforgettable here. I'm really that's right So we have we still have this border invasion. We still have this crime situation. We still have this economy We still have credit card defaults at an all-time high. We still have issues with the election We still have still have still have here, right? We still have oil and oil reserves all-time low We still have lack of military equipment because it was intentionally left in Afghanistan and Ukraine and said to Ukraine And now it's being used by Hamas in the Middle East Okay, so we still have 25,000 plus inner city people who are getting killed in their own cities and co-blood. We still have a hundred thousand uh, you know overdose is a fentanyl plus here We still have tens of thousands of homeless veterans in this country We still have mortgaged defaults at all-time high. We still have credit card defaults at all-time high We have our own problems here. So like then just stop once you start and so like this You know, I still stand on what I said. I don't give a fuck. I don't care I care the innocent people are getting killed Yes, that bothers me But at the end of the day we should not be doing fucking anything until we take care of our own people here That's the priority and anybody who says different is a fucking asshole. They're not an American Okay, they have interest in other places either money or loyalty to another country Okay, because it's coming It's common sense for us to say hey This a right here and for us to fix that every single fucking American knows this the the problem is we are being sold out by people who have their own interests Financially in mind or loyalty to another country that isn't America and that's not okay That's not okay for this country. No, and so let's dive in on this uh this middle east issue real quick before we get to the other issues Um, don't know if you guys saw this but uh this came out Defense secretary issues prepared to deploy orders for us troops to the middle east it's getting real Quote I have placed an additional number of forces on prepared to deploy orders as part of prudent contingency planning to increase their readiness And ability to quickly respond as required he said in the statement that's defense secretary Austin um, we just made that statement from the Pentagon um and according to uh, Nika Asia, which is a military they they follow military articles and and press press responses and stuff um, they're saying it's it's about 10 12,000 sailors Um, and they listed this out these are the two striker uh striker groups carrier striker groups that are now moving uh to the area With their crew size listed uh next to them Um, now here's the interesting thing so blinkin says us is quote ready to get involved in israel hamas war if line is crossed we won't hesitate now they just released that today uh blinkin said quote this is not what we want not what we're looking for We don't want escalation blinkin said we don't want to see our forces or our personnel come under fire But if that happens we're ready for it How about no motherfucker? How about you be ready for how about you go fight it Yeah, I think that's fair. I think anybody that's supporting this should have to go fight their kids should be drafted they should go fight I agree with that we won't have to know motherfucker. You don't hesitate and you go yeah, like what's real easy to say we don't hesitate when that when it's not gonna bother you one bit at all Yeah, completely on your kids aren't at risk your life's not at risk you're willing to volunteer American lives To go fight some bullshit when we have all these problems here dude fuck you You know and again because people have short-term memories these are the same men who are willing to kick military numbers out For not taking this you know there are for not taking this experimental drug. Yeah They were not they were not hesitating at that time either. Yeah, like just we're now they're trying to get them back Well, they need them now. Yeah, I wouldn't go back far. We know you know and all of this is happening while uh But what Biden said the beach again This this had my reach crisis what crisis Biden enjoys breezy beach walk as middle east explodes President Joe Biden has been seeing them pictures and videos enjoying a weekend of walks at the Rojo both beach Delaware as a Mastere's pushed their campaign of destruction against Israel and the US placed additional troops on prepared to deploy orders to the Middle East here's a quick video To the point that 50 sent he's even even chimed in on this he he posted this on Instagram With the caption saying Hey Joe get the fuck up. We're in trouble man. Yeah, man We're in trouble because y'all keep believing all this bullshit narrative and you keep fighting and attacking each other For bullshit that ain't even true. Yeah, you know like uh for example like George Floyd being suffocated to death, which actually just came out that that's not the case at all Not even not even a little bit Notty the one that came out that like uh The BLM protests may have uh influenced the jury and that case. Nope. No shit. No This dude sitting in jail right now for probably what I don't know what they sent some to and they a bunch of dudes Those murder, okay, I'm pretty sure that's what he said for for something that that did not happen Okay, yeah, they held him down. He didn't die from that He fucking died of a fentanyl overdose. That's that's proven fact now Okay, and all you guys intimidated and scream and yelled and fucking marched and all this shit And now now we have all this division in the country and we have all like bro When are we gonna wake up? Yeah, we're not in trouble now. We've been in fucking we've been in trouble because y'all don't fucking listen Yeah, I just thought that was he and when I say y'all I don't mean black people. I mean everybody. Yeah, you keep falling for the same shit over and over again Yeah What are they gonna are they gonna have a retrial? Are they gonna dismiss? What are they gonna? They're gonna let this guy rot in prison for the next 20 years for something that didn't even actually fucking happen the way they said it did Um, and there's gonna be people saying he deserves to be in prison for what he did for what for restraining a criminal The guy fucking died of fentanyl by the way we covered that in June of 2020 so That's 2020 yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why I'm man But I saw I did some math man because I know this motherfucker takes more vacations like I've been on one vacation the last fucking 12 years yeah one yeah, well, that's what I was doing some DJ math for yeah, so because do you guys remember all of the articles coming out about Trump golfing? Right Donald Trump's been almost a year playing golf during presidency, right? There's even a website that counts His total golf count, right and puts an inaccurate number of how much it actually costs the taxpayer 144 million dollars. Okay And I saw found this article cost 144 million dollars for Trump to play golf, but how many billions of dollars and how much damage has been done for the entire presidency of Joe Biden to be Joe Biden Yeah, they don't count that. Yeah, no, no website for that one But I found this article through as like Biden leaves DC as much as Trump did, but there's a difference Yeah, there's a difference they says This article says those trips were ones in which Biden stayed at the homes of donors his virgin island trip was to a home owned by donors Bill and Connie Naveel twice he stayed at Martha's Vineyard compound owned by billionaire David Rubenstein Now this is not an ideal situation certainly the president of the United States receiving favors from wealthy Allies for these trips make up only 24 of the 250 plus day Biden's been The question that should be asked isn't being asked. Hmm. What's he getting a return for those trips? What's he getting a return for those relationships? Andy didn't matter. It's only 24 days bro. It's just 24 days of the 250 plus days Right now I did some I did some add some some numbers here, all right and I have to check with E shine too, but we'll make sure these are good Okay, but according to the Republican national committee and this is just of as of August 18 Biden has spent 382 days Right that's 40% of his presidency. So 958 days when this article was written 382 that's 39.8% Now Trump Trump spent 388 days out of 461 days So that's 26% of the presidency for Trump. Yeah now we still got 103 days left of this presidency. I did some other math Biden's already ahead of vacation days. Do you do you think he's gonna spend the next 501 days straight working? No, oh, okay But you ain't gonna see no nothing about that, but here's here's one thing I thought was interesting the money did come out And they got the proof This head on reach coma raises questions about $200,000 direct payment from James Biden to Joe Biden in 2018 So House oversight chairman James Comer said his panel had uncovered evidence that Joe Biden in 2018 received a $200,000 direct payment from his brother James Biden and sister-in-law Sarah Biden and is demanding the president answer questions about financial arrangements with members of his family. Here's the video This summer Joe Biden said where's the money? What we found some We're still digging in the evidence subpoenaed from bank accounts belonging to Hunter Biden the son of president Joe Biden And James and Sarah Biden the brother and sister-in-law of the president A document that we're releasing today raises new questions about how president Biden personally benefited from his family shady influence peddling of his last name and their access to him Bank records obtained by the House Committee on oversight have revealed a $200,000 direct payment from James and Sarah Biden to Joe Biden in the form of a personal check Here's some important context about this check. We've obtained in our investigation In 2018 James Biden received $600,000 in loans from AmeriCorps A financially distressed and failing rural hospital operator According to bankruptcy court documents James Biden received these loans Quote based upon representations that his last name Biden Could open doors and that he could obtain a large investment from the Middle East Based on his political connections in quote On March 1st 2018 AmeriCorps wired a $200,000 loan into James and Sarah Biden's personal bank account not their business of bank account And then on the very same day James Biden wrote a $200,000 check from this same personal bank account To Joe Biden James Biden wrote this check to Joe Biden as a quote loan repayment AmeriCorps a distressed company loaned money to James Biden who then sent it to Joe Biden Even if this was a personal loan repayment, it's still troubling that Joe Biden's ability to be paid back by his brother Depended on the success of his family's shady financial dealings Some immediate questions present Biden misanswer for the American people Does he have documents proving he lent such a large sum of money to his brother And what were the terms of such financial agreement? Did he have similar financial agreements with other family members that led them to make similar large payments to him And did he know that the same day James Biden wrote him a check for $200,000 James Biden had just received a loan for the exact same amount from business dealings with a company that was in financial distress and failing The House oversight committee will soon announce our next investigative actions and continue to follow them And of course Let's not all there was there was also another part of it where Like five or six days after I could be wrong in the exact days But a few days after that text message where hunter Biden basically threatened them Joe Biden paid $2.7 million in cash for that beach house. He's at all the time Okay, and that was from China Yep, okay zero evidence of wrongdoing though. Yeah zero evidence These people are pieces of shit for stick for for for all they're doing dude They're intentionally destroying the country from this man Is in and his cohorts and his accomplices are intentionally destroying the United States of America For money for money for themselves think about that Because they couldn't make it think think think about that bro Think about your like dude think about how big of a piece of shit You have to be to sell your entire country down the fucking drain Make all of these decisions that are destroying it hurting everybody making everybody's lives difficult dividing everybody You know making the them you know feel scared frustrated anxious all the time at odds with their fellow citizen destroying people financially For money Like dude think about that this dude is a fucking cockroach Period and so is anybody that's fucking with them. Yeah, that's fucking disgusting man But you know and we've talked about this He deserves zero respect from people. No, no zero And we've talked about this and you know, I think it was right around the blood the black square time But when we're calling out, you know like like Cory Bush and you know these people The amount of money needed for them to be bought and paid for very little very very little yeah very little But the reason that they do these things and they join into politics is because outside of that These people couldn't do anything in the real world. No You couldn't make that money being an entrepreneur or being you know Even an entrepreneur like when that you can do that stuff. Yeah No, he has zero skills. There's nothing to rely on. Yeah, so this is this is the route that he's left to do and these people do it And that and and my belief is pretty much all of them do it There's very few of course they do that's why they cover for them because as it comes out It's it's it's going to show that they're all guilty and they're all implicated all you got to do is look at the people Who are trading on these defense Contractor stocks that are part of you know the Um the the military industrial complex people who are in those stocks or who just recently bought in the list is long Yep, you think they don't know what's about to happen and it's already these people are selling us down the drain for financial gain for themselves They do not give a single Fuck about us at all at all in fact they I think they laughed behind closed doors I think they laugh at every one of us who falls for every single one of these narratives every time I think I think they're sitting there be like look at these fucking idiots like all we got to do is this stuff and they fight each other like And it is what it is man until people get smarter. They're gonna continue to win Yeah, guys, let us know jumping on this conversation down in the comments Let us know what you guys think hashtag holy vacation Let us know what you think um, so with that being said, let's keep this cruise moving before we get to line number two Let's cruise the comments Got a good one for you Andy. This is uh this comments from uh two wheel separation anxiety 271 he says I went to a birthday party last Saturday and I was that guy in the best shape in the room Friends I haven't seen in months were like you look good Been listening to you guys and working hard since last December. Thanks for all you do That's what's up, man. You gotta lead by example That's what we talk about when we talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion all those friends That said you look good. There's at least two or three of them. They're like fuck. I need to look good too I need to get my shit together and right now they're considering how to do that. Okay. This is how it works This is how the ripple effects starts. This is how we change culture and what's happening in this country is not going to be survive or Solved by you know violence or doing some bullshit. They they have intentionally wrote the culture And because the culture has been eroded it's going to take a long time to fix We don't have strong men. We don't have strong leadership We don't have people to give a fuck and because of that we become slaves to their system All right, we eat their chemical filled food and because we eat their food we got to take their medicine We take their medicine and because we take their medicine we become dependent on them All right, when we talk about the information that we consume you know Look at how they culturally mold us to look at success and winning as some sort of Morally inferior quality your greedy your materialistic you're this you're that do you think that's an accident Why do that why for why for the first hundred and Maybe 200 years of this country was success celebrated why was it's called the American dream Why was it a thing that they taught us in school and then all the sudden they switch gears and taught you that all successful people Are greedy fucks and that you don't need anything other than you know the bare minimum I mean do we can look at the cultural conditioning right down to the commercials that they run on TV I saw commercial run on TV for some For some short term loan finance program this dudes at the check out counter of of his Getting groceries right and it's a dude and then there's a girl behind them with a cart full of groceries and this guy Is basically he comes up short he doesn't have the money to pay for his groceries So he's like taking stuff off the grocery bill right they said take off the broccoli take off the Hohoes or whatever right and the lady behind him says hey, you know, there's this fix to that if you go to this app I can't remember the name of it you can get $250 of cash right now Okay, and the guy fucking looks back He's like really and on the phone as he's checking out he gets the $250 in cash and he looks at the cashier He's like put the hohoes back on my on my thing and like winks at the little girl, okay? What are they conditioning you to do? They're conditioning you to value shitty food. They're conditioning you to be broke as if this is a normal thing You think it's normal for you to go to the grocery store and be short to can't even buy groceries That is not a normal thing, but they have conditioned us to see it as normal through their propaganda And once you start to see the propaganda you start to realize that it's everywhere Okay, there should be no like you there should be no reason and oh, but people don't get it They don't understand that propaganda exists everywhere especially in marketing So they're convincing you to accept a reality where you cannot even barely afford to eat And that's your place in the world and it's normal and by the way, it's so normal We have an app for that that can solve it and by the way the woman behind it. She has the same problem What is that condition people to think that conditions people to think man? Okay, I don't have shit But they don't have shit either So it's okay that we don't all have shit and that creates a mass Situation of dependency on the government like this is bro. This is not what like if you want to ran that ad 30 years ago People would be like what the fuck Like dude, but we see it every day Look how they make become numb to it. No, we think it's normal and that's the point It is not normal these people Tax us and oppress us financially and miseducate us and steal from us in a way to where we can barely survive And because we can barely survive it's hard for us to notice what bullshit they're pulling on us It's intentional and it's way deeper than people think it's not just propaganda about A war or about a covid or about a thing. It's bro. It's it's if you pay attention. It's everything they fucking tell us It's okay for blackrock to have 12 trillion dollars in assets or whatever fuck they got but you can't afford to get your groceries the point where you can't choose between broccoli or Hoes and by the way when you dig when you can't choose it you choose the hoes. You think that's a coincidence. Yeah Talking sick man. No dude. It's everywhere. It's everywhere people just aren't paying attention because they've been conditioned to believe it's normal So be abnormal. Yeah be the standard be the example for people to look at and say I can do this. I can be better This is what I talk about when I talk about this concept of personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion If we want culture to change we have to be the example of what it looks like of the changing so that other people will come along with us We have to live it not just talk about it And so so good job to you brother for doing it That's fucking awesome guys as always thank you guys for being real ass fans keep like can keep commenting keep subscribing Make sure you guys are supporting the message and not being hoes out there So let's get back to it headline number two headline number two reads Trump find $5,000 for violating gag order as a judge threatens jail for future violations Getting a little steamy in New York. Yeah, so a state judged fine Donald Trump $5,000 Friday after finding that the former president's campaign website continued to display a social media post attacking the judge's law clerk In violation of a gag order imposed by the judge earlier this month Justice Arthur and Goren who also indicated that he would consider jailing Trump for future violations of the gag order In Goren who is overseeing a $250 million civil fraud trial against Trump And his business empire issued a gag order on October 3rd after Trump used his truth social platform to attack And Goren's principal law clerk Trump quickly took down the post from truth social that day, but it remained on his campaign site until Thursday night And Goren wrote a two-page order that while Trump's lawyers had called the violation of the gag order Quote in a verton The effect of the post on its subject is unmitigated by how or why it remained on Donald Trump's website for 17 days So this is from the actual reading or order from the judge Um, it goes through it I'm saying like quote despite this clear order last night I learned that the subject defending post was never removed from the website Donald J. Trump calm and in fact had been on that website for the past 17 days I understand it was removed late last night But only in response to an email from this court today an open court councilful Donald Trump stated that the violation of the gag order was in a verton And was an unfortunate part of the process that is built into the campaign structure Giving defendant the benefit of the doubt. He still violated the gag order goes on to cite some legal Schmigel saying that uh given the defendant's position the that the violation was in a verton and given that it is a first-time violation the court will impose a nominal fee $5,000 payable to the New York lawyers fund for client protection within 10 days of the date of this order um and He concludes by saying make no mistake Future violations whether intentional or unintentional will subject the violated to far more severe sanctions Which may include but are not limited to steeper financial penalties holding Donald Trump and contempt of court And possibly imprisoning him pursuant to New York judiciary law 753 now. This is the post That that pistol mall off right so judicial protests put this out. That's a picture of Ingoreance principal awkward Allison Greenfield Palling around with Chuck Schumer There was rumors that these who were dated and then Trump used that to push out saying basically this was an inside job That was being done And that's not the only place that the direct gag orders in place we talked about this on a more more recent show also but um He's also on a gag order in the DC trial anywhere we got on this I think all these people who are doing this shit are Are walking on very thin ice. I think I think this is egregious. I think it's appalling. I think it's disgusting I think That once this all gets sorted out. It's a very important to remember who was willing to lie cheat and steal To get their narrative pushed through and all of those people should be held accountable to the highest degree all of them You know every single one of them, you know Anybody who was willing to lie or manipulate or and this is going to be a big undertaking But the reality is is um This is absurd. It's absurd shit You clearly have a woman Like he like Trump said howling around who's supposed to be Nonpartisan in a in a in a justice is blind you know the statue of you know of the liberty where the fucking scale the scales are on there and she's blindfolded Clearly that's not the case here and What I see happening is the exposing of how corrupt everything is actually actually is So I don't know man So when you hear the state I mean I look at this fucking woman look how fucking like like These people piss me to fuck off bro like even just fucking looking at him like looking at and by the way I don't give a fuck what you think Like these are the people who are like We need a reckoning in this country Well the president has definitely been set for that so yeah that that's the only like to me That's a silver lining right like and it sucks But I feel like everything these people have done all they have done was set the precedence for the same thing to happen to them Yeah, but it's gonna be worse but ten times it's gonna be worse because these people have disrupted people's lives in a way You know a lot of this is fake Okay, a lot of the support for these these progressive initiatives is bots And they've been tried they've been counting on bots and fake accounts to hold it up And what people are realizing is that not very many people out here in the real world Actually agree with any of this shit that's happening even the Democrats even people who voted for Biden are now like holy shit Our republic is crumbling and this is very dangerous And I don't want to be associated with this when the backlash occurs And so these people who are continuing to push this shit who think they're in the right They're in very dangerous territory because the backlash is gonna be very severe You know very severe and there's not a single time in history ever Where the backlash hasn't come It always comes and these people are walking around with the fucking fat ass fucking faces and their smiles and their you know I hate everything about Trump Bro even the tech billionaires and and San Francisco are coming out saying yeah We fell for the tuck Trump derangement syndrome You know you might not like the messenger But he fucking did a good job and we can see now because it's affecting our businesses And like there's still people marching around thinking it's four years ago where it's cool to like hate everything about this dude Not understanding that like bro the backlash of what's about to happen is welling up And you're gonna be right in the fucking crosshairs of it when it comes back So people aren't gonna continue to take this dude. No, they're not gonna continue to take this no And hopefully the transit there can be a transition of power without violence But the more and more I watch the smugness of these people and like how brazen they are and how much they they believe that like nothing's going to happen to them Confident they are yeah the more I've real lot the more I believe that the there's going to be violence That's the scary part for me is like the they're shoving it down our fucking brothers that they have like how sure and certain that they are That's the only thing that gets me man It makes me just like Remember you know when when they When they hung that dude from your Romania and his wife or shot him You know up until they killed him. He was barking orders at him Nikolai Chuchesky that's a that's a video man These these people they're bringing them out to execute them and they were arguing they were telling the people to stand down And know it these people are delusional and they're so fucking mentally warped that they don't care how much damp Bro, these people don't care that they're about to start a world war because they don't like one single dude And what do they not like about them? They don't like his fucking tweets They don't here's what they don't like they don't like that. They're fucking wrong That's a fact they've built their identity and anti-Trump and now they don't want to like abandon it and that's gonna end up like dude Honestly and yeah, I'm just saying I believe it's gonna end up cost a lot of these people their lives People aren't gonna continue to take this like the pressure They're not gonna continue to take the division. They're not gonna continue to take the the frustration They're not gonna continue to take the anxiety. They're not gonna continue to take the disruption to their lives The fucking punishing of the like the financial hardship they're being put through for this case And the more they put these people through it the more support this man is getting So like put him in jail and see what happens bro You're gonna fucking create a whore a hornet's nest that you're not gonna be able to deal with Yeah, pardon me that's what my film with Trump like bro like Welcome yeah, I just stopped showing up the court. I just keep doing what the fuck you do and make him come get you Because who's gonna do it? Yeah That's what I would like to see honestly. Well, I think he's still holding on I think he's still trying to preserve the system at some way shape or form. Yeah, that's noble But I don't think it's needed right now. I don't know. I don't know. I he knows more than us. Yeah, just remember that he knows a lot more than us So it's true. We don't actually know we're speculating here But I can tell you this People aren't gonna continue to be punished by these dudes like Schumer with this big fucking stupid grin on his face And these people smile and they and they they fucking their smug and like bro people are starting to hate him Hate him Because they're feeling the pain So they come out why do these people hate him? Yeah, no, they fucking hate you because they're tired of you fucking with them Yeah And that's gonna go for any class or group by the way So just remember all of you have been fucking with people for a long time that your day is coming you better stop That's what shit man guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments hashtag. I said silence That's what you guys think but let's get on to our third and final headline headline number three. I don't know three reads This is a win This is a win right amongst all of the distraction going on. There's still some some solid wins that are happening So headline number three reads Supreme court to the side of Biden and admin illegally bullied social media into censoring content It's a big win right from the state of Missouri This Supreme Court will determine whether the Biden administration violated the constitution when it pressured tech companies to remove From their platforms with federal officials said was false or misleading content about the 2020 election and COVID-19 in an order Friday afternoon The justices agreed to hear the Biden administration's challenge to a lower court A quarter order blocking it from urging social media companies to remove certain content that the White House claimed was misinformation around COVID-19 vaccines Hunter Biden's laptop and the contest at 2020 election results In taking the case the justices also blocked the lower courts and junction Which have been set to kick in within minutes and would have barred many types of contact between federal officials And the social media giants the high courts actions means the administration officials can keep contacting social media companies for now While the justices weigh the case both the conservative district judge and an appellate court had largely sided with the lawsuit from GOP attorneys General's a Missouri and Louisiana that accused the administration of violating the first amendment by co-horcing Social media platforms to take down the content the administration doesn't like Three conservative justices Samuel Lelito Clantz Thomas and Neil Gorsuch Decented from the decision to block the injunction joining in a five-page opinion by Lelito that called the courts actions Quote highly disturbing and said it threatened to curtail the discussion of unpopular political views online Quote at this time in the history of our country What the court has done I fear will be seen by some as giving the government a green light to use heavy handed tactics to skew The presentation of views on the medium that increasingly dominates the dissemination of news that Lelito wrote Quote that is most unfortunate Um, so what's up there? It's in the Supreme Court the White House did not immediately respond to a request or comment Adjust this department spokesperson to cliente comment everybody's quiet Senator Eric Schmidt the previous Missouri AG who originally filed the case in 2022 called it quote one of the most important free speech cases In the generation no now in a generation history. No Anyway, we got on this um Well, both those gentlemen have been on our show Andrew Bailey and Eric Schmidt and they're the ones pressing this case So that's cool I mean look dude These people censored information that got people killed Okay, when when when people were talking about Iver Mecton and people were talking about hydroxychloroquine And they were mentioning effective therapeutics They people were being displatformed for that it was in license. Yeah, they were losing their medical license They were being arrested like one of those women from the frontline doctor group that said hey We got a solution here that they won't let us talk about was put in jail for 60 days All right, and why wouldn't they let people talk about it because the reason they wouldn't let people talk about it is because if there was an effective therapeutic solution They couldn't maintain a state of emergency which allowed them to do all the shit they were doing All right, so they couldn't allow any of the effect of therapeutics to be talked about even though they knew they were talked about And as a result lots of people died Okay, and this this you know, this is the same thing with hunter-by-the-laptop You know all of this shit that we're talking about today about Joe Biden taking money from China and this $200,000 or the two point seven million dollars and it's been on the how all that stuff was on the hunter-by-the-laptop That came out pre-2020 election and it was it was meant it was it was fabricated into this conspiracy theory which it wasn't And if you talked about it you lost your account you got censored you got your your platform taken away and You know You got put on domestic terrorist watchlist, okay, why? Why did that happen? Wouldn't you have liked to know those things before you voted for Joe Biden? Well, because what what would have known in those things would have made me do Andy would have made you vote somewhere other other way Okay, or you know that that that these are crimes listening. Oh, man These are crimes against humanity. This is treasonous activity. This is not you know like bro They made up the Russia Steal dossier they made it up they made it up it was fabricated out of thin air and for seven years The country was turned upside down over this Why ask yourself why? Why is it that important that we keep this man out of office? Why is it that important? The answer is very obviously they cannot have someone who's not part of their their incestuous intermingling of Backdoor deals running this country because that person's gonna say hey this ain't happening anymore and fuck up all their shit And then by the way he's gonna find all the criminal activity that they did the entire time which is being exposed now, okay? So This is It's it's insane. It's insane our government is a rogue government these people are not operating with our intentions in mind There's a whole bunch of people who have committed treason that need to be held accountable And in my opinion, this is the greatest crimes against humanity. It's ever been orchestrated in the history of mankind because it's been global It wasn't it wasn't just one little area. It was a global Conspiracy to execute. Yeah, do most people don't even like how much money was like that's why the like that's where it all started A lot of money that we've lost like it was all transferred during this time billions Dude, there's so much here. It would be impossible to cover at all because it's just it starts with COVID and it keeps going and keeps going and keeps going Actually, it starts with the Russian dossier the steel dossier You're talking about like 2015. Yeah, and then it keeps going and it keeps going and it keeps going And the question should be why do these people Do this and why are they doing it? They're not doing it for the peace and prosperity of the American citizens They're not doing it to protect us. They're doing it to protect themselves And you guys that continue to support this you're at a point now where you're becoming complicit in this problem Like at the very least you should be able to say man, I fucked up I bought it hook line and sinker and I'm not with it anymore Where we do now guys? Yeah, right exactly And so like dude, this is this is unprecedented. It's very real and You know this free speech case is a lot bigger than what people realize because dude the only reason they've been able to do what they've done In terms of the you know, we live in a time where the biggest Most complicated most powerful propaganda machine in the world has been turned On the American citizens and the citizens of humanity at the hands of the government.

They don't care They've turned this weapon against our own the citizens of humanity for their own profit and protection of their backdoor deals And and dude, this is a real thing And so like you know, you got to remember Social media didn't exist 20 fucking years ago You know, the internet was just a little baby Like this was the first time they ever got to really unlock this weapon and somewhere between 2000 and 2020 they figured out hey we could use this weapon to turn it on our people and get all this shit for ourselves and fuck them And they decided it was a good idea to do it based on the idea of depopulation It's incredible dude. It's it's incredible shit of what's happened and it's not this isn't This isn't You know, oh these guys did a couple things and we should look the other way. No, this is the most important The most severe crimes against humanity.
