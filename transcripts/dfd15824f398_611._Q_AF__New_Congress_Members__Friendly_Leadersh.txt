show okay we get throttle we talk about uncomfortable topics we make light of uncomfortable topics and we get throttle for that we get shadow man for that and we really rely on you guys to share the show so don't be a hoe sure the show all right this up I feel like time is just flying right did you feel that way well because I do I got look up and it's for like two weeks out from Christmas like I feel like things are just like time is just going by quick and like it made me think like did you ever believe in that that saying that you know time flies when you having fun is that like a real thing for you man time always feel like I honestly yeah I have so much going on at all the time that it always feels that way whether it's fun or not yeah you know I guess that's good because even when she gets hard it goes fast because I've got so much going on but I think there's truth to that you know it's always like you're the best party or the best day or the best event and all of a sudden it's over it's over yeah so I think that there's a lot of truth to that yeah I just feel like there's some time years just gone by fast man I will you're you're coming up on 25 years it's a big big that's a big milestone yeah 25 years and a quarter of a century yeah in business like that same business it's crazy the same industry right yeah it definitely you know I was thinking about this you know what's cool about business that is different from being an athlete right like I grew up wanting to be an entertainer an athlete and I was a decent athlete I probably could have grinded out a division one college career I wouldn't have been a star but that would have been it okay my brother was much more athletic than me he could have been he could have been a star playing pro baseball how do you not have his injury but one of the things that I really think about when I think about business and entrepreneurship that I think is cool is that you know how like as you become an athlete the older you get the worst you get but in business the older you get the better you get because you accumulate more and more skills more and more knowledge you have the ability to observe experiences and you can recognize them at later date the intuition grows your ability to perceive things grows and like really you just become a much more form formable weapon of an entrepreneur the longer you do it yeah so like you know yeah I just say that that existence sports but there is definitely like this cap this like there's a limit there's a physical limitation how long you can go with it right well okay for like a coach right there's a reason why most of the great coaches are 60 years old yeah it's because they fucking see everything every fucking play every technique yeah so like there's I like that about business you know when I look at business and I look at what what what we've accomplished in business um you know it's it's incredible it really is like and I'm not saying that to brag I'm saying that as a as a matter of fact you know it's it's an incredible achievement I think at 44 years old I've achieved more than what most entrepreneurs would ever achieve an entire career yeah um but but I don't hang my hat on that at all I don't walk around I don't think man to me I'm I still feel 25 and I'm just excited to have all that experience and knowledge so what can I do for the next 25 years you know what I'm saying and that's kind of like that's how I look at it so you know it's it has gone fast it's like that like what you said about uh the having fun like Tom Flazzon yeah it hasn't always been fun yeah but there has been a lot of fun you know some of my best friends in the world even people that you know we're part of the company at one time that are no longer a part that I'm still really good friends with and they're out building things and doing things there it's just been a very rewarding experience all in all even though it's been very difficult uh it's never been easy ever but it's been rewarding and I think that's a universal truth or law to most things that are hard most things that are hard are rewarding you know and so it falls right in line with everybody thinks um but honestly like other than it being 25 years it just feels like another opportunity to get better man yeah I love it I'm just wired that way yeah I just think it's cool man because like I mean you don't like I mean again like I'm not the entrepreneur right but like just looking at a couple like 25 years in business like but that's a lot that's a lot of years man it's a lot of years and so yeah people now that's our first form now first form is founded 2009 right so we're what 19 14 years old right almost 15 years old first form uh s2 is 25 years old 25 years old yeah um that's pretty cool yeah I mean that's what I mean and then like and and to see like where it is today versus where it was 25 years ago yeah I mean look man the first three years we spent fucking sleeping in the back of the store on and off on a fucking mattress that we got from salvation army dude had a fucking piss stain on it like Chris and I lay on that motherfucker together two big ass fucking young men that aren't gay you know what I'm saying like that would be normal yeah like you know uh it was it was it was I mean look man the whole story is crazy and in one day we'll do a whole podcast telling the whole story but the reality of it is is like yeah it's been a fucking battle bro and it's been a journey I met a lot of cool people of you know I had a lot of really cool experiences had a lot of really hard times um had a lot of big wins uh but when I look back you know I'm where I'm at in life and I acknowledge you know the legitimate accomplishes accomplishments that I've had I'm like if something were to happen to me tomorrow I feel like I've done some shit yeah you know what I'm saying like substance there yeah and and and I'm not saying what I'm about to say to brag but like I've created two number one podcasts and different formats okay um I've built a company that's worth 10 figures I've built a company that's worth nine figures I've built a number of companies that do eight figures um and I have a bunch more that are in the seven figure that are going to soon be eight nine figure businesses so like I've done some real shit and then you throw 75 hard on top of that which is pretty much the as far as to my knowledge the world's biggest ever in history mental recalibration program you know that's free yeah and so when I think of the number of impact the people impacted and careers built and all that stuff at being 44 years old that makes me proud yeah and it's also one of the reasons I get so upset with like some of the entrepreneur culture that's going around you know um those rewards and that gratitude and those accomplishments don't come from something that you do for six weeks or a few months or some bullshit course that you buy you know it's a lifetime commitment and I'm even thinking 25 years no bro listen man don't look there's a lot to unpack there but all in all man I'm grateful to be here I'm grateful to be where I'm at um I'm proud of the work that we do on real AF in regards to what's important with culture and the country and the social environment I feel like you know I feel like if something were to happen to me like you guys shouldn't be sad you should be like well he fucking maximizes time and I feel I feel I feel that way you know you know like I do feel that way and hopefully nothing happens to me but uh you know I'm excited where we're going from here because when I look out here and I see all these young people and I see all these people um you know growing their careers and helping people and doing things that are positive and culture and society being a good example of a great human being that look out at all our podcast listeners who are like you know maybe thinking that you know living a free life was more so I do whatever I want and now looking at it like a free life means I have an obligation to make the environment good for the people becoming coming behind us and the people who have sacrificed like when I see everybody kind of doing the thing now versus where we were even five six years ago you know it's cool yeah it's cool I think we got a lot of work to do though I'm excited to do it yeah that's a fact man yeah well guys Andy I got three guiltments for you let's uh let's knock these out Andy guys question number one Andy um a lot of members of Congress are leaving recently and this is opening a lot of a lot of doors for a lot of new members um what do you think will be the change that happens in Congress like will it be more gen X in the lineals entering Congress and finally putting this country on the right path like what do you what do you see the landscape changing too I am not sure but if what I actually believe is I think a lot of these people are resigning because they're realizing that the old ways of doing things are over you know the the establishment Republicans are getting very frustrated with the you know the quote unquote madda Republicans which reality I don't think that I think that's a that's an intentionally negative label that they try to put on these people when in reality these are just pro freedom people that like want a more uh a less corrupt government without without all these backdoor deals I don't think it has very much to do with Trump I think it has more to do with what this country is actually supposed to be I think these a lot of these people are patriots I think a lot of these people coming in now are not going to allow the uh establishment backdoor traditional deals to be made um I could be wrong but I think what's happening is a lot of these people are recognizing that and they're like shit dude I'm gonna lose this and I'm gonna end up getting hung up on it in some sort of congressional inquiry or you know and so they're they're they're fucking bouncing before and shit it's weird you know what I mean even though that won't save them no it won't but you know I think that you know when you look at everybody else that's got it that's coming in and you're you're like let's say you're let's say dude like okay in the beginning you know you're looking around and there's 500 other people who are of like mind you know yes they're Democrat yes they're Republican but we all know how it works how it works is I do deals on the side you guys do deals on the side we don't tell on each other we all get rich and we sort of work together and then we pretend not to yeah and that's kind of the deal we'll solve some of the shit yeah and then they go play golf and go to dinner and be rich fucks right and what I see happening is like you see a guy like Matt Gates come in right or even some of these other these other older guys who are speaking up Jim Jordan yes the patriotic Americans are starting to say no we're not doing this and I'm not going to do this thing either and I think what they're seeing is like you know at first those corrupt people are all looking and they're like oh yeah there's two of those guys they're not with us you know fuck them right but then there's eight of them then there's 10 of them now there's 30 of them and everybody's like oh shit then they look at the polls and they look at the culture and they see how much the average American is how frustrated they are with the system and the government and what's been going on in the world and I think they're seeing the fact that like their days are numbered in terms of being able to operate with no consequences and just rob us blind and do things that are hard for us so that's I'm not sure but that's how I'm reading the situation I think a lot of these people are starting to realize like oh shit there's more of them this time oh there's more there's more coming and then they look out on the local election landscape and they're like these are the only people winning elections there are only people winning school boards there's only people winning state elections and they see what's coming yep you know I mean what do you say to the to the average American citizen that you know maybe listen to this for the show right now you know but you know I mean what do you think dude no I agree with that that consensus I think a lot of I mean there's a lot of them that are leaving out dropping out and retiring yeah I'm trying to get out of here and you know go live off of all the stock trades that they've made and I think that's wrong but I don't think it's gonna save them I think the sweeps coming for sure but but I look at you know my my thing is like I'm I feel for you know the average American that's like I said listen to this show I've always been one that says like you know if you see something wrong fix it right like if it's in your means do something about it right is that a practical thing like do you think because I feel like we need it more now than ever right we need more average Americans getting into these systems getting into Congress and fixing the problems that we all know is wrong how practical is that well it's always harder when people are having a harder time surviving yeah right um and right now people are having a harder time surviving so it's very hard for people to want to do more than what they're already doing when that's taking all they got just to pay their bills and keep the lights on yeah and that's intentional all right so that's an intentional strategy to keep the common man out of these situations uh and what what does that leave that leaves these situations open to people who are not actually contributing are not actually building are not creating don't have any real responsibility and they're able to just kind of like do whatever they want life and if we look at the school boards and we look at the county boards and we look at these these small local governments across the country you know this has been the case you know we have a bunch of people who are not patriotic who do not actually care about our constitution who don't care about right and wrong who are not contributing members of society they're not doing anything productive and they've taken over these little local governments and you know I think over the last four years a lot of that's been taken back and uh but I think a lot more has to happen and so we talk about practicality you know your first and foremost responsibility is to be an excellent human being in all regards you know fit healthy intelligent high earning as much as possible taking care of your family and and to conquer that and then you know the second phase of that responsibility will be to get involved in your local situations when you can you know a lot of change culturally can happen just from that so um you know what we really need is we need like for example you know I don't make money doing this show I don't get fucking ad revenue I don't take ads but one of the reasons I do this shows because I feel called to do it and speak out in front of an audience of millions of people over the course of a month from a standpoint of service like hey these are the things that we need to work on and so like I've found myself in this sort of like conductor seat like over here over here over here and I think people just have to look at it what can they do in their own little communities you know I don't I don't think everybody needs to go run for president or run for senator or run for congress united states congress or anything but if you can you know what I'm saying um but I think all of you can participate in your local school board meetings I think most of you can participate in your county meetings your town meetings your community and I think over the course of time Americans have just gotten away from that and they have lost the understanding that those things are important and valuable to our our our communities in our culture and while they took the eye off the ball those places were we're overrun with far leftists and communist yeah disgusting shit who you know we've seen these clips all over the internet for years and years and years of you know people in a school board you know like that loud and county stuff that happened where that that 17 year old boy who was dressed and as a girl was in the girl's restroom raped one of the girls and then the dad freaks out and they fucking arrested that and the school boards up there were like trying to like say that guy has rights that no he doesn't have fucking rights and the reality is dude to another thing I saw a video this morning um on the internet it was like a recap remember we covered that story about the uh 50 year old man swimming in the pool with 13 year old girls yeah well he did it again okay and there was another video of this and there's like this camera guy and he's like harassing this guy right he's like why are you doing this why are you doing this why are you doing this and at the end the guy goes who's gonna protect me from these people like the demand who's swimming with the kids look bro I don't here's what I don't understand I don't understand how this how parents of these girls are allowing this to happen like where are the men you know what I'm saying like dude 20 years ago 10 years ago like if there was a pedophile in your neighborhood he just kind of went away right like nobody knows where Jeff move that's right he just went away yeah like dude parents can solve this shit they're just not solving it men can solve this shit they're just not solving it and I can tell you this if I had a girl and she was 13 and there was a 50 year old man in there while she's changing that dude would be in a fucking hole like the next day yeah COVID yes whatever I don't care look bro I need to care if I go jail for it I need to care yes and in this wave in a camera and they're fucking face and she ain't gonna get it done motherfucker was the point is we're trying to keep these people feel entitled to our fucking children period yep if a grown man is going to say he's a trans aged 13 year old girl who is changing in a girl's restroom competing in a girls event and none of the men in the neighborhood are gonna do anything like what the fuck is going on yeah no bro every single one of those dads is a fucking bitch real talk that's real talk like if your daughter was involved in that and you didn't do shit bro bro I can't understand it they have it hold on right let me call let me put him on camp no the things you do to people like that you do not put on camera right exactly holy fuck yeah thanks yeah man oh yeah bro we have a pedophilia problem in our culture it's real it's not bullshit it's not conspiracy it's not this or that we have a culture that is legitimately chosen to be in parade on it's not only that bro the communist insurgency in our country is trying to remove all boundaries this already happened it happened in the vimar republic in 1930s Germany I've been saying this for years and years and years okay this and then when these people are finally handled they're gonna write the history books like it was unjust you know I'm saying like these people are fucking little kids bro they're your kids and they're trying we see it in Spain we see in Europe we see people of parliament and government saying that children should decide if they can if they want to have sex with with an adult it's their decision like you understand like they're trying to make laws to protect it head of failure is a fucking legitimate mainstream thing that hides under the surface okay like when you go to the grocery store there's pedophiles in the grocery store like a lot of them yeah okay and it's so rampant and it's so big that and nobody wants to say you know uh hey I'm a pedophile right I didn't want to fucking say that in public but their actions are all in defense of these kinds of people right they're they're we're seeing that we're seeing people call them minor attracted people we're seeing people justify pedophilia in literal college classrooms we're seeing entire groups of people like allow these people into their groups like dude this is fucking wrong okay and until we address this problem as a real problem and how and how big it is we have members of government who allegedly have been involved with a dude for years and years and years who was engaged with child sex trafficking and shit you see what I'm saying right listen dude I think it's way bigger of a problem than people think I think it's way bigger of a problem than people think I think people when they traditionally think about pedophilia they think of it like okay yeah it's that one weird guy down the street you know that looks like a pedophile but I actually don't think that's what the problem is I think there's a whole bunch of people that are all connected in some way that are legitimately fucking trying to normalize it globally why would they normalize them because they know they're gonna get caught and if they can normalize it before they get caught they won't be held accountable the way that we would normally hold them accountable that's what I think you know that's why I observe yeah yeah I mean dude the guy who busted that pizza gate conspiracy just got fucking brought up with child porn exactly you know he's the one that debunked pizza gate being a real thing and then all of a sudden he's proving to be a pedophile so like dude we as Americans need to take a fucking hard stance and draw a hard line in the sand and what's gonna be tolerated and I'm gonna tell you this pedophiles go in the woodchipper bro yeah no that's it real shit that's the line the line is if you fuck with people's kids you go in the woodchipper and we should legitimately consider like making public examples of these people meaning like torturing them and fucking unaliving them in public yeah so the people understand why we don't do these things there should be zero tolerance for this no zero zero zero sympathy I don't give a fuck why you do that I don't care what what happened to you when you were a kid I don't give a shit like we got this victim mentality now where it's like oh well he's mentally distressed I don't care not know that into the woodchipper yeah we'll solve your problem he's not mentally disturbed anymore and by the way his mental his mental disturbance is not disturbing any of us exactly okay like so we have to start talking about this in real terms these people are not gonna stop they're not gonna quit it's being like encouraged at some levels and it's a big fucking problem dude yeah no it is man it is well guys any question number two Andy I'm the 26 year old young man and was recently beat out of a sales manager position by my team counterpart my director told me that a contributing factor was that I am definitely a leader but need to learn to not lead with friendliness and your opinion is it bad to be a leader whose team looks at them as both a friend and their leader and if so do I work on being less friendly as I continue to pursue my career and leadership going forward this is a delicate situation I think a lot of people struggle with when it comes leadership I think people have a hard time drawing the boundary between friendship and leadership and a lot of people try to like draw the solution to this saying like oh we're outside the office so we're gonna be friends now or we're that's not where the boundary should be drawn like the boundary should be like look bro you and I are friends right okay boys okay but when I tell you some fucking real shit do you know I'm talking about some real shit absolutely okay there's an understanding there switch there's an understanding of where the line is okay and all until I have to enforce the line we're fucking friends because I treat you with respect and as a grown man to do your shit and handle your shit until that line is crossed and you everybody in this building knows when that line is crossed immediately and then I will say hey don't fucking do that and then five minutes later we're friends again right like it's not there's no like they're it's communication man it's like what we talked about a couple weeks ago it's being directly to your communication it's being comfortable saying exactly what's going on and meaning it and uh and then now holding grudges and now you know I think a lot of people when it comes to this friendship leadership thing I think they look at it like they look at it in the extremes they look at it like well I'm the leader I can't be their friend and bro your people that your people don't somewhat like you they're not gonna go to war for you bro right okay secondly there's people who think I have to be the friend to be the leader those people get walked all over they can't leave with a fuck so you have to find a balance there to be an effective leader and the effective leadership is hey man yeah I'm being hard on you because I give a fuck about you okay I want you to fucking win I want you to move into a bigger house and be able to pay for your kids private school and right now you're fucking up that line yeah okay so this is what I'm telling you this and then we have a conversation and then two minutes later hey you want to smoke cigar right you know what I'm saying like it's it's it's like that and so like there's a there's a nuance and a balance to it and the reality is is all the people I see talking about it online they don't lead anybody like bro like like you got like these little Instagram videos that people talk about leadership they don't even have employees are they have two okay if you if you've let a group of people and you've been effective at leading them and you have accomplished things with them I will listen to what you have to say you know you know that's why football coaches are good to listen to because they're able to coordinate a large number of many different personalities for many different backgrounds and many different life perspectives and get them to operate as a unit to accomplish something which in football is to win a game or win as a championship yeah and uh you know we see all these guys on the internet giving these leadership then well how many people have they actually led oh I got my I got my personal brand team well that's fucking six people yeah you know what I'm saying you know what real leading is is when you've got people that you can like orchestrate orchestrate like a symphony you guys this you guys that and if you do this and these guys do that we can win make us a fucking yes so like it's we have a lot of bad information about leadership out here you know one of the guys I like that I think gives a great presents himself as a great leader and I think is a great leader is uh Jaco okay I think Jaco has a lot of great shit to say about leadership I think he's a tremendous leader to about accomplish and manage missions not exactly yeah where the consequences were if you fucked up it's not like they lost money people fucking died exactly okay so that's real leadership okay and I think we need to be real careful about whose opinions we take about leadership we have to ask ourselves like has this person run a team how many people were on the team what did they accomplish did they win as a team or did they lose as a team just these fucking videos that keeps scroll like these people like there's so many people on the internet now they're saying all the companies I invest in which ones are they all the companies I run which ones are they yeah let's first see in some shit let's see your building let's see your customers let's where can we order your product where can we test out if you are actually living by the principles that you're speaking about on your little fucking Instagram reels okay where do you understand absolutely so like there's so much shit out here that we have a lot of people that are really confused about what good leadership looks like and this ruins them because they're listening to people that have never read and never won leading so in my opinion leadership coming down to be an effective leader has to do a lot with intent all right meaning do you do you I bet every single person in this building knows that I want them to win I believe they know that I want them to progress and be better and earn more money and build their career I bet they know it okay and that's a fundamental quality for you to have in your team make sure they trust you make sure they know that the best interest of them is in your heart and that's what you're trying and if you can instill that level from the beginning you have far less problems because everybody knows okay look yeah he might be saying it this way but he's saying it this way because he gives a fuck all right and so like we have all these other people who overanalyze you know and like I said they end up being a total dick and they can't get the respect to their team or they are totally soft and they get run over and they're ineffective and really the truth is is somewhere in the middle is where you want to be you want to be someone who's respected who your team knows that you care about them who is also driven and that they trust will take the mission and accomplish the mission and you know there's a lot to that like leadership we could have a whole entire podcast on leadership and come in here every day talking about a different aspect of leadership but to get back to you know the question hand it sounds like you're walked all over that's what I think your boss is saying what I think your boss is telling you is that you're allowing your team people like you but you're not as effective as you could be if you were a little bit harder in terms of enforcing the standard holding the line yes yeah yeah because that's what I was going to follow okay like who who speaking more on this like like like when that when that is a situation is that more of a sign that okay you just have bad followers right like there's bad people you know maybe they're just pieces of shit that like to take advantage and like don't respect that or is that more of like that no let me ask you something hold on if you have if you have a team and you're the leader of the team and the team isn't able to perform and you're in charge of who's on the team who's fault is it that they're not performing sure yeah yeah okay so that's my fault if I have a team it's not performing then there's one of a couple things that could be happening and one of them could be that they suck one of them could be that they're overwhelmed one of them could be they don't believe one of them kid they don't believe in me they don't believe in the mission one could be they've been paid too much so they're unmotivated one could be you know there could be a fucking million things that could be that could be doing it but ultimately the reality of leadership is this you have a mission you have to get everybody to orchestrate and work together as a team to accomplish the mission and the only way to do that is to do so in a in a way that um you know your team knows that you care about them but they also know that you're not going to be walked over and the more that you're not walked over the more they respect you which the better they perform so like you know I there's just so much to it dude you know I think and there's an art to it too there's a nuance there's a feeling like I can generally feel when there's some fucking shit got wrong in the team and a lot of this experience like how long about earlier yeah like how long have you been leading like in the beginning of the game dude like yeah it feels weird to to balance that dynamic between friends and team but real shit like I don't even think about that like that doesn't even come into my mind yeah well I mean I think to your point two though like I mean Nick Sabin wasn't Nick Sabin day one right like like all of his his skills as a leader he I'm sure he didn't have that day one as his first day as a head coach right like that stuff has to be developed yeah you know it's gonna take time yeah but dude like if you're if you're leading a team okay and you're you're trying to find this balance between you know they're my too hard and my too soft and my friends well what's your definition of friendship because my definition of friendship if I actually care about you is I want the best for you I want you to win I want you to develop I want you to make more money I want you to be the best that you can be that's the kind of friends I have I don't have many friends in my life that are like that you know and a lot of people interpret friends is like always nice always laughing always having a good time fucking around you ain't got to touch the line right right right yeah and that's not a friend yeah that's not a fucking friend bro your friends will force you to win and they will help you win and they will call you out when you're being a fucking bitch yeah okay so like I personally believe and this is I think what makes me an effective leader and I'm statistically very effective my track record speaks for itself is the fact that I actually believe in my heart that being a good friend means holding people accountable that's what I believe like if I saw one of my friends fucking off you know this better than anybody yep if I saw one of my friends live in below what the I'll say it has hey bro the fuck you doing man that say how it should be it should be like this and you know better yep that's the kind of friend I am like bro that's why I don't have any friends because most people are too fucking pussy to be friends with me yeah because I fucking straight up tell you bro and you know what that's why I live in a high standard because they can never turn around and say that shit to me you know what I'm saying so that's another aspect of being a great leader is living at the highest standard possible in all areas because that way when you that's a big problem see we can unpack all the shit is about to you can't correct something you listen listen bro there's so many leaders out here that are fucking fat lazy incapable of doing the job that they ask of their team and then they're like well I should be a leader because I'm a leader and it says so on my paycheck that I'm the leader that doesn't make a leader bro no you know what I'm saying leading makes you a leader so you know there's all kinds of things like are you like what's your physical state what's your mental state what do you look like how do you appear how do you speak how do you behave are you confident I would bet this person is not very confident I would bet this person is very afraid on the inside I would bet this person's terrified of having a real conversation with anybody about fucking anything you know what I mean yeah so bro that's a confidence issue yeah so make your confidence come up 75 hard is a great way to do that you know there's just a lot of aspects to it dude but like at the end of the day here's the thing you know what makes an effective leader the mother fucker that gets a job done that's it so you could take all this shit and you could throw it off the table but I bet you the dude that got the fucking job I bet he gets the job done better than you that's that all right so I get hey look there's a lot there are leaders if you have to pick between being a leader that gets walked over in the leader everybody hates be the one they hate be the one to hate okay be the one that forces it that's required sometimes dude when I was younger in business I was a fuck okay like if you fucked with me I would fucking bury you I will cut your fucking head off in front of everybody I realized through maturity that wasn't good okay but here's the deal here's the deal the job got done yeah I'm here today because of that because we did with the fuck we had to do you see what I'm saying absolutely man absolutely I love it man guys there's a lot to it yeah guys any question number three hi Andy I'm I am an artist and recently earned my tattoo license I've been tattooing for eight months now my problem is my confidence in charging my client what I know I'm worth because I am new most times I throw away deal in front of the client which is usually less than what I think I should charge hoping that they will see my talent and compensate with the tip but more often than not that doesn't happen and I feel resentful and not getting enough to cover my costs how do I put my talent skill and my time first when quoting a price of my clients without feeling guilty about what I charge I know what I deserve but I don't know how to be confident in what I deserve that person's full of shit if you actually deserve that you would charge that okay real talk let's address this step by step first of all how good are you after eight months bro okay let's be real I wouldn't let you within a hundred miles of my fucking skin if you've only been tattooing for eight months not happening okay so let's assess our abilities properly you are a brand new tattoo artist you are eight months in you really don't know shit okay I don't have to see your shit I know you don't know shit all right so you're probably not worth whatever to fuck you think you're worth that's the first thing the second thing is is if you were worth what you think you're worth and you were delivering this amazingly beautiful art of tattoo work and you charge the price that you feel is undervalued people would say how the fuck Merrow they say right they would say that yeah okay not everybody but but people would and it would become a thing what would happen is people would say bro go to Steve look how fucking good he is and look how cheap he is okay you would start hearing that kind of stuff and because you're not hearing that kind of stuff it means you're overestimating your own value in your own skill okay so do yourself a favor and remember where you are you're eight months in the game bro you're at the beginning you're a rookie okay you're gonna have to do rookie things in the beginning and rookie things mean I'm gonna have to do things for low or free cost that's the reality all right so let's start there you're probably still in a place where you're getting paid what you deserve now let's flip it and let's say you are the who you say you are and you're under charging but castle now listen bro listen to what I just said yeah if that man actually believed he was worth what he says and what he's trying to say he's worth then why would he not charge that in the first place I don't have any issue charging fucking anything for why is there a doubt there is no doubt yeah like bro I get hundreds of thousands of dollars to speak I don't feel bad should I be charging that yeah I'm like fuck dude okay well I'm pretty much one of the best in the world and I actually do real things in real life I'm taking away from this to go do that you're gonna fucking pay me and I don't feel bad in fact I don't even do the events because I feel like I can't even charge what I'm actually worth because it's not worth my time to do you see what I'm saying so so we got to be real if you really believe this bro you would have no problem charging it all right so here's how I would recommend this person get around this issue and then we'll cover what we'll cover another part of it you should work on becoming so undeniably great that is obvious that you're worth that right now there's a question and there's even a question in your mind otherwise you'd just be charging it all right so you should focus on your experience and your skillset you're gaining and the customer base that you're building creating an amazing situation for people to spread the word amount that you are an amazing tattoo artist okay that's because look look here's the reality about tattoos people really don't give a fuck what they cost they want the best shit they want the coolest shit okay so we're not talking about the drunk girls on the weekend getting the fuck we're not talking about spuds McKenzie tattoo my real shit though yeah yeah like we're talking yeah we're we're not talking about Pokemon tattoo you know what I love right we're not talking about some some little bitty fucking fine it's this big and can't read down your spine like every Instagram girl has the heart with arrows yeah bro we're talking about fucking actual tattooing art art yeah you're an artist and tattooing should be looked at as a cosmetic procedure no different than a woman who's getting fake breasts all right you want you don't want to get your you don't want to get the fucking cheapest titties okay you don't want to get the cheapest fucking eye surgery like you want to be the best that's what people want and there are price levels to that and whenever your experience is you want to be the best of the beginners okay so you work on the skill set over deliver create an amazing customer experience builds your book okay and as your book builds you start to get exclusivity and if your shit's good you can start telling people no and then what happens is your price goes up all right so that's the straight okay okay that's the you have to make yourself scarce through volume and that comes from doing things for cheap in the beginning getting to a point where you can't get to everybody raise your fucking price and that's what it is now if you're in this situation and let's say you are already there and you really do have a problem asking for money from people understand first is that you will always struggle with money if you have a problem asking for money you're talking about money or speaking about money or talking and you will always be in a position of having no money all right so what you have to work on is you have to understand that there's a lot of people out here that have a lot more money than you think okay and salesmen do this quite often they will sell the customer based upon their own financial situation so like if you take a salesman who let's say they have 300 dollars in their bank account and they're struggling for money and they can't really like you know feel comfortable when they go talk to a customer they start to project their own financial system situation onto that customer they start doing things like judging the customer based upon how they appear thinking well this fucking guy can't I've got $300 he can't have more than $300 I'm talking to him about $50,000 truck how am I going to do that he's only got $300 when in reality dude you don't know that guy might be fuck that guy might be a fucking billionaire right you have no idea okay so stop judging people based upon how they look or your own personal financial situation a lot of the insecurities about charging for things come from their own financial securities that they project on to the client yeah um third of all you know you have to understand everybody in the world understands how business works they understand like I pull out my wallet I give you some money you give me some shit all right and I understand how that's weird in the beginning when you're like operating as an entrepreneur you're not used to that because I can remember back in the day when I started the first store I felt like I had to give everybody a discount I felt like I had to like you know because I didn't have no money yeah and that's how I figured this out I'm like why do I feel like I have to always give people a discount well the reason was because I needed a discount she was a lot of money to me you see what I'm saying so there's a lot of mental hurdles to get over here but the main one is this if you're undeniably great you could pretty much charge wherever the fuck you want and it sounds to me like instead of you focusing on what you're making now you should be focusing on getting much better where people like would line up to get tattoos from you and then you could start to work on your pricing you know that's my opinion no there's a whole bunch of things that you can do to work on this but it's a psychological you know it's a psychological hang up most of the time if you you know most people they understand what things cost they understand that things cost money people know that tattoos cost a lot of money it's it's like so much it's so well known there's memes about it you know what I'm saying like bro if your shits if your shit is actually good charge what you think it's worth and the market will tell you the truth people either pay it or they won't and you can't take that personal if they don't pay it you know what they're telling you you ain't good enough yet if they do pay it and they don't ask any questions and you have a line of people out the door saying fuck I want one you're you're probably too low you know say it like the market will give you the proper feedback to for you to decide where your pricing should be and it sounds to me right now like you know dude you just got some experience to gain some work to do and some skills to acquire and uh and if I were this person I would be working on creating a mate an amazing book of business and an amazing experience for all these customers so that you have an army of people out here talking about your tattooing that's that's where you start and you keep getting better and better and better and better and better I mean bro eight months is bullshit let's be real eight months is bullshit bro I take shits longer than eight months yeah real talk real talk bro in eight months wow I'm not a billionaire yeah that's right you know what I'm saying like in the big scheme of things eight months isn't that's fucking nothing yeah okay so let's let's quit this shit you're not going to be one of these ten grand a day dudes and fucking eight months and it happened you know what I mean yeah so it's be real about where we are let's ask ourselves and introspectively what is the hang up why am I struggling with this why do I have this doubt and then let's focus on getting better let's focus on building the word of mouth and let's create a situation where the price has to go up because you're so good and you're so in demand that's the best way to do it I love it man well guys Andy that was three yep all right guys don't be a hoe
