Rogers yeah you watched mr. out yeah everybody watch mr. Rogers all right so I mean you know same same dude that's pretty good my bad yeah my bad that's not that's not my favorite but it ain't it ain't terrible pretty fucking good that old blue one that we have is fucking nasty I don't know how you all drank that shit you know what the worst one was that fucking cherry lime really yeah everybody knows that no but I don't the day didn't support that to cherry line yeah the data is wrong oh okay yeah data's racist yeah yeah I learned that from you no no I know I forgot that I that was yeah anyway yeah what's going on that is good it's good it's good I just didn't grow up with the blue drinks bro like Gatorade was yellow and orange red there was no blue blue came later I think blue came when power aid came I got a conspiracy on that because now we got blue drinks we also have fucking blue hair dye and fucking all the other blue balls all the other problems of the world yeah came with the blue laughing at over there's the shine hey man happy birthday just because it's 7-11 not the month of the day it's a natural holiday for you guys today 7-11 oh man all right well um now let's let's do some stuff man I wanted to bring bring something bring something up I love taking your your opinion you know this is a cultural show um you know we talk about setting societal standards here um we we go out to dinner often right night yeah yeah and uh you know I we uh and I'm actually I'm glad that we always have been pretty much the same when it comes to this idea of tipping tipping your servers right in your wait staff yeah um and listen there's some golden rules about tipping bro but yeah for sure all right for sure I'll get I'll get that in a minute yeah and so there's this new thing that's happened right now you know Trump passed the that no no no taxes on tips and stuff like that so we'll see what that does but this is different okay uh this headline restaurant surcharge stirs up controversy business owners should be embarrassed so apparently there's a new trend happening in in the restaurant world right now um let's dive into this a little bit uh below the total was a disclaimer from the unnamed restaurant saying living wage fee of 18% added to each dine-in check this fee goes directly to staff payroll and provides a living wage to our team the notice also said that any tips given would be pulled and distributed among the entire team so this is uh this is something that's happened this this guy went to this restaurant he ordered like a burger and some stuff and um and then you know it was like you know one burger was like 13 bucks yeah it was like 14 bucks whatever but the soda was like 40 bucks because they charged the burgers were 14 dollars um is that what a fucking cost of burger right now at a restaurant yeah it's about about that Joe does that sound fucking absurd I don't know why he's gonna why because it should be five dollars no that's not why I'm fat too we're all about your fat fucks in here you don't like it fuck you anyway no I'm asking Joe because he's the only one that's in my age range in the room and he real he remembers what shit costs were supposed to cost bro you used to be able to get a fucking you used to be able to get a McDonald's cheeseburger 55 fucking cents bro yes that's crazy you used to be able to get a taco taco bell for fucking 80 cents that's wild yeah for remember that bro you used to go to talk listen dude I used to go to Taco Bell let me tell you what I got I got a Mexican pizza okay all right good Mexican pizzas the shit bro I can't eat Taco Bell anymore like I had to quit it like people quit drugs like no I'm serious total abstinence yeah withdrawals no because if I have it once I'll eat it 17 times in the next 12 days it's a food addiction bro I have it real bad good I think it is but Mexican pizza Mexican pizza two double-decker tacos two chili cheese burritos and a large soda an extra large soda that sounds like a hurricane in your guts it was amazing fire sauce so like dude we're talking like six bucks seven bucks you know what I'm saying now that it's probably like fucking $18 can't even get one of those in six bucks now really I think so that's crazy that's crazy that's crazy you know that's why we're feasting anyway but yeah so I mean back to the subject yeah to this tipping thing though right so now restaurants are adding it's not even optional right I know some restaurants they do like automatic retweet if there's like you know if it's a large party or something like that table of black people whatever huh what so I get that I understand I understand that okay but just putting it on there for these living wages what what should take on that so this is just like so so let me get this straight so you have you have the check mm-hmm then there's another 18% we're called 20% mm-hmm for living wage then tip and and tip mm-hmm so this is the this is the restaurants way of getting around the tax on the fucking 18% 20% that's what it sounds like yeah look dude first of all there's a lot of things here if you're running a restaurant so poorly that that's how you have to like make it work you should just fucking start over okay the restaurant business is very difficult but the reason it's very difficult is because the people who open them are just people that think you know they sit around you we've all heard the conversations right people sit around they have drinks they're sitting there like dude I could open a restaurant it could do this it could do that it could do this or a bar right I could do oh we can we open a bar and so I have this saying in business it's drunks opening a bar right and the reason that nine out of 10 restaurants fail isn't because restaurants are this extremely hard business it's because the people that open open them open them because they think because they like to eat they get run a restaurant or they like to drink they know good thing they can have a bottle yeah bro and it's a business it's a business this is why a lot of lawyers go out of business this is why doctors have problems running their offices because they don't understand that business itself is a fucking skill okay now what do I think about this I think that if you're charging 18% on top of your food and that's how you're making your living wage you probably suck it running a restaurant now how am I gonna perceive that as a customer I think that's what you're asking um I'm probably not gonna like it yeah uh that's a lot of people are saying yeah I'm probably never go to the restaurant yeah it's it feels greedy yeah and if you I would feel better if they just charge an extra 20% like like if you just charge an extra 18% on your prices because dude it comes down to customer behavior right like what's the customer used to and when you anytime you change the protocol of customer behavior that is condition for them it creates rub which creates you know problems yeah okay it's it's a harder time to convert them so if this guy was intelligent instead of doing it that way you would just put 18% on the fucking across the board on your shit and be like we had a price increase which everybody would be like well shit everybody's everybody's getting more expensive yeah that's what it is and you'd have nobody talking about it um nothing too like I mean the whole point like I mean correct me if I'm wrong but I look at this like fuck if the service and the food was so fucking good people wouldn't have a problem tipping people wouldn't have a problem yeah but that tip that that fucking living wage is probably going to now I could be mistaken here because I'm at that living wage is going to the restaurant it sounds like they're trying to get a tip to go to the restaurant so they can avoid paying taxes on it and then there's a tip on top of it yeah and that's that's distributed is that is that what you're saying that's what that's what it appears okay that's what it appears yeah that's a stupid move because it fucks with people's already uh you know condition behavior when it comes to a restaurant it makes them pay attention how you would do it would you would put an 18% price increase and then you know like you're saying deliver great food and great service and then people want to tip more I mean look I come from a from an era where you tipped according to the service that you got um if it's sad because now it's like if you just get everything the way it was supposed to be it's considered great service yeah and that truly I think happened during COVID where everybody stopped caring about fuck is shit and so the good news is is like when you go to a really good place that has great service it really stands out you know when you go to twisted tree fucking stands out when you go to Louie it stands out you know what I'm saying you go to Bartolinos it stands out um you know there's some other places too but like it's rare yeah and yeah I'm with you bro like I like I like to tip big like I hope that people take care of me and and I enjoy tipping you know I mean a lot of times dude I'm tipping you know 100% on the meal you know because I've been blessed and I've you know I've worked hard and I know it's like to wait tables and you know that could mean a big difference for somebody if they're working hard for sure and bro waiting tables is hard and and being a bartender is hard people say oh who's gonna fucking heart no have you done it it's hard you've got to run around like crazy if you're it's fucking hectic a lot of people don't appreciate you a lot of people asshole yeah a lot of people a lot of people take it as the entrepreneur the the opportunity to kind of like posture like you're the help and like I've never been comfortable in those situations like I'm not a I'm not I don't know like I'm not that kind of a person on like I like like you know dude I don't even like people carry my bags you know like I just I wasn't raised that way yeah but yeah dude I'm a I'm if the shit's how it's supposed to be and it's it's a look that's over the top I I will tip very well unfortunately from their perspective not everybody does that there's a lot of people that don't fucking tip there's a lot of people that will tip you know you could kick ass and bro they won't tip shit oh yeah and you know so I don't know where I don't know enough where culture is right now on that to know like if that's required you know I mean maybe maybe things are so tight right now that people aren't tipping at all I don't fucking know but I know this if if they didn't want people to get pissed about it they would do it the way I said yeah yeah no I think I think a couple things need to have here I think people going to restaurants should stop you know stop being assholes I think we should you know be reasonable right for sure and I think people that are also you know in the in the weight and weighting industry serving and stuff like that again I where the day and age where it doesn't take much to really stand out and be exceptional in that position you're all debatically going to get to yeah you know I'm saying like maybe more often than not I would say you know I'm saying and that that's a problem you need to go to a better restaurant then because that restaurant just has shitty fucking people coming to I know lots of high-end restaurants that have trouble getting people to work there at their level and the the weight staff at those restaurants make a lot of money a lot of fucking yeah bro that's it was I forget there's a I forget the name of the restaurant it's a local one but like they were I forget who I was talking to they like the oh yeah I used to serve there I was making like fucking like on a good night I can make four five hundred dollars yeah I'm like that's fucking insane but again like the service is fucking exceptional and like you know I'm saying like there's there's an understanding here you know yeah so I don't know I don't like that one person like being forced to fucking do tips and stuff like that I don't like it either I don't like how everything now is like a tip thing yeah like come on you know what I mean yeah you get this fucking iPad shoving your fucking face and we go yeah right and it's like dude what are we doing here like no see I got no shame bro like if I don't think it's something that should be tip four I will hit no yeah yeah I will yeah I don't what is there policy when you're picking up food to go do you tip on to go orders huh that was your ass yes man you know what because even that's a fucking thing now I will tip less I will tip a small tip if I'm picking it up to go and they like bring it out to the car yeah I will tip for that but I won't tip that's a different tip than if you're sitting at dinner for a while correct correct correct so because Starbucks does that if you're going through the drive-through to pick up a drink you have to go through that screen if you have to choose yes or no or how much to tip before you pick your drink up yeah and there is a lot of conversational line about it with it should do it or not well yeah because dude if they if you have to tip before and you say no maybe they're spitting your shit right yeah I don't trust it yeah I don't trust this bro there's this what I was gonna say there's a couple golden rules about fucking restaurants you never fuck with your people to handle your food fucking ever bro yeah ever they will spit in your shit and I'll give a fuck if it's fucking Michelin 50 star fucking restaurant bro those service gourmet spit all right okay secondly tip people that work hard well that's the proper thing to do they're working hard you know it's the right thing to do if you if you can afford to do it it's it's just right you shouldn't go to dinner if you can't afford a tip right that's that's what I think number three one thing that you should all know is that when you go to dinner with someone they I watch everyone I go to dinner with and and I could I always watch how they treat the weight stuff oh that's a tear yeah and so yeah dude like if someone treats the weight staff poorly when I'm to dinner I won't do business with them so keep in mind when you go to business dinners um there's there's probably evaluating how you treat the weight staff you're actually hitting on a good point there's a very famous quote and I'm rephrasing it when you want to judge someone's character see how they treat someone who can do nothing for them yeah that's right you're hitting right on that right listen I've been in situations like and you know me as well bro it's like I will tip even if the service was bad simply because again like I you're you're fucking with my food like I yeah you're gonna come back I'm not gonna complain I don't get the pens to I think it depends on if you're coming back or not yeah yeah you know I'm saying you want to come back yeah no I'm saying like if I'm out of town and I get shitty shit I might fucking be like fuck you yeah right right right I ain't coming back you'll never see me again but if it's like a place I go to all the time yeah I'm gonna be like hey just so you guys know this was a little off but I got you you know what I mean and it's all good yeah bro first of all how many times have you had a bad day how many times have you you have you fuck something up yeah how many times is something out somebody else mess something up that you had to do like bro we all need to have a little grace in these situations yeah yeah that's real man guys tell us in the comments what you guys think what should tip uh golden rule give me the golden tip yeah the golden tip that's why you guys are fucked up guys let's get into our crews man let's uh let's start knocking these headlines out start talking about the talks of today I remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them all link there for you that being said um head on number one let's go to DC some some interest again yeah again I mean listen things happen man they're moving quick yeah they're they are moving quick um but I thought I was interested so so right now as it currently stands uh president trump he's uh him and the first lady they are uh in texas um going over and looking at all of the damage and and meeting with volunteers and rescuers um down in carry uh curveal texas with those fatal floods that happen they uh they just got down there today um so far I think the current death tolls like 120 right now I mean it's insane very very terrible did you see the picture that pickup truck buried in the fucking gravel bar no oh my god it's bad bro all that was sticking up was like a little bit like the truck was completely buried like all that was sticking up was like a couple tires shit man it's bad dude it's bad 120 people yeah more than 120 people fuck and still I mean and then we got people so we got people on the line on the internet cheering for it yeah it's disgusting fucks it's sick um but what's that age old saying it's like when mom and dad's away the kids come and play right because people are losing their fucking minds in DC right now are they a lot of stuff weird stuff happening uh but I thought this was interesting trump posted this uh or the White House yeah I saw that you see this yeah I did not like that I don't like that like bro that's like this what we're looking at here is a as a picture of trump dressed as Superman looks like a CTI poster it looked yes I like it when we do it yeah it's better when we do it it is better when we do it we're also not present in the United States but if we were we'd probably still do it yeah but I don't like when he does it dude I saw this sheet and you know what it reminds me bro it says symbol of hope truth justice in the American way Superman Trump first of all that's copyright my fucking hold on I don't like this shit no okay and here's why that reminds me of some north Korean propaganda bullshit all right like oh here's this fucking hero Kim Jong-un or whatever bro it reminds me of all of this fucking communist shit all right like yeah we do it to joke around we run a fucking podcast we're not running the country and like this this idol tree of like that's not what our fucking country is about dude our country is about service to the fucking people it's not about taking the leader and glorifying him to be some sort of fucking character man yeah I don't like it I don't like it at all I think every time their staff does some shit like this it completely fucking makes everybody go dude this guy this guy literally thinks he's fucking the king of the United States and like dude you know Trump is a polarizing dude already if he was smart he would fucking realize man everybody thinks I'm an ego maniac and you know maybe I am but maybe I should tone it down a little bit to bring unity and bring the focus back to the people not put it on myself and like dude I just I think these moves like this because this happens what the different ways of this happening happen all the time I just think this is fucking stupid yeah I think it's a stupid strategic move I think it looks bad I don't like it and dude even me someone who has you know been I would say a fair supporter of Trump I just call how I see it but at the end of the day like this shit makes me wonder like fuck dude like who the fuck this guy really think he is what here's my take on this too though and why why isn't that fucking why isn't that poster a picture of the people why isn't that poster a picture of the fucking workers down in in Texas right now you know like if you really want to be a leader bro celebrate the people you're leading you don't celebrate yourself yeah well here's my counter to this okay people might not agree with me it's fine but we also know how things can happen in business and companies and fucking in political offices where not everything will get approved under that you know certified stamp of approval and sometimes little fucking you know staffers 100% you know I'm saying so like I can tell you this bro okay that was my step what happened you didn't fuck fire yeah somebody somebody is getting fired yeah you know I'm saying like because we say like bro these people there's a time listen bro there is a fucking time in place for funny shit yeah right and right and you have to know when it is right okay like for example our CTI posters are clearly satire shit okay they're funny they you know but like bro very realistic to yeah of course like we're fucking we are that cool yeah right obviously I have though we have those uniforms yeah outfits those uniforms are fucking they're real that's a real picture actually that it's yeah the other ones are which are talking that's from the history books when we actually were pirates so we put the thing yeah back in the day when we built this country when who built this country who built it yeah right let's have that discussion yeah so we digress yeah so anyway that's a historical picture okay from the history books this is some made up bullshit you know look man here's the bottom line I don't think good leaders take care of the people and then are celebrated as a good leader by the people you gotta celebrate yourself that's right yeah and and I personally don't vibe with this shit at all and I think if discounts everything the motherfucker tries to do I think this is what people say when they say oh if you like Trump you're in a fucking cult this is what they use as evidence yes and I think it's very fucking and I think it's stupid I think they should stop this shit and I think they should get back to like if you okay you can very listen motherfucker like you can very clearly see they're trying to you know be yeah Trump if you want people to be like yeah Trump then fucking celebrate the motherfucking people bro do some shit for the fucking people show you out with the people in fucking Texas helping them maybe service of waters maybe you know like get your hands a little dirty like and then people will say hey this fucking dude actually gives a fuck right and by the way actually do it don't just do it for the fucking photo op like if you want to lead lead that's all I'm saying that's real bro that's fucking real man yeah it's off color that it's not tasteful it's kind of lame I think it's super lame and you know if you guys need some help by house if you guys need some help on making some CTI but you know posters no they need some fucking brand help bro but I have this feeling that it's not I have a feeling that like you say oh that's some inter I know you think yeah yeah I mean the motherfucker names he's named every property he's ever fucking had him left for himself yes true you know and he says I'm a branding genius I don't know man that's real that's real listen the guy's fucking worth like three billion dollars you know it's hard to argue with someone who has billions of dollars and convince them that whatever they're doing is wrong like that's a hard fucking thing to do yeah okay yeah that's real that's real but yeah I saw this but yes it trumps out town okay and while he's out there are some things that are happening and getting pretty heated in DC so let's let's talk about it this first piece that I thought was very interesting that just came out we have to go this is an agency called wired okay I think we may have talked about a couple of their headlines before on CTI but they just came out with this new report that says metadata shows the FBI's raw Jeffrey Epstein prison video was likely modified now yeah we talked about that minute missing right they go deep they go fucking deep let's dive into this a little bit United States Department of Justice this week released nearly 11 hours of what it described as quote full raw surveillance footage from a camera position near Jeffrey Epstein's prison cell the night before he was found dead the release was intended to address conspiracy theories about Epstein's apparent suicide and federal custody but instead of putting those suspicions to rest it may fuel them further metadata embedded in the video and analyzed by wired an independent video forensic experts shows that rather than being a direct export from the prison surveillance system the footage was modified likely using the professional editing tool Adobe Premiere Pro the file appears to have been assembled from at least two sourced clips saved multiple times exported and then uploaded to the DOJ's website where it's presented as raw footage experts caution that it's unclear what exactly was changed and that metadata does not provide deceptive manipulation video may have simply been processed for public release using available software with no modifications beyond stitching together to clips but the absence of a clear explanation for the processing of the file using professional editing software complicates the justice departments narrative in a case already clouded by suspicion the ambiguity surrounding how the file was processed is likely to provide fresh fodder for conspiracy theories so yeah they're saying that the raw file shows clear signs of having been processed using Adobe in Adobe product most likely Premiere based on the metadata that specifically references file extensions used by the video editing software according to experts Adobe software including premiere and Photoshop leave traces and exported files often embedding metadata that logs which assets were used and what actions were taken during editing in this case the metadata indicated that the file was saved at least four times over a 23 minute span on May 23rd 2025 by a Windows user account called MJ Cole one the metadata does not show whether the footage was modified before each time it was saved so yes so that comes that comes out okay now immediately when this is released phones are going crazy headlines are going wild because now we have this reporting this was initially done by Axios this headline reads scoop FBI's Dan Bonzino clashes with AG Bondi over handling of Epstein files now like always we and we try to tell you guys on the show all the time right like we don't know what's happening you guys don't know what's happening nobody on this planet that is intellectually honest nobody's been in the intellectual no there aren't there's a lot of people that listen you want to know why the country can't unite because we got people that fucking think they're so sure about what's actually going on that they're willing to you know call anybody who questions anything you know four years ago these same motherfuckers were yelling at us about COVID saying you know all the sudden they open their eyes to some of the corruption and then they're like yeah you don't know what the fuck you're talking about bro you motherfuckers yelling are the same people that were yelling people at the fucking mass song yep you know what i'm saying and just because you're a little bit of weight now when everybody else not everybody else but a few of us have been out here battling our balls off by the way for you for fucking free all right now you know a couple things and then you're trying to attack everybody that doesn't agree with your thing okay to make you feel a motion for you to fuck out of here this is the reason you probably got the vaccine run through your blood I'm being serious like fuck dude that's my point like like nobody knows none of us know we do the polarization and the certainty of people like look man I know I know when you first start figuring shit out it's like oh man fuck you know and then you become like you think you know everything now there's now your lead in those fucking family table conversation yeah you're arguing now at things giving a job good job yeah but that doesn't mean that the people who have been in the game much longer than you maybe don't see something different than you just like they saw something different than you last year and the year before and the year before the whole reason you're seeing shit so let's shut the fuck up it's real yeah I mean dude look because the lack of critical thinking and intellectual honesty is what's creating a lot of the divide in the country nobody's able to say you know it could be this and this and this if you say it could be this and this and this all the sudden you you're not loyal to Trump or you're you're you're fucking protecting a pedophile right or motherfucker you don't know none of us know okay and you could say oh well he's owned by this or did this or yeah or this look man you have no fucking idea yet because there's been no definitive evidence yet and there's so much fucking turmoil happening just like I said yesterday through vacuum I said this is not surface level shit no and and in the next day you got bansino coming out saying I fucking know what the shit might be resigning yeah everybody's talking about CNN's talking about everybody's calling like it's a big fucking deal so why now this is where this is where these conversations that this is where discussions happen right it's like we take what we do know and we can you know draw some conclusions sure yeah we can you know do some deductive reasoning sure and you know again not to two our own horns here but we've been doing this for a minute have been wrong on much and you do great at fucking seeing down the fucking line so that's what we're gonna do that we've always done listen dude if I was cocky I'd say mother fucking you just wait just wait just fucking wait just wait if I see the other thing is I don't have problem saying I'm wrong after I know that I'm wrong but like I'm telling you I'm pretty sure I've been right about almost everything we'll see and we we shall see man because here's the other thing that I hate to like you know a lot because again people are in the state where they're just trying to they want somebody to validate them it listen you know what I'm saying like yeah I don't give a fuck where it comes from saying it as long as it validates the current fucking correct feeling it's confirmation bias plus a group think yeah plus you know this this cancel culture mentality of this or that it's all of those things culminating into one thing that's what it is and it's sickening and then part of the you know the problem is not conducive to problem solving at all at all and part of the issue is you have people that come out who want to be first who want to be right who you know I I have the inside information according to a source they don't name fucking most of these people to say that are fucking on the payroll as propaganda pieces for one party or the other exactly exactly and so you again we don't know that no dude it's called narrative shaping yeah okay like that is a fucking technique they whether it's left or right okay they use influencers they tell them what to say they they they it doesn't have to be true it's just how do we bend the narrative yeah ahead of the curve all right so they get someone like Harry Sisson or you know someone on the right which they have those two and they saying go say this and they go on say it and there's a tactical reason for that because they're trying to bend the narrative certain ways yeah all right so there's no truth telling coming from these people so when they come out they say I got the inside shit blah blah blah just remember that picture all the motherfuckers with the binders out in front of the fucking White House had the shit then too right yeah right exactly yeah I mean so it's it's annoying man and all we can do is just take again what we what what what what is common knowledge yeah so what's up and that that's what's coming out you know and so let's go to one that's go to somebody who allegedly has a scoop and see what they say this is Laura Lumer I don't have a read on her I don't know she's she's she's like an insider but she's not an insider who fucking knows she says all kinds of shit and it's fucking very rarely is it is it it's half and half exactly that's my point but let's you know this is somebody who says they have the scoop so let's dive into it she's saying she's also said she's had the scoop a lot of things that she didn't right okay but what does she say yeah so she says here's the scoop FBI director Cash and Dan Mangino are live it with A.G. Pam Bondy over her DOJ memo and the lack of transparency from her office regarding the Jeffery Epstein files sources or source tells me Dan Mangino is taking the day off today from his job as deputy director of the FBI and there's now speculation on whether he or not he will return to his job at the FBI over his disgust with Bondy's lack of transparency and handling of the Epstein files Pam Bondy has brought total embarrassment to President Trump JD Vance Dan Mangino and Cash Patel she has also lied to the American people I'm told Cash and Mangino are furious with Bondy blondie she's calling her in the blowback she has caused them with her lack of transparency Cash Patel and Dan Mangino should call for Bondy's blondies public resignation today to save themselves and to also push for full transparency into the Epstein files this is an issue the American people care deeply about someone needs to be fired for this giving blondie courtesy to resign as more than she deserves Trump should fire her I have a couple issues with this this piece okay because again we don't know what's true and what's not true retake what we see and we conclude from it right we I keep going back to that fucking video of the interview with with cash and bongino all right and we I think anybody you don't have to be a fucking you know psychologist to look at them say okay there it does not appear that they were telling a complete truth they're fucking lying right they were told to for some reason or another there could be lots of things they could have been threatened their jobs could have been threatened their families could have been threatened they could have been told hey say this for now because we're gonna do it this way who knows but I know enough from watching enough mother fuckers in my life that both those motherfuckers were lying and I could also tell that both of them were very uncomfortable with line with and that that's an important piece yes right and so which this behavior from Dan Mangino would back up that assumption right right you know until it's like you know it is this the case of you know by Dan Mangino because again we have to remember who this guy was before he became the deputy director of the FBI who was he he was a media personality was a podcasting he wasn't that different from us he had a really big fucking following yeah he had very he has a very loyal base of you know listeners yep that expect something of him yep and so it would make sense to I mean he's getting heat he's been getting heat about the zepstein shit we've shown yeah he looked dude he's saying it's very simple the guys spent a significant amount of time building reputation of being honest being truthful you know up until he became the deputy director of FBI you know I would say my assessment of Bonsino is he he trusts and likes Trump a little too much but I think he's I think he cares about what's going on in America the right way I know enough about him in terms of you know events that he showed up to support that he didn't have to to know that he does care because it wasn't something he publicized right you know during covid he was standing with people that were opening their businesses he he listen I think the dudes of patron there's some receipts there for sure but I also think that he likes Trump a little too much but here's what up my assessment on this situation here is he realizes that he's becoming all his following and all the work he's done and all the time he put into his reputation is getting diminished literally completely and entirely and he's instead of being you know damn Bonsino who's a little bit right but we think he's a patriot now it's damn Bonsino's a fucking liar yeah and like bro I think damn Bonsino is aware of that and he's saying this isn't fucking worth this and by the way I didn't I didn't sign up for this yeah I signed up just like all the American people I want transparency I want fucking law and order I want people arrested which are all things he said yeah okay so I mean this makes perfect sense and honestly it just reaffirms all the shit that I said yesterday that there's something happening behind the scenes we're not aware of yeah the only issue that I had in any of this is like because there are you should have made Andrew Bailey fucking AG they should have or or should they're well there's probably a reason he wasn't picked and I tell you what it is it's because Andrew is not for fucking sale and if they said hey Andrew lie about this and this and this he's gonna say I'm sorry sir I cannot do that that's real yeah that's 100% real but the the issue that I'm having and then panbodies from Florida right and she dealt with all the F-steens shit and she's from it like you see what I'm saying it all good no it doesn't but here's my the issue that I have with this is that because they're trying to argue about transparency right the FBI had all of the stuff too they're the ones that were saying that they didn't cash could have just said the cash and baijino could have came out and said hey this is that yeah right that's what I'm saying so like I don't I don't know I don't know what to what to hear now that being said you know we also been here's what I will say you mother fuckers baijino and cash you mother fuckers have a duty to fucking let people know what the fuck is going on yeah and and dude we don't give a fuck what they're telling you we don't care what Trump's telling you we don't care what bondys telling you you're in a position right now to fix what's going on in the country okay the only thing that's going to restore the the possibility that this country is going to become great is going to be transparency about the fact of is our government and our key officials including media officials and important figures in Hollywood and all these different power structures being blackmailed to deliver a message to the American people that is a fundamental truth that we are going to have to know for sure is our country based on blackmail you know is our country based on child trafficking like at the core of who the fuck you to are as men you owe it to tell the truth and if that means you go to fucking jail then that's what it means but I can tell you this this is your chance to be an American hero and you're gonna fucking pass it up yeah 100% 100% now I mean and I've been like you know we both have you know people that are in some places that you know would be in these conversations we have listeners on the show that reach out to us all the time that also in you know would would would at least maybe know right and one of the things that I've been hearing from my sources is that this whole Epstein stuff is being delayed there's like you know and we've laid these options out for you guys but when I know why it's being delayed well one of the things that I've been hearing is that it's uh that that trumps actually delaying the release because he's using it as leverage against Israel to make peace in the Middle East I've heard that I've heard that I've heard that and I'm like yeah and then what though you can't because you can't just look bro look dude okay look it's very simple it's very fucking simple okay for you guys that keep saying oh it fucking Zion dot yes it could be who fucking knows it could be but it could also be this it could also be Trump understands what the Samson option is that Israel has and so if the US if the FC files come public and the whole entire world flips on Israel and the US drops support of Israel and then Israel gets attacked by the three billion Muslims that fucking hate them that they do the Samson option and nuke the mother fucking world okay like that is one option of many that has not even all that's like one of like seven different options and everybody's like oh your production dude maybe you're maybe they're trying to make sure that you don't get fucking nuke exactly okay so there's all kinds of things to consider but I will say this if that's the case then they should be preemptively dealt with preemptively yes and and we're gonna have to make a decision that they're gonna have to make a decision my decision would be all right mother fuckers I'm gonna fucking take you out first before you can even before you even sniff that I'm on to you you're gonna be done yep and then it'll be it'll be a very simple public address yeah for the fucking hey hey he did this yes and this is why we did yeah and the rest of the world would be like oh well yeah okay cool and then you have the evidence to back up that they did it all of it okay so how this I know everybody wants this to play out their way but like bro just because you believe that it's cut and dry let it go doesn't mean there's consequences not consequences to my other thing is like and I'll be real do real talk like real fucking talk if that's the case and our government is blackmail and all this fucking corporate propaganda the movies the fucking music all of this shit is siopped which everybody in those industries says it is I really don't give a fuck if they fucking blow everything up because bro I'd rather I would legit rather be fucking out here uh hunting and gathering then fucking knowing that everything's fake everything's a facade yeah yeah like fuck well that's my other but I think people have to fucking like think about that when they think like there's consequences to this and are you prepared for those that's my that's my biggest issue with people man all these people that all the genre okay what are you gonna do about it yeah okay let's say that okay that's the case what what now what now what do you what do you listen bro people don't understand they they the bottom line is here we don't know what's going on but I will say this I have respect for bansino for at least standing up and say hey this thing fucking right yeah we'll see what he does we'll see what he does but at the end of the day bro um um trump's got to handle this shit or it's going to fucking ruin his whole fucking reputation it's going to ruin this country if this isn't dealt with and it's just swept under the rug which I don't think that's going to happen it can't happen it's I don't think it will but if that were to happen we will never escape this matrix we will never be free again we will never get our country back we we because basically what they're doing what they would be doing if that were the case would be saying yeah what the fuck are you gonna do about it we gotta maintain the status quo that's right yeah and it's the mass coming off if nothing's done about it yeah and uh you know there's a lot of people like we've talked about that say trump is engineering that okay that's a possibility it's also a possibility that um you know they're that wherever the fuck you live could be targeted by a nuclear threat from israel uh if the whole world turns against them and tries to kill them okay that's a possibility uh there's a possibility that you know this is being leverage to create peace there's a possibility for that if that's the case I don't think that's right I think that this shit needs to be coming out no matter what um in a way that's not going to get everybody fucking killed yeah 100% but the way that that happens broke like is like what I said you if you know if you know that that's what's going on and you know that that's their fucking retaliatory plan then you have to preemptively prevent that plan from happening and then come out present the evidence and be like look we did this shit but here's why yeah it would be very simple and I think most people at this point in time would say yeah that sucks but at least we know the truth 100% now here's another there's another option there's another thing yeah I'm gonna tell you right now and like dude this is the rumor going around the classified circles which everybody says well this is the truth but we but no one wants to talk about it well the connection apparently to you know everybody keeps saying well Trump's on the list Trump's on the list he's in the files yes but but not the not the way that most people think right okay and it would just be embarrassing for yes and and Trump said he's out of his own mouth he said if the lists were released it would ruin a lot of innocent people's lives okay maybe so but also it's important to understand whose lives he may be talking about and he very well could be talking about his own considering what the rumor is around that Trump his involvement with Epstein which is this the rumor is and I can't confirm this so this is the and I even feel bad saying it but the rumor is that Trump was introduced to Melania from Jeffery Epstein okay that's that is the rumor among people who are around that they don't want getting out that would be embarrassing if that is what's holding him up that's fucking ridiculous it's weak yes it's weak because here's the thing is now you're you're gonna crumble the trust of the entire fucking population over over this yeah and it listen if this isn't addressed it will lead to a fucking revolution well and like so let's dive down this this a little bit right like is there anything there yeah and it's not even just a rumor and here's the thing it's like it's it's it's kind of known like I was able to look this stuff up pretty fairly quickly and easily right so you got you got Trump and Melania they met in 1998 is when they met okay there's Melania now according to how they met this is all Wikipedia again trust or not she worked as a model in Manhattan where a guy named Paulo Zampoli Zampoli okay hired her and sponsored her immigration to the United States in 1996 she worked as a model of Manhattan where Zampoli introduced her to Donald Trump in 1998 she began dating Donald Trump shortly thereafter Trump worked to get Melania more modeling jobs and she also supported him during his 2000 presidential campaign he ran for president 2000 yeah I had no idea didn't know that and then Mary was like not taking it seriously yeah but yeah Melania and Trump they married in 2005 they had a son band Trump the following year but the Paulo Zampoli guy okay because that's where we have to who's this buddy he's a former modeling agent and now diplomat that has been mentioned and is in direct connection with Jeffrey Epstein primarily through their association with Galein Maxwell that's where it's at okay now I think it's also important to note that Zampoli okay this former modeling agent now has a US ambassador ship seat that he was given by Donald Trump okay now if that's no bueno bro no that doesn't pass like that's not acceptable excuse to hold if that's the reason that's your skeleton yeah if that's it bro let it out you're being selfish by not letting it out because nobody trust you right now and nobody trust the government right now and it's a big problem bro I went on Donald Trump Jr.'s fucking Instagram post yesterday and literally I swear in my change now bro there was not a single comment that wasn't about that there wasn't about the Epstein list nor positive no every single one was negative so nor positive yeah so like dude we have to like I mean you know yeah he's a special envoy of the president of the United States for global partnership ambassadors and poli listen man I think people need to realize something too I think people need to realize this they got all the shit on you okay so like all the shit that you think that you got away with or the things you might have texts or the things you might have said within your shot of your cell phone or the cause you might have made or the emails you might have sent or whatever whatever whatever they got it on you bro they don't just target individuals they fucking own the data okay they have it so before you go saying all right I'm freaking can't believe Donald Trump would do this or can't believe so and so would do that or this or not or this remember if you ever get in a position where you're any kind of a threat they got all your shit too I don't have anything to hide you sure about that yeah right right right you share about that I'm pretty sure every single person in the world has some shit they would like to prefer nobody else knows that's real man that's real so I mean that's what we again we don't know there's just what this is the current facts as they stand draw your own conclusions like fuck dude it's whatever man let us know down in the comments yeah I mean the shit needs to come out and dude if we're gonna have a country of any sort this needs to be handled by Trump properly and it needs to be disclosed and it needs to not get anybody killed whatever the fuck that means needs to happen and he's having soon because people are getting fucking pissed oh yeah man yeah guys let's go down to the comments what you guys think with that being said let's roll people do vote for this shit now he ran on fucking letting it go and that's a common fucking yeah this motherfucker ran on letting it go he ran on uh stop in the war in Ukraine he fucking sent him shit right after he announced that I mean all that war would be over day one yeah let us know man and then he's trying to say well look what we're all we're doing over here over here yeah that's fine these mass deportations that they claim are happening where are those why where's the video of those I know we've seen a couple raids and we've seen some things but what are the actual numbers because I'm pretty sure that the numbers haven't been reported since December yeah let us know man where are the actual numbers let us know down in the comments what you guys think that being said let's go cruise some comments Andy cool cruise some of these this first comment from uh tinnock true who tinnitrugh okay the smoke alarm beep uh too much african ceiling bird haha haha there was hilarious buy some batteries DJ and you heard it DJ didn't haha no DJ is just used to it just kidding I thought he I miss heard that yeah well we got some jokesters in the podcast video yep it appears tinnitrugh that's a good one yeah cool thanks bro next one digital pocket change 736 DJ never ceases to amaze me he can read better in french than he can English but then he pronounces all timers all the timers I feel like a democrat cheering on Joe Biden when he reads 50% of the teleprompter correctly you know it's fine that's fine um pause back Paul Paul the sucker Paul all the corn suckers back for you oh really what I do Paul run 111 Andy is looking extra cute this episode hey that's my man right there see Paul recognizes good thing when he says it all insane all right Paul Paul you're looking good too bro I can't see you but it takes one to no one you know I'm saying yeah get it uh this next comment it's from uh not uh uh oh uh a shot this a fucking long one not a shook one . oh oh oh how the show has I love when this yikes. Yeah. Yeah. Yikes. The show has fallen. Man, I used to love real AF back when we started listening in 2020 during the pandemic. I felt you guys were the voice of the unheard, the voice of the people. But lately, it feels like the show has fallen into the same political tribalism bullshit that 90% of other podcasts has fallen into. It doesn't do anything but create more division and add fuel to the climate of hate that already pollutes this country. What's he talking about? Oh, I guess he's going to tell us. Andy will have a whole crybaby meltdown pity party about how white people are victims of racism, but without mentioning it's the majority of white people that are being racist towards white people. That's a fair statement. That's a good statement. I don't know that I would say I would have a crybaby meltdown. Like, pity party. I mean, it is the white people calling the white people racist. And he'll laugh his ass off at one of DJ's corny jokes. Well, yeah, I have to. I'm required. Thank you. It's he's my friend. Friends laugh at friends jokes about black or brown people, but also never addresses the racism that happened. God, dude, what the fuck? This is long. Not a runoff synthesis. Yeah, the racism that happens towards any other ethnic group that happens way more often. Like what? What's he talking about? Stop Asian hate. Maybe a little bit. Stop getting slow piece. Yes. I mean, the slow piece. What the fuck is it, bro? All right. 7-11. We got it. We got it. Okay. But the final straw was DJ. Uh oh. What did I do? It's all the bullshit going on around the world. Floods war and death starvation. Why take a rant and shout at angel. Oh, angel Reese commented on the show. You guys shit up there every day. And this was the final straw was me making angel Reese comments. I guess so, bro. What the fuck? That's what I'm saying. You guys sit up there every day and praise Caitlin Clark, but shit on angel. I don't understand that. It's a fucking talking about. We talked about twice on the show. That's it. Two times. No. Um, how the fuck does that help us grow? And you night? Well, because it's honest. Okay. What should we ignore that that's a bias that's happening that's that's that's not see dude. This goes back to the intellectual dishonesty. Yep. Okay. Unity happens with truth. Unity happens with honesty and humor and humor is one of the ways that truth and honesty are delivered so that people can soften the way that they receive it. Okay. Make it more powerful. So, yeah, we unite people through humor. How is that an inform formative information for the listeners? It doesn't. And it and it ain't. So yeah, I think I've had my fill of the show. I'm tired of the Trump ass kissing that mother fucker. Ain't saving us. Yeah. And I've only said that a gazillion times tired of the division from these political podcasts. You guys are turning into the view. Oh, wait. Okay. Who are you on the view? And who am I on the view? We're not the view. No, but if we were, who would you be? I wouldn't. Let's say it in the same. I'm going to say who you are. You say who I am. One, two, three. We'll be go bird. Oh, I'm. There's nowhere. I'll be Joey. I'll be Joey. I'll be Joey. I'll be Joey. Hold on. And I just want to say to DJ when your fat ass makes it on the cover of something, then you'll have room to talk. What bro, he's on all these posters. I mean, historical posters right out of the history, but history. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know where you've been. And keep, keep agree with, with 100% of whatever Andy says, like a good employee. Yeah, that's good policy, bro. Let's call smart. That's called longevity of employment. I mean, bro, whatever man, don't listen to show. It's all good. I would say that out of that entire fucking book that you wrote, the only good point in there is that white people are the people who call other white people racist. But the rest of it, I think, I don't know. Maybe you're having a bad day there, bro. Yeah, I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry to be a fat. Bro, look at this. Oh, yeah. Whatever man, don't listen. Try to see the profile picture. Is that a witch? Is that a witch? Fucking cares. Oh, how the show is falling. You know what I think is funny, dude? I think it's funny how so many people forget that we were the only mother fuckers out here talking about being an advocate for all these people during COVID. Nobody else bitched out, pussyed out. We've taken more heat than any other mother fucker out here. We've been right about every single fucking thing that we did. And now all of a sudden, because so many people have woken up a little bit, they think we're talking out of our ass now. Yeah. Well, here's the, you know, maybe if you sat over here, bro, every single day, you would see things differently because this is a continuation of a much bigger narrative. All right. And as far as uniting people, I would fucking, I don't know. I can't think of anybody who's, and I'm just going to say this, I can't think of any people out there who have woken more people up and got more people to take responsibility for themselves or united more people. Yeah. You know, I don't know. I don't know. I mean, yeah, whatever dude, don't listen. Sorry to disappoint you. I'm so sorry. We should rebrand the whole show. Oh, I think so too. Fake as fuck. Let's just, yeah, let's just do it. Whatever. Yeah, someone's having a bad feeling. All right, man. Is that it or woman? Yeah. Yeah. Guys, we appreciate you for being real ass fans. I mean, look, nobody's forcing a list in the show. I'm also not as fat. No, you're down 35 pounds. Yeah. I'm working. Yeah. Why don't you guys stop being fucking assholes. Yeah. Talk as you said, injuries. You couldn't handle the black one, black crime. Yeah. That's what it was. Yeah. All right, guys, that's fine. Cool. We sit up here and we praise, create, create, paint, and Clark. We suck her nuts. That's what it is. What it's fucking talking about, dude, we talked about it two times. It's very clear. She's best player in a fucking league undeniably. She does not get the same attention as other players that earn as good. She also gets brutally assaulted. Oh, the fucking, that's the fucking, that's the, that's the story. Yeah, that's it. Like, that's it. Not cool. Yeah, I could honestly, I don't give a fuck about either one of them. So yeah, there you go. Yeah, well, let's keep cruising. Yeah. Sucking, injuries is nuts. I'm okay. I'll pass on that one. I'll pass on that one. Let's keep cruise moving, man. Let's head to the good old state of California. What is their state called? Like the Golden State. The Golden State. Because of all the urine. It's all the, yeah. On the sidewalk. Yeah, we start calling it the Golden Shower. Yeah, how about that? That was good. All right. Let's go count for you. Immigration operation. California cannabis form leads to clash between federal agents and protesters. This is an interresor. This is hot right now. The protestant. Tear gas smoke bombs and state license cannabis sites. It actually doesn't sound like a party. Doesn't sound like a bad time. Yeah. That sounds like another weekend at our farm. No, don't come right now. Yeah, keep your access out from the farm. It's fine. All right. We got tanks. Yeah. We do have tanks. Yeah, this is hot. Man, this is like going on there. Let's dive into this a little bit. Protestants clash with federal authorities Thursday during an immigration operation north of Los Angeles at a marijuana farm allegedly employing illegal immigrants. Multiple agents arrived at the glass house forms. A state license cannabis facility, which is considered illegal under federal law in Camarillo. The federal authorities had a warrant for legal employees. Fox News has learned another raid also occurred at another glass house form in Carpety Railroad. If it was French, you could hit it. Yep. That's not French. Capita hall. Capita, Capita, Capitaria. Carpenteria. Carpenteria. That's where it is. Sounded out. DJ, you got it. In addition, US Attorney for the Central District of California, Bill Essely said the FBI has offered a $50,000 award for information leading to the conviction of an unknown suspect who appeared to fire a pistol at federal law enforcement officers near Camarillo. Now this is where it gets interesting. At the cannabis facility, investigators found nine unaccompanied migrant children, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Trisha McLaughlin, told Fox News digital on Friday, updating earlier reporting that eight such children were there. She added, quote, so glad our law enforcement could rescue another child. Customs and Border Protection Commission, Arotin Scott said Thursday the facility was under investigation for child labor violations. So you got nine, okay, now nine. Again, originally it was eight, but you have nine now unaccompanied children with the youngest of them being 14 years old, working at a cannabis grow farm, okay. That's the situation, okay. So between the ages of 14 and 18, okay. And so you have that going on, all right. Now, and these are not US citizens, these are not US citizens, and these are kids, these are kids, minors, okay. And you have people like the governor of the Golden Shower State putting out a tweet like this. He's running from tear gas, crying on the phone because their mother was just taken from the fields. Trump calls me new scum, but he's the real scum. Oh, baby. Burn, but I have a question and it's funny because so does Homeland Security, Gavin. You know, why are the children working at a marijuana facility, Gavin? Like, he doesn't care. Like how do you miss that whole thing there? He didn't miss it. He knows the same thing that all these politicians know is that people make their decision about who they're going to support. And then they look away from the things that they don't want to look at. And they only focus on the things that they are told because they want to believe so bad that their guy is the guy. It's no different than team sports. Like some people will root for the Cardinals, no matter what, bro, no matter what they could lose a thousand games and someone's going to be, they're going to take pride on you. I'm sure Ash, you talk about it. I'm loyal to the Cardinals, all right? And then, you know, there's, do that for the cups, you know what I'm saying? Like, once people pick their group, it's hard for people to get, you know, it's hard because you're attacking their ego, bro, and their decision making, okay? When you attack someone's team or let's say, you know, they're a Ford or a Chevy guy, right? Like, here in the Midwest, bro, you got Ford's or Chevy guys. And you know, you see a Ford guy, right? And he gets out of the truck and he's like, you know, let me do this is, this is, it's sales. It's sales 101, all right? There's a analogy that I use all the time. And it's how to align yourself with the customer. So let's say you have a fucking Ford guy who's drove Ford's for 17 generations, man, whatever, right? This whole life is granddad, is grandpappy, pappy, they all drove Ford's for, right? Exactly. And he's got a Ford that's giving him nothing fucking problems. Like, it's irritating him so much that all of a sudden he's like, dude, you know what? I'm going to look at Chevy's dude just because the guy pulls up. On the Chevy lot. And the guy walks out from the Chevy dealership and he says, what are you doing driving that piece of shit for that guy's getting back in his truck and he's going home and he's never, ever considering a Chevy no matter what. But if you were to say, hey man, nice Ford, I used to drive a Ford. There's things I really like about the Ford. What do you like? And then the guy says, well, I like this and this and this, but fuck, I'm having problems with this and this and this and be like, bro, you know what? I had the same fucking issues with that. Let me show you what we got. That's a different conversation. Hold it for a second. Okay. So once you get, bro, get generational curse there. Correct. So once you get someone who has bought into Gavin Newsom or Donald Trump, all right, because it works on both sides. They want to believe. They want to believe that whatever that person is saying is true. All right. And this is a big problem with what's going on in politics today because we have accepted tribal politics. By the way, this goes back to the comment that dude left. What are you talking about? We're the only fucking show out here that calls balls and strikes on both people. All right. But back to the point, people associate their decision making and then make that decision part of their identity. And then when things go wrong, they don't want to see the things that go wrong. They have a story for it. They defend it. And it does become cult like behavior. All right. So, but this is not just exclusive to one side or the other side. It's exclusive to how human beings operate. All right. Human beings attach their identity to the decisions that they make. And that decision for their own ego's appeasement has to feel right to them. So even if it's shown, if you show them the evidence, here's all the things that Gavin Newsom says and does that are fucked up, they're going to say, that's bullshit. That's not true. He didn't do that. And it goes the same way for Trump. Okay. So when you say, why does no one say anything? Well, because they look away, because it causes them to have to question their identity and their own decision making. And unfortunately, most people have a big problem with admitting that they were wrong. It's too uncomfortable for them. Yes. I mean, because even on the bare minimum, like you got these protests going on, man. They're like people brought their kids to an ice raid to protest. What? You can't even don't ask, well, what do they think we're going to happen? Here's my thing. They know exactly what the maybe they want their kids to get taken. They want those out. No, no, I'm from the standpoint of you have these protesters bringing these fucking kids to the protest where these tear gases. Oh, got it. Yeah. Don't ask, well, why would they, why would they do that? They did. They're not know what was going to happen. They do it for this video. They do it for these optics. Right. Exactly. They do it for the fucking optics. You know what I'm saying? So even, you need to be asked, what kind of person or why would you even want to try to like connect with a person, reason with a person who thinks it's okay to bring their young children to a fucking situation that that's going to be, it's going to be that dangerous one. Why would they, you know, I'm saying like you can't reason with that person. So don't try. That's my thing. And you know, of course, he's not going to answer. It's like you always say, bro, until it personally affects them, they, they, they will continue to tell a story. Mm-hmm. You know what I mean? No. Yeah, it's crazy. You know, now there's other protests going on, not just here in America, but people, and this whole immigration thing, dude, it's been a constant issue. And it's not just here in America. It's happening in all other, most Western countries right now. And I don't know if you saw the shit going on over in the, in Northern Ireland, but UK police say, stop the boats, bonfire display may be a hate crime. Do you see this? So a fucking hate crime is allowing people that aren't from that country to come their unrestricted and take over the fucking country. Mm-hmm. That's a hate crime. That's a fucking hate crime. Yeah. So authorities in Northern Ireland are investigating a bonfire that featured effigies of migrants and a boat and a banner reading, stop the boats to determine whether it was a hate incident. Um, here's the video of it. Got some fireworks and shit going on. And so that, that's a tower in the middle there, right? Stop the boats. That's a boat of mannequins, not real people. Oh, I see the boat. Yeah, okay. It's got a boat with people in it and they're burning it. Yeah, and they're burning it. Yeah, I would say that's probably hate. It's Irolyne, bro. I want to fucking see pale skin, redhead motherfuckers that drink beer when I go to fucking Ireland. I want fucking leprechauns. That's what I'm saying. That's what I want. That's what leprechauns do. I want to butcher fucking shit talking con with Gregor's run around getting fucked up talking about how they're going to beat my ass when they're five, too. You know what I'm going to see when I go to Africa, Andy? I want to see fucking elephants. Lions and tigers. All right. Period. Big tusks. I can't make jokes and big tusks. That's right. Thank you. Don't make jokes. Yeah, no jokes. Don't make any jokes about brown people. Yeah. You're going to make one about white people, too. For sure. So you got to give me one now. We come to America and see what? Manays? I was just going to say peace and safety. That's not even true. Not true right now. Fuck. It's not true. What do you want to see when you come to America's Asian? Tell you off here. A bunch of people, a bunch of people, a bunch of people, little dicks, no rhythm. Like what the fuck, dude? Yeah, man. Guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys better not joke about Africa. Yeah, don't know. What do you want to see when you go out there, man? Where are you going? Bro, when I go to Italy, I want to see fucking Italians, bro. I want to get some fucking spaghetti. I want to get some fucking pizza. I want to see that I'm off the coast without fucking, you know, having to stop for prayer time in the middle of fucking day in a Christian country. Like that's the fuck I want. Yeah. I want to see that. If I wanted that, I would go to fucking wherever they're from. Exactly. Exactly. Like, bro, it's called travel. Listen, there's nothing wrong with that. No. There's nothing that is not racist that isn't fucking, that is how the world is supposed to be set up. The problem is nobody wants to go see that shit so they're making it, making it, bringing it to you. Well, no. Dude, this is about conquering the fucking world, bro. Yeah. I'm sure that people don't understand. Yeah, man. Guys, jumping on this combo, man, let us know what you guys think down in the comments. With that being said, final headline, headline number three. You got to bring a girl in. Who? Jasmine Croquet. Oh. Good Lord. So dumb it hurts. Now, this is, you know, we got to give context because she's back in saying some dumb shit. So dumb it hurts. It's like a representative Jasmine Croquet slammed for calling GOP inherently violent. Yeah. So, now, this was May 9th, okay? Mmm. And you had a thing like, oh, hey, you can't get worse than that. Right. But she, she said on the podcast back this was May 9th of this year, she said, quote, Ya'll got the white supremacist galore, the proud boys, the neo Nazis, even the KKK, so like inherently in who you are, Ya'll are violent. Okay. I didn't think she could get fucking morbid started. But you can't. did. Jasmine Krockett claims Trump assassination attempts were done by maggots Trump supporters. And more importantly, violence doesn't come from the Democrats. Let's check this clip out. The violence doesn't come from Democrats, it was clear. I mean, obviously anyone can be a criminal, but it is mega, it's specifically mega-faction. Like, I don't think traditional Republicans are getting engaged in all of this, but like, even when we look at, and they don't talk about the assassination attempts anymore that took place with Donald Trump, but these were Trump supporters, right? As well as this most recent situation, they tried to flip it and say, oh, the left is, or I'm like, this doesn't even make sense, right? But it's only like, mega that does this. Okay. Okay. All right. That, okay. What else? You want some, well, I mean, let's, let's try comment now. Yeah, I mean, I really have nothing to say because that might be the dumbest fucking shit I've ever heard my life. In fact, I'm surprised she didn't say yikes before it started, right? You know what I'm saying? Right. Like that was, and dude, she's literally making shit up on the spot. You can see it, right? No fucking, I mean, if you're watching this video, you'd be like, yeah, that fucking ladies making shit up. No. Well, I mean, let's let's talk about some of the virus that has happened in our country. And it's laughable to say that at this point. Yeah. Well, I mean, who did it? Who's been doing the violence? Let's cover some of the things that we've covered over the last five years. Okay. Oregon federal judge orders release of trans suspect charge with fire bombing shooting up Tesla dealership. Yep. This dude right here. Here you go. Yeah. That's, that's a fucking mega guy. For sure. Oh, hard mega, but well, that might be soft mega, but that's one of them fucking that's right. Little dickers. Yep. Or this guy that, you know, threatened to fucking put a quote, I can't wait to put a bullet into this guy's brain. But first his children, he's a Democrat. Audiologue Matthew White out of James Sound, New York. Oh, hold on. Let's just keep going. All the major fucking shootings that have happened in the last fucking five years, the one in Nashville. Let's go the Buffalo shooter who shot the Supermarket shooter, the subway shooter, the fucking Evalidate shooter, the shooter that was in Colorado, the fucking one, the shot up fucking the nightclub in Florida. Okay. We could go on and on and on and on and on. Everybody knows this bullshit. What about the fucking Black Lives Matter riots? Okay. Where's the fucking white neo-Nazi riots that happened? Oh, January 6th. How many people fucking died there? One and she was shot by a government official. The rest did not die on the scene. That is a fucking fact. Okay. They were either suicide because they knew shit, which is my opinion. Whatever, bro, that's it's a fucking laughable statement and everybody knows it. Yeah. Well, I mean, like, I mean, more importantly, right? Because these are just headlines, Andy. Right? These are just headlines. What's the data? Right. I like data. You know what? So data's racist. Well, data can be racist, but let's go to the man data is anti-trans. That's what it is. It's bigoted. Non-binary. The red verse by the Manhattan Institute on governance and public safety. The red verse blue crime debate and the limits of empirical social science. Where they conclude it. Okay. I mean, they put it in there very politely. For the past two years, several think tanks on opposite sides of the political divide have waged war over whether red or blue America has a worse crime problem. Commentators on the left have pointed out the red states have higher homicide rates than blue states. Well, those on the right have noted that the relationship is more nuanced and can easily flip at a more local level because red state crime problems are often concentrated in blue cities. Correct. And red counties have lower motor rates than blue counties. Facts. So, look, man, magda. What's the what's the what's the who commits the most crime in the United States? Black people. Okay. That's fact. Violent crime. Black people. 53% of the violent crime isn't that correct? Yep. With 12 to 13% of the total population, most of that's committed by mail. So 6% of the population commits over 53% of the violent crime. How do most of those people vote? Vote blue no matter who. Okay. I'm just saying. All right. That's a fact. The exact numbers might not be point zero, whatever fuck, but that's a fucking fact. Okay. It's a fact that here's what I want to see. Where are these fucking KKK people? Bro, they're shooting up Chicago. Hold on. That's what it is. Where are these white supremacists committing all these crimes? What like am I only getting one side of the fucking headline here? Because I can never see the pictures of what they describe. Like where is the good old boys in the pickup trucks driving out of the streets? It's just screaming. It's screaming. Yeah. How? I'm like saying it. This is how fucked up. Okay. I kind of want to see one. Yeah, but you know what I'm saying? Just like all right. That's my point. I don't even know what a fucking looks like other than the shit they put in the movies. So I got I just want to see one. Well, listen, dude. Listen, I'm a white dude. Yeah. I've been alive for fucking almost for a long time. Right? Like I never got invited in none of this shit. All right. I speak up for white people, bro. I'm one of the few people that speak up for white people and say, hey, that's not right. Not because I want to be, uh, yeah. Yeah. Like I it's not because I want to be superior because I can recognize things when they're not right. Just like I speak up for black people who get conned by the Democrats, every mother fucking two and four years and then, and then, you know, they point at people like me or the Republicans because they're people. They're voting for stealing their money and intentionally impoverishing their cities and ruining their schools and making life hard for them. So I just call it how I see it, bro. In real talk, I've never seen one of these white things outside of the fucking movies. Yeah. Like, you know, in Mississippi, burning where the fucking red net fucking dudes rape that girl. It's a great movie. But like not because of that. No, but, but no, it's a great movie. It's no shit. Not because of that. The point is, is that I've never seen it. What the fuck are you talking about? This is all a big lie, bro. This is a big lie. You know, and dude, you know, because most of these people, they live in New York City and they live in fucking California city or LA Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago. Okay. Um, these people don't go out to the fucking country. They don't drive across like how many of these people white or black have no anybody in rural America. Yeah. No anybody. Yeah. When was the last time a group of black people from the city who believe this went to rural America and even fucking had any sort of, you know what I'm saying? It's like, have you ever seen that movie, The Village, with by M. Knight, Shauman? You have it. Okay. Well, the whole fucking premise of the movie, it's very similar to this. It's, they, these people basically got tired of technology in society and they wanted to start their own little colony of like living, living almost like sort of like Amish people live. Okay. Like old, the old ways. Um, and so they set up this, this community and then at night, you know, these monsters come out. And so what it does is they, they have like border security and, you know, when the monsters come out, you know, they fucking handle it and it scares all the people to stay in the city or in their fucking little colony. Well, eventually, one of the people in the in the colony fucking escapes. And they figure out that it was all bullshit. And what was actually happening was they were living in the middle of this nature preserve with no planes couldn't fly over it. And they discovered that the whole story was alive. Well, that's what's going on with these motherfuckers in the cities. That these Democrats tell these people in the cities, hey, man, don't go out there. They're fucking the fucking white supremacists will get you. Right. Except it's not true. And it doesn't happen. Maybe it happened in the fucking 60s. Maybe it happens occasionally. Okay, maybe, maybe there's some, there's some great, because there's assholes and criminals and murders of every race shape and kind. Okay. But it just so happens that more of them vote Democrat than they vote Republican. And more of them cut their dicks off the parreroid. Yeah, well, I don't know the stats on that, but, you know, I'm pretty sure that everybody that cuts their dick off those Democrats. Yeah. Just about, find me one. I mean Bruce Jenner. Okay. All right, but that's not fair. But I don't know if he did it the thing with the full child. I don't think he did either. I don't want to know. Well, I don't care. I don't care how Bruce Jenner wants to live. Yeah. I don't fucking care. Like I care if you force everything down, everybody else to stroke. Mm-hmm. I care if you fuck with the kids. I care if you're committing fucking crime against people who, you know, you perceive to be hateful because they're teaching their kids that men or men and women and boys and boys and girls or girls. Like that's not hateful. That's called fucking facts. I actually call it love. Well, look, bro, there's lots of reasons for this. But this has already been done if you know history. And by the way, if you go back through history, it's always the same mother fuckers that commit all the violence. Do you know who's killed more mother fucking people than literally every disease and every war and everything combined leftists, communists. Communists. They've killed more fucking people than any other reason that people have died in the history of man fucking kind. You know why? Because they're fucking violent. And that's how they get their power. They shame, they lie, they gaslight, they, they convince everybody feel guilty. If you have anything going for you and then the minute they take power, they kill all those people because they are, they are physically inferior. They're intellectually inferior. And it's their only way of being relevant. And that is communism wrapped up in a fucking, in a, in a fucking nut shell. Yeah, bro. Okay. At the end of the day, here's the reality. Those people who believe the communists and the leftist shit have been lied to. They have been manipulated. They have been gaslit. Their entire lives about the rules of reality. They have been told things like if you show up, you deserve to be celebrated just like the guy who put in all the work and wins. If someone goes out and spends their whole life trying to build a business, you deserve some of that because you breathe the air. They, they tell you that everybody's equal. Everybody's not equal. That's not, that's a fucking lie. Okay. And then when these people get out and they get to be in their 20s and they figure out, holy fuck dude, I'm totally unequip with the world. They see the entire world as unjust, which only backs up what they've already been told. You see? So these people are, are, they're fucked. They are fucked. Okay. And we all should stop bending to their reality and compromise their own integrity, our own belief and our own reality, which is reality. There is a natural order of things. Winners win, losers fucking lose. People that work hard do better than people that don't. You know, not everybody's gonna, gonna have, gonna start at the same place. But if you work hard, you can cover a lot of ground. And not everybody's gonna end up at the same place. This is reality. Every time someone's tried to create equal outcome, millions of people have died. That's it. Okay. So there's, there's all kinds of things that they've been taught that just aren't fucking true. And now they're trying to drive the nail down even harder the last 10 years with ruining the fundamental reality of men or men and women or women. So this has already happened in history, dude. Like it happened in Weimar, it happened in the Weimar Republic and fucking pre-Nazi Germany. And you want to know why the fucking Nazis happened, it happened because of all this crazy shit that's happening now, which we're starting to see the same fucking thing kind of happen. Yep. I mean, there's just calling out. Yep. And dude, you know, like, anything good. And no, it's not good for anyone. Like, bro, it's not good. It's not good for anyone. You know, but at the end of the day, bro, people who think like her and the people she represents, the second that they get any leverage on you for real. And this is why it's important for everybody to speak up all the fucking time. Because what they do is they shame you, they guilt you, they cancel you, they call you names, they try to fuck with you, they try to make you feel bad for being who you are. And then the minute that you can see power to them, they fucking kill those people. And that has been repeated in history over and over and over again. And people hear that and they're like, oh, you're being a panicking. No, I'm being a historian. Real man. Real shit, man. Guys, jump in on the conversation. Don't agree with me, man. Yeah, don't agree with me. I don't, I don't, I don't believe in history. Yeah, let us know what you guys think down in the comments. That being said, let's get to our final segment of the show for you guys. As always, we have thumbs up and thumbs up. Bring a headline in and talk about it. Get to one of those two options. Now, you don't fly a commercial anymore. Okay, you have it in a long while. No. Might be a reason for you to fly. Maybe one more time. Commercial. Nope. Okay. Well, thumbs up. This actually made a lot of people happy. Surprise me. Thumbs up. It does. Fuck hell on reads. TSA to end shoe removal policy at report security checkpoints. You know, I never used to have that. No, yeah. I don't, a lot of people don't know that that was never the case before. It was only made the case after, and after 9-11, they had this fucking guy. I can't remember his name. Richard something. The shoe bomber. shoe bomber. Right. There's 2006. When he did, no, he didn't do the shoe bombing 2006. That's when the, that's when the policy went in. Maybe they were doing the policy before that. That might have when became national law. But like right after 9-11, everything changed, bro. There was like four or five days of no flights, which was super weird because you like, it was, there was no flights. The shoe bomber incident happened on December of 2001. Yeah. A British man named Richard Reed tried to get explosive hidden in his shoes while on board American Airlines from Paris to Miami. Yeah. Geez. And he was an al-Qaeda guy. He came right after fucking 9-11. Geez. It was like right after. And then all of a sudden, everything changed in the airports. Like that, that shoe thing, that might have become a federal law or something. But they were doing it before then. Yeah. It was like one of those things, bro. It's like every time, you know, this is just temporary. Yeah. Now just 10 now. Just spread your butt cheeks. And we got it. We got to check you there. Yeah. Well, they're removing the policy. It's now okay to keep your shoes on at the airport. Thank God. The transportation safety administration will allow passengers at airport across the country to keep their footwear on as they go through security checkpoints, Homeland Security Secretary. Christie, know them to report his Tuesday. The new policy is nationwide. It takes effect immediately. Said no one whose department oversees the two TSA. While the rule may not apply to passengers who need additional layers of screening, no one said it will be the norm for most people going forward with this no shoe policy quote with this no shoe policy. We anticipate that Americans and travelers and those are coming into our country will be very excited. They will no longer have to remove the shoes, she said. So yeah, I mean, this is a mental out of people happy, man. Yeah, the shoe removal has been a part of airport experience since 2006 when they institute the requirements, having intelligence indicating a continuing threat of explosives. I mean, look, these guys don't think I like the full body scanners and all of that bear like you stick your fucking hands up on the. Put your right hand in and take your right hand out. Yeah, right hand in. Is that move it all about all of that? Yeah, it's ridiculous. Yeah, well, dude, I know this. It's it's like it's gross. It is, man. There's nothing grosser than other people's feet, bro. And then you got a fucking like walk where their bare feet were like that's fucking gross. And then you got people who think that the airport is their fucking living room. It's never, you know, and they're wearing their pajamas and you see this fucking large margin for any of this wrench in the fucking dingle berries out of her butt crack. And you know what I'm saying? Like, it's just a disgusting fucking place. Yeah, it is. It's like and it's reflective of American culture at this point in time. Like when other countries, you know, when they see a prototypical American, if you want to see what it looks like, go to fucking airport. It looks like fucking Walmart, bro. And like I just wish people would start carrying a little more about their appearance in the way they present themselves so that we would have a little bit more class in the fucking country. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like there's places for your shoes to come off and for your pajamas. But it's called your fucking house. So yeah, this is nice. But I mean, I'm fucking, wouldn't make you fly commercial. No. No, no, no. Did you have an airline before you went private? Yeah. Who was your go to? Well, I mean, dude, you know, obviously, I was always flying in the Southwest because like, I like Southwest. Look, I haven't flown in there a long time, but I felt like there was no real upgrade of paying more to other places. I know Delta was nice. The few times I flew on Delta, but they don't have a big presence here. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, I'd flew Southwest, bro. And I still fly Southwest. I'm talking shit, but like, I don't, you know, I look at things differently, dude. People are going to hear me and they think it's snappy. But I think a little bit different. Like the way I think is like, once you adopt a standard in your life, that has to be your standard, right? And so like, that's part of my standard. Like, I don't, I'm not too good to fly commercial, but my standard is, you know, this is what I do. That's a reason. Yeah. And that keeps me working hard because I want to keep that standard. And I like that standard. And if you've ever flown private is completely fucking different than flying commercial. It's like a time machine, dude. Like, I leave my house. I go to the airport. I walk right on the fucking plane. And in an hour and a half, I'm landing in New York City. And in two, two hours, 15 minutes, I'm in fucking Manhattan. You can't do that commercially. It saves you a day. So what's a day of your life worth when you're when you have the means to travel like that? No, I do people, people will understand it because there's some people that like, oh, I'm only flying first class. I'm only flying fucking business. Well, dude, it's fire once. Like I'll never go back. Here's the reality. I'm gonna do whatever the fuck it takes person. If I have to go back and eat dog shit and live in the back of my store to fucking win, that's what the fuck I'll do. But right now, I don't have to do that. So I don't, you see what I'm saying? 100%. And it's not that it's beneath me. Yeah. But I do have something to say about this TSA thing. You know, it would be nice if you people in Washington would real like stop the fucking formation of this digital surveillance state that y'all are creating and thinking that we're not noticing. You know what I'm saying? Like this shit, the the bigger story here is, you know, when are you going to repeal the Patriot Act and stop using the surveillance equipment and technology to listen to every single conversation that we have and every single email and every single everything that we do. That is not okay. And I don't think any American thinks that's okay. And I think we have a duty to ask, why is that happening? And who's behind that happening? Right? So, you know, this to me, to me, how I see this is just another fucking crumb. Hey, peasants, guess what? You get to wear your shoes the whole time. Yeah. But we're still going to surveil you. Yeah, right. And we're still going to use our technology to spy on you. And you're going to pay for it. Yeah. And by the way, we're still going to steal fucking more of your money than you actually get to take home. And then we're going to send the rest over to these fucking fake ass wars so that our stocks go up. But enjoy your shoes. Yeah, right. Yeah, that's what I see. Yeah. So, you know, and and dude, unfortunately, most people will see the shoes and say, fuck yeah, bro, shoes. Winning fucking America. Yeah, bro. And like, dude, I just think that people need to wake the fuck up. And instead of being so concerned about, you know, whether someone agrees with you or not, we start to realize something that I've been saying and you've been saying for fucking years, which is this, everything, all of the division, all of the frustration, all of the ridiculous regulations, all of the taxes, all of the racism, all of the propaganda is designed for one mother fucking reason. And that is this is to keep you in a state of uncertainty, is to keep you in a state of aggravation, is to keep you in a state of disruption so that we will never understand who's actually creating the problems. We will look at each other and we will say, well, that guy's white and that guy's black and that guy's Indian and those guys are the problem. No, they're not the problem. And the minute that we all come together and we say, you know, it isn't that guy, it's like this other guy, it's fucking them. We will get somewhere. But until that point, nothing will change. And the truth of the matter is, it's never been left versus right, it's never been gave versus straight, it's never been any of this shit, it's never been black versus white, it's fucking them up there and us down here. It is class warfare. Okay. And until people understand that it's Andy. Well, you're wealthy guy. What? Yeah. But I for most of my life, I wasn't. Okay. So when you sit there and say, oh, look at Andy's hand signals. He's doing this fucking illuminati. Hey, dumbass. I grew up the same way you all grew up. I come from fucking where you come from. I care about people. Most of the people my friends are fucking regular blue collar people, my family, regular blue collar people. Okay. I give a fuck about the freedoms that all of our friends and family, including my grandfather, fucking died for allegedly. Where the fuck are those? And until we start to understand that it's not us for each other, it's them doing this to us. Nothing will change. And dude, the minute that everybody says, like I said on yesterday's show, the minute, black and white people and everybody says, well, you know what? Fuck those motherfuckers that everything will change. It will change instantly. But until then, we will continue to be ruled over, we will continue to be divided. Our lives will continue to be financially oppressed by the tax code. Our money will continually be stolen. All right. And that shit will go on and on and on until we fucking stop it. It's not going to stop on its own. Tyranny does not stop itself. So when you think about attacking someone because they don't necessarily agree with the same thing that you think, remember, you're playing into their fucking plan. You're the problem. It's real. Anyway, that's my fucking speech. I love it, man. If you don't want to listen to show, fuck off. But if you do want to listen to the show, don't be a hulk. Bitch, who the fuck? Got a own bank row. Can't fold. There's a note here. Shot case closed.
