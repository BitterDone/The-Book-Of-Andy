I'm super excited to have a Young man who who I am greatly impressed by He has a podcast. He's a young guy out here getting it done Quite honestly if you haven't listened to the episode that I've done with him what you should after this show It's one of the best interviews that I've ever been given and it's by my friend Danny Miranda So welcome to the show brother.

I'm originally from New York I I grew up in New York and moved to Austin, Texas two years ago I started a podcast four years ago and the reason why I started the podcast was Because I started to have an amazing phone conversations with people who All around the world were people who were people I wanted to learn from and people I was excited by and I was like I got to record these conversations just conversations with friends and that led to me recording them Originally just zoom calls and Skype calls and it led to me flying out to St. Louis to be here and You know in this moment this season of my life I'm less Fired up about podcasting that I am about coaching and helping people mentally perform at their peak Mm-hmm because I've realized the podcast is an amazing vehicle for helping people and And growing my Myself and helping others but Helping people one-on-one is a different level of excitement and I'm just blessed to be here in this moment and I have to thank 75 hard for Bring it all to happen and make it all happen. So thank you. So what's your podcast? Tell everybody about it because I want them to check it out Yeah, the Danny Miranda podcast. I interview entrepreneurs like yourself High performers people who are getting shit done in the world and I am you know so blessed to be able to Do deep research on people to really help them and help them I Want to know more about somebody than they they're significant other knows about them And so that's how I've kind of separated myself in the whole process You mentioned it was one of your favorite absolutely the reason why is because I did more research on you than anyone who interviewed you Yeah, I believe that I listened to must-man 30 40 50 hours of you in addition to being a fan of real AF in addition to Listening to MFCO for years and so of course you're gonna have the best experience and so I think 75 hard really drove this home in me you want to be better than most people just do more work Right simple, but how often is our people actually executing on that? It's rare. Yeah, it is so dude. Let's get right to it man How'd you hear about 75 hard what made you decide to go after it and let's talk about that sure so the first time I heard of it was September 15th 2019 and I had just quit a job that was paying me $10,000 a month I could do it from anywhere. I was living in San Diego. Life was great Except I hated my life and the reason why I hated it was because The job was easy. It wasn't in line with what I actually care about and I knew I needed to change something so I stopped the job. I quit the job cold turkey and was like I'm gonna find the better way and then a week later 75 hard comes on my radar I have no idea how but I looked at the five tasks or six with the second workout I was like that's it that's something that I need to do and that's something that if I do I know I will be in a different place And so it started because I was in such a depressed state So bad and I didn't believe I could do what I said I was gonna do and so 75 hard was found I found it early on right? Yeah, it's been even talking about it. Yeah, I mean since the beginning. Yeah, so I Did the I I committed that that night that I found it was like I'm starting tomorrow I told my buddy that I was doing it. He said he would do it I told my other buddy that I was doing and together I just saw my life Transform day by day brick by brick and by the middle of the program I'm a completely different human being. My friends are texting me like dude. What are you doing? Like I notice in how you're showing up in the world It's so much different and I knew that I was becoming a different person I was becoming somebody who could do what they said they were gonna do and finish what they started Which is a huge huge I think that's everything dude. I think that's I Think Most everybody knows what they should do and the areas that are weak in their life, right? Like we all know if we're a little overweight we got to get in shape We all know if our bank accounts not right We need to make some more money. We all know if we're not the best friend or the best human We need to improve. We know what to do the problem is we have problems doing it and I Think that's the what you're talking about there You know the be the ability to finish things the ability to fulfill the Obligation that you make to yourself when you say I'm going to do this thing. I really think that's most of the people Out there's problem. I do not think the problem is that they don't know what to do I mean, what do you think I think you're absolutely right? Yeah, and I know that 75 hard was the most difficult thing I had ever done in my life at that point. I was 25 years old or 24 years old and The fact that I could actually that what's so amazing about the program is that 75 days seems like a long time, but by the time you do the first you complete one day If you can complete one day you have Showed yourself that you could actually do what you said you were gonna do in that day and guess what every day is day one That's right. I love Tim Grover it one on everything That's it. It's like if you just do that one day and complete that one day You've proved to yourself that you can do what you say you're gonna do. Yep. So just do it again. Yeah, dude I think that's such that that's the most simple way to describe High levels of achievement Every single person listening right now has the ability to be a high achiever. Yes, they think it requires this complex algorithm of you know the stars aligning and being born in the right place under the right kind of moon You know and having the right parents or the right this or the right that when in reality, dude It's very simple. Okay, if you can muster up the will and the drive and the discipline to make it through one single day That's one day and every single one of you listening can do that There is no reason that you can't do it again tomorrow and again the next day So if you can make it through one day, dude, you can win your whole life And I think when we break it down to make it that simple it really resonates with people because you know we see all these I guess you know for lack of a better term just misrepresentations of what success is about You know we're told by our parents that you got to be lucky or we're told by you know our teachers that you know You're not getting good enough grades or we're told by all these people that are supposed to encourage us and help us and Make us better that there's all these reasons why we're not Who we want to be or why we can't be who we want to be when in reality, dude If you can make it through one day you can make it through your life and and that's what the programs designed to really help people understand And I think I think most people to do the program right it sticks and I think that's the power of the program, you know what I'm saying When you started the first time I mean did you expect the results that you got did it makes sense to you when you first started because a lot of people When they start they're like I don't understand the point of all these things and they kind of don't get It I mean, how did you feel when you first started versus how you felt when you first finished the first time? Yeah, I I knew That I was doing most of the tasks on 75 hard I just wasn't doing them consistently and so I knew if I stack these together day by day by day break by break I'm going to be a different person just by virtue of the fact that I I can actually do what I say I'm gonna do So I knew it would be impactful from the first day I knew there was not a shadow of a doubt because I knew I was already doing them. Yeah, and so It was a no-brainer for me in terms of committing to it. It was a no-brainer because I knew I would see the benefits And I did and what was so interesting was I was reviewing my notes today of my notes that I took the first time around Mm-hmm I could feel the first time that I almost Quit or almost I'm not gonna do this or wow this was a challenging day And then I could feel another day, you know first one was 24 days in I'm waking up at 11.30 a.m And I'm like I haven't done any of my stuff and then the next time is day day 50 where I get food poisoning and The difference between day 24 and day 50 is like I still complete my workout day 50 day 24 I figured out a way but those days I realized all my excuses were such bullshit. Yeah, you realize Yeah, it's like you realize you're just lying to yourself and so but it's cool to have those days where You might quit or that you could give yourself an out those are the most important days because those are the days when you gain the most strength Those are the days when you sell yourself on the idea and you realize that wait a minute Just because I had a bad moment doesn't mean I have to have a bad day Right, like a lot of people will take a bad interaction or a bad conversation or some bad news And they will make it a spread across their whole day when in reality, dude It's just a bad moment like it's a moment in time and if you pick up right there and finish out the day and win the day You can actually minimize the amount of impact those moments have it's the opposite of what most people do right like most people amplify You know the one bad thing that happens to them in the day and they're like fuck I had a terrible day It's like broke You know like there's people out here that are that are not being able to eat You know what I mean? There's people out here without a place to live like you you got some bad news You know you were you were not down an extra pound You know what I'm saying like you had to do an extra thing at work send an extra email. It's not a bad fucking day. Yeah, you know So let's talk a little bit about You know how because you've done the program how many times now this is my fourth time four times I'm doing a 55 right now. Yeah, okay, so We're When you first went through this process and you were you're not happy You're not really in a place where you want to be and you said hey, I'm gonna do this program Where where did that take you after that? Where it took me after that was exactly what you say not to do I was drinking and parting and so happy That I completed it and I felt immediately. Yeah, I felt like wow what what did I just do? This is not fun the what was fun was actually building up to this point. Yeah, and I got a huge moment of like I Went into depression. Yeah after I went into depression because I knew what I was capable of and now I wasn't doing what I said I was gonna do Yeah, and I was like I'm disgusted with myself and so it took me a few months and then I got back on the program I started phase one and I was like oh I could do this whenever I want I'm making the choice to be depressed right now. I'm making the choice to get mad at myself Well, and the reason you're probably depressed correct me if I'm wrong is that you know what you're capable of and you're living below that Standard that's it and that's something that people have a hard time once you open up Pandora's box to what you're capable of yeah, and you start living below that of course You're gonna feel like shit dude because you know in your heart that you're living below what your potential is and that doesn't feel good No, and so I I just went into a tailspin and and I think people I I wish I Thought about what am I gonna do after and prioritize it and made it a focus because looking back That was the most obvious thing to do you're creating a whole new person and the person that you are creating is Better than any person that you've ever been in your entire life So when you go day 76 have a plan. Yeah, you got to have a plan for day 76 You got to start and continue having standards for yourself Maybe even higher than 75 hard requires because if you don't you're just gonna you might go back to old habits and you might Absolutely become a person that is even worse. Yeah, then the person who yeah who started the program That's why I tell people so many times I'm like guys. This is not a diet This is a mental program and once you open up the possibilities for yourself You try to go back to where you were you're gonna feel even worse because where you were before you were ignorant To how you could be right if you don't know what you can be then you don't know how bad you are But once you shine a light on how bad you are and you know that you could be more That's a hard pill to live with when you know you're underperforming or holding a lower standard You know I I'll just throw this in here, you know for me I've always struggled with my weight my whole life I I have a very easy time putting on weight and It wasn't until I figured out that I could Hold that standard for myself mentally That would keep my body and check where I was able to maintain the weight loss, right? Like I've I lost 110 pounds in 2016 and then you know I didn't we didn't start 75 hard till 2019 But normally that's that's how it would have went for me it would have went you know two or three years And then I would have got fat again and I've been able to keep it off, you know Fuck I guess almost you know eight nine years now Because I understand the concept of living a standard right like once you adopt a New standard for yourself you have to live it otherwise you're gonna feel bad and I think it's very important for people to understand like once you understand That you're living below what it is you're supposed to live It's it's it's very important that you That you execute at a higher level because dude you will feel like shit about yourself and a lot of people will say Oh, they get off 75 hard and they just go back to the way they were and I didn't feel I felt worse no shit Because now you know that you're capable of what you're capable of and now you're you're not living that at all You're trying to go back to who you used to be and that's very painful and and your heart and your soul and your mind is all telling you Dude, you don't want this. This is not you you're you're supposed to be here. You can do this You could be that and you think about those internal conversations that we have about what we're capable of mentally Right like we're laying at home at night and we're kind of thinking about what we could be or what we could become or what we want to become or We want to create or what we want to build and We're thinking about all these things and when we're not aware of what we're capable of those visions are small So they're not very far above like when we're living the I would say you know a negative lifestyle, right? They're a little bit above that But once you go for an extended period of time like 75 days or let's say you do phase one right after where you go 105 days in a row Now you're very very aware of what you're actually capable of so like that level of Where I used to live is so far below You give them saying it's so far below what you're actually capable of that living like that is miserable Like even living at a high level of what you used to think was high is still miserable So it's a it's something that you need to be prepared for before you go into it for sure. Yeah, I'm curious You recently it stopped for you right 75 hard stop for you in the sense of you were doing the program Yeah, just Saturday Saturday. Yeah, you go to the ER. Yeah What do you tell people in moments like that and how do you respond to moments like that? I mean there's there's things that happen, you know, that's called life man Yeah, you know sometimes there's gonna be uncontrollable things I woke up in the morning. I was throwing up I had massive like pain in my stomach and went to my back and went up in a chest and I'm like fuck I'm having a heart attack and and I made I went to hospital on an ambulance and I was there all day and what it ended up being was an intestinal blockage from I smoked three cigars the night before and dehydrated me and then I ate a super like a like a I ate steak that night Which I usually don't eat steak usually eat chicken or or fish or shrimp and The combination of those two irritated my gallbladder and then also gave me an intestinal blockage So like I was in the hospital until six seven p.m. That night um And and dude after that I wasn't able to to continue going so what do I tell people? I just tell them the truth like there's things that happen. There's life that happens and when that happens It is what it is yeah I've already done this year 75 hard phase one am phase two and I was doing 75 hard with my buddy who Needed it to really get himself back on track. Yeah So I just picked up where the next day and I mean I'm not I'm not doing it like officially But I'm gonna finish with him because I said I would so I missed I missed a day. Yeah But I'm gonna go ahead and finish and if it were my first time through 75 hard this year I would start right over but because it's not I'm just gonna pick up where I was yeah I think that that part about I was speaking to somebody who works here earlier and they were talking about how If you've done the program multiple times what happens is you miss a day and That's just life and you understand you can get right back on the horse the next day. Yeah, the first time going through I had nightmares. Yeah about drinking alcohol. Yeah, or about eating a donut. Yeah, it's like no now I'm just this is life. Yeah, dude. It is life. I would say most of the time even when I'm not tracking the program I'm still living the program. It is pretty it is very much so Become a daily routine for me. I mean all of those things Every single day whether you see me posting it or not posting it or saying what day I'm on or not Chances are I followed those things all day the only thing that I might not follow a hundred percent All the time is my diet, right like I might I might eat You know good Monday through Saturday and have some sort you know go out to dinner or something Saturday night kind of Eat something but like dude even though even with that like my my off meals or my cheat meals So to say that I have when I'm not like there's so much less damaging because like I don't I've gone so far like so many cumulative days now Without eating all that shit then when I do eat it I feel gross dude and so like it's not even what I want When I when I actually want to go off plan. It's not even what I choose to eat like I used to want to just Gorge myself and I'd want to eat you know all the all the good foods quote unquote and the reality is and dude I remember used to be and I remember you when I used to be like when I had zero discipline I Would like fantasize about becoming one of these people That like this stuff didn't affect them like I would notice friends or people I knew or guys that were good They were athletes You know and we would go we would go out or we would go to a ballgame or whatever dude and they're they're eating on their plan Right and I always admire that I was always like how what it like how come I don't have that like why are they able to do this And it's no big deal and I always wanted that for myself and and now I have it like I don't even crave Any of that shit and I know how hard that is for someone who's at the beginning stages to really understand But when you put like the live hard program where you do 75 hard phase one two and three over the course of a year You're sort of weeding that out of your your system and and dude. I can't tell you I mean you probably talked to a bunch of people too who after they Started living this lifestyle. I mean do they don't really drink ever yeah, they don't really I mean they're usually pretty ripped all the time And they're constantly moving forward in life. They're not just stagnating and and Staying still so it's kind of funny when people say oh dude, you know, it's just a it's a gimmick or a fad Well, I mean fuck dude. I only know I don't know any fads the last six years and get bigger as they go. You know what I mean? But yeah, dude, I think that's a good it's a good thing though, you know like I feel very proud about The discipline that I've cultivated and and it's it's so good now where it doesn't even feel like discipline It's just like it is what it is like I don't have those mental Struggles anymore like when I see someone drinking beer. I don't think like oh, I need a drink beer or when I see someone eating eating pizza It doesn't make me want pizza like I don't even I don't like I used to be like the first time I did 75 horror even the first year I did live hard Those were mental conversations. I had you know we talk about in the book the boss voice and the bitch voice But when you get so far down the path The boss voice just becomes your default setting and it's not a struggle anymore. There's no longer this like contentious Conversation happening on the inside of your brain, you know the little angel and the little devil It's just it this is what I'm doing and I don't compromise it and I think that's the power of the lifestyle in general What do you think dude? I think you're absolutely right and I'm so happy you brought up the the drinking piece Yeah, because I so specifically remembered during the program I was 24 years old living in San Diego and I would use the fact that I was doing 75 hard as an excuse to tell people I wasn't drinking Yeah, because I was insecure about that fact. Yeah, well you were you like in the life the drinking lifestyle Yeah, I was too. Yeah, so I was partying every weekend and I wanted to I wanted to go out still But I was insecure about the fact that I wasn't drinking. Yeah, which now that I think about as an entirely different reality That the one that currently live in it. Yeah, it's so wild how you progress now I'm proud to not drink Yeah, and but there was a moment there where that was part of my identity That's part of who I was yeah, and so one thing that I'm This conversation is just making me think of it's like there's a lot of people who whose identity right now listening here is I'm a drinker. Yeah, and I drink alcohol and that's an important part. Well, okay. Well Do 75 hard you have an excuse away around it in that moment so that you can eventually Be secure in the fact that you don't drink you know what was hard for me at first is because the drinking lifestyle was such a big part of my social Existence, you know, I knew the people where I would go to drink at I had my friends that drink with and it was hard for me to See my life outside of that because that was such a big part of my life and I think it's important for people to realize that once you kind of unplug from that and you see it for what it is It's really just not it's just not a healthy way to live and and I don't mean that like physically healthy I mean just overall man, you know a lot of people spend their whole lives in a bar and You know when you unplug from that and you start to recognize it You know one of the things that that really helped me realize why I didn't like it is like if you go to a bar and you imagine Imagine there being no music and imagine like all the lights on right and then imagine what that looks like right That's that's what you're at and and when you start to like imagine it like that and see it for what it is and then you see all these people When you look around and they're none of them are in shape. They all look sick. They all look 10 years older than what they are and You start to realize like dude This is just not what I want to be around and so you unplug and you start to build better relationships With people who are aligned with progress people who are aligned with healthier lifestyle and do when you're in the bar Seeing you hear that like that sounds corny. That doesn't sound fun at all But dude I can't tell you how much better. I mean I It's a It's a thousand times better. It's it's inconceivably better to to unplug yourself from that social scene and and and live a You know, I still drink occasionally, but I would say most of the time I'm sober life, right? Yeah, and it's one thing to hear that on a podcast It's another thing to have the lived experience of on day 76 you drink a beer and you're like wait, I miss the program. Yeah, and that completely shifts everything Yeah, when you actually feel winning is actually doing this and Losing is actually the thing that we do to celebrate and that was the Hugeest mind fuck for me. Wait. We're we celebrate doing the thing that hurts us. Yeah, this makes no yeah no sense I got on people for For on Twitter. I posted on my birthday. I was like, is it it so fascinating that we celebrate birthdays by cake and People were like this guy. He has no life. Yeah, and I'm like well, you're actively doing something that hurts you Yeah, where does that come from? Yeah, and why do we celebrate by doing things that actively hurt us? Yeah That makes no fucking sense to me. It doesn't to me either, but it always did before Did before and and I think that's an awareness that you have to come to on your own Dude, let me ask you this you know, we talk a lot about the benefits the mental benefits of 75 hard right the confidence the grit The the self esteem the self belief the ability to endure let's talk about some of those character traits and And how this helped you develop not just the first time through but over the last five years or so so I Mean there's so many examples, but dude you got the open mic. Yeah, so what happened was The first time I noticed the program actually making an impact on me after I had done it was when I started to meditate 60 minutes a day for from May 2020 to December of 2020 I Never I started meditating when I did the program So it was basically 75 hard plus a meditation of 15 minutes in the morning when I started and then after was over Did 20 minutes a minute I did a 60 minutes of meditation and I carried that through for the rest of the year and How do you do that you sit down close your eyes you put a blanket over you you put your feet out or put them on the floor and Just witness what comes up. We spend so much of our time in other people's worlds through Instagram through the TV Through the internet through podcasts, but what are you thinking your voice is as important as any of those that You're listening to so I realized that and I started to meditate 60 minutes a day and what I realized it was a 60-minute a day challenge for 60 days I Realized somewhere around day 30 there is no shot that I would have completed this challenge had it not been for doing 75 hard Because there was a moment where it was making an impact, but I didn't really see it and Then I said to myself I'm gonna continue doing this because I know if I get to the end of this I'm going to be a different person and I have faith that if I take the appropriate action I will be a different person and so I continued and I continued and it changed my life It changed my perception of myself and it changed everything I saw my reality shift one way it shifted in September of 2020 Was I started the podcast and because I'm meditating every day. I'm doing 75 hard and the live hard program. I'm now Talking to people I want to talk to people about my experience So so those were within one year. I mean within one year I can't do what I say I'm gonna do to now I have a podcast and I'm doing three episodes a week I mean that's a completely different reality and I'm meditating 60 minutes a day during the time when everyone's losing their mind So that was a cool moment of building mental toughness grit and Discipline what you notice is it gets bigger and bigger Just on on December 31st of this year or December 30th of 2023 rather my buddy Matt Choi text me and he says hey, do you want to run a marathon tomorrow? And said yeah, let's do it I knew I was that person who was capable of doing that But it was only because of 75 hard that I knew that I wouldn't have done that I'd run a marathon a month prior But I wouldn't have done that had not been for for do is I'd fight hard So the ways in which this program shapes you is phenomenal now when you talk about like you know When we talk about like the grit the confidence self-esteem You know as you're making this progress from someone who can't do what they say they're going to do to someone who's clearly moving Down the path of progress Did you find that The more you dug into this lifestyle the more those skills compounded for you? Absolutely, I mean, it's it's not it's not a question, but what's interesting is that Every time I think I have a figured out and every time like no, I don't need the program I go to a low that is needed where I need to recalibrate and I Think if I spend Three months off the program I'm like something's wrong something's off and and I need to change something I mean dude I went through this this breakup Three months ago three months go almost those day and I was the lowest that I've ever been in my entire life just feeling like Who am I what am I doing and it was a month of just being in absolute Distress and sorrow and sadness and It was only until my friend Taliah was like you know you mentioned doing 75 hard. I'm gonna do that. You want to do with me? I was like yes That changed my life doing it on June 15th started in the program again. So it's like yeah It's a great tool for recalibration. That's it. That's the thing is like it's you know people think You can do something once right you can go on a diet once or you can You know train for a marathon and do it once or or you can you know do 75 hard once and It's gonna stick. It's listen these skills that we talk about discipline grit fortitude self-belief confidence The ability to endure all of these things are Parishable they are things that will go down if you do not practice them if you don't practice playing the guitar You're going to get worse at guitar playing if you don't shoot on a regular basis You're going to become a worse shot. All right, if you don't shoot baskets every single day Guess what you're not going to be as good as you could be and it's note if you don't take a shower Guess what you're gonna stink and that's the thing about this this program is that that's why it's designed in a framework of one year All right, it's 75 days for those of you guys that don't know then it's phase one is 30 days phase two is 30 days and phase three is 30 days And they're all spaced out at your discretion throughout the year except phase three phase three is done 30 days Prior to the anniversary of you starting 75 hard the year before Okay, and the purpose of this is so that we can keep these skills sharp all right because just because you do 75 hard Once doesn't mean that your discipline's going to be at a high level for the rest of the year It doesn't even last that long that's the thing the what does last that long is your awareness Your awareness lasts forever because like we talked about before you're now Understanding what you're capable of you're now understanding what your potential is and what it could be if you Execute it all the time all right, but the ability to execute is a different story the your confidence staying high Your confidence isn't going to stay high all the time You're going to have dings on your confidence. You're going to have breakups. You're going to have career changes You're going to have unexpected hardships. That's called life, dude And we have to know when it's time to you know take another shower right or Recalibrate our our discipline and our toughness and our our mental fortitude and our ability you know to endure and our confidence and all these things we have to look at those As if they are sliding scales that are always moving and I like to compare this to like you know a video game right like Let's just you know madden footballs a game I used to play and you get a football player and you'd have a guy on there that had speed 99 and then strength You know he had 80 and then his agility was like 90 and they had all these different levels And if you think about yourself like that and you think about the categories being discipline grit Fortitude mental toughness confidence belief all of these self-esteem all of these things They're always moving up and down because of the environment that we're living in because nobody is so immune and So strong that they can just stay at the top level all the time nobody. There's not a single person on earth We I mean we see this in sports all the time right we see the pitcher Who's a phenomenal pitcher and then all of a sudden he loses his shit and kept throwing fucking Strike right or we see a football guy who was an amazing player all through college and then he gets to the pros and he's horrible The reason isn't skilled dude the reason is somewhere in that in that mental mindset They have allowed their Levels to go down and they haven't figured out how to replenish them So we as a cheat like do look anybody listen to this show you have Goals for achievement or else you wouldn't be listening So we all of us listening as high achievers or want to be high achievers We have to realize that we have to constantly be Assessing where we are right we have to self-assess where am I like you just said I just went through this breakup. I'm I'm really low. I need to get my shit back together Yes, I'm gonna use this tool to get it back to where it needs to be and that's how I look at the program and and that's how you should look at the program You shouldn't look at it as a cure all be all one time one stop shop. You should look at it as okay I did the program. I got the awareness I understand how to build these things and then the next step past that is being aware enough to self-evaluate as you go through your life To know when you need to sharpen the blade so to speak and those two things The the ability to execute on 75 hard once and then the ability to know when you need it again Bro, I think though if you can if you can do that. I don't think that you can I think the limits of of a human are almost non-existent because we like I said on the compounding effect The longer you do it the more you invest just like Like we say when you don't do it and it goes down the more you do it the higher it goes So the higher your levels go and and dude to be a high achiever on a high level you're competing with the best in the world So this whether you want to believe that or not you are and When you think about where your levels need to be it's it has to be something that you're you know Like when you start to let it when you start to notice that it dips You should be right on that and say are dude. It's time for me to recalibrate phase one should start now Phase two should start now right 75 hard should start now and I think that's a very very very important way To look at the at this program as a tool not as a cure. It's not a cure It's never been told never been told you I've never told you guys it was a cure It's never been presented as a cure. It's presented as a tool that we use when we You know realize that we need it Absolutely and what I was thinking about on I was so beautifully said I was on a run this morning and I realized That I am the way I am the way out of every situation I Need to get out of or every situation I want to go towards I am the way you are the way There's nobody else that's gonna come save you There's nobody else that's coming for you and and checking off your task for you You are the way for everything and if people really understood that they would get excited when the day gets hard Yeah, they would get excited when there's two workouts and it's four o'clock in the afternoon and you haven't done it Yeah, they get excited for when life throws them a curve ball because you're the way out Yeah, and when you understand that and live that you become a different person. Oh, it's a chance It's a test every single day where you have those days where it's like like dude I'm having one today to be just completely honest like today. I procrastinated so hard on training because I've just had one thing after another after another in my business life today and I didn't want to train and and I Did I had a great workout, but the point is is that you start to look at those To your point you start to look at those times as an opportunity as opposed to something that's negative, right? Like okay cool. I woke up before I still got to or I still got two workouts to go today That's an opportunity to prove to myself that I can overcome this and get this done, right? Yeah, it's midnight. I haven't got my second workout in you know what? I'm gonna do it and then when you do it Those hard workouts are the ones that pay you the most right those those critical tasks that we that we accomplish when Your back is against the wall is when you learn That you actually are capable of doing these things and so you know as you start to progress mentally Yeah, dude, I think it's absolutely true that when tests present themselves you get excited about it as opposed to Demoralized I think whenever you know what most people do. Yeah, you know what's so interesting is This is my fourth time through the program and I have not I Every single day I've gotten it done before Seven p.m. Yeah, there's been no moment where it's nine o'clock or eleven o'clock. I'm laying in bed And I'm like wow isn't that the win as well the fact that you're talking about you figured it out Yeah, that you can actually get your shit done Yeah, there's no and and I was so fascinating for me to realize is I used to procrastinate this Yeah, I used to wait until the end and that was my way of coping them But when you realize and do this program enough you realize you're gonna do it one way or another so might as well do it early Yeah, I noticed that too man the more I now that you say that Like I don't have those days anymore where I were it's midnight and I got to get out and do my thing like that's not Like if I know I'm having a hard day tomorrow meeting my schedule is packed I figured out dude. I get up an hour earlier two hours earlier or I make time to get it done because I don't want to be out doing it And dude that's a valuable skill as well the time management aspect that that this program teaches people I think is one of the biggest benefits of the program and a lot of people when they first look at it They say there's no way I have time to do all this I'm busy and then when they're like fucking I'm gonna do it They get like two weeks in and they're like dude. I actually have way more time because I know that I can't be distracted with Bullshit I can't allow people to steal my time and one of the things that was really Good for me was not just the time management, but it was also the realization of How many people and how much time was being stolen from me over nothing my tolerance for bullshit went to zero My tolerance for other people's excuses went to zero and it really showed me a lot about other people When I started figuring this out because like dude When you're living at a high standard and you're doing all these things and you're around people that aren't even trying Or you're around people that are making excuses or you're around people that are saying oh my god I'm so busy when they really don't do shit. It starts to wear you out real quick because you're paying the price It's kind of like having to do a job with like you know, it's you and four other people and we got to move this pile of Rocks from over here to over there and you're doing all the shoveling and they're not doing shit You start to be like well fuck you guys and do to eliminate a lot of the weak relationships out of your life That's something it did for me that I'm very thankful for and you know Of course people get upset about that because they're like oh, well you got too good for us No, dude. I'm just on a different path. I'm trying to squeeze out everything that I can squeeze out I'm not trying to be a normal motherfucker, dude. I'm not trying to wake up every day Go to my job get paid go home and repeat that cycle for I'm trying to be the best that I can be so that like when my time comes I can say all right, dude. You left it out there on the field bro. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? I'm not gonna have regrets now. I might have some regrets like maybe I will regret that I didn't you know Do more fun things or whatever but dude? That's just not the way I'm wired. I'm wired for achievement. I'm wired for battle and I have to have a fight, you know warrior's got to have a war and for me I Love the fact that I'm constantly getting better and I love the fact that as I'm constantly getting better The people around me and the people that I attract and the relationships that I build even now in my forties I'm meeting people who are of higher standard. I'm meeting people who hold a higher standard all of my friends now They're all you know They're all sort of the same, you know, they're not out like getting wasted in shit and they're not they're all focused They're all willing to work hard. They're all moving in the same direction and dude That feels a hell lot better than being the only guy in your circle that's like running hard You know what I mean? Yeah, when you're high energy and you're living a life that's in alignment to you It really puts a magnifying glass on the people who are not bro and when you see that and experience that you just get Excited I do to continue pushing that path because the people in my life just keep getting better and better and better Yeah, and it younger and younger ages. Yeah, so it's like I I have a 22 year old friend right now named Ben and I'm like This guy is so self-aware. He cares so much about life. He's trying so hard This guy is someone I want to be around. Yeah, and it's like where were those people when I was 22 bro That's fucking partying. That's how I thought when I met you dude. I'm real talk man. I appreciate it I tell everybody I know I'm like bro You got to talk to Danny Miranda. You got to go on and do a show. You got to listen to a show It's really really cool and I tell you this all the time and I've told you this before the It's cool to have a young guy kind of carrying that torch, you know There's very few young people out there carrying that torch of high standards You know Mac ram does it you do it? There's a couple other guys online that I really that I really enjoy their content and their persona and the example that they're setting And you know this side from all this I just think you're really setting an amazing example for the other guys around you bro Thank you. It's a big deal. It's a big fucking deal. I really appreciate that. I really appreciate. So let's talk about this brother How did it affect you like we talked about this just a minute ago, but like like your actual Roaster of friends like how did it? What happened during this whole last five years? I wonder if it's similar to what's happened with me. Yeah, dude I mean my friend just I was big in partying and drinking and that was fun But my friends now are some of the coolest most interesting in sightfall hardworking people I know yeah and I I'm so blessed. I live in Austin, Texas and the only reason I live in Austin, Texas is because the people there are So in alignment with who I am and my friends are Everybody you know you know what I was thinking about the other day my friends are People who get shit done on their own and I trust them 100% to get the job done and they trust me 100% to get the job done myself. Why cuz I proved it? Yeah the podcast with my meditation with my working out like I've proved that I can do things on my own And they've proved they could do things on their own too and together we come and do things together and that is such a special relationship Because we don't need anything from anyone. Yeah, we're not using each other to validate ourselves Yeah, we're not using each other so that we could have this habit We like doing the habits that we like doing on our own and together we come together Yeah, and we get better. Yeah, it's the best thing in the world dude. That's that's that's what it's about That's what friends should be right friends shouldn't be people that drag you off course Like it's weird to me how many people I get this all the time from the show people who They feel like because they grew up with people or because they knew people in high school or in college They feel this sense of loyalty towards them even though those people don't do anything But bring negative into their life right gossip drama alcohol party and You know Criticism of your goals and dreams like dude you guys have to understand you have to cut that loose Being successful and becoming a high achiever in any area of life is Super super super super super rare and super fucking hard Okay, that's why it's rare and if you think you're gonna be the first person in the history of the fucking world To carry a bunch of dead-weight mother fuckers to the finish line. You're insane It's not gonna happen for you bro So like you have to figure out who you are you have to become that person and then you will see these other great people start to Materialize around you, you know one of them the the questions that we get frequently is How do I find more friends that are of high level? How do I network better? Listen dude. How do I find a better girlfriend or a better boyfriend like listen? Listen, you have to become what it is you desire you have to become the person That you desire in your life from the other person whether that's a relationship or whether that's a friendship or whether that's You know whatever it is You have to become that and then when you become that it attracts the other ones to you Okay, you don't go out there as a piece of shit and get to hang out with the world champions, bro Like that's not how it works. You don't get to be a shitty fucking athlete and go hang out with the New England Patriots No, you have to be good and then they're like hey come hang out with us and that's how this works, dude So you guys out here who feel like you know, yeah, man I want to get better and yeah, I want to do better and yeah, I want to have better friends and I want a network Okay, cool become the kind of person that you want to attract and those people will surround you Automatically you won't have to try you won't have to go network They will just find you bro because it's so rare that when you find somebody like that you know it like like Like you know what I'm saying when you meet someone who's special who's who's driven who's disciplined who is one of these people who Gets done what they say they're gonna do you know it right away so It's an automatic thing so like dude you guys have to understand It's not find the group and then work to fit in it's Become the person and create your own group because they the those people will find you that's right And here's the thing people listen to podcasts because often they're in the middle period. Yeah, the middle man's land No man's land is an important piece to talk about you you have these habits or you have this these friends that you grew up with and Now you say okay, I'm gonna do 75 hard and I'm gonna be a different person But guess what in between you having the group that you want to be around and you your current life That's the middle period. Yeah, and the middle period you have to have faith in the middle period that you're doing what you say You're gonna do you're building yourself into the person that you want to be and just have faith it will work out Yeah, and it will I'm living proof of it I've the best friends in the world and it's only because I waited the middle period and I didn't Sacrifice my progress because I could have friends that were not in alignment with the person that I wanted to be Dude, it's super super important to talk about this because so many people Will limit their own life and their own success based around other people standards of what success looks like and what I mean by that is Is what Danny's talking about? Okay? You grew up with this group of friends from high school and you decide that you're going to go out and you're going to become A successful businessman who has his whole life together and these people, you know, they're happy where they want to be and that's okay I'm not judging, but they're happy working their regular job coming home drinking Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday They're happy with that because they're unaware just just so we understand each other. That's why they're happy ignorance is bliss That's the saying and then you start to move away from that, okay? And this is where that phrase lonely at the top comes from because you start to make progress Maybe you get a better career or you get in better shape or all of that right and your life starts to come together in a little bit better way And you get in this area and I call it no man's land Where you don't have many friends all right and and you know What most people do at this point in time is they get really uncomfortable because it is uncomfortable when you don't know how to what it is When you don't know to expect it, it's very very very uncomfortable. You're like fuck I have I've alienated my friends I've you know I've lost all my people I don't have no I'm gonna end up alone I'm a diolone holy shit and you freak the fuck out and then you start to go back to their group Because you are afraid of continuing to move forward But what you'll find is that when you continue to move forward is like we're talking about here You will begin to attract these other people who are no longer making fun of you for your goals They're no longer talking shit when you say I'm going to do this big impossible crazy thing They're saying yeah, dude. You should how can I help right and this changes your entire life because now you're not Surrounded by anchors now you've got a few propellers in the boat right and then if you keep going and if you level up even again The same thing will repeat itself and it will keep repeating itself over and over over the higher that you go and Every time there'll be one or two people that decide to go with you and the rest will stay there and yes You'll maintain Amicable decent relationships with those people, but you're not gonna be with them all the time And so what you guys have to understand is that when you start to progress You are going to feel alone at first and it's going to be uncomfortable But if you keep going your life gets so much better and so much more fulfilling and quite honestly so much easier because you have People around you that are now pushing you down the path as opposed to trying to hold you back from the path And that's that's an amazing thing If you can withstand the time that you're alone and most people have a problem with that and I think it's because they don't expect it I think it's because they don't know you know How do you know something that you don't know? How do you know something that you never experienced and? You guys that are out there like right now I know there's a lot of you because like I said we have a lot of high achievers and ambitious people here You guys you know, you guys that are feeling alone and feeling like man, you know I just fuck let us be your fucking friends bro. Look come here. We're here in almost every day. All right We're out here like I always say this shit on my Instagram story We worked together. We win together Follow Danny bro. He's working every fucking day. We're we may not talk every day But I guarantee you bro We live the example every single day and until you find that new group let us be your group. All right Well, this is why I set up my daily commitment because I want to help people do 75 hard to work in that middle period of their life So I'm I'm creating a program where you do 75 hard we'll do a call a week Let me be your friend. Let's go and have I'll have the forum for you to come to yeah So send me a message. It's like that is I Created the my program because of that. Yeah, the 75 hard community is very very supportive dude. Yeah, there's a very there's a also an official Facebook group on Facebook But dude, you don't even have to do that all you got to do is go through to 75 hard hashtag You'll find fucking Thousands of people doing it in any given time and DM them, you know, yeah, I took them be the accountability for each other Yeah, it makes a huge difference It does it the first time was because I had a friend Tejdosa who every day we would text each other at the end of the day and say we completed this day and it's like that was the thing Yeah, that we did that to the first time it's important first time I did it Well, obviously me being the person that made it the first time I did it I knew I couldn't fucking fail like I was like there if I fail I'm fucked and We also had a group with with my companies with Submit super stores and first form of a bunch of guys who did it the first time with me and every day We'd all be like telling because like it was the first time through ever we'd all be sharing notes like how they felt and I remember like Dude the first time I got through a full week Meaning Monday through Sunday and I was on the next Monday and I had it like I've made it bro I thought I I was like dude fuck yeah, like that was a huge win for me because I was always the person who couldn't go A full week without cheating on their diet or or even like three or four days I was that guy and I was the guy, you know who would get three or four days into a diet and be like all right, man You deserve a reward right and then I would reward myself with the shit that I was trying to get away from You know and when you think about that psychologically You know you can't ever really get away from the bad habits living like that You have to go an extended period of time without you know when we talk about like What it's like to be in this culture of alcohol and food? You know we have to drink we have to eat to survive and These things become so normal to us that it's almost impossible to quit like think of someone who's addicted to food bro Like for real I was a food addict I had no control over what somebody put in front of my face none if somebody put something in front of my face I had to eat it and I know that sounds like really ridiculous But I had zero control and for me That's the equivalent of You know, I'm being told hey, you have to eat less. You have can't eat all the shit But you have to eat all right and I was also an overeater So so think about that how hard that is to quit when you have cheat meals Inside the framework of that because what you're telling somebody for real is like okay You're you're a heroin addict and you got to quit doing this because you're doing too much of it But you got to do a little bit or else you'll die Okay, now think how hard that is for a fucking addict so so now Oh and by the way on Saturday because you did good you can get highs you got all is what you want How can you ever get over it? You can't okay, so we have to understand that That mentally we have to go without for an extended period of time to prove to ourselves that we are capable of doing it And I remember that dude that was one of the key lessons for me the first time I went through when I got that Eighth day in and I was like bro I made it through a whole week and a weekend Perfect bro, that was very powerful for me. You know what's so fascinating about that is how often Before the program I believe that the conditions were dictating the actions and so all right Friday Saturday Sunday that means drink all right the weather is bad out that means don't work out. Yes, and now it's I Create the conditions. Yes, no matter what yes, and I am capable of doing what I'm supposed to do no matter what dude If you are the kind of person that can execute see dude this is this is the key okay We're really hitting on the keys to success in life in anything right here this point Look dude Most people cannot operate they cannot execute unless conditions are absolutely perfect and the problem with that is is that Conditions are very rarely perfect So if you can learn to execute when things are imperfect or even when things are chaotic You are in a massive advantage over someone who is like everybody else who can only move when shit is perfect 70 degrees outside perfectly sunny not a rain in the sky nothing's going wrong in my life And I got a great day in today no bro You have to be able to do it when it's perfect you have to be able to do it when it's minus 30 and there's a foot of snow on the ground You have to be able to do it when it's 105 and it's how to shit or it's storming It doesn't matter bro, and if you can understand and and those are those are metaphorical things right the storm and the snow These represent hardships and inconveniences and difficult times in our lives bad days, you know Our girlfriend leaves us we get divorced our dog passes away. These are difficult things we lose somebody These things happen man. It's called life and we have to be able to operate at high levels Regardless of what's going on in life over the cumulative okay now I understand and the no way is shape or form by saying that you lose your spouse and you're supposed to do your workouts that day That's out the fuck I'm saying what I'm saying is that you need to be able to pull yourself out and you need to know how to get back on track Quickly and you have to operate over the cumulative time of your life at a higher standard wind times are not ideal because most of the times They won't be and if you can become that person that can execute whether it's storming whether it's sunny whether it's raining whether it's snowing whether it's hot whether it's cold Bro, you were at a tremendous advantage over everybody else and people will say well I'm not competing with everybody else. Yes, you are you absolutely are you just don't you you bought into this bullshit society If someone else can only execute three days out of the month that are perfect and you can execute 30 You are doing ten times the amount of shit is that person you are going to win infinitely more and infinitely more frequent and and just more in general so You know that's that's the key dude. That's the key along with along with Along with being able to repeat the day one over and over you know People would come up to me and they'd be like how do you how do you do three episodes a week of your podcast when I was doing it? Yeah, it's like bro are you kidding me? You can't do three episodes a week I don't care if you're working another you can do three episodes a week If you commit yourself to it and you know you hold a standard for yourself, that's it Yeah, just we're doing three. We're doing three. Yeah, you could do five. You could do seven Yeah, you could do wherever the heck you want. Yeah, it's not a like people are so shocked at the smallest bit of success It's like you executing three episodes a week, you know I Mox podcast go to 20 episodes So you do do three episodes a week for Five weeks six weeks seventh seven weeks by the seventh week You've done more podcast episodes than 99% Us right, that's right bro But most people when they start a podcast or whatever dude they they buy five episodes if they're not ranked in the top 100 They quit it's like bro. Do you understand? There's millions of podcasts. It's the hardest social platform to get traction on by far Yeah, it's the hardest which is why I don't do any of the other social I just do that right because I got the momentum there. I'm gonna fucking good stay there Dude let's talk about this. What about your reading? I love for eating. Yeah, so let's talk about some of your favorite books man Yeah, so two books have changed my life forever Map of consciousness explained by David Hawkins the surrender experiment by Michael Singer and those are two books that Re-shape who I was as a human being and help me understand that there's One thing is that love rules all and when I say love rules all 75 hard is the greatest Example of giving love to yourself every day so that you can give love to other people and I'm not just talking about love in this Light and fairy white like the real practicality of love. What does loving yourself mean? Loving yourself means doing what you say you're gonna do and holding a high standard for yourself and What that book by David Hawkins show me is that the better that we can get at Loving another person the better we can get at showing love the more amazing things come into our lives So that starts with who you are and what you do every single day which 75 hard show me The other book the surrender experiment by Michael Singer Told me that there's a lot going on here that we are not in control of 75 hard shows you you are in control of a lot of your life and you if you do the task every day You can control how you feel But then there's also a lot that's happening that is outside of my control I didn't know on August 8th, 2024. I'd be here. That's outside of my control I just show up every day and do what I'm supposed to do right I don't control when I meet certain friends or How certain opportunities come in you don't control that we always do a show up with how we can show up So surrender to what you don't have control over is a really important thing that the surrender experiment by Michael Singer show me So those are two books. I'm currently reading how champions think by Dr. Bob Rattella Which is more in line of the habits the routines? But what I love about this program in general is that it's made me consistent with reading right? I've always been somebody who would love reading but would be inconsistent with it. How do you think I's benefit to you? It's made me realize that If I'm in the process of reading I'm in the process of learning from somebody who took time out of their life To put together these thoughts that were then edited by someone else over a period of years that now I'm Getting access to that information. Yeah reading and podcasting are examples of time travel Yeah, absolutely dude. It somebody else is in a different place in a different time giving you information in that moment How is that not the coolest thing ever dude? It's weird to me that people don't understand how To value that kind of thing right like Dude when you read a book, okay, when I read a book If I take you know, I'm not a very fast reader, you know, like I don't I don't mow through books They I it takes me time to read and comprehend so I act of read meaning I read things and I take notes and I read parts of it and I take notes Dude, I'm reading that entire book for one fucking concept one thing I don't know what it is when I open the book, but it's one thing and Whatever that one thing is I know is going to benefit my life immensely and probably make me a whole bunch of money a whole bunch, okay, and it's weird to me How people don't value Information properly like right like if you're if you let's say bought an audio course from someone and it costs $200 and it's Fucking seven days long or whatever right and making this shit up and you get one fucking concept out of that and it cost you 200 bucks and that concept over the course of your life I mean do what's that worth you see what I'm saying and I think whenever you start to value reading and value information properly by understanding that like dude. I'm not trying to I'm not a book connoisseur where I'm trying to rate the book Oh the whole book was it was an a plus or it was a C I didn't like the way that his grammar was no We're looking for that one or two things You know what I'm saying that are gonna benefit us and and dude when we could take someone's life and Put it into a book like bro. There's this book About Sam Walton it was the first book I ever read. It's called made in the USA or made in America of Sam Walton first book I ever read my life Which is kind of ironic because like here. I'm not now. I'm here. I never intended to be here when I was there but and but you read this book and It's this man the one of the greatest entrepreneurs ever Takes his whole fucking philosophy and puts it in a fucking 250 page book this guy made Walmart, bro. He rev revolutionized retail. He made He his children are the richest people in the fucking world, right? Like if they didn't have it split up six seven different ways. It's the biggest empire ever created and you know To be able to read that and a couple hours. It's like you think what's that worth? So you think you're not gonna learn something? Yeah from the guy who created the thing that you see everywhere Yeah, it's like anybody yeah, and dude you can read a book about anybody shit like bro You go read shoot-dog you could read like whatever it is. You're trying to learn about man. It's just a highly highly undervalued underutilized skill set and I see a lot of people on the internet that I don't read Well, and I automatically think I'm like well, you're a dumb mother fucker then. Yeah, cuz like dude you're turning your back to like complete life lessons of some of the smartest people that ever lived yeah And and what I love about the program to the 10 pages often I'm reading 20 30 40 50 and It's the fact that I can know all right tends to baseline. That's the minimum that we accept for ourselves When I'm in the process of finish this chapter I'll get to the next one and so there's something really magical about 10 pages is small enough where it seems so easy to To get done that I end up wanting to read more. Yeah, absolutely Well brother listen man We're gonna close the show, but I'd like to give you a few minutes to speak to the people about why they should do 75 hard. I know you talk about it a lot, but you know Just let it rip man and let people know what you think. Yeah, man. I There's no program that I've come across that has changed more lives and more specifically changed my life than 75 hard And the reason for that is build my discipline built my mental toughness and given me the tool that I need to go back to anytime I want to become all I can be and I sit here before you today feeling the best I've ever felt in my entire life feeling most energetic most alive Most like myself and the reason for that is because I've done 75 hard over and over and over and over again and failed and And got back to ways that I don't want to be but that's such a beautiful thing to know that it's always there I'm always 30 days away from the person I want to be that's right and it's because 75 hard and so I am I feel indebted to the program I will be talking about this program for the rest of my life I will be doing this program for the rest of my life. I will help people through this program because I know Who I've become as a result somebody who is loving who is caring who is disciplined who's focused who's able to do what he says He's gonna do who's able to help other people in the process who's able to use his gifts and I just want everyone to experience what it feels like to live in your purpose 100% of the time Day by day by day action by action every moment getting a little bit better a little bit better Getting a little bit worse all getting a lot better and over and over and over again And I want everyone to experience that so I want everyone to do 75 hard because it's really has changed my life Well brother listen, dude.
