What is up guys, it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realist's sake about the lives of fitness and illusions. I'm Otterson Sagan, welcome to Motherfucking Reality. Guys today we have Q and AF, a little midweek Q and AF. I was gonna do a real talk, but I was just feeling Q and AF man, so we're gonna throw it at you. Right over this way, catch it. Yeah, I caught it man, I caught it. Like I caught AIDS. What the fuck? That was so love feel, I'm just saying. Anyway, I want the show. This is how this works. You guys asked questions, do we answer them? Typically this is about personal development, winning business, life success. Sometimes we talk about what's going on in the world, you can ask really whatever you want and we'll answer the questions. So, for those of you that don't know, the backbone of this show was the MFCO project. It was the number one entrepreneurial podcast in the world. And so we like to keep that part of the show alive through these Q and AF. So if you want to submit a question, you can. You can do so a couple different ways. The first way is you guys, you can email those questions and ask Andy at AndyFrasola.com or you can go in the comments section of YouTube and you can type out your question in the comments and we'll answer it from there as well. Other times you tune in, we're gonna have CTI, CTI stands for cruise the internet. And ironically, the internet does not like to be cruised by us. So those shows really need to be shared out. We need your help there, right? We get throttle, band, whatever you want to call it all the time there. So we need your help sharing those. Other times we have real talk, real talk just five to 20 minutes and me giving you some real talk. Then we have 75 hard versus that's where people who've completed 75 hard come on the show and talk about how their life was before. How their life is after the progress they made and how you can make the same amount of progress. If you're unfamiliar with 75 hard is the world's most famous mental recalibration program. And you get it for free. It is the initial phase of the live hard program, which is a sustainable lifestyle for those of you that don't understand the program. Go to episode 208 and listen to it. You get it for free. And if you want to know the ins and outs of the nuts and bolts, you can buy my book. It's called the book on mental toughs. It explains the whole live hard program plus a whole bunch of other chapters on mental toughness. Why it's important. Why you need it, how to cultivate it and how to use it to improve your life. Other than that, we don't run ads on the show. You'll notice that if you listen to any other podcast after listening to the show, you will be ruined because we don't stop the show 17 times to talk about shit that we don't use. Just because someone's giving us a few binge mints. I don't like to answer anybody. So I keep the show ad free. And in exchange, I ask very simply that you buy my shit and then share the show, which means pay the fee. Okay. That means share it that makes you think, if it makes you laugh, it gives you a new perspective. Share it out there. Don't be a hoe. Sure. The show. All right. But first of all, this is for my sponsors, guys. We're going to be doing this. This is definitely not an ad. But we do have this amazing new first form energy and dream berry. I haven't tasted it. Why don't you crack it open there? Because you're afraid of a little election camp. What are you pussy? I'm balls deep in caffeine right now. I can pussy over there, man. Double up, double fist, those energy drinks like a man. Do it. Yeah. Get some more tattoos and shit. That's a pop loud. Otherwise, you're not a man. You're just a bitch. Holy shit. That's the first time that that's the first time I try it. That's fucking good. Do you have one of these? Have you? These are fucking good. Taste like dreams. Yeah. Taste like berries. This is good. Stream berry. This is good. This is a top flavor. This is top two, three flavors, man. This is up there with orange. Yeah, aerated. And tropic lightning. Yeah, aerated. Is that what we call it? Air rating. The flavor. The taste buds. Keeping the palate aerated. That's good. I think it's fucking phenomenal. I'd say I give that a solid. It's phenomenal, DJ. You want. It's phenomenal, DJ. It's not just good. He wants to taste my dream berry. It actually is really tropical. Traffic light. That might be number two, but tropical. I don't know, man. That's fucking good. Joe, have you eaten this? We're getting better at this game recently. Eating ass. He tasted some of my dream berry. Oh, cleanse his palate with it. I'm all that ass. Anyway, let's get better today, guys. Anyway, yeah. By this drink, it's actually real to firstform.com. You can get some, but probably not because by the time you look, it's going to be sold out. I like the cans, too. This is a sweet can. Yeah, you're welcome. You guys made great cans. First one has nice cans. Nice cans are a plus. Everybody loves nice cans. I'm just saying you guys got the best ones. I know. All right. What? Hey, this is not CTI. This is professional time. Let's get fucking. CTI is fuck around time. This is professional time. Stop fucking around, guys. Yeah. That's them. Fucking. Let's get better. Butch a lazy motherfucker. All right, let's do the show. Let's get into it, man. Guys, Andy, I got three good ones for you, man. Let's get into this, guys. Andy, question number one. Andy, I'm a manager in my company. We have around 60 employees. I manage chin of them. And our CEO is now implementing AI and has already cut and fired a team and replaced them with AI. He says it's for the longevity of the company and ensures the management team will be fine if more cuts are made. As a member of the NADA host squad, I obviously believe that it's wrong. And it's not good for the people. Any advice on how I should move forward? Man, this is such a hard thing to balance because Pandora's box has already been open. And they've created a hard, difficult economic situation where businesses are having to do. Well, here, look, let me explain you what I think is going on. All right. What I see going on is an intentional downgrade and an intentionally created hardship for medium size, small, and the smaller, large businesses. Everybody who's not a global court. This started in 2020 when they closed all the small businesses and they allowed the bigger companies to stay open and swallow up all that business. And the residual effects of that have been real. If you drive down the street of any city, you're going to see restaurants that used to be there that are no longer there. And some of them were there for 100 years. We could go on and on and on and talk about the damage that was created there. But if you look at what's going on in the big picture and we look at how the money is intentionally being devalued through over printing, sending the money overseas, which is clearly money laundering if you guys are paying attention in any way, shape, or form. We look at all of this manufactured hardship that's happening in our economy. And in my opinion, the reason that the hardship is being manufactured is that it's going to force companies to implement AI solutions to trim their labor force, which puts more of the employees in the government dependency class, which is ultimately their goal. Their goal is to create a class of people who are completely dependent on the government. And they're trying to sell this to people in a whole bunch of different ways. You know, it'll be great. Universal-based income will take care of all your needs. You won't have to own anything. You'll be super happy. They tell everybody all this shit, but nobody's buying it, right? So when you try to sell something to someone and they don't want it, the next move is they're going to force it on you. And so what I observe happening in the business environment is the forced implementation of AI through intentional economic hardship. Follow what I'm saying. So for a company to stay afloat, a lot of these companies are going to have to trim their employees and their departments and replace what they can with AI to reduce costs because it's getting harder to run a business. That's what you're saying. Price of goods are going to cost labor. Everything's going up. Everything's going up. So I got you over. Yes. So companies are being forced to adopt this technology. And what that does is, you know, the companies are going to survive, but it removes all the in-person jobs and creates that dependency class, which is what the people that are in charge of all this shit intend to do. And so ultimately, what's the solution here? OK. The solution here is to support companies as a consumer that employ actual human beings and do as much to create jobs and workforce as possible. But unfortunately, companies that do that are still going to feel the economic pressure. So there's going to come a point in time where a new balance is had, I guess, so to speak, or found where there's technology and people. And because people have jumped at every technological advancement for the last 20 years without thinking about it, we are now in this position where the technology is actually costing people their careers. And if you don't understand what's going on, go look at how many people Facebook just laid off. Go look at how many people, the big tech companies are laying off. These are people who showed up every day for years and years and years contributing to the development of this technology. And now we're getting fired because of it. And unfortunately, humans are short-sighted. And people don't think outside what the ramifications could be of something that's new and neat and convenient right now. And so the real solution here on a large scale is that the cultural thing to do in America will have to be to support companies that employ real people as much as possible. And I don't know if that's going to happen. And at the end of the day, dude, people are going to survive. They're going to make sure their company survive. And this should be a real concerning thing for any employee out there and also any business. If you're an employee right now of a business, you should be thinking, how can I provide as much value as I can over the top? Because the alternative is you're going to be replaced by technology and you're going to be sitting at home and you're going to be capped on what you can get. Because no one else is going to be hiring either. All right, so if you're an employee right now and I'm giving you some real free game, the next two years are going to be crucial to your entire life because you're either going to become an irreplaceable value-apart of the organization that you're in or you're going to be replaced by technology to never ever be able to move past the class that you're the economic class that you're in at that point. So it's very important for people as employees to understand this because this is reality. And unfortunately, I tried to warn people back before it even came out many, many times, but it does seem to be working. And we find these examples of these companies who are replacing their entire sales force, their entire customer service force, all on AI tech. And you have all these influencers out here bragging about how awesome AI is and how cool AI is. And it's putting people out of fucking jobs for real. It's ruining people's lives. Nobody's even talking about it or thinking about it. And it's all selfish greed. Remember how I said, I don't know, if you hadn't listened, but two years ago, I told you guys that the way this would work was they would appeal to people's greed. They would appeal to what money can be made quick and easy with AI. You know, I can write a whole blog post today with no effort. I can do this in that in this. And that's what's happened. We have tons of influencers who brag about AI, who try to teach all the AI hacks. And it's ruining careers and jobs on a massive scale. And people don't give a fuck because they're making a little money right now teaching it. You see what I'm saying? So they appeal to the greed. It's now out there. It's like the genie is out of the bottle. And now you have this difficult economic situation where companies either have to adopt it or they have to get real effective with their staff. You know? But that's one thing too. I don't think most people like think of it. I think most people, when they hear that and they see these business owners converting to AI, it's like, oh, well, that owners, he's just a piece of shit. He just likes AI, whatever the case is. No, no, no, that's not the case. A lot of them are like you're being forced to survive. Yeah, listen to the economy right now. If you're in business and you own a company, you know. Okay, most Americans, the majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck right now. It's like 70%. Okay. It's like, I forgot what the stat was, but a large percentage of people to make over 100K can't even make it between gaps in their bills. Okay. So yeah, I covered the stat about a month ago on the show, but I forgot what it was, but it was considerable. It wasn't the majority, but it was like 30% or 40%. I believe. But the point is, is that you have to understand work because the consumer did not discern when it came out and say, hey, I'm not buying from a company that uses AI. Now we're in a situation where companies that are using it are able to survive and companies that aren't, aren't. Okay. So here's the, here's the silver lining. All right. If you own a company, people still want to deal with people. They want to have an over the top experience. And AI can't really do the in person shit the way that people can do it. So you're going to have to be good. You're going to, actually, you're not going to have to be good. You're going to have to be great at what you do. You're going to have to connect with people. You're going to have to connect with them in a real way. And that will help insulate you from, from this. But at the end of the day, nobody's going to be insulated completely because if you want to look at what's happened to Amazon over the last 20 years, they've implemented as much technology as possible and they've become the biggest company in the world because there's no regulations around what they do. You know, the fact that they have an entire, you know, their entire warehouse is are pretty much automated and they don't employ people. But yet for the first 15 to 17 years of their business, they didn't have to collect sales tax. So they got a 10% price advantage over brick and mortar retail without employing any employees. The government gave them that. You see what I'm saying? This has all been part, this has been part of the strategy for a long time. They, the government allowed them to do that. Understand, this is a, this is an attack on small business, attack on medium business. They do not want the American entrepreneur to survive. They want all of those people depending on the government and they want to pay your peanuts and they want you to be poor and they want you to be a little slave. And unfortunately, people don't vote with their dollars the way that they should. You know what I'm saying? Like, you should be supporting and spending with companies that like, I know there's a lot of people listening that say, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then go home and order from Amazon for real. They go home and they order the most convenient shit. And so at the end of the day, what people say they're about is not what they're about and it's going to end up costing their careers. So to this situation with your boss, I would probably say he's probably in a bind and he's probably in a place where he has to cut some overhead and this is a solution to do so. And so you're going to have to figure out a way to create value out of your inhuman, your human workforce that prevents him from actually having to make those decisions because those decisions, no one's going to sink their company on that principle. Like, no one. It's not going to happen. You know what I'm saying? Like, I'm going to tell you this. This is just real shit. I employ real people. We don't use AI for shit like that for anything. All right. But if it gets down to it and we're fucking on the fence and if we're going to ask people, but we're going to have to make that change. And it's because consumers are valuing the good American companies that actually employ real people the way that they should. So it's a consumer cultural behavior change I just required that's not happening fast enough. And that's unfortunate, dude, because it's going to end up with a whole bunch of people, working class people who are sitting at home, collecting a very minuscule amount of money, not enough money at home. They're going to be renting. They're going to be, it's going to be apartment, pod living on universal basic income. And we could have stopped it by just saying, hey, I'm going to spend my dollars with companies that employ real people. Like my companies for real. And that's not just a pitch for me, but you should be discerning about where you spend your money. You should spend your money. You shouldn't be spending your money with big restaurant chains that have 4,000 locations. You should be going to the mom and pop local business. You shouldn't be spending your money on a company like Amazon, when Amazon isn't like sponsoring your kids fucking T-ball teams and shit, right? You should be a little inconvenience to shop at places that are actual companies owned by medium and small and large companies that employ real people. That's where you should be spending your money. And until Americans get wise to that, we're going to continue to lose this battle. And what's the ramification of it is is that the entire middle class working class people are going to be on universal basic income and be fucking like optionless and their lives. So it's consumer behavior problem. Yeah, I love it. People say, oh yeah, dude, I want to shop with this company because they stand for American values. And I want to shop with this company because they employ actual human beings. But then they'll go right on their phone and fucking order off of Amazon and not think two things of it. And it's like, bro, you're killing your own future by doing that. You're killing your own future by shopping at places like that. And people just don't connect those dots. So it's a big problem that needs to be corrected. I love it, man. Guys, any question number two? Hi, Andy, I'm a 31 year old physician in my final year of residency training to become a physician. I might have completed 12 years of medical education. However, I don't know shit about anything besides what I've learned in medical school. And even that is question will given the state of a highly unethical medical former system. I am determining if I want to specialize further in cardiology or finish my medical training this year and start my own medical practice. Regardless, I know I want to build my own medical practice either as a cardiologist or general practitioner when I'm done with training. What advice do you have for a physician with no business knowledge or experience outside of medicine who wants to build his own practice without the influence of the brain wash from a medical industry? Yeah, first of all, I love this question. And the reason I love this question is because you're obviously a highly intelligent person. And most doctors are not intelligent. Okay, this is the truth. Most doctors think because they went to school for 12 years that they're gonna come out and they automatically know everything about, have you ever tried a debated doctor on anything? Oh, fuck. They're fucking think they fucking know everything because they went to medical school to learn about intestines and they inside of a body. But yet they know everything about business and they know everything about politics and they know everything about everything. And it's a massive ego problem in the medical and law profession. And this is why so many doctors and so many lawyers end up going broke. So the fact that you understand that you don't know shit about business is a huge advantage over everybody else. Because most of these doctors are terrible business people, the worst business people. Okay, you can't get any better at something if you think you already know it. And that's what these people are like. So the fact that you are even open to the idea that you don't know what you're doing is an amazing thing, bro. And I commend you for doing that because clearly you insulated yourself from whatever ego disease these people have. All right, so that's my first take. And my second take here is, how would you go about opening a practice or how would you go about being independent? I don't know the details of how you would structure that because that's not my expertise. But what I would recommend you do is to find other doctors who have done that and learn from them. There's tons of tons of doctors who have made incredible businesses out of doing things outside of the status quo. Okay, like Dr. T.J., my doctor, all right? Or Dr. Gabriel, my other doctor, all right? These doctors have built incredible businesses, Dr. Twyman. You know what I'm saying? Incredible independent practices by doing things outside the box. So what I would do is I would start calling these people or getting in touch with these people, asking them for an hour of their time, taking notes, learning from their mistakes, and that start there because they're gonna be able to jump you far ahead, any advice I could give you right here on the show. All right, but just be open, try to find people who've already been down the path, learn from them and keep that humility that you have about learning when it comes to business. I'm 25 years into my business journey and I still don't know shit. I know a little bit more than most of you guys because I've been doing it longer, but there's so much I don't know. All right, and if you keep that attitude, you'll keep getting better. That's the cool thing about entrepreneurship. You never stop getting a better at it. The older you get, the longer you've been doing it, the bigger competitive advantage you have. Like you know how many young people I see that think they're, I'm doing it, and I'm like, you're making all these mistakes and I can clearly see them, but do I interrupt them? No, because you don't interrupt your enemy when they're making mistakes, all right? That's, you just don't do it, all right? But like when you're an older person and you have experience, you can keep getting better in the game. And if you keep that attitude, I don't know very much, you just keep getting better and better and better and better and better. And dude, I think that's one of the first times I've ever had a question from a medical professional that actually admitted that they don't know what the fuck they're doing. So I think that's actually gonna probably be a real big move for a lot of them. I mean, you see there was a lot of awakening in 2020, right? With all of the stuff going on. So maybe there's gonna be a bigger push to private practice and stuff like this. Well, I also think that, I also think that there's a demand for it. I mean, people don't like going to a hospital and they don't like sitting in the ER for seven hours to be told, you know, they can't even be treated. And then as they want to, like the hospitals have become a huge, just marketing system. You know, if you go to the ER for a broken fucking finger, they're gonna keep you in the ER for seven hours and then they're gonna tell you we need to keep you overnight and monitor to you. To get free broken things. Yeah, right. And then they're gonna charge you 100K. Like, bro, it's a business and everybody recognizes that. Remember the last time I had to go to the ER and there was that young girl who was in there. That was six. The company worker, yeah. Bro, it's not a real thing for the average American person anymore and people who are looking for alternatives. They're looking for people outside of these networks and these global corp conglomerate of medical bullshit that nobody can like operate with. Yeah, well, the charge of premium prices for bullshit service. Yeah, that's the problem. I don't care if I gotta pay 100 grand. Yeah, but I'm gonna be in an out and fucking 15, 20 minutes. Fist, I mean, the thing is, it's like, dude, it shouldn't, you know, when you go in the hospital and they give you some aspirin and it costs you $700. That's not okay. And Walgreens is right across the street. Yeah, that, listen, that is, that is the problem with the medical system and everybody's recognizing it. So I think there's a massive market for people that want to work outside that. But setting up a practice and doing all that, all the same principles apply once you have it set up. It's servicing your customers in an amazing way. It's making it remarkable so that they talk about it when they leave your practice. Word of mouth is always gonna be your best top of funnel putting people in your top of funnel marketing that you can do. And that just requires you doing a great job for people going above and beyond and doing things in such a way that they can't help but tell their friends about. And those things actually, you know, if you do those things well, it's kind of hard to fuck that up. You know what I mean? So, you know, I would find some doctors that, that you know who have done what it is you're trying to do. I would try to learn from them. If you can't get them on the phone, fucking pick apart what they do from the outside, the best you can. That's all I ever did. I was just a student of all the companies that I wanted our company to be like. I wasn't able to call people and talk to them. I just watched them and I dissected every single move they made and wonder why they made it and I figured it out and eventually I started doing it and then eventually we surpassed them all. But at the, and that's what we do now, you know, like when I look at companies that we're trying to beat, I look at companies and I try to break down all the moves they make and I say, okay, they're doing this. Why are they doing that? Why do they do this? How do they do that? And I just become a student of these other companies in a highly detailed way. And I try to learn everything I can about them, break it down and then make a plan about how I'm going to go about beating them over the next 10 years. You know what I mean? So yeah, that's why I vice on that, man. I love it. Yeah, I like the fact that I like the fact that he's open to learning. Like the ego problem with doctors and attorneys is absurd. And don't get a fucking portion 9-11 either. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I can only one in nine years. Yeah, cause I just the ultimate doctor car. The ultimate doctor car is a, it's not even, it's a low level entry level portion 9-11. And then everywhere they go, they leave the key keys on the table. So everybody can see the fucking key chain. You know, they park in the fucking, they double park the car. Like bro, that's, it's every single one of them deals. So why don't you, like real, real, real vice, like for all you doctors, quickie and douchebags. I'm just being real. You know, when I go to the hospital, you know where I park? Yeah. I park in the park. I park in the doctor park. I did it. You know why? Cause I want them all to fucking know. Yeah. Hey, damn, who's that doctor? That's right. That's right. That's right. I drive something that's going to shit all over every single one of them and I park in their spot. Yeah, I love it. You guys call me a douchebag all you want. Bro, these people need to be humbled. It's real shit. Sometimes you got to do it. That's right. Yeah. Guys, Andy, our third and final question question number three, Andy, I'm 32 years old. And I feel like I just woke up and realized that I haven't kept my promises that I made to myself back when I was 18 or 20. Something is just meek and blah. I sleep to go to work. I work to go to sleep. And the problem is I feel like I can't really pinpoint where exactly I lost my ability to dream and make goals. I can't figure out where I messed up. And I feel like knowing that will help me pick up where I left off. I know that the first step is to go, but my question is where. Got any advice or thoughts on this? Well, nobody's going to tell you where you want to go, bro. Like you have to sit down and make a decision. Most people fail their entire lives because they're capable of making a decision about who they want to become and what they want to do with that. All right. They put more effort into deciding what they're going to do on the weekend than they do in their whole fucking life. And then they wonder why you wake up when you're 31 and you say, oh, man, this sucks. No shit, it sucks because the people who don't suck, they start thinking about that when they're 20. They start thinking about that when they're young and they put in work every single day while you're out partying and you're out drinking and you're out living the life and you're out doing all this shit. There are motherfuckers out here that are grinding it out day by day by day. And everybody out here who parties their life away, they look at those people and they say, what is that going so serious? Where do you need to relax? You need to, you need to not take yourself so serious until they're 40 when that person is killing it and all these people are like, fuck, man. I guess you know, you finally made it work. No, I was making it work the whole time. I mean, you fucking made fun of me about it. All right. So let's, you're 31. You're lucky you're learning this now. But will you need to understand is that no one's going to make a decision about where the fuck you need to be, but you, okay? So stop being a bitch and make a decision because eventually your time's going to run out and you're not going to have an ability to even adjust it. All right. Time runs out. You do not have all the time in the world. All these knuckleheads on the internet to tell you, oh, dude, just, it doesn't matter what you do in your 20s and 30s. You know, you can, well, it does matter. That's real shit. It does matter. Now, can you do much more, much faster now because of technology? Absolutely. But if you waste your 20s and 30s and you start at 40, do you still have a chance? Sure. Is it going to be mega hard? Yes. Because you're going to spend the next 15 years of your life at an age where you have a mortgage and kids and probably a divorce or whatever you got, you know, statistically it's reality. Sure. Like no other way forward. Now, it's really something you want, yeah, like 638 and 34 is why you're trying to do all this stuff. And now when you're jumping in the middle of a можете, you might, you might be involved with all these, like, super resonated parties or whatever. But I'm going to just transfer here about a few things that you know. You might need a İyi Wooc, that is my final tip. That's my cleverest tip make up you know what, I'm I Shane's always about to have you to take this understanding down on the others. Things come every day back. I really enjoy it. For all of the I mean you know, you're about to have your jewelry all the way up to one of the counsel that I carry. Before. I pay a debt to something and to pay as much attention as I appreciate itWhatever. building a funnel or social media or whatever skill you have to build something that actually grows in equity, meaning a business, a real company, something that actually is worth something. So that way you're getting the cash flow and you're getting the nut on the backside. But you guys want to, you guys want to fucking follow all these dudes on the internet and just run around and fucking flash your dick around when dude really your dick is fucking point one inches long. You don't even know it yet. You for real. You know, I see these dudes flashing their bank accounts on the internet like they're fucking crushing shit like bro, you don't even understand you're telling on yourself. You're telling on yourself, you're telling the world how fucking broke you actually are because there are levels to this and at the upper levels, people fucking laugh at you. There's this, this, this, this idea of getting rich in one week and, and we're going to kill it and we're going to crush it and I'm going to fucking floss around. That is, that is the quickest way to waste your opportunity in building something real. I'm sorry. You can have some fun along the way, but the real, the real talk is the real thing you need to do is you need to concentrate on what skills you have and then how do you use those skills to build something that's going to accumulate value on the backside. That is the game if you want to be wealthy forever, not wealthy for five years and then have to figure out what the fuck you're going to do. All right. Dude, the point is is that no one's going to make this decision for you. No one's going to come around and save you. No one's going to do the work for you. No one's going to tell you what you should or shouldn't be. In fact, when you decide what it is, you should or shouldn't be. Everybody's going to tell you you're crazy. Everybody's going to tell you your waste of your time. Everybody's going to tell you you're stupid and you're going to have to be able to go through that. And if you can't go through that, you cannot win. It's impossible. All right. So make a decision, say, I'm doing this. I'm going to become this. It starts today and then take the next 10 years that commit every single fucking ounce of energy you have to be coming that and I guarantee you you'll become it. The problem is is that people spend most of their life in this in this nether region where they're like, God, I'm just don't help you with what I do. I just don't like, but they don't change it. Well, if you don't change it, what are you going to get? You're not you're not going to get the same, by the way. You're actually going to get worse because the longer time goes, the more miserable you're going to be and the more shit you're going to have to pay for, which means the more dependent you're going to be on the position that you're in right now. So unless you make a change, unless you decide I'm going to be this and go do it, it's actually going to get worse. It's not going to stay the same because you can only get better and you can only get worse. You cannot maintain success as a sliding scale. The entire fucking game is getting better all the time. And if you're not moving at least the pace of the game of getting better, you're actually going backwards. This is why people who own businesses who decide, man, I've made as much money as I want to make. I'm going to take a vacation every week and I'm going to go to the lake house Thursday through Tuesday every single week and everything's going to be good. And then five years were down the road. Their business is out of business because they're not improving at the pace they need to improve to quote unquote, maintain. Does that make sense? Absolutely. So if you're moving forward, even if you're trying to just kind of stay where you are, you still have to be moving forward at slow pace. Otherwise you're losing. So my advice to this person is dude, you're lucky you figured this out at 31 and not fucking 51 because at 51, there ain't much you can do about it. And yes, there's a lot of great stories about people who are over 40 that have become billionaires. I actually share a story like that on my Instagram just the other night, but the reality of it is this. That's the rare shit. It's not the norm. That is the anomaly that is not the norm. Okay. The norm is people who take their youth and fucking dedicated to their craft and show up day in and day out and day in and day out. No matter if they feel like it or not, that end up producing a great career, a great life, a great fulfilling existence for themselves. You're never going to do that with indecisiveness. You're never going to do that with indecision. You I firmly believe the reason most people lose in life is because of indecision. It's not because it's not because they don't have the skills. It's not because they they're incapable. It's because they can't make a decision about what they're going to do. They look at all this stuff. I'm going to I like to do this this week. I like to do that next week. I like to do this. And when I have ends up happening is they spend a and this is a whole other discussion about it because when it's up happening here, guys, is that the person who can't commit to a decision ends up repeating this cycle throughout their life. And the cycle looks like this. We're going to take this guy as an example. I'm 31. I don't like what I'm doing. I'm going to make a change. So he makes the change, right? And it takes three fucking years to even get through the transition process to where you feel comfortable and and competent and what you do. All right. But before that three years is even up, there are already like this isn't for me. I'm going to try something else. So then they repeat this again. All right. Now you're six years in. All right. And you get to the end of that three years and you don't give it enough time. And you say this isn't for me and you make another change. And what ends up happening is people go three years, six years, nine years, 12 years, you know, 15 years and all of a sudden, bro, they're 35 years old or 45 years old. And they're like, we're the fuck to the time go. Well, dude, if you had just stuck with that first thing, think where you'd be now. You see what I'm saying? Like, bro, this isn't fun. Like the, the, the idea that is spread on the internet of entrepreneurship being this fun thing that you get to do every single day or your career, entrepreneurship is this fun thing that you get to show up every single day. And it's just going to be fun. It's going to be awesome. It's going to make you feel fulfilled. That's a lie. You're going to have to work for a really long time doing shit that you fucking hate to ever get the opportunity to do what it is that you actually love to do. So you can't just quit things when they're hard or in you're in that phase of, it's very difficult or it's very frustrating or it's very hard because that's the phase where everybody quits. And you don't want to be one of those people that quits because when you start out, there's a thousand people trying to do, and I'm just making this up. There's a thousand people trying to do exactly what you're trying to do. And after three years, that 1000 goes down to a hundred because everybody quits. And this most people end up being in that fucking, you know, 900 people that fucking quit. Okay. And now you're competing gets a hundred and then three more years go by and out of that a hundred, there's fucking 20. Okay. So now six years in out of a thousand people, there's only 20 left. And then three more years out of that 20, there's 10. All right. And this is how you, this is how it works. It's persistence. It's, it's fortitude. It's grit. It's persevering the hard times. It's pushing through the times when everybody else quits when things are frustrating and things are draining and it's sucking your soul and you'd rather die than take another step forward. It's pushing through those times that produce the greatness in your craft that everybody searches to have. And then when you become great at that craft and everybody else is quit, you feel like the fucking man. You feel super fulfilled because you're confident. You know what you're doing. You've been doing it for 12 years and everybody else quit. And then you're way ahead of the thousand people who are starting this year, the same path you're on. So those people are easy money for you. You just beat their asses. This is how the game works. So it's persistence, bro. This is why we talk about 75 hard and live hard so much because if you can't get better, if you can't push through when shit is extremely hard, you have no chance at winning long term. Zero. Fucking zero, bro. I don't care how talented you are. Okay. Obsession and discipline will destroy talent a hundred times out of a hundred every single fucking time, bro. So you have to become someone and that's the good news. You can become someone who's obsessed. You can become someone who's disciplined. Those are things you can control. You can't really control your talent. You control your skill set, which appears to be talent from the outside after 20 years, right? Like people look at me and they say, oh, that's a talented entrepreneur. No, I'm a dumb ass who's just been doing it a whole long time and I accumulated a bunch of skills into you. It appears that it's talent. It's not talent. It's learned it's going out, getting my ass kicked a thousand times and learning the lesson every single time and not repeating it twice. And it appears to be talent from outside. It's not talent, bro. It's perseverance. It's grit. It's fortitude. It's pushing through the times when everybody else quits. And you're left as one of the few still operating. And this is the problem that most people make in their lives. They never get great because they don't give themselves enough time to be great. So I know there's a lot to that answer. But at the end of the day, here's the deal. Whenever you decide, fucking decide that you're going to do it for 70 years and stick to it and eventually in 10 years, you're going to be great at it. And then you'll have 60 years of awesomeness. That's what's going to happen. But the idea of going from thing to thing to thing to thing to thing. This is why internet culture is so damaging to people because they're called hamster wheel. Bro, it's the new thing this year. You know, it was fucking crypto. Then it was NFTs, then it was e-commerce, then it was this, then it was that, then it was this. Now it's this. And it's always this new thing. Bro, you'll lose that way. You might win today. You might win this year. You might win for a couple of years, but eventually you're going to lose. You have to play the long game. What would you want to do if you could do anything in your life? For the next 50 years, what would that be? What would that be? Because whatever the fuck that is, if you're an entrepreneur, that's the company you should be building. You know what I'm saying? It's not a short, it's not a short timeframe. And we have a bunch of knuckle fucks on the internet that tell people bad information because they've never actually even really done it. Bro, real, real talk. How many people out here talking about entrepreneurship have really built a company? I mean, why are we not asking these questions? Why are we not asking these questions when it comes to building companies? How many companies does person build? What kind of what, what do they do? How long have they been around? How many people have they served? How many employees do they have? Can I buy their product? How do they fulfill their product? How's their customer service? How's their actual product quality? What like, what do you guys not ask these questions when you see all these people telling you how to build a company on the internet? Like real talk. You should learn from people who have built shit. Okay. And people who have built shit are all going to tell you they're going to listen to the last 10 minutes or whatever I've been talking and they're going to say, fuck, that's correct. It's it's fucking the game is outlasting. The game is pushing through when everybody else quits. The reason most people fails because they cannot commit and they cannot see things through the hard times. That's it. I fucking love it, man. What guys? And that was three. Yep. Go pay the fee. Yeah. We're from sleeping on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck a boat. Fuck a stove. Counting millions in a coke. Bad bitch. Booted slow. Got a own bank road. Can't fold. Does a note? Hit shot. Case closed.
