Yeah, yeah, it's over huh? So it's been a few weeks Since we've talked about it. Yeah, did they quit yet? They're about to Michelle Obama humiliated amid dismal ratings for podcast she launched with great fanfare So her new podcast with her brother Craig Robinson has failed to meet expectations after it launched with great fanfare in early March The new media venture titled iM.O. or in my opinion with Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson Follows a sibling duo as they give advice discuss current events An interview of a variety of special guests. So currently they have it listed at 34th as is ranked number 34 on Spotify um Which I don't know man. It I don't think so I don't think so um her youtube it went from 19,000. She's up at you know 67,000 right now Yeah, so she hasn't completely bought all of her engagement I guess Video supposed to three weeks ago only has 21,000 views youtube tart. I mean it's an animal to fucking battle Yeah, I mean look you know a lot of these dudes that get millions of views they're either buying their views or They've been doing it for a decade. Yeah, right, you know, right and it doesn't matter who you are. Yeah, you know just because Just because your Michelle Obama doesn't guarantee success not I know it's hard to believe But not everybody's gonna fucking bow down and come listen to your shit I mean real talk like People don't want to be chastise and talk down to in terms of like what kind of pieces of shit they are and how they're the problem Which what these people consistently do or hear your You know oppression stories when you were the fucking first lady of the United States. I'm sorry. Yeah, she doesn't really no Doesn't really there these people are tone deaf and they've been propped up for many many years by a botan-paid for media that You know Makes it appear as if people are more important and more powerful than what they actually are um And you know this is this is smoking mirrors. It's always been that way. We're all throwing supplies. That's right and you know We've we've seen this okay the proof is there we have all these bot networks that have you know gone across social media and Prop these people up giving them tons and tons of traffic and Comments that seem legit that aren't legit, you know, you go to their comments You click on the person and they got four posts or you know no posts or you know, they're just It's just there's technology to do all of that shit and these people have the access to it and they've been using social media as a weapon of persuasion and cultural Direction to their own benefit for a long time and people have finally figured it out. They figured out that you know companies like Fox and CNN and all these big networks um are accepting funds And expected to run certain narratives a certain way uh at the direction of certain people for the benefit of people like her and um It's bullshit and so what we're seeing here is the Reality of what How popular these people actually are It's just crazy but speaking of trans women Uh, did you see that two trans Huh nothing Speaking of Well, I got restart now Speaking of trans women uh, do you see two trans players face off at women's pool championship after defeating female competition?

You know the more reps you have in anything the better you get If you grew up with the sticking balls you probably better with the sticking balls. Sit. That's it.

It looks it is what it is these people are mentally ill they're fucked up It's insane that people go along with it and uh, you know The only reason they're like this is because dude they they can't get attention any other way So they get to be in a protected class they get special privileges uh, you know, and once those special privileges and that protected class dissolves itself. We'll see a lot of these people, you know Go figure out other ways to get attention. That's my opinion. Yeah Yeah, man, well, let's give it to our crews.

Yeah, okay Yeah, dude from the south side Listen, she's one of my least favorite people. Yeah, like in history. Yeah, for sure No, I mean that like I don't like I don't understand Like the fanfare around her has always been manufactured You know they they and look I'm not one to make fun of people's appearances and shit But like you know when she was in office They were trying to make her the most beautiful woman in the in the world and they put out magazine articles and all this shit And like broke I you know, it's just it's it's it's it's objectively not fucking true And that's the problem I have with it You know like you can tell it's forced. That's the piece. It's like They they because they try so hard and put all the fucking dollars behind the shit Yeah, they force you to think that this is the truth Well, they want you to think of it and then if you don't accept it There's something wrong with you like if I don't say that that's the truth guess what I am I'm fucking racist, you know So I'm just tired of hearing it dude and I'm tired of them and I wish they would go the fuck away All of them Real man more guys. Let's jump into our first set of headlines Number one Let's go to the White House. Yep. LA Dodgers made their visit after winning the World Series and You know how Trump is can't let it slide without you know giving some type of heat to somebody so check this clip out Congratulations And others we have a couple of senators here. I just don't particularly like I'm so I won't enter this Over the course of this amazing season the members of this team I didn't think it was that big a deal right It's Washington over the course of this amazing season the members of this team gave us some of the most in Who's the guy on the right laugh in his ass off? Oh no, right. I was fucking In the city you know, he's fucking skipping out. I mean at least it tells the truth. That's true man You know, it's getting you know, I mean listen. That's just Trump fashion man. That's how he rolls. I'm I'm cool Cool with it, but let's let's get to some more present matters Also going around in DC right now the columnist blood bath Monday. Oh really? Stock markets aren't doing too well. Dow is down 2200 points 6.4 trillion dollars is wiped out in the two-day blood bath And we got China declaring a trade war over the Trump tariffs. So the the Dow is down 2200 points from when time that was April 4th. Oh This is down 349 as right now 300 today. Yeah, it was gone up a little bit Yeah, but like they were calling yesterday, you know It's gonna be the worst day in the history of the stock market and blah blah blah blah blah blah Well, there's been some weird stuff with that too And I got we got some proof on that But yeah, this was from April 3rd I'm saying before I mean it dropped quite a bit Trump had to put out a message on truth social tellin Americans Don't be a panicking I'm saying quote the United States has a chance to do something that should have been done decades ago Don't be weak. Don't be stupid. Don't be a panicking a new party based on weak and stupid people The president wrote on truth social half an hour before Wall Street opened for trading He says quote be strong courageous and patient And greatness will be the result So I mean that's a decent advice Yeah, I'm saying because I mean everybody else kind of panicking out right now Well, I mean who who was panicking right the billionaires? Well, I mean the senators that invest it's interesting how We have you know to pay attention to who's actually driving that narrative and You know It's CNN it's MSNBC. It's you know these big networks that are driving this information as hard as they can And it's interesting because people Will be quick to Say that everything else that they say is bullshit and against our Interests and all these things, but somehow this is in our interests Most people don't even understand that the stock market and the economy are two different fucking things Okay, the stock market is for extremely fucking wealthy people in generally, right? Most Americans don't have any money in it The economy of this country is not dictated necessarily by the stock market Okay, the regular people out here who you know are trying to afford food and Take care of their family though the prices of those items are going to be way less They might go up in the short term, but the cost of living is gonna come way down And they don't understand the balance of what's actually happening Uh, and they can't understand it because they don't understand basic economics like at all Yeah, go ahead Well, I think that's another byproduct two of the stock market like you said I mean most of Americans don't We're not actively involved in stock trading or anything like that I think this is also going to open up a massive opportunity for for sure for people to get involved Yeah, why do you think Warren Buffett has so much cash on hand right now? He's gonna let the market go down. He's gonna rebuy when it's low And he's gonna make a bunch more money how it works Yeah, I know and but dude what's what's fucking frustrating to me Is all these people saying all this shit that can't even tell you what a tariff is And they can't even tell you why we would have them or what would happen They're just parrot bro. I see very smart people who are You know obviously not as smart as I thought but Talking about this as if they don't They think it's the end of the world and it's like dude. What are you talking about? Yeah, they're idiots There it is, but I mean so you're point two, you know, you talk about like who's actually pushing this information out I wanted to bring in this this this this Profile from Twitter real quick called the co-bc letter They tweeted out This was today. They just tweeted out what what just happened At 10-10 a.m. Eastern time rumors emerged that the White House was considering a 90-day tariff pause At 10-15 a.m CMBC reported that Trump is considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries except for China By 10-18 a.m. The S&P 500 had added over three trillion dollars in market cap from and slow At 10-25 a.m Reports emerged that the White House was unaware of Trump considering a 90-day pause at 10-26 CMBC reports that the 90-day tariff policy headlines were incorrect 10-34 White House officially called it off saying it was fake news By 10-40 the S&P erased two and a half trillion dollars of market cap from its high Just 22 minutes prior to raising it which means it was still up 500 billion There's definitely some manipulation going on Very obvious who the fuck is doing it Why I don't know But here's the point that I want to bring up real quick let you jump in on this because people tend to forget just Not too long ago The state of the economy and the state of everything and how everything was going on I mean, I got some headlines here from from not like I said not too long ago When is the recession not a recession when Joe Biden says it isn't or here about this Majority of Americans wrongly believe US is in recession and most blame Biden Or you know Biden ran up insane bills before he left the White House Here's how Trump plans to pay them down or or this one This is my favorite by dynamics are starting to transform America. Why has no one noticed Because it didn't fucking work. Yeah, cuz it's not true. It's not true, man It's not true now the real numbers like you said the economy is separate from the fucking stock market Well, and here's the truth for you Trump's policies Crush inflation per blockchain based inflation index proving media and experts Wrong yet again. I mean here's the true graph of inflation We're down Right, let's talk about the tariffs because that's another interesting thing that's happening right now I'm not sure if you guys saw this EU they offers Offers Trump removal of all industrial tariffs Check this out We stand ready to negotiate with the United States indeed we have offered zero for zero tariffs for industrial goods as we have successfully done with many other trading partners Because Europe is always ready for good deal. So we keep it on the table But we are also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests Like you have any leverage lady, right? Okay, let's be real the United States is the biggest Consumer base in the world by a lot all right, none of these people have any leverage in the reason that we were involved in all of these unfair trade policies Has to do with what we've talked about on this show for many many years Which is the third worldization of this country they wanted to outsource manufacturing They wanted to remove Manufacturing and self-dependence and independence from the United States That's why Biden shut down the Keystone pipeline and we started doing all of these things They wanted to make the country as weak as possible and all of these tariffs That had to do with the European Union and all of these countries that have bought into the Push for globalism Was to effectively weaken the United States and take advantage of the fact that a lot of the manufacturing had already been moved overseas So if we don't control our own manufacturing and we don't control our own products then we are at the mercy of all these other countries and Trump understands that because Trump's not a fucking idiot now he may say things you don't like he may do things you don't like But at the end of the day the guy understands how to run a business and the country is just that it's a huge business and our Previous government officials up until this point And he's right when he says should have been done decades ago because if any of these people were acting in our own self-interest They wouldn't have allowed those tariffs to exist. Why would we give someone 0% You know import which we don't charge them anything, but then when we go there we're paying a 20% That doesn't make sense and the only sense that it makes is that They want to weaken our economy and make us more dependent so that it's easier to control And we bring the level of the United States down to everybody else's level which creates a Want from the citizens to Unify globally to create, you know a globalist which is communist conglomerate of nations and These people have failed, okay, it's not going to work Manufacturing is going to come back here and we are going to be in control of our own shit And we aren't going to be dependent on all these people a lot of the pain that we felt Over the last two decades in this country has to do with our own leaders selling us out to this idea of globalization. So You know Really the truth is is that all those people who did nothing their traders to the country in our interest because they were financially incentivized to make decisions That were against our best interests. This is why when you go look at Joe Biden you find all different kinds of pay for play um Money grabs by the Biden family and you have to ask yourself for what are those for why are they getting paid? Well, they're getting kickbacks and getting paid so that they don't change things like what Trump's doing right here Right continue to allow other countries to take advantage of us squeeze us Use our tax dollars just built off our labor and our businesses and our backs to Take care of the rest of the world and and basically You know do that for some personal wealth. I mean that's complete abandonment of an obligation of a president and government officials and all these people and they all did it So they can make more money themselves And on top of that like it's not even just the tariffs you take the EU for example Right And then on top of that we pay the majority in for NATO. So then we're protecting them militarily. That's right You know i'm saying What way that's not that's not a friendship that's not a good deal. No, like you don't do that to your friends Because they're not our friend they're not and while we were coming down there we're trying to equal up Yes, that's how you get there faster. Yes, everybody's on the same page. Yes It would take a long time for the Americans to just go down Yeah, like you got to bring everybody else right But do you notice how much worse they tried to propagate how how much worse it was The The reason they need people to Believe that it's worse than it actually is is so they'll accept the idea of Unifying with this You know world economic forum globalist Movement which has now failed Um swabs out right we step down I yeah, I saw that. I mean look this is a they have a culture. It's not gonna matter If he stepped down But he knows it's failed and he also knows that you know if once this progresses enough It's gonna mean him at the end of a rope. That's what the fuck it's gonna mean for a lot of these people um So or at the end of a drone it's a drone strike Uh, so I think a lot of these people are jumping ship because they don't want to get caught up in the In the consequences for what they've done um, and I think personally it's hilarious that this woman stands up here and acts like She has any fucking leverage whatsoever Like okay, we just won't send you shit and you're fucking starve Is that simple? Yeah, that's very simple It's very simple, but I mean he used not the only conglomerate that tried to jump in on these deals apparently Damn near every nation that was on that tariff list are reaching out streaming for deals because they understand that they don't have the leverage Right, she's still trying to posture it is what it is Um, another interesting country that popped up Um, and there's some interesting shit happening around this topic. Let's let's let's let's check on this um net nyahu is here BB he he he he he he DC right yeah um, and he was supposed to be meeting at the White House uh, you know talking about the tariffs um discussions on iran Gaza hostages, but then but then something weird happened Uh, they were supposed to be doing some some some joint press conferences and all of that stuff You remember you did that with zilinski the last time and then they all got canceled Uh-huh. Yeah, check this out indice nn Uh, the White House has cancelled today's press conference with is uh with president trump in his really prime minister Benjamin netanyahu This is a really big change. Let's go to jef zeleny who's at the White House Um, Jeff are they explaining why? Uh, at this hour they are not explaining why the press conference was a scheduled to take place at about 230 eastern time with a president a Trump and prime minister and netanyahu would have been their second formal press conference back There was one in February and one this afternoon was on the schedule It's been on the schedule for several days, but uh, the change here Uh, the the White House officials are saying that they will still potentially take a questions in the oval office in a more informal setting But that formal press conference in the east room of the White House, uh, which has been uh set up for this Uh, has now been canceled That's interesting That is that is interesting where you think dude i listen I don't know what to think Based off of precedence like i said the last time this happened was with zilinski And he gave all the fucking food away to the staffers You know i'm saying like and and the rumor on the fucking street was as the list got kicked out You know i'm saying this was after the zilinski talked to you know trump kind of crazy. Mm-hmm right This has the same markings. I don't know waiting on my people to get back to me But it is interesting because at the same time all of this is going on Let's go over to nbc real quick Because israel's having some some explaining to do on the global stage Not sure if you saw this Israeli military walks back account of gaza medical workers killings after video appears to contradict its version So This was a story. I mean we seen it. We didn't really follow it too much at least i didn't um But last month apparently the israeli military Uh killed 15 paramedics and emergency workers in southern gaza last month um And they said that oh you know they were terrorists that was in there they pulled up with their lights off and you know It was suspicious and oh well Now there's a video okay of this The israeli the israel defense forces initially said soldiers open fire on vehicles as they approached its position Suspiciously without headlights or emergency signals that said nine Hamas and islamic jihad militants were killed in the incident However nbc news reviewed video recovered from the phone of one of the paramedics killed Uh and in it an ambulance can be seen with its lights on and its emergency lights flashing when soldiers open fire The vehicle was also marked with the Palestinian red crescent societies insignia Um lights on two other vehicles can also be seen flashing Um, and so now since that video has come out He'sraeli military walked back its version of events after the video of the shooting emerged On saturday a spokesperson said in the news briefing that the initial report received from the field had not been Uh had not described any lights but that it appeared that the individual who gave the initial account was mistaken mistaken mistaken Just a mistake Um the idea of spokesperson said investigators were still looking at operational information to try to determine Whether and why in error had been made According to a transcript of the briefing um the spokesperson refused to comment when asked why the idea of had initially described the vehicles as moving suspiciously So i mean dude it's There there is some weird stuff happening with that. I don't know you got any thoughts theories on that I mean look dude uh Like we've said a number of times here, you know the the the israeli decision makers are Warmongers and they are genociding An entire group of people and we have people like that fat dude from last week and i find yeah Bragging about it and we see this all over we see these pro-Israel people showing you know no restraint no mercy no empathy no care for for anybody being killed whether they're innocent or not And there's videos all over the internet of people who um Have far different accounts of what's actually going on than what the IDF and israel's reporting and uh You know at the end of the day I don't think they can be trusted and what people here fail to realize is that the rest of the world doesn't like israel You know i'm saying we're the only country that's out here being like oh there are greatest ally in this and that That's not fucking true. Yeah, okay now they might have Uh strategic land that allows us to have some sort of forward operation Uh presence in the middle east that doesn't mean that there are closest ally um You know at the end of the day dude You know we're getting drug into a bunch of shit that shouldn't be happening That wind up costing us money and probably American lives And many different ways not just in direct conflict but also uh the reason who's gonna have to deal with The terrorism that will result from this right we will the greatest ally yeah 100% and and dude like People are done with it dude You know look all over the internet. They say oh anti-semitism's at all time high Well meanwhile they're shooting up three fucking lit up ambulances Yeah and and laughing when a little baby gets blown up and shit like what do you expect dude and then play victim or you can do that Yeah, well, I mean they've been doing it for a long time bro And it's not the Jews it's fucking the corrupt people at the top of the food chain In israel and a bunch of other fucking it's it's a mafia that exists Uh, you know in different countries here there a few other places and um you know they hide behind anti-semitism they hide behind the ignorance of people who Persecute regular everyday Jewish people um Because there's a lot of Jewish people that look at this and they're like this is fucking disgusting No different than how you feel when you see some of the black crime that's happening right? It's the same thing and um I just think it's irresponsible to say Arguments like it's the Jews when in reality bro uh Joe Biden didn't represent my views It would be very easy for people to say it's the Americans well it ain't most of the Americans um I think I think I think the leaders of israel are fucking evil people period And I think they're willing to do anything they can to protect their own reputation uh, you know and it's absurd too like What why do you hate us? What do you what do you not like about us? What do we do wrong? You know We we can criticize every other country We can criticize every other government. We can criticize every other everything of everything else But if you say one thing about israel Your anti-semit they try to get you fired they try to fuck up your shit. They try to ruin your name And You know, I don't know about you, but When someone's trying to present the case that they are doing everything the right way and they're upstanding people and doing the right thing um You know when you go and make laws and arrest people in other countries and try to pass laws here That says you can't question things and you can't talk about things and you can't criticize certain people When you could criticize literally every other race you can criticize every other religion You can criticize every other government, but if you say it about this one government You're somehow the worst person in the in the world And I don't know about you bro, but that doesn't foster trust with most people Okay, most people are smart enough to understand that You know when the person trying to Play like they're innocent is actually forcing people to not talk about it Whatever that might be It's pretty clear that there's some lying going on all right And it's interesting because Why is it that Israel is above criticism from everybody Why is that someone explain that to me? Okay, you had Randy fine talking about legitimately out of his mouth You know our people which he what he means is the Jewish mafia is really higher-ups We bit kicked out of 200 countries, which is actually not 200. It's like a little over 100 But You know who's fucking counting? But if you ask Why that is you're a fucking anti-Semite right so you can say that is happening Yeah, but if you say well why it's probably why would people want to kick you out? They like dude, you know So you're telling me so this is what you're trying to tell me you're trying to tell me that For 200 or whatever you said 109 countries you're trying to tell me that for no reason whatsoever Like you're just mining your own business you're chilling. Yeah, right okay Eating the bagels just doing your thing And 109 other they just decide they don't like you you weren't doing anything all in season might yeah, right? Okay, yeah, nobody believes that All right Secondly, anybody who tries to defend that Nobody believes them either and they get lumped into it. Okay, so what you have here Is you have this like momentum that's starting to build where You know like Regular Jewish people will instead of like standing up and saying that's wrong They'll get pissed off whenever you try to like ask questions, right? So then you're like well fuck Steve down the street It was Jewish man. He actually is with them and you start to see you start to like See it different. Does that make sense and that's what's happening dude like No reasonable person looks at what they do and says oh they they they're just picked on for no reason like bro There has to be reasons Okay, what are they and then when you talk about those you know you you get anti-semite of the year on the ADL website or whatever right? So I got fired from 109 Jobs It's all their faults in my like It's right be me I love saying Listen, this is no different This is no different than you getting fired from 109 jobs and then saying it's because all of them are racist all the jobs are racist Yeah, but you didn't like black people. That's what it was Had to be and so like dude with the awareness and the transparency that we have from the internet now You know, this isn't 25 years ago. This is now and 25 years ago There wasn't as much available information and You know You could squash things very easily with with the narrative, but now you can't with one new cycle. Yeah So it's just It's absurd and the more they push and the more they try to lock down people's voices and the more they pressure The more resistance they're going to create for themselves It's crazy last little piece on this tariff thing Because China is now in the conversation 100% Trump threatens to add 50% tariffs on China if a territory tariff is not dropped President Donald Trump won Monday that he would impose additional tariffs on China a 50% If Beijing does not withdraw The 34% tariffs it announced against United States last week So China unveiled the measures in response to Trump's liberation day we covered that on the last cti Um, but and they responded they trying to issue the retaliatory tariff of 34% on top of their already record setting tariffs Right, so they charge us 67% they just added 34% to that Um, and so uh, you know Trump said that they Play ball or don't pick your poison Um, which I think you should have just went straight to a fucking hundred But they haven't till tomorrow to get the shit to fit heat and we'll see Yeah, here's the thing With all these other countries you can certainly just say Fuck you. What are you gonna do? All right the problem with China that makes it different from all the other countries Is not just the amount of people they have But it's also the fact that they do so much manufacturing for American companies at the moment And this is a big problem and why manufacturing needs to happen here So at any given time China can say we're done making product for you Okay, um, they can also decide to not honor patents Uh, or intellectual property that they manufacture for American companies and they can just say Fuck it We're gonna make whatever Labels uh, the United States makes and we're gonna send them out to the rest of the world and they can flood the market with counterfeit products that are actually the exact same thing And and really honestly we put most of the companies here in the United States out of business So we're not prepared to correct and that is the danger of outsourcing manufacturing so China in this situation Because the manufacturing hasn't returned To America full force they have this card to play that I mean If they played it would it would mean legitimate war we're China like bombs and guns and fucking blowing them the fuck up for sure Yeah, so Because it would ruin every single Company that manufactures anything over there ever Dude, I saw this one post and I don't know the numbers if they're 100% concrete basically what they were saying is like you're at your standard iPhone Right, it's 1500 bucks. Uh-huh. This would go to like 30 grand that huh they said 30 grand no no no no That would go to like $3 Okay, so all of your premium goods that you get manufactured in China under specific IP So let's say this you're Uh, you're getting this water okay, and you're making it in China and It's it's intellectual property from the United States, you know, it says US water right okay, and let's just say it's the most popular water in the world What I'm saying is is that they can Cut off American companies from receiving the product make the product themselves and then ship it out to the rest of the world at Cost or a few dollars over and ruin the market for the water While simultaneously crushing the business here. You see what I'm saying. Yeah, so It's like hyper inflating the product availability to where it's not worth anything and they absolutely can do that So it's a very You know, so I always been conflict with it because like yeah, like you know you hear all these people all China's our biggest Yeah, I mean in the sense yes, they are You know what I'm saying, but we still bow down to them man. That's the point we have to when we don't make our own shit Yeah, okay, we don't make a lot of our own products We don't make a lot of our own medicines a lot of the ingredients that we use come from there We're depending on them and their ideology is not in line with ours So why the fuck would we ever allow a country whose ideology is not aligned with ours to control our supply chain Whatsoever it should be illegal than any products or main China? But instead we have shipped our manufacturing over there And you have to wonder why why is that You you think that the people who did that didn't understand what they were doing No, they knew what they were doing they sold us out for money that went to their own families That's how a lot of these people come in Worth nothing and leave worth a hundred million dollars They're not just taking money from our taxes and you know funneling it back impact donations They're accepting straight up payments through many different methods from countries like China so these people are legitimately traders to us who we elect To represent us and then they work in the interest of China for their own personal wealth And this is something that's been happening for a long time any leader any any intelligent human being Would understand that for us to be secure strategically secure We have to manufacture our own goods and services here in this country and when was the last time you heard any president talking about Bringing all of that here It's not been in your lifetime. That's right. So They have intentionally what i'm trying to get to here is that they they have intentionally weakened the country For their own personal wealth they knew what they were doing and we're in a we're in this Window right now We're China could really fuck us up if the cards are played wrong now after the manufacturing comes back here They won't have that card to play anymore does that make sense? So yeah, man, dude, it's a scary it's a scary volatile situation man guys jump in On this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said Let's go clear some of these comments Got some buildings for you Andy.

I already told you bro You know, I don't do fun No fun guys. We appreciate you for being real ass fans Let's keep the cruise cruising. Let's go to headline number two Uh Let's talk about our Americans Huh, let's talk about our fellow Americans Okay, okay, just a little bit. Yeah, um thousands of protesters gather for hands-off rallies across the country This was it was a lot of people hands off of what Their penises Well, I'm they cut them off anyway What what are we talking hands off hands off this sounds like hands up It does It sounds I mean is this not a fucking sorrows funded oh for sure organized rally or sure. Yeah, I mean it's it's they got similar name You know some of the people You know that uh similar arm hair Brody if you want I hope you got some videos of some of these people being interviewed Okay, cuz there's some I got some videos. There's some fucking rocket scientists. Oh, that's for sure. That's for sure Yeah thousands of protesters gathered for various so-called hands-off rallies throughout the United States to protest President Donald Trump and Elon Musk a video posted to Twitter by ABC News show thousands of protesters Who had flooded the streets in Boston, Massachusetts as part of a hands-off rally um Breibart's Breibart News shine more more in previously reported protesters were slated to gather across the nation on Saturday For the hands-off rallies to tell Trump and Musk to take their hands off People's health care social security civil rights and their freedom and education So let's check a couple of these these clips what what what before we get into this what is he doing? What are they doing to health care and social security and civil rights? Yeah, it's a my mouth freedom and education Nothing dangerous or bad. Yeah, I mean they they sign an executive order to delete the Department of Education which has produced the worst decline in education Quality in any modern civilization ever over the last 40 years That doesn't sound like a bad idea to me. I mean these people are probably what that Though, you know, I'm saying I mean yeah, I mean what are we talking about here? What are we talking about The civil rights thing I couldn't get none of it makes sense. Yeah, I know I mean none of it, but I mean dude these were some massive crowds got to give it to them check a couple of these clips out Here's a live look at Boston, Massachusetts now as we check back in on one of our top stories anti-Trump protests Taking place across the country today after tumultuous week to say the least Uh Unmultuous the economy we want to point out just a few minutes ago. We did show you a protest It was we said it was Boston. It was not Boston there. It was an unrelated protest But what you are looking at right now is Boston and I'm from there. I can recognize this This is the plaza right outside of city hall In down that is a shit ton of people. Huh, that's a shit ton of people New York City Yeah That's a shit ton of people. Yeah, I mean that's a shit ton of people How do you get so many people organized like that like you know To do the same thing with the same signs and Right like like there's there's like I mean that's a massive level of coordination Right Well, let's let's go to Mario Nafal this this cool guy on Twitter He uh he tweeted this out Exposed anti-Elon protests are staged and paid Bust in scripted clocked out The anti-Elon anti-doge anti-Trump protest in DC. So specifically we're gonna go to DC here Um, they aren't grassroots. They are payroll driven theater buses rolled in packed with hired protestor Pre-made signs handed out assembly line style scripts Describid it to keep messaging on brand protesters all left at once just like a shift change protest or organize astroturf NGO backed donor funded and fake as their outrage It's a union of grifters and bureaucrats trying to stop Elon from cutting off their taxpayer gravy train Let's check a couple of these clips out So me and Gabe took about a 30-minute break and we went back to hotel to recharge when we come back In this place is dead take a look like not a single protestor inside and just 20 to 30 minutes ago It was completely packed with protesters So one of two things Either a they were paid and their time was gone, you know, they're off work. They get to go or be They're literally just a cold and they all left at once like it's one of the two options. You tell me Oh, it's a mix It's paying agitator protesters bust in you know, I sent you that video last night of the guy dancing Okay, so there's this video. I sent DJ of this guy At a music festival and he's like he goes up and he starts dancing on his own and then over the course of about two minutes There's like Hundreds of people dancing with them and the reason I sent that to you was because that's how these protests happen Okay, they get enough people there to make it seem like a crowd Who are all paid and then they count on the rest of the people joining in um Yeah, man, I mean look it is what it is at this point and uh There's some interviews of these people they don't even know why they're there They can't even answer you they're pulling out scripts. Yeah, they have to pull out scripts. Yeah, but these are some more clips of people coming and going check us out Got to have some pile of Stein people in there This is a picture of video them literally getting off the buses I The buses underneath they all got signs that are getting handed out now It's my thing that bus. I mean you can see them the the information on that bus I mean it wouldn't take a rocket scientist to look that up and see Where it came from yeah, you know who ordered that bus who paid for it right like we wouldn't take a whole lot to get that But we don't even have to because they they're straight up telling us now to lead a web page published by the organization offered to pay groups up to $200 per person to stage the protest against Tesla and Elon we talked about this few times. It's one of these NGOs called indivisible Right literally had the payment link form on their fucking website. So you register your group I'll let's say it's 10 of you cool 200 bucks a piece come to this protest that they're paid. Yeah Which is also would understand or make sense and explain why Everybody was gone after the you know the payroll was up, you know, I'm saying but to your point These people are not smart. They're idiots. Let's check this guy out And what brings you out here today What doesn't Can you explain a little bit for our viewers what this means go ahead You're Caque the stock was Government by the least suitable or competent citizens of the state seems to fit done it These people yeah, they have no idea what they're even protesting dude What are we not like It's so it's so crazy man. It's so crazy But these people look like I mean we've shown some violence before we're talking about it You know all of the violence that they say that you know, we're gonna be doing we're not the ones really doing it Um, I want to go because I actually follow this girl on on Instagram. She has a really really awesome account name Savannah Um, I don't know if you have you seen this fucking clip bro. Uh, where she just punched in the face. Dude. Yeah. Yeah, New York City because the person that she's interviewing has no education And doesn't even know what they're arguing about zero morals right or anything Incy new york city woman who deck pro-life activist claims she was provoked in survival. That's what they all say They've the issue she made her puncher right. Yeah, for sure Um, yeah, the woman who socked a pro-lifer Uh reporter in the phase during the film interview offered an apology Saturday but claimed her antagonistic victim Goat at her in survival. So check this clip out It's very obstructed and I think that you just don't understand the magnitude of Having a child. Yeah, well, I'm not the one who admitted they would be okay with killing babies and foster care and killing children that have been abused Seems reasonable Listen These people are creating their own backlash. It just hasn't happened yet People are fucking sick of that shit Okay, there's sick of being told that they're the violent ones or sick of being told that they're gonna go on a domestic terrorism list There's sick of being told and these people have never faced accountability for fucking anything Okay, and that's why we're seeing behavior like this Look at this she plays victim she wants a Facebook of course. The lady's name is Brianna rivers She went to Facebook saying uh, it's a Savannah. I sincerely apologize But cannot sit around and allow you to continue pushing this one-sided narrative I understand hands being put on someone is never the answer but throwing rocks and hiding hands is worse She knows the truth and she needs to release the footage and its entirety Savannah is a professional antagonist not a reporter and the truth will be told Which is funny because Brianna approached Savannah there was the whole video out there They she did release the whole video and guess what happens after that, bro It's classic. It's classic victim bullshit. Yeah Help Brianna rivers find legal protection She started to go phone before herself of course. Yeah, I already raised 12 11 hundred bucks. Yeah, of course She's the victim saying that uh, you know, she was asked to partake in an interview um to a pro-life advocate and Our initial interaction was genuine and friendly until I stood in support of Planned Parenthood services So she's she's doing this saying that she's received death threats She's being cyber bullied Uh, her comments are not not very nice and body shape listen to Uh You deserve it you deserve it Yeah, you deserve it and you deserve more you physically assaulted somebody for no fucking reason And this is the shit that y'all claim Everybody does to you which nobody ever does we don't see have we don't ever see videos of it go in the other way We always see videos of that side of things doing this kind of shit and getting away with it and uh, you know Things are changed now dude. I just I just wish we could get back to a time where victims were actually victims Right and like not this like a aggressor being the victim bullshit that we're constantly seeing because it's not even just like this I mean, I know you guys have seen it. We'll touch on it shortly, but like do that case down in fucking Texas It's a track meet bro. Uh-huh like that dude who fucking stabbed that dude that stabbed that like these are kids one, right You stabbed this dude and now you're playing victim you gotta go from me which by the way It's parents keep raising the fucking limit on it and we're from 50 50k to 100k to 150k now it's at 200,000 dollars like can we just get back to victims actually being the victims here Like that'd be nice That'd be nice to see instead of playing this like row with me bullshit bro like no you fucking killed a kid dude I don't get it I do When you hold certain people mainly Democrats and left-leaning people of any race sexuality Gender who fall on that side the laws have not applied to those people for the longest time and there's clearly a double standard about where the laws apply and when they don't and then you throw in a culture That you know is openly racist towards white people openly racist towards white people That's the truth Okay, and that's not most black people, but there is an element of black culture Which is not small which it is allowed to be openly discriminatory and racist towards white people It's been that way my whole life you can say whatever the fuck you want about white people But if you say the same shit about black people Your racist you lose you should lose your job and this and that and this And you know we can't observe simple things like crime statistics or crime data with out being called racist which is interesting because to solve the problem It has to be addressed and so who's actually racist the people who are wanting us to Avoid noticing the actual data so that we can correct it and and which allows you know inner city black people to suffer the consequences of a abnormally violent and zero accountability society um You know it seems to me that the racist position there is to act like there's not a problem and allow it to continue You know and 100% yeah and and the real non-racist people are willing to say hey, here's a problem Here's the data that supports that problem. That's fix it. How do we fix it? And that is the non-racist take but it's interesting because that's the inverse of how you What you get called and how it's labeled in society and let's be real dude uh For the last number of years you know Black crime has had very little accountability at all We have inner city prosecuting attorneys that's the race the most racist piece about it completely dude I mean my your tax dollars is going for some dude Some organization To send your tax dollars to go pay for people to get in these positions who intentionally Release violent criminals Violin offenders back into the fucking community say they care so much about you But they're letting you be in fucking pillage and murdered and raped and killed yeah, listen all over your city You think you think every day uh Every the every day a black citizen black American Want to deal with their own people being criminals and shit bro We hear from these people all the time. They're fucking embarrassed by it. They're like bro It's not all black people. I hope you understand that. Yes. We all understand that But at the end of the day there is a fucking huge double standard You are allowed to say anything you want about any it's the same thing that we have with the Israel thing But with with black people some different segment though they can criticize and say and do anything Just about With no repercussions right you could say anything about white people that's you're not a racist If if a white person is to say hey, uh, there seems to be a problem over here with black youth and crime You're a racist right like there's just all sorts of double standards and we have to ask why those double standards exist And the reason those double standards exist is not for the benefit of black culture If we really wanted to benefit black culture and black people in this country We would say here's the fucking problem. Here's the reality of the problem And here's what needs to happen to fix it But that we're not allowed to do that because even identifying the problem is quote-unquote racist so um You know until people come to the reality of of what the truth is and what the facts are this is going to continue and You know Bro real talk. I've seen more anti-white racism out of this one scenario than then I've seen Yeah, but I've seen Maybe ever Like look bro You know, I saw a video where a guy was saying What right does that kid have to tell him to move? Well, it doesn't fucking matter The the amount of that doesn't give someone the right to stab someone in the heart right There's no marks on this kid's face. It's not like they got in a fist fight and it happened in the heat of the moment right like I don't see self He felt disrespected and acted out as if you know What they're told to do in their culture by rap by fuck it and by the way Who's putting out and I like rap but I'm also old enough and intelligent enough to know that you don't run around doing the shit they talk about yeah, okay? But at the end of the day who's who's propagating those messages to the black youth? Who's pumping that who's making the money from it right? Who are the questions to ask right? Okay, because we have a situation here where You know and furthermore beyond this specific discussion It's it's fall people are failing to realize that this division is being created intentionally Okay, they're trying to create another George Floyd type situation because when people choose a side such as race um or socio-economics poor versus rich or sexuality, you know gave versus straight or political affiliation left versus right That all works in their favor Okay, because when we're fighting amongst ourselves and we are passionately arguing about things That mattered us right it bothers me that a that a black kid stabbed a white kid in the heart that's not good That that should bother everybody It should also bother people equally as much when a black kid stabs another black kid right which clearly it doesn't because that nobody talks about it And it happens what happened there in frisco happens in Chicago 40 times of fucking week But nobody says shit. Okay, why because it's not good for the divisive narrative that they want to sell us So that they can continue to steal and take advantage of and pillage and oppress all of us while we're busy arguing over things like this. Here's the the reality of this Uh, this was wrong. It was horrible that that young man that lost his life His life is over. I don't think people people are like desensitized to it like he's dead Okay, he's not gonna grow up and have a family. He's not gonna have story His family's gonna have to live with that their whole lives and anybody arguing that he deserved it is a world-class piece of fucking shit I don't give a fuck who you are Okay, and and to be honest the black Community that's standing up and saying things that insinuate that such as this man Who like the one video that really irritated me was What right did he have to tell him to move? Okay, so they justify stabbing someone in the fucking heart Dude, I saw somebody try to compare this talking about Uh try to compare this this the the the fucking aggressor here to Rosa Parks I was like oh, so wrote you know, he's like listen to Rosa Parks. I'm gonna know Rosa didn't stop the bus jiving bro Like it's uh, I think it's a little bit different. Listen dude. I'll be real. You know, you know how I I'm seeing this dude I'm seeing this as a very revealing event to understand how Many people in the black community see white people they fucking seem to hate them they hate them No matter what for what yeah, just for no reason and bro I'm sorry. I just don't see that in white culture. I don't now now if you're a black person You bought into that narrative that all white people are bad. You're not gonna believe what I'm saying but I don't I don't have I don't have we don't have discussions At least in my circles and I don't know. I'm a pretty aggressive by society standard advocate for No hypocrisy when it comes to racism meaning that I am one of the people that will stand up and say hey This is bullshit. This is a double standard. I'm tired of white people being fucking criticized I'm tired of white people being blamed. I'm very open about saying that Um because it's wrong But at the end of the day that doesn't make me some sort of racist where we sit around and Talk about how fucked up black people are that's not that that that doesn't happen And I'm one of the I'm one of the people who actually speaks that Truth like hey, we shouldn't have this at all on any way any direction And generally most people that stand up and say hey, uh, you know this this Over Racism towards white people is bullshit, you know this double standard towards white people is bullshit You know If you flipped the page on all of this shit and you had white entertainment television and white Grammys and this and that and this and all these things Uh, people will lose their mother fucking mind if that white kid had stabbed This black kid in the heart. What would be happening right now in this country? Right we know what would be happening. It'd be the burning down. It would be the same shit that happened with George Floyd and You know, there's just a huge double standard, but the point of this that I'm getting at is that If there were that kind of racism out there happening, I would fucking hear about it I would have people messaging me saying we would know about yes, everybody would know about yes And it does it just I don't see it and but what I do see is a lot of people in the black community who are very comfortable Justifying this as okay, you know this kid was defending himself. No, he wasn't this kid wasn't Uh, uh, stand up, you know kid. No, he wasn't he fucking killed a kid Okay, like stand up about that dude and I'm you know People can mad at me when I say this and I understand their point of view right like there's a lot There's a segment of the white population that gets super mad when I say that hey We we should all be getting along and we should all not see color and we should be judging each other on the content of character I personally believe that's how things should be I think most people believe that's how things should be but there's I get a lot of heat Just like you get from the black community saying you're an uncle time. I get a lot of people from the white community who say Bro race does matter it matters. Look how they talk about us look how they say this look these people fucking hate us And if we allow them To you know continue to hate us like this you you're putting yourself in a dangerous situation by ignoring the reality You know that this exists which that's a fair point there's there's naivete which usually gets people killed Okay, you think everybody's cool and everybody thinks like you and they don't and uh, you know, it's just it's disturbing dude and Um I don't know man just for me is the victim should gotta go listen. I'm I'm Personally, I'm fucking tired of it. Yeah, okay, like I'm tired of And I don't care what people think about this is just what I observed Show and if I'm wrong show me show me the show me the videos Show me the videos of white youth ransacking Comignia stores or grocery stores Show me the videos of these massive mail-as in public places amongst all white people show me the videos of Groups of white people beating up a black person when you could show me those videos Then then we'll have a talk about reality. You have a dial. Yes, but those things don't exist and the videos the other way around Do you agree or disagree are plentiful? Not hard to find okay, so we have to assess what reality is and the reality of the situation is we have a group of people This is not black people. This is bad people in the black community in my opinion uh Creating a bad name for a lot of black people Okay, and to fix that The everyday black American is gonna have to stand up and say this is fucking bullshit and we need to self-correct on our own culture and that doesn't happen enough um You know the the other the other situation is is you know, uh, I think I think we all have to realize that You know, this situation is being marketed does you know, it's being do I think it's right that he raised a 150 gram by people supporting him No, absolutely not. I don't think so. I think it's fucking bullshit Do I think it's right that there's certain people making videos saying that this kid deserved it or that you know This kid was justified in doing what he did. I don't agree with that. I don't like that Um, there's lots of things I don't like Do I do I like opening the internet every day and being and and seeing black people Tell White people that their race is for existing Or or how that's become a public policy in schools for the last 15 20 years You know, you you listen to Obamas get up there on stage and talk about how racism is such a big problem when they're president of the United States and multi-multi multi-millionaires, you know, we look at the You know, I just see a lot of different things that indicate, you know, the opposite of what is actually said and told And at the end of the day guys, you know, if we're going to have a functional society that's going to exist Cross culturally People are going to have to call out the bullshit for what it is you don't get a special pass because You know your ancestors were slaves 400 fucking years ago or 200 years ago or a hundred years ago There there's more slaves that exist currently in present day than have ever existed in the history of earth before now We're not talking about that. Okay, Italian people were slaves Irish people were slaves American idiots were slaves Fucking almost every single heritage that you could trace back there will be slavery at some point in time Yes, so so what makes me responsible as someone who happens to be You know of Western European at descent um How am I responsible for something that you know happened before my family even immigrated to this country I'm not and I don't feel guilty about saying it You know there this is another thing like white people are made to feel guilty about it bro You didn't fucking do that shit Do you believe the slavery's legal or should be legal or that you have a right to own other humans? No, well then fucking tell them to fuck off Right, you know like bro. We got it at some point everybody's got to stand up and have a backbone and acknowledge what the truth is You know the truth of the matter is is that bad people are bad people good people are good people and we are being divided intentionally Uh, are there some real issues? Yeah, there are but You know they can be solved real easily by just standing up for yourself and saying hey, I'm buying into that shift fuck you That's what I do nobody comes at me for that shit We can't just come at me for that race argument bro. I'll fucking school you Okay, I'll make you look stupid in front of the whole fucking world That's a thing and we can't pick and choose what what's an important conversation to have you know I'm saying well what a important problem it though. We're gonna talk about problems talk about all of them What happens what happens what happens to a toddler When they have a toy that they really like and they've grown accustomed to and you fucking take it away from them Oh, they lose their shit what what so what happened to this lady right here? Yeah same thing No, what the the exact same thing only her toy was her privilege to say and behave any way that she sees fit with zero repercussions And when she was intellectually cornered and exposed for not knowing what the fuck she was talking about what happened She threw a fit Okay, and this is what happens when you raise people for their whole entire lives With zero consequences trophies for 20th place Telling people that they're entitled to this or that because of what their ancestors did or didn't do 200 years ago. This is all nonsense. It's total bullshit Okay, I didn't fucking have own any slaves. Did you? Nope, I didn't either so like I don't really give a fuck I really don't know. I know that Here's what I do know Lots of fucking Americans and lots of white people fucking died to end that in this country. What are they talking about that? You know what I'm saying? No, we turned down those statues. Yeah, I Dude listen, it's it is what it is bro, and We need a cultural correction in this country to where people who are good on all sides of the equation meaning Good people of every race good people of every religion good people of every sexual orientation Call out to bad people in their fucking little segments Okay, like if there's a video of a bunch of white motherfuckers beating up a black cop Your first one is said all of them belong in the wood shipper Right, but that don't happen the other way around. Why is that? Why is that why is it that? Because it do go fund me to shit on our end, right? But I'm saying but like bro I don't if if a white group of people beat up a black kid Or that white kid had stabbed that black kid you know what I'd be saying right now? Fuck dude that kid deserves go to fucking jail forever or being a wood shipper like I like to say It's a truth Violence is violence bad things or bad things bad people are bad people and the rest of the good people of all the different races and creeds and religions and nationalities and origins and fucking anything else Have to call out their own people and say this is unacceptable and until that changes nothing's gonna change That's real man. That's real guys jumping on this conversation. I mean what do you think? Oh dude? I mean listen, you know what I think man. I know but like bullshit like We got to do better. Well, what caused it? What's caused it? I mean, I think when you when you look at it It's a lot of like I mean we could talk about whoa. Oh, he had a better. Okay. Yeah, we could talk about all of that stuff I'm over that. I don't give a fuck. It doesn't mean anything. Hey listen. It doesn't mean anything. I don't get listen I don't care what happened to you when you were a kid no Just because something happened to you when you were a kid doesn't mean you can destroy other people's lives We still know right and right and we still know right from wrong You can be a fucked up individual. You it's still there. It's human nature Right, and so like I'm not one for making excuses um I think that we got we got a lot of problems. What I don't like is how we tend to cherry pick. Oh well Yeah, let's talk about this problem. Oh like like bro like the the black stakeholders, right? Like know what they're worried about They're worried about fucking boycott and target You know what I'm saying like they this won't be a conversation for them And like that and like but like that's who we look up to be our leaders and voices the black like a dude is bullshit man Well, I mean, let's be real dude, you know I mean look dude most people are good people. I believe that most people want the same things I don't have problems when I go out in the black communities. No, I don't I don't have issues with gay people I don't have when I go out in real life I treat people at respect and almost every fucking time I get treated with respect back I don't run around acting like I'm above anybody else. I don't run around acting like I get to do things that they don't You know, and when I talk to people that come from different places than me or look different than me Uh, or raise different than me. Usually we have a lot in common Usually we want to we want to find something. No bro. Usually we have a lot in common You know, we we want to we want to do well in our lives. We want to make some money. We want to be left alone We don't want to be harassed. We don't want to be fucked with and those are you know, we do good things for people. I mean dude like We got better Yeah, I don't know man. I don't know the solution, but I know I know that Pretending that there isn't a problem statistically With black violence in particular is Racism in itself Because if we don't address that that's an actual problem then it only gets worse and worse and worse and who does that hurt? That hurts black people so You know and and the same would be true if it were true about white people there's things that white people do that black people don't that are problems um And if we at pretend to like those worn issues then it would just get worse and worse and worse and so we have to We have to be honest about the problems that we face if we ever want to fix them and ignoring them and sticking the head in the sand and saying your racist for pointing it up Pointed out is actually the racism In my opinion 100% man Guys jumping on this conversation want to hear what you guys think down in the comments. Let us know man Um, that being said we got one more set of headlines here for you. Um, this is a bit so quick way headline number three. This is an interesting turn of events um Hello, I'm the three reads Legacy media DC journals come around to investigating dim scandals years after conservatives sounded alarm Oh, so this is basically just a recap of the relay f show for the last you know four and a half years It's pretty much what this is everything sure it all came out. Well, you know what? That's a big reason why they they keep us off the fucking radar Oh for sure because dude if if they put us out there in front of everybody Then everybody goes back and sees oh fuck these guys have actually been spot on about shit. I'm fucking on you know And you know, and here we are you know four and a half years later now they're fine. Look bro Tell tell me a show um tell me a show That has been more spot on than us and calling the shit out Only when that comes close will be Alex Jones I know Alex Jones Alex jump people people don't listen to Alex Jones Because they see him on Rogan getting fucked up and have bro the guy the guy had missed in 20 fucking years He's been doing a way longer than we have that's right for sure like bro And people's love to set it first of all you see him getting shaped. Mm-hmm. He looks fucking great But but but dude he's you know, he's loud and he's kind of obnoxious and kind of like me, you know Well shit. Yeah like me like but but but but people don't recognize Him you know because of certain other things that he's maybe overstepped on right he's done a couple things that were over steps Um potentially Yeah, I mean Yeah, yeah, I mean that's the truth, you know like but at the end of the day bro nobody else You know We've been ahead everybody way ahead And you know, but now it's true because league you know legacy media says this of course well, you know, and I think that's a You know, that's a problem with the conservative and middle of the aisle people Because they'll criticize the media right they'll say things like I can't believe they're not talking about this Or I can't believe this or that or the And then once they report on it, they're like oh see it must be true Bro, you're validating them after you just said that they're liars right so what difference does it make if they say it or not say it Give what I'm saying so so it's like weird how people think and they're like, you know Um, you know, these people are so corrupt. I can't believe they're not doing anything about this. It's like Well, that's a that's a paradox like that's a fucking that's a that you know what I'm saying like yeah, it's never enough You just said That they're not credible and they're corrupt and then the second thing out of your mouth is I can't believe they're not doing anything Which one is it yeah, right, you know, gotta show a shower there yeah But it is interesting. Let's dive into some of the things that have come around so the specifically this is uh New York Times, which has been the biggest I guess Violator of truth in my opinion Um, let's dive into this a little bit legacy media long time politics reporters are increasingly reporting on scandals that rock the Democrat party ahead of the november election shining a Dishonel light on political issues that Republicans had long spotlighted and railed against um Quote a full four and a half years after the post bombshell series on Hunter Biden's influence pedaling schemes The New York Times has Dined to take an interest in the first former first sons corruption the New York Post editorial board wrote in a piece last Week slamming the New York Times for reporting on Biden corruption allegations years after the outlets Another outlets had already uncovered reported details Quote we'd say the times willingness to at long-last cover this comes better late than never But it only published the story now that it doesn't remotely matter anymore the editorial board continue New York Times declared an article published on Friday that former first son hunter Biden quote Salt support from the state department to a dis former employer Ukrainian energy energy company barisma While his father served as vice president hunter Biden allegedly leveraging his last name and father's political status in the US Has long been criticized by conservatives We have a legend that hunter and his father engaged in influencing Influence pedaling through barisma Hunter Biden was paid millions of dollars while serving on the board of barisma after joining the company as legal counsel in the spring of 2014 Before being elevated to board of directors later that year um, and of course, you know Biden said oh he had no involvement in the son's dealings Um, and that was right before he issued a sweeping ten year pardon for the oval office Uh before leaving the oval office is where he protected hunter Biden from any offenses that he is committed or may have committed Um since right before he joined the board. So I mean, you know, they got there. They also came out Um, New York Times were in a column last month claiming the scientific community badly misled the public So neither they lied not that New York Times lied and pushed bullshit. They were just misled badly misled What's the difference between a lie and badly misled intentionality? I mean Yeah, I guess you're right They're trying to I mean, they don't they don't want to admit to it They're trying to admit to it without a missus because if they admit to it, it's crimes against humanity. They're complicit Yeah, they already are bro. Yeah, they are, you know, it's it's so crazy Um, yeah, the hard article headline was we were badly misled about the event that changed our lives You mean when you know, you mean you didn't get any red flags when Fauci was on TV literally three days into it saying we were never going back to normal. This is the new normal You mean that didn't raise me red flags. There was no red flags there. No Now the last little thing they also came out on was Biden's decline You got longtime DC reported Jonathan Allen and Amy Parnies Fight inside the wildest battle for the White House. They investigate Biden mental decline and the lead up to the general election calling him a Shell of himself like white like they're doing all of this stuff now Now now they want to do it now they want to admit. Oh, yeah, there was been some some issues we've been following them since 2020 It's pretty remarkable how they kept them very closed off He was a shell of himself when he entered the White House He was so so different from the man I covered as vice president guy who couldn't Who could hold court in the naval observatory with reporters until the wee hours. That's a lie Biden was fucked up when he went into the fucking office. Mm-hmm everybody knows it Everybody who has any sort of common sense and who isn't propagated to the point of just being a total NPC sheeple all right new that COVID was fucked up We recognized that when Fauci came out and said we're never going back. This is a new normal We recognized that when you know effective therapeutics and doctors were coming out saying these things will treat that And then they were losing their medical licenses We recognized that when people like Rogan came out and said hey, I used diver mectin And then they filtered his face to make it seem like he was sick as fuck. Yeah, okay We recognized it when we had people who designed the PCR test Who came out and said that it was ineffective for this kind of testing and oh by the way what happened to him? Oh, yeah He was dead on alive, okay And then we had all these doctors that came out and said hey, you know, Saraski who came on the show Um amongst others been taper Ben taper, you know who came on the show and said hey the PCR test doesn't work because of this and this and this You know the cycle rate can be falsely tuned up to where it can detect a Molecule that will not ever the viral load of that molecule could never get a human being sick to create false positives We knew there was something wrong when you know They started pushing this vaccine that had never been tested ever and claiming it was safe in three months You know people say oh well Trump did that. Yeah, I'm not saying he didn't We all knew that she was fucked up, okay When when people weren't allowed to have funerals, but George Floyd had a gold casket and when people weren't allowed to go outside But there was a hundred thousand people marching down the street with the fucking virus. Just knew that it was a protest So so like it didn't infect anybody like bro, unless you were like legitimately low IQ moron you could see through it You know or if you're one of these people who you know wants to be morally superior to everybody You know the masking thing was a was a literal genius move because it People who didn't have a strong sense of integrity and backbone would just go along with it to keep the peace And that is reflective of the mentality that they've had about these certain things that we've talked about on this show And that we continue to talk about on this show such as The black crime thing right people all know it's true, but they won't fucking say anything about it because they just go along And you know, I knew the mask didn't really work, but yes, yes, I don't want to argue with this person You know we let them pretend to be men and women and I'm not gonna fucking rock the boat because dude it just causes me problems like all of this shit is is psychological operation shit to get people to buy into basically keeping their mouth shut Or being ruined in every way shape or form and I'll be real with you dude like this is just my and people are gonna say I'm brad in but I'll be real um I'm proud of myself and I'm proud of you and I'm proud of these guys here You know why because we came back down a fucking inch the entire time and lots of other people profited and lots of other people got a lot of credit And lots of other people built big platforms because they walked the mother fucking lines to the colon and how they see it And a lot of those people I know for sure knew what was going on But wouldn't say it in public because they were afraid of what would happen to him And now a lot of these people are you know being rewarded and being you know And they forgot about all the people who actually called the shit out from the beginning right who actually took the arrows Yeah But like dude that's neither here nor there because enough people listen to where you know the shit didn't work But at the end of the day bro uh You know People know what's going on and and the problem is is that they're shamed in the silence and they're shamed in the thinking that their voice doesn't matter And they don't understand that you know your voice doesn't matter And if everybody thinks their voice doesn't matter that means the enemy gets to do whatever they want without any resistance You know your voice and your opinions and your thoughts Are the most valuable thing that you have to offer to anybody? Yeah, well apparently not enough people are Are feeling that because It's tiring still feel like they haven't platformed the fucking dictate their tyrannical moves Foulty just came out with a new clip have you seen it yet? Oh the one saying that another fucking Panamix gonna come yeah check this out What is likely to happen? I don't know if it's gonna be next year or 10 years of 15 or 20 years from now Is the emergence of another respiratory disease it may be another coronavirus because we know that Corona viruses Really Mostly in bats have the capability of binding to receptors that are in humans It could be another flu with dealing with age five and one now Which is bird flu which has taken the the somewhat disturbing step of infecting mammals namely cows and cats and other mammals which means it's adapting itself Mortally human so my concern Well, there is that whenever that happens the next outbreak will be of a respiratory disease That's easily transmissible that it has a significant degree of morbidity and we are making this a little bit Dangerous with the cuts and our attitude to science. Oh, absolutely. Huh, of course. We are oh, yeah You didn't believe us the first time now we're gonna release something that actually kills people by the way who said that Oh, I think we said that like four fucking years ago the actual play for these people that they listen This is chess We make a move they make a move we make a move they make a move to to assume Or believe that they already don't have the virus that he's speaking of ready to go Would be total ignorance All they have to do and they're gonna do it Because eventually this will be the play that puts them in a position of power again Remember when they were wanting to put people in camps. Yeah, and you had Trudeau saying What are we gonna do with these people that won't take the vaccine? They're a menace to society. You had Leanne win on TV saying Unvaccinated people don't have a place in society. You had New Zealand lady Chicago mayor a little like yeah, be reduce You had all these people saying that Unvaccinated people didn't have a place in society and we didn't know what to do with them And then you let Australia put in people in camps a candidate building camps and You know, it was highly uh Resisted by the citizenship, okay? So what's the next move if you if you've just been embarrassed and you've just been called out And you've just been showed to be liars and you got now you have the world media calling you liars What's the next move to regain power because that's all these people care about? The next move is to release the real virus and then blame all the motherfuckers out there that resisted the first time for everybody dying And then remove those people forcefully from society permanently To create a non-resistance Environment for whatever globalization that they want to have and blame it on Trump. You guys want to doge cut all the shit, you know I mean look dude. It's dangerous. We listen. These people are evil and somebody up there in Washington needs to pull the trigger and pull their balls out of their fucking shorts and pull the trigger on getting all the Police people arrested and put away because this dude's a fucking legit psychopath Okay, he did the thing with aids. He caused all kinds of death with aids He he his animal research is the most brutal disgusting research in the history of earth, okay? These guys in Nazi Germany have nothing on Fauci like that's the real doctor death of Modern history, okay And he's not a hero and Now people have figured it out and so how do they get regain their hero status? There's only one way and it's to embarrass and show the other side to be not credible and then remove them And that's gonna be the next move dude if something's not done like the You know Trump and they're already calling him a dictator anyway. He might as well just arrest all the motherfuckers That did all this shit and get rid of him before we go. Yeah, like they're already calling you that dude right like What were you? You know, let's fucking handle shit, but see Trump's in a unique position because He refuses to get off his position with the vaccine. So like dude, you know It's really hard to know who's who and what's what? I don't trust anybody up there to be completely honest um I trust Trump more than I trusted the people that were in there before But until I see some real shit. I mean that's that's that's up for debate because We're not seeing the upstein list, you know, we haven't seen arrests. We haven't seen accountability for COVID. We haven't seen The things that they've been you know promising we we haven't seen it and um That's no different than any other administration. They've come in and made promises. They haven't kept You know, where's the removal of of income tax and and all these things Like dude, you know, you have all these people panicking about tariffs. You know how you want to know how to fix it Cut the fucking income tax like in half or down to a reasonable percentage of 10 or get rid of it. All of it. Okay Um, do you think people would be bitching about terror? You don't know look dude I It's getting harder and harder to Believe that any of these people are going to do anything in our interests and We as the citizens of this country have a duty and obligation to Do what's best for this country and uh Doing what's best for a large group of people means pissing off some of the people It's just reality, you know, so You know It's very dangerous with this Fauci dude and these people the world Health organization and the world economic do you really think that these people Don't have a virus ready to go with an antidote for them that can cure it do you like You know people say will we what we think they're just gonna unleash a virus that could kill them Well, yeah, I think because they already have the fucking antidote for it. That was the reason for having a virus in the first place. Yeah We got to clear the cure for something that doesn't even exist yet, right? Let's do it. Yeah, I mean to bro listen, you know real talk the truth of the matter is is they probably already done it and Unless some sort of swift action all at once takes place where these people are just pulled off the street all at one time You know like noon on a fucking Monday and they're all all their communications cut off at once and every You know, there's really no stopping it because I'm sure they have like dead man switches and fail safes And if this happens is so and so do this and so you know the really the only way to stop it um Would be to arrest all of them literally at the same fucking time Uh on the same day You know in an organized effort Across across the fucking globe. Yeah, but you know When's that happening, right? You're You're There's no negotiating with these people. They're not going to give up. They're not going to just say oh yeah, we're defeated like let's just go home That's not what they're gonna do. They're gonna quote they're gonna back up when the last time you heard from Fauci Okay, that's what I'm saying now as you back out Been a minute bro and hiding I mean no no fucking Security detail you were hiding Now I mean look man, you know Look dude, right? It's it's it's hard for me To believe that something hasn't already happened to this dude Because of how many people's families were just utterly obliterated because of it Like it like if I'm him Like I came I'm not even showing my fucking face and it kind of shows you his ego To to even think that he can do that, you know, so We'll see man guys you let us know what you guys think Down in the comments. Let us know man Let us know with that being said. Let's get to the final segment of the show as always. We got thumbs up or dumb as fuck Now that's where we're bringing the topic we talk about it gets one of those two options talk about doing the right thing right Let's talk about it A thumbs up we got go to Florida. That's always something you're coming out of Florida Man, we spend a lot of time on thumbs up in Florida. Yeah, dude. I mean Yeah, it's a lot of good stuff. Yeah happening in Florida Uh, let's check it on Florida. All right thumbs up. It doesn't work out. I read Florida principal caught using Walmart foam plate hack put on disciplinary leave My friends told me to I don't know what that is. This motherfucker was stealing from Walmart bro How This is the scan hack. Yeah, right? You like you take a fucking, you know TV you ring it up as a fucking tomato You know, no man. Yeah, is that what people do? Fuck yeah, fuck yeah Oh, yeah, man, this is fucking principal got caught. You see my friends told me to do it. That was this No, it was his excuse. Yeah Every middle schooler is told just because your friend does something risky It doesn't mean you should Unfortunately one middle school principal from Florida did not follow that age old advice and was arrested After copying a friend shoplifting hack Gregory Lewis principle that Bach Academy North and poke county was called stealing 37 dollars 45 cents worth of goods from Walmart and White Haven on Saturday afternoon during his arrest Lewis submitted to the crime and said he thought he would try it out after his friends taught him how they shop Using the tactic quote we sit around talking hey, I did this let me try and see what I can get away with Lewis has heard telling the police on the arrest footage I did something dumb today and I understand it. He said regretfully Coordination police Lewis has been Skip scanning a common shoplifting method where customer scan cheaper items while sneaking more expensive items through Walmart security observed in placing disposable foam plates between the pricier items While using a self checkout. This is method similar to the banana trick used by shoplifting Where they scan a cheap item like the fruit But take a more expensive item So apparently he's yet a large pack of light bulbs bacon and frozen butterfly shrimp Is what he did this for Lewis admitted the skip scanning offense according to the arrest affidavit Lake walls chart charter charter schools this place Lewis on leave pending a review according to the interim superintendent All Ricky Smith Fortunately, it's turning out turning our profession into a sad situation entire poke county teacher James Barker Told the news here's here's the principal man Stupid ass Throw away your whole fucking career for $37 dude that's what I'm saying like I mean you think you'd be doing all right You know, I'm saying your principal man you're doing all right it's $37 bro Oh Man This is a common thing when people do I mean well, I mean listen like I'm here and this is the other piece of it too Right because like I mean a lot of these large retailers complain about that type of theft But it's like that's what happens when you replace humans to do that job You know, I'm saying you put these fucking scanners. I'm not I'm not Pro scanner. I'm pro people you know, I'm saying I have people with fucking checkouts man It takes the same amount of time. It's not quicker. What bothers me is it like you know people think it's okay to steal from companies Because they think that the companies you know, fill it Yeah, and then and then the prices go up and then they're like all the companies being greedy right You Stole shit for free, right You know for like let's use this for an example like looking California right now, you know you got Walgreens and all these other companies closing up their stores in these areas where They're allowed to shoplift up to a thousand dollars without being arrested for anything right right and then The businesses end up closing because they can't Actually make a profit and cover their operating expenses And then those same communities tell people that those companies are racist or they don't want to serve these certain communities or no They don't want to serve those communities because it's impossible to make money and while Walmart or Walgreens or other companies might be these huge again at companies They still look at their stores on a per store profit basis So if I have a store in California That is getting robbed every single day and it's upside down That drags all the other stores, okay, so it would make sense for me to close it has nothing to do with racism or Well anything has do with the be has do with the behavior of the people in that neighborhood And that's not that's not discussed because you know if he's bring it up your racist Let's do stupid as fuck. Well, I mean Yep And you know, he's probably gonna you know Well, he'll probably keep his job Probably He's only been fired well. I mean, yeah look man What an idiot man Yeah, pretty fucking stupid. Yeah, I'm down for that one man. I agree At least like I'm not thinking is too like you weren't gonna steal some shit like do better than fucking bacon light bulbs and fucking shrimp man I put some TVs in there or something. I don't know Like fuck man. You know I'm saying I mean fuck do a bike something. I mean how about this? How about just don't steal Yeah, I just don't steal how about just like be a responsible human and set a good example What kind of example is this guy setting around other kids? That's what I'm saying you're the principal, bro You They don't care. Say it's you people don't care bro Listen when civilization starts to act like this and behave this way it ends up crumbling It's history So I think we're in for a very rough ride because the culture has been so diluted And yeah, I think there's gonna be people that can turn it around and fix it But there's gonna be people that just completely You know what I don't know what's gonna happen It's just So Society seems to have lost its more compass and If we want the country to be good and we want the world to be good we have to understand that It's made up of individuals and how you live and how you behave and how you carry yourself and the money that you produce The ideas that you put into reality the information you consume All creates an end product in you that either is a representation of what we want this country to be or It's not and it's not other people's job to live the standard of what we need here in the United States It's your job and until you realize that you have a responsibility to live that standard and still that standard than people around you and hold them to that standard We're gonna continue to swirl down the drain You know what I mean? So it's not the politician's job to Fix all this shit that's going on and that's that's the lie that we're being told you know, we're like somebody do something Well, that's somebody is you and until everybody accepts that regardless of your follower account regardless of your platform or or any of this shit That it's your responsibility to live the standard of what you think Americans are supposed to live Whether you're you know white black Fucking gay straight whatever whatever man Uh, if you're not living that you're part of the problem and that's that True, man Guys, Andy Don't be a hoe Case closed
