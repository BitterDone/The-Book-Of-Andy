It's been a hell of a year though man For a lot of people i think that that's the other thing too. It's like it's it's been a it's been a lot Going on and on yeah, you know it's going to get way worse Yeah, well i mean on top of that too though. I feel like it's also gone by super quick. Yeah, you know i'm saying Like i feel like that too like it's already fucking November man. Yeah at the end of November You know i'm saying it's just been going by super super quick man And so i think it's for some reason it's like the holiday times is always the time people start to slow down and yeah Try to ground themselves before they they lie yeah the problem is bro for a lot of people especially with their fitness Is they just give up and they'll put on 10 15 pounds and 45 days yeah And bro that 10 15 pounds got to take you 60 days to get off You know what i mean like It's just uh in a real way. Yeah, you know if you do it the right way But uh, you know a lot of people during this time of year they create a bigger mountain for them to climb and If i were to recommend it i would say to avoid that Yeah, just try to maintain where you are right now Yeah, yeah, or or try to get better right now. Yeah, you know Everybody else is getting worse so if you can get better at widens to get yeah, absolutely man. Absolutely Um well, so no one surprised That's from going to all right Let's get it Guys, Andy question number one Andy Uh, COVID really killed a lot of small businesses and shifted the wealth over to the big companies like Walmart Amazon et cetera Um, now with a few small-sized businesses. They're getting back to somewhat normal What do you think would be the best way for us? As Americans to support small local pro-American businesses in spite of the ultra-conveignant way the big box stores do business How do you compete with that? You just have to inconvenience yourself you have to understand that when you make an investment In a real company owned by real Americans that employs people in their community um These are things that You're going to have to do if you want the economy to continue to provide jobs and provide value and not be owned by three or four mega corporations Uh, and then by the way if they own all if we have three or four mega corporations We have basically one culture being dictated us, which is the woke culture that we all fucking hate Okay, so if you don't want them to be in control of everything You have to understand that it's going to take some conscious effort to move outside the realm of what is convenient To taking pride in doing things that are inconvenient to support Real-American people yeah, not the you know the wal-marts and the amazons of the world right um I'm going to tell you this too. This is real important for you guys to understand They're going to try to close a bunch more businesses between now and election time. Okay, so whatever they have planned I've been talking to you guys on cti about this for for years now It's a pandemic or a war and they're going to use whatever assets they have necessary It might be both to shut down business again and use it as a way to to scrape even more into their into their coffers and um You know, you guys have to be preemptively prepared for that and that means you're going to have to prepare your mind That you are not going to give in you're not going to close your business. You're not going to comply with anything they say and Um That process should start now like you should start realizing that over the next year Probably a year to the day from now is probably going to be one of the hardest times In America to own a business that has ever existed for multiple reasons now. What does that mean for you? That means that you're going to have to get extra diligent and aggressive about not just um Staying in business, but also evolving your business to be more successful A lot of times when the economy shifts and things change and we go through hardships People shift into this mindset of just staying open and just staying open will get you killed by default Because just staying open means that you're not trying to improve. You're not trying to evolve You're not trying to press forward and basically what it does is it puts you into a mental place where Your mentality goes from we're trying to become something we're trying to build something to We're trying to maintain this thing and the law of business still applies even during hard times which means There is no maintaining there is only moving forward and then there is falling behind Because the world is going to continue to move forward even through hard times So we have we as business operators have to understand that as hard as it is and as hard as it might get It's going to be important to stay on your egg game to make sure you're doing a great job To not lacks your standards in any way and to continue to try to push forward And for the businesses that make it through which will all of those businesses that make it through operate the way I just said When things get better again, which they will they will be sprinting at a full pace Where everybody else is kind of picking up the pieces and try and it takes them two or three years to try and you know get it going Most companies being two to three years. Yeah, it gives you a two to three year head start on everybody else Because like so many companies will just go into this like maintain Shit, you know what I mean So there's that but I think the main thing is is like dude we have to be real We have to inconvenience ourselves to shop with people intentionally. It's not that inconvenient It's not that inconvenient to you know to not order things on Amazon and to actually just order them from the company directly That's not that bad like ordering from the company, you know, it's not that inconvenient to you know Go support small locally owned businesses or even medium-sized locally owned businesses It's not that inconvenient to look at a company who may not be small And say we're supporting like we get that here in St. Louis with first form and ask to right like St. St. Louis is an amazing fucking town It like everybody's like why why do you live in St. Louis? Well, you'll never get it because you don't live here But I love the people here and I love this community. I love this town And they are they treat us very well And even though we've become bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger They still understand that we're a small business and the scheme of things And that we're providing jobs and building careers in a pro-American way right right So we get massive support and what happens is the community rallies behind us And we continue to do better and better and better like one of the biggest driving factors of our companies is our support that we get here locally You know, and we don't talk about it enough, but that's the truth You know if you walk through St. Louis bro There's a good chance people are wearing first form shit drinking a first form energy or at least shopping at our retail stores And they're proud of it. It's not it's not like oh, yeah these local guys. They're like no fucking first form is fucking as St. Louis Right and like there's a pride there and For those of you guys that own businesses. I would lean into that with your communities You know get involved with your communities get involved with with the people in your town Become a place that They're proud to patronize and proud to support because and you do that by treating them extra well, right? And then reinvesting in the community over the course of time, but Dude, aren't you pretty small business entrepreneurs are under attack and we're gonna have our hands full this next 12 months It's gonna be very important that you guys don't comply with any of the shit that's going on and to make sure that you keep moving forward and not getting in this rut of maintaining Yeah, I love it man. Absolutely All right guys question number two Andy Andy I'm in high school and I have recently started a Christmas light installation business with one of my closest friends We both put money into the advertising and equipment But I feel like I invest way more than he does in the business Um, I was the one who came up with the idea to start the business We used my truck and trailer my ladders. I make all of our ads made our logo, etc All he has done is invest his money He also would rather go out and party instead of working on the business on the weekends When I brought up the topic of ownership of the company he thinks this is 50 50 Should I just bluntly tell him that we can't work like this together or should I try to Paying a picture of how I see it and try to amend the situation. What advice do you have for me? Well first of all you should never get into a business Without clear expectations and understanding of what's what to start This is how you get in messes like this. Yeah a lot of young entrepreneurs will get in these Mentalities and by the way, I'm the same you know Chris is my best friend. So that's how we started the business um When they want to build a business they want to do it with their friends, which is a noble thought I must say it sounds good it does sound good and it can be good But it can only be good when both partners are bringing different things to the table All right, and the reality of this situation is he brought something to the table You didn't have which was capital and that's a normal business relationship Over the course of time as your business grows there's going to be situations where you borrow money from The bank or you you get an investment from a silent investor Well, that silent investor isn't required to come in and do the operations He gave the money you gave you the money. That was his part, okay? So so that to what it sounds like to me is that's what he's understanding the other guys understanding of the deal is which Is it is a deal? That's a very real thing. There's a lot of people who invest they're called investors that don't do shit with the operations of the business So what this sounds like to me is You came up with a good idea you got your buddy in on it you wanted his money to come in on it But and he was okay with that but now you want him to do all the shit with you too Which dude if you guys agreed to that up front that's one thing But it doesn't sound like you did So the best way to handle this is to understand that you made some mistakes and your organization and launch of the business and then have a conversation with them and say hey look man I know that You know you gave the money in it, but I'm doing all these things and this and that but like real talk if this is going to work I'm going to need you to help out with some of this stuff not just give me your money And we're going to work that out and if you can't do that Then let's work out a deal where I could pay you back your money and then I can go on my own way right and and there's no reason It's not a hostile Talk it's not an argument. It's not uncomfortable It's just the truth and I think the reason that most of these things turn into bad things Is because we anticipate them being bad before we have the conversation instead of just looking at them for what they are This is a miscommunication that you have between you and your business partner that needs to be rectified So it's not just hey man, I can't fucking do this anymore. It's like hey bro look I know we agreed to this and I'm assuming that you thought this was this was I must have miscommunicated because actually I need this help too Okay, and so like if we're going to move forward and build this out to what it could be I'm going to need you to do these things to help me do do what we're doing here and then if he's not willing to do that He's okay. That's cool Then let's work out a deal where I can pay you back the money and get out or I could bring in another investor That's willing to do those things and we can make you haul on the backside and dude there's this kind of thing happens in business all the time It's totally normal and I don't think you should hesitate to have that conversation in fact it will probably condition you for the millions of other hard conversations you'll have over the course of business because the Christmas light Decoration business probably and probably isn't going to be your business forever, right? So you're learning and you're learning how to do a business um It's important for you to have those conversations. So that's that's what I would do and that's what it sounds like to me. It sounds to me like You know, he just probably doesn't know that he's supposed to be doing these things Um or you didn't make it clear and there's some some things that need to be fixed up there You know, the funny thing is Is that sort of relevant to how we got started in business too and I think this is a worthy story for you guys to know you know When Chris and I first started as to You know Chris Chris pretty much did all the work like he did he did all the back end work He didn't know much about products and didn't know much about sales So I did that part Chris did all the back end stuff and Real talk there was a time for a long time many many years Where he did way more than I did okay, but then when the when the business grew I was able to discover what I Was gifted at which is branding and vision and I became a massive asset to him. Yeah, so What assets does this guy have that you're in discounting because he's not doing it now that could serve you later That's something to look at as well. Yeah, because everybody knows me as the quote unquote Business guy out of the whole organization, but the reality is is you know for the first five or six years That motherfucker did all the work. I didn't do shit. I talked to customers You know what I mean? I went door to door. I passed out flyers. I talked to people because that's what I could do But once we got to a point where we were expanding I was able to bring immense value because of my knowledge of those things. Yeah, that makes sense So there's when you're in a business partner relationship There's times during the course of the business where each partner is going to have more value than the other partner That makes sense. It's not always good. Yeah, it's not always like you're this one guy as the guy Sometimes you're gonna go through phases where that where your friend Maybe he saves the business because he's got some skills that you don't even know he has yet There's all kinds of things to think about and very few times like like when I come in here at first form a lot of people think Oh, Andy's doing this, but the reality is I got Jason. I got Sal I got fucking an amazing team of executives and those guys are highly skilled people like They're carrying the weight, you know what I'm saying? So We have to be real about how this works now. I realized that you're just getting started And this is probably a heavy answer for us, but but there's a lot to it and you should be thinking What's what would this be like like how would you address this conversation? If you were Five years down the road and you were doing 20 million dollars in sales. How would you address it? Right think about it like that You know what I'm saying? So There's ways to think about these things, but ultimately guys the truth is is that we have to get very comfortable having Good communication with our business partners And I don't like to say like a lot of people will say, oh, I got to have a hard conversation. It's not a hard conversation It's just a conversation man. You're building that up. Yes. Yes. Yeah, like stop saying I got to have a hard conversation Stop saying that about your girlfriend or your boyfriend or your husband or your wife or your business partner And just for say I got to have a conversation Because it takes a lot of the weight and the pressure off of that and it just makes it what it is Which is we're not communicating and we got to get on the same page and that's that's as simple as you can make it The simpler you can make it the less pressure you have to carry Which makes it easier to get to an actual resolution and then the last thing I'll add to this Is that when you have these conversations? You should be understanding that the the idea is not to win the conversation It's not to I'm not trying to get my way. I'm trying to get the best way V-way V-way, okay? And a lot of people especially when they're young they want to win the conversation the idea of winning the conversation Is is a faulty idea Conversations are not things to have won. There are things to have to find a resolution that serves the purpose of what we're working to do and That comes with humility and the removal of ego Which is hard to do when you're young real talk. Yeah, so like now when I have to have conversations with Let's say Jason and Sal or Chris or you know one of the guys here Or anybody or fucking Ed who on partners with in our tea or whatever whatever that going on it's the the The context of the conversation is not we got to do it my way the context of the conversation is hey What's the best way so that we can make this work and win? And that's that's where a lot of business owners and leaders really fuck up dude. They fuck up their whole lives It's not about winning bro It's about finding the best path forward. If you want to be a great leader your leadership style should be I'm going to listen to you. I'm going to listen to you. I'm going to listen to you two guys And then I'm going to figure out what I think the best answer is even if it's not mine Yes, you know, I'm saying it may not be yours. It's probably not going to be yeah like the real you know what I mean sometimes it will be but You know the the goal of what we're trying to do here is to win So the outcome of the conversation should be What's the best for everybody here? Not just because I love this or this is me or I did this or I put this money in or I did all the work Dude, fuck all that Sometimes you're going to do more work than your business partner. Sometimes he's going to do more work than you That's an ebb and flow that naturally happens So my advice ultimately here is to have a conversation get on the same page Address the conversation with the context of we're trying to find the best solution possible And then move forward from there. Yeah, I love it. I think this is awesome I like seeing these these questions and stories we're seeing a lot more younger people Coming in at like starting businesses. I think it's fucking great. Well, dude, listen. This is hard shit like what I just explained Like yeah, I can rip it off and it sounds real easy, but remember I was a young dumb entrepreneur that in 19 years old didn't know shit Okay, so I've done this and made all these mistakes so many fucking times bro. It's insane This is experience bro. This is not this is not you don't supposed you're not supposed to just know this shit Yeah, you know what I mean? It's learners. Yes. Yes. I love that man One one one thing I want to follow up on this question. No one we can talk about conflict resolution right which your partners or your even execs Have you found it to be difficult when you know, let's say you're a passionate person right and then you know You're a whole team. They're also passionate Like how how have you handled those conversations when it's like, you know, it's not necessarily okay My decision is the best, but you truly believe that you have the best goal and somebody else does as well And you guys are equally passionate on it. How do you have those those conversations? Well, I'm overpowering you have to know yourself first, okay? So I have this and you guys all know that all the guys hearing this room talking to I have an overpowering Passion I have an I can walk into a room and there can be ten other passionate people in three seconds They'll shut the fuck up, okay real talk But that's not good. That's a that's a hindrance to me because what ends up happening is the rest of the guys shut up And I don't hear their good ideas, okay? So we have to understand that sometimes you shutting the fuck up is what produces The best result. So how do I address that? It's hard, okay? Because I am passionate, but I have to sometimes remember like all right look Just shut up and let them talk let them say their shit Let everybody go and then you go at the end and so like that's something that that has helped me but dude real talk I'm not great at it all the time like sometimes it sometimes I do know the answer Buff all right, this is a weakness of my leadership. No, this is this is a weakness of my own leadership I'll just be real Sometimes I know the answer like I already know and and I'm urgent because I want to win now, okay? So I already know the answer. I don't want to fucking hear it from ten other people. I already fucking know right okay So I'll walk in and be like this is what the fuck we're doing all right however You can make a lot of mistakes doing it that way because maybe Maddad has a couple ideas that will make it even better than that right? So it's very it's that's my weakness as a leader my weakness is not not being assertive. It's being too assertive and So there's this really good book uh called the five dysfunctions of a team that I read I don't know 12 15 years ago and It kind of goes through this process of how you get people to contribute and be valued on your team And I read that book and it changed my perspective, but I still struggle with it So what I try to do man is I try to be the last to talk like when we're in a meeting If like I know the answer or I all right if I don't know the answer I fucking you guys have to talk right But sometimes like I get too aggressive and too ambitious and too passionate and I want to go in and be like all right We're just doing this for the sake of getting it done quickly right? I like to move now I don't like to move like I want to I want to I want to be there now and That's unrealistic So sometimes that gets the best of me as a leader, but you know the truth of the matter is is being aware of your own shortcomings Is how you become great at it? Yeah, and um So I have to be very conscious of that Yeah, for sure me and then I got because I remember the time when I first got with you You know how to ask you a question like man, why are you guys going to do it this way Ignorantly not understand like well, fuck I'm sure you guys have thought about this idea 15 fucking years ago Well, and that's that's part of the problem It's gotta be difficult to do so so like dude So one of the frustrations with having a lot of business experience like you guys probably hear this like when you see me do live Q&A or if you're at Arate sometimes I'll get fucking annoyed at the question Yes, like yeah, because I'm like are you fucking serious dude because I forget that you don't know Yeah, you know what I mean? And I've gone through this so many times That it's it's like air to me like it's just the way it is and the more experience you get the more it's like that But also the more you get like that the less involvement you can make because you're not allowing for any other opinions or insights So you have to be very aware that like just because it's gone this way 20 times Maybe this is the 21st time it's gonna go a little different So we have to leave room there for the for the outside Perspectives to allow you to make the proper decision. Yeah, that makes sense absolutely, yeah Guys Andy question number three Andy this actually flows perfectly man Andy I suck at having hard conversations I'm growing up whenever hard conversations will come up family with either Call it complaining or respond with that victim mentality even throwing Bible verses into the conversation Now whenever these conversations are needed I feel like I'm complaining or being somewhat selfish I have a five year old son who is very observant and out of many things I want to install in him that this is one of the things I'm not sure how to how to have those conversations How did your dad teach you to have these hard conversations What I just said they're not hard conversations. They're unemotional just conversations You know about finding resolution. It's all about the perspective, bro. It's about it's about looking at things Like well first of all you have to understand If you aren't willing to communicate you're not gonna get shit Okay, you're gonna get paid bullshit. You're gonna have a shitty job. You're never gonna get ahead You're gonna get bitter. You're gonna look around and be like everybody's passing me by No, they're not passing you by you're not learning a very real skill set that you must have to be successful Which is to communicate so if you can't communicate you have less value This is a real thing and so when you look at your little five year old son You say I want to set a good example for him right now You are not setting a good example for him. I'm gonna tell you that right now He is learning right now to be passive to be weak to go with the flow And what'll end up happening is that kid will grow up witnessing his dad Be this way and then he will be that way and he's gonna get the same shit. You're getting which is probably not much right now Okay, so learning how to communicate effectively is the most important skill that you have to have for a prosperous life Prosperous with your relationships your friendships your job Anything that you do It's a requirement to be able to communicate effectively if you have some sort of reservation or some sort of mental block You have to figure out how to get over that now. How do you get over The fear of having conversations if I had to give you a million dollars to answer this right now What would you say you have to do to get over the fear of having conversations DJ What we have to do? There you go million bucks. I got it. Yeah, not really though Not really no I'm just saying yeah But here's what I'm saying dude like this is this there's only one way to move past the things that you suck at Like when I first started playing baseball bro my first year of baseball. I didn't get a single hit a single hit the whole entire year Okay, the next year I figured it out and I started rapping mother fucking bombs. Yeah, okay? Like this is how it works to follow Yeah, they would come back Listen, I hit those motherfuckers in 82 they went over the mountain. Yeah, I'm rich. All right. I'm rich. Like dude look we This anything that we want to get better at Comes down to us doing the thing that we are afraid to do because we suck at it all right and right now brother You suck and having conversations. You just listed off 15 objections as the why you don't have it Oh, I'm that they threw bible versus that. I mean man fuck that Like do you want do you want to lose? If you want to lose keep being a fucking pussy about having conversations You will not make any money you will be pissed off You won't have any good relationships because you can't communicate You won't have any real friendships because you can't communicate and your life's gonna fucking suck And lots of people live their whole lives like this because they're afraid of saying things That are very obviously things that they should communicate. It should be said yes And so we have to remove this fear From our minds and our hearts that having a conversation is a hard thing. It is not hard It's very simple you move your mouth sounds come out like it's real simple Dude if you break it down to how simple it is there's nothing to be afraid of Their reaction to what you say that is their responsibility now they might get upset they might get upset They might throw a tantrum they might you know fucking get angry But the reality is dude. It's not gonna matter because even if that relationship crumbles You're gonna have the skill of communication that's gonna allow you to build amazing relationships with other people And other careers or other relationships that's going to benefit you. Yeah, so Stop thinking of this is like dude this person whoever wrote this that you're By you saying well, I had this happen to me and I had that happen to me and I had this happen to me I had that happen to me bro. That is victim mentality Like whoever told you and your family they're fucking right like you're being a victim I got yelled at one time when I tried to say something I Got told I was stupid. I Bro that happens to everybody. That's not exclusive to you You know me times I got told I was a fucking do you ever times I get told me fucking more on today? Like you guys read the comments on some of these videos on the internet Like if I actually listen to them like I would want to do I'll go home and fucking cry every day Like fuck those people. I don't give a shit man. I'm gonna say what the fuck I gotta say and however you react to it is okay with me That's dude. That's a place of freedom that you want to get to okay because When you're afraid to say things when you're afraid to speak the truth or you're afraid to communicate You are living in an environment That owns you okay if you want to feel free and you want to feel light and you want to feel good You have to develop the the one the skill of communication but also to the courage to say the way things are Even when it's uncomfortable and if you can if you can do those two things like you and I do on the on the CTI episodes every fucking day Bro I walk around light as fuck a lot of people are like They're like how do you do all that like how do you bro that would that's gotta be hard I'm like it's really easy man. I move my mouth the shit comes out And however they react as the way it is and like what are they gonna do? Well, you're gonna call my business a complain get me fucking fired Well, I'm not firing me Like it's not happening. Yeah, right. So like Dude, I'm I feel good about that like what the dude real talk it will become the thing you're most proud of in your life Like you know what I'm most proud of I'm most proud of is that I could say whatever the fuck I want and nobody can ever say That I'm being told what to say or someone's influencing me or like my sponsors are telling me not to say I don't take sponsors telling when listen these fucking idiots tell me what to say or not to say You know I'm saying there's a tremendous amount of like confidence and freedom and your your shoulders back and your head hell high Like when I walk in a room bro This is real shit when I walk in a room with all the other people out here who are famous right I know I'm the baddest motherfucker because they're all too pussy to speak the truth It is what it is. It's very few exceptions. Yeah, very few. No, that's really okay So it is what it is it bridge it builds you up tell the truth speak the truth learn how to communicate You'll build an amazing life with an amazing income with an amazing partner You'll have amazing kids and I think most of the success in life comes down to us getting over this idea bro. You ever heard that saying Uh The squeaky wheel gets the grease Like there's truth to that like the person who speaks up gets the reward you're never gonna be wealthy if you can't learn to fuck and speak up If people always think of that as like a negative. Wow that that that that quote there bro the world doesn't reward Meekness it doesn't reward humility the reason that those values are overvalued in society Is for two reasons one the people who run society want us to be poor little means they don't want us to say shit They want us to accept scraps. They want us to be dependent on them and two It's much easier to live that kind of life than it is to have the courage to actually speak up and communicate and stand up for yourself so because We are in a situation of comfort and convenience We act like there's no real problem and because we act like there's no real problem that real problem It's fucking massive and out of control and it's a ruining our lives. So look man Learn to communicate if you can learn to communicate and you can remove this idea that it's hard or that it's bad or that people are gonna be upset or this person is gonna be upset with me Bro it brings a tremendous amount of success and freedom to your life and it's something that's required to be The kind of person you're trying to be that's reality It's funny because like all the conversations that I've had that I thought we're gonna be these hard difficult ones They're actually the easiest ones But then the ones that I thought would be nice and easy, bro. It's turning to a fucking fist fight You know look dude you're dealing with you get out your head. Yeah, it is what it is man. And I mean I don't uh I don't know like This is something This is an issue that I very rarely think about anymore and I forget that I wasn't always like that Like I wasn't always like how I am now There's I spent a lot of time like this man or this woman who ever wrote that question I spent a lot of time like that person where I was afraid to communicate and I was afraid to say what I thought And I was afraid to speak up and you know what happened to me when when when that happened I didn't make any money. I didn't get any of the opportunities I didn't have any good friends and I fucking was pissed off at everybody in the world because I'm like Fuck dude. I have all this shit to offer and you don't see it Well, they're not seeing it because you're not allowing them to see it so we cannot live in this Bro, it honestly this works itself into what's going on in the world today Okay, the reason a lot of you guys won't speak up and stand up or for the same reasons we're talking about now You're afraid of what might happen? You're afraid of what could happen you're afraid of what's so and so will think and then you live your the rest of your life Dealing with the the results of that and having frustration When in reality, dude, it's just a little bit of courage like look at the look at the the way society has been For the last However many years the last 10 years at least where so many people Disagree with the way societies going but it continues to go that way why Because nobody's talking about it. Why aren't they talking about it Because the other team has figured out that if they shame them and they make them feel stupid and they insult them And they bully them that that person will remain silent But those people that remain silent lose They lose there's no nobility in the silent majority. There's no nobility in you know Political correctness. There's the fucking truth and then there's shit that isn't true Like a man is a woman and a woman is a man. Okay, just because you understand biology doesn't mean you're a fucking big it All right, the truth is the truth is the mother fucking truth And it's always going to be that way and until you understand that not only should you learn to communicate in your personal lives where it's going to affect you the most And you also need to communicate what's going on in society. She's going to continue to get worse You know that's reality Guys, Andy that's three that's three go pay to fee Fuck up fuck up stoke counted millions in the coke bad bitch Who did slow got a own bank row can't fold does a note here shot case closed
