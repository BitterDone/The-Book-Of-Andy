ask Andy at Andy for sell it on or you go on YouTube and the Q and AF episodes drop your question the comments and we'll choose some from there as well now if you're new we have shows within the show it's not Q and AF every single day throughout the week we're going to have different formats tomorrow we're going to have what's called CTI that stands for cruise the internet that's where we put topics of the day up on the screen we speculate on what's true and what's not true and then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on in the world it's it's a current event show with a little bit of comedy then we have real talk real talk is just five to 20 minutes of me giving you some real talk and then we have 75 hard verses that's where someone who is completed the 75 hard program comes on the show talks about how their life was before how their life is now and how they use 75 hard to recalibrate their mental state and become the people that you see here on the show okay if you're unfamiliar with 75 hard it is the initial phase of the live hard program which is the world's most popular mental transformation program you can get it for free at episode 208 on

other show of this size in the world is we don't run ads the reason we don't run ads is because I like to keep it real with you guys and because of that we're constantly dealing with censorship shadow bands traffic throttling and you know if we ran ads we'd be listening to people cry about what I say on the show and I'm not doing that so I make a little deal with you you help us get the word out and we're not going to fill your ears with 30 minutes of bullshit I think that's a pretty good deal all right so at the show makes you think to make sure laugh it's good information if it changed your perspective if you think it needs to be heard do us a favor and share the show okay we got this little thing that we'd like to say here it's don't be a hoe sure the show all right what's up man it's going on man oh not much Monday morning yeah got some battle scores there aren't you yeah yeah I do man I got the uh what happened well I rode uh four we learned through Thorne Bush a couple of them you did as well I don't think you got as bad as me one is a press no yeah I made it out okay yeah uh you're welcome because I ran them over for you took all the right yeah right but yeah we went uh DJ and I went riding four wheelers on Saturday and uh yeah it was awesome yeah I was surprised dude you did well I mean how'd you think I was gonna do shitty yeah it's an engine man it's wheel seconds right you did good I mean that one vertical leds we went up I was I was I was wondering how you were gonna do you did all right yeah no point is there anything now I followed you I'm like I yeah yeah what's good you know that's right and we made it work yeah we did it's a good time the man yeah well uh fucking thorns did get me though they got you pretty bad yeah I did feel bad shit I'm like look look at this man taking all the bro it ripped my fucking arm off the handlebars when we were coming up out of the creek that dude it those those ones got me so bad it ripped my arm off I'm used to like rose bush thorns I don't know I don't know what those were either bro I never seen those before like two inch daggers yeah and then when we pulled out they were all stuck in me yeah wasn't any fun oh cool man well a little weekend little weekend mental break yeah cool yeah we need to do some more four wheels I'm down soon I am down yeah that was fun I'm down well uh guys it's Monday it's uh it is Q&A so let's uh let's get better today yeah let's do that because I got three goons for you all right cool knock these out guys any question number one a D&D J six years ago I helped build something incredible at my old company which has since become a massive success after laying the groundwork I left to be a stay at home mom now that my child is in school I reached out to my former boss about returning to the work field but he straight up ignored me how do I overcome the feeling of rejection and jealousy from being part of something so successful I think you got to be a realist okay you chose to leave something that you put a man's work into and now it has moved on and that's what happens so you guys have to realize this is the real world and it's very unforgiving it's not very loyal even if you're loyal and this this is a problem for a lot of people because a lot of people have good hearts and their loyalty people but they're loyal when they want loyalty right like when when you left how do you think they felt they probably felt like you weren't being very loyal all right and now you're getting a taste of what that felt like and you don't like it so my advice to anybody out here who's in this position is that you got to understand man there's two sides to every coin and just because you put some work in six years ago uh and it became a success doesn't mean shit it just doesn't okay and the fact that you went to raise a family that's admirable but that was your decision and that was your choice and the company that you worked for continue to move and I'm sure you do wish that you could get back in once it's somewhere that it wasn't six years ago I mean who doesn't want to do that right like uh I'm part of University of Alabama and you know I helped them start to win and six years later they're winning national I want to be on the team again right how's that sound right sounds pretty stupid doesn't it okay well that's what you sound like all right so we got to be realist about about decisions that we make in real life and when you are a part of something special I think it's important for you to recognize that you are a part of something special and instead of thinking that everything out there's something special you should come to the realization that there's very few special things out there where we get to invest our time our energy our skill set into a meaningful project and that matters and matters a hell of a lot more than just the paycheck you take home all right so if you you guys are out there and I'm talking to everybody if you're out there and you're a part of something that's growing that's you know uh part of a good mission it's something that you enjoy it's something that you feel like you know you should be a part of and it starts to get monotonous and it starts to get tiring and it starts to get bored you should make some you should do some real slow and clear reflection on are you just a little bit worn out or do you really need to make a change because I'm gonna tell you dude there's not that many places that give a fuck about their people and there's not that many places that are actively trying to grow people's careers they say they do but they don't and if you're in one of these places where you get to have input and you get to create and you get to build it's very important that you need to back up and say hey uh it's not like that everywhere and and you know that's an unfortunate reality you know uh a lot of times when people fall into something especially in the younger years of their life that's really good they don't have the perspective of what it's like everywhere else so when they do get tired they say oh I don't like this this isn't for me but then they go out and they experience all these other things that are like the real world so to speak where you know they don't give a shit about you at all they don't care if you build a career they don't care if you want a family all they care about is that you show up and you do your job and you take your money home and you don't cause any fucking problems and that's not a fulfilling rewarding career for most people most people want to create most people whether they believe that they are or not uh our team players they are creators they are builders and they want to contribute to something that matters and if you're part of that you should think very hard and long before you make a decision that's gonna abandon that because the reality is it's just really rare so how do I not feel jealous or how do I not feel bitter or I mean you got to be realist you know like you you don't have the standing to be jealous or bitter because you left all right so it's an interesting question about just even with value alone right like does value have an expiration date like how long can somebody hold on to the value input that they put in like how long does that one day last one day one day when you when you go when you go uh when you play baseball and you hit four for four on Monday and you go zero for four on Tuesday how good are you here's good as your last game that's the reality dude and that might be that's a that's a harsh example but that's also a real example the minute you stop contributing the the things you've done in the past don't necessarily matter and I know people are gonna get upset about that and they don't like to hear that but that's reality dude and that's even more so like if you're in a place where they give you credit for the things you've contributed and they value that and they're willing to work with you in your low times and then you know help you get back to the high times at some place you don't want to leave you know what I mean so it's just rare um but the reality is is you know I think that people have like to me but how I feel is not the same as everybody else for sure okay I mean with how you when people make investments with me so unique thing I remember that yeah you know what I mean and they go through a downtime I I could say okay they're going through a downtime but they've invested this much of their life they've done all these things let's work through it right you know now if it's uh unethical something that's a different story but when people have invested that matters to me but it doesn't matter to everybody right and because it matters to you you think that it should matter to everybody and the reality is is most places are not uh people friendly they say they are but they're not the minute your production goes down the minute you start coasting the minute you start fall off your value expires and they don't care to bring it back you know what I mean they don't they don't care about most places that's right they don't care about sitting down and saying hey what's wrong how do we fix this how do we develop this skill set how do we pull you out of this little mental funk you got going on in your life but the fact that when you do that the right way you develop a an amazing culture you do like a lot of people come into our companies and they're like how do you do this well I don't know we don't tell people to fuck off the minute they make a mistake you know what I mean but the reality is in most people do that so we have to be honest about it um and you know I think people in general put the way that they feel onto other people not realizing that other people don't feel that way you know like in this example this person saying man I built this I helped build this this is look how good it's doing and they feel like they still have a part of it in the title entitlement almost well I mean they I think if that person was running a company they would probably say yeah uh Stacy had a big part of building this let's let's talk to her but that's not how everybody is and you can't expect everybody to be like you and in business it is very cutthroat and it's very harsh and it's not always quote unquote what you want to think is fair but if you flip the coin over and you look at how they felt when you left hey Stacy left in the middle of this project when it was going you know and we made it work the reason they're ignoring you is probably because they think that you quit on them you know like yeah we made the Stacy had a couple hands in the beginning but when she quits she fucked us and we made it work anyway and so they might be thinking hey fuck Stacy she quit on us you see what I'm saying so we got it we got to be real about the decisions that we make and that's why you know we don't want to burn bridges we don't we don't want because you don't want to burn bridges you might have to cross again right so maybe had you known that you were going to come back you would have handled that situation a little bit differently maybe you would have said hey I'll do what I can from home hey let me do this or let me do that or hey let me take a step back and do this just to stay involved in what's going on but it doesn't sound like that's what you did it sounds like you left and you came back six years later six years in a company is fucking lifetime dude you know what I mean most companies don't make it six years so you know you got to be a realist you don't have it you don't have a standing to be upset I think that's an important piece too man because you've had plenty of employees who have left yeah and come back yeah you know I'm saying and like in those situations there there's still an honest conversation yeah about the bridge that's still remaining for sure it has to be well that's because those people that leave they were always contributing they were always doing good they got in a situation where you know they felt like they they need to go down a different path and my hope is always that if they decide to go down a different path they look back here and they say fuck I learned everything I need to know there I mean these I wouldn't be where I'm at right but there are people to go down that path and they realize that it's not what they actually wanted and they they call back and they say hey man you know I really miss it I want to be a part of it and usually when those people come back they're fucking amazing because they don't take it for granted anymore um but you know that that comes with no bridge burning that comes with no shit talking that comes with no issues there's that's a conditional fucking agreement right right like and and I'm just a big believer dude life is long you don't know when you're gonna need someone or when you're gonna want to fix a bridge or when you're gonna run into someone in a restaurant and it's gonna be real awkward because you are a fuck right you see what I'm saying like the world's small and life is long and it's a good idea to maintain relationships and had this person maintain a relationship that whole time uh you know I bet you wouldn't be getting an award right so you have any recommendations on how she should move forward with this I mean if you're dead set on on trying to get back in with that company I would uh I would force yourself into in in front of the decision makers face whether that be waiting outside whether that be writing a letter whether that be sending 50 emails um and if you want to move on you know you you move on with you might have to move on you move on with the attitude of okay I'm not gonna make that mistake again I'm gonna get into something I care about I'm gonna try to build it and uh I'm not going to you know just abandon whatever it is because I want to go do this and and dude a lot of people do feel entitled to that they feel like you know yeah but I was going to start a family okay lots of people start families bro you ain't the first month fucker in the history earth to have kids right that doesn't mean you get all these special treatments and you get to come and go as you please you see what I'm saying right so you know we got to be real dude and a lot of times people think that you know the company the companies have to do all these things because they have to and the reality is they don't have to do shit you know that that that manager or that owner that worked for you you know they don't have to do anything with you they have to call you back they don't oh you shit you quit on them you quit on them I want to quit to start a family it doesn't matter okay maybe you should have handled it differently but like the truth of the matter is I just don't think you have a position to be pissed and a lot of times when people get in this position they start talking shit on the company you you did that they didn't do that you did that and I think it's for you in this situation you have to own the responsibility and maybe you get in front of the decision maker say look dude I know I handled that poorly but here's the thing I love this place I want to be a part of it I want to contribute to it I know I can here's how I can and let's fucking do this and if they say no you don't have a choice you got to go do it somewhere else yeah yeah I love it man it's it's listen don't burn bridges that you might have to cross bro like life is long life is long okay and you never know when you're gonna need someone yeah I love it man guys any question number two Andy one p instagram they posted a real a couple of days ago they said the heaviest things in life aren't iron and gold but unmade decisions the reason you are stressed is that you have decisions to make but you're not making them this really hit home for me as a logical critical thinker who over-analyses way too many decisions I end up pushing things off to some future date or just not doing anything productive and falling into negative habits assuming at some future point I will just fall into place which I know is false thinking I'm also know Andy talks a lot about doing the things you know you need to do but aren't doing but focusing more on the decision side of things versus action I actually completed 75 heart phase one and two because of all the actions are laid out but for other items in my life where it's a hundred percent up to me to make the decision I I just struggle to have that same drive to make or do things and I feel like life has passed me by how does someone end up and a decision paralysis mode more times than not get out of that train of thought and become more decisive in a positive manner you are wasting your life you are letting your life pass by because you lack the courage to make the decisions that you know you need to make you got to be real about that if you don't make the decisions that you know you need to make time is continuing to go which means everybody else is getting better and you're staying the same which by default means you're getting worse and in terms of these unmade decisions being heavy there's a podcast I did a long time ago I can't remember what number it was but where I talk about to say in the monster okay the monster is all your unmade decisions it's all the things you know you need to do the work you need to do that you letting pass by you got it 119 119 on real AF yes sir okay it's 119 on real AF go listen to it I answer this entire question but the point is is that when we don't make decisions that we know we need to make it causes anxiety it causes depression and in reality it causes not to progress so that's extremely stressful and extremely anxiety inducing and this is why I tell you most of the anxiety that you feel isn't because you just aren't anxious it's because you're not taking the action that you know needs to be taken to get where you're wanting to go and it's making you feel that anxious feeling it's actually a very strong indicator that you need to go and then once you go you will be unburdened by these unmade decisions and it won't feel as heavy it won't feel as anxious and you'll be proud of yourself because you're moving and you know you're moving you can see it so make a list of the decisions that you know you need to make the ones you you're afraid to make a lot of times these are this is about money a lot of times this is about relationships a lot of times this is about your physical health but the fact of the matter is make a list of these decisions and start executing on the decisions make them part of your power list if you don't know what the power list is go listen to episode 16 on real a f it gives you the entire plan for literally never losing in life okay so plug them into your power list make sure the decisions get made you're gonna feel lighter you're gonna move faster and everything in your life is gonna start to materialize but if you don't make those decisions nothing's gonna change except everybody else is gonna progress and you're gonna stay the same which like I said by default means you're moving backwards so uh yeah man that's that's pretty much it this this almost sounds like like when I was reading through this again it it almost sounds like an awareness issue too right because I think it you know for most people it's easy to say oh I don't really know you know what to do or what what sure you do it's an awareness thing you're choosing not to see it right right and you said before I think also people pretend to be ignorant to the awareness yeah yeah you know yeah I don't know what I need to do okay open your bank account that's right yeah you know it's easy to do yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's an easy thing uh it's easier it's I think it is easier uh to do than just to say it but it's just a click of the awareness part how do you build that I mean look man uh this person if they've already completed 75 hard the right way you have the skills to make the decisions dude you know what you know what I figured out man a lot of people's lack of success comes from a lack of courage when we look at what happened over the last four years and how many people were pissed off and how many people were frustrated what was going on in the world and didn't say shit okay and those same people are always complaining about their income they're complaining about their business they're complaining about their job they're complaining about their significant other you know why your life sucks bro because you're a pussy that's it okay being successful in real life takes courage and part of the courage the biggest part of the courage is to make decisions stand on those decisions when really nobody else is in your corner you've got to make those decisions for you and that takes courage and when you don't have courage and you don't make decisions you become one of these NPC people in the world who just kind of floats through life and ends up being bitter and pissed and frustrated because they're not able to create anything all right and I think that most people the reason that they lack success in their life especially from a financial aspect is that they lack the courage to make the decisions that need to be made to put them in the position that they want to be in and I really think that's a big part of it and I never really thought about it until I watched everybody DM me and email me and text me and say I'm so proud of you for speaking up and then watch them not do shit and then when I took inventory of who those people are all of them are struggling so I started correlating it together whoa these people are they don't have courage and they suffer in life and so I think the courage to make the decisions that you already know need to be made that your anxiety is telling you need to be made is one of the biggest things that has to happen for you to be successful and most people are just not courageous enough to make the decisions that they know they need to be made and because of that they fucking don't get anything they don't get any money they don't get in shape they don't get a good partner they're pissed off at the world they think the world screwed them over when in reality it's there in action their lack of courage is screwing them over if we would have had 50 million people speak up the way that you and I have spoke up the last four years we wouldn't even be here we can be in this situation but so many people were afraid they were afraid because they're they're aunt whose you know a crazy person is gonna blast them on Facebook or they're gonna get yelled at by their you know person at work or whoever right they won't get invited to things given yeah you don't like one of those anyway yeah like dude you you when was the last time you truly stood on your own fucking business when was the last time when was the last time you didn't just go along to go along when was the last time you made a hard decision that you knew was gonna push your forward if you can't name that then your lack of courage is the problem that's the problem and that's why you're suffering so pull out your fucking balls make the decisions that you know you need to be made and start moving down the path you're gonna feel good and if you don't you're gonna feel bad and it's that simple guys Andy let's get to our third and final question here guys any question number three Andy so I'm 23 I work at a small company doing paintless didn't repair just starting to finally get good to where I'm about to start seeing major results my question to you is how do you balance putting in the work of hours trying to get better and sacrifice going out drinking with the boys and doing things like vacations because sometimes I feel like social media makes a person feel like they're missing out on just living life to the fullest but I know if I make these sacrifices now the future I'm sending myself up for what will be incredible but I do find it hard at times seeing people travel and doing things while I'm working on trying to better myself in career how do you keep yourself happy and motivated during that period first of all the internet's full of bunch of liars okay all these people that go out there and they take all these dramatic photos you know in front of the sunset or the sunrise or this or that I'm so at peace blah blah blah yeah they're at peace until they got to go fucking eat or they got to buy a new car or they got a problem at their house or or or or or their family gets sick right like it's real easy to go out and take some sunset photos and pretend like your mother fucking Buddha all right in the internet and and that's what we're dealing with here we're dealing with a whole bunch of people that pretend to be happy pretend to be enlightened pretend you know appreciate life experiences which you should by the way because they don't have anything else going for them they're not making any money they're not making any career moves they're not doing well in any other area and those photos are fucking free bro you could go out tonight and make a take a photo of the sunset and write some fucking bullshit and there's going to be people who are out here building their life who are going to be like god I wish I could do that but see here's the thing that you don't see you don't see them 10 years down the road you don't see them 15 years down the road you don't see them when they're 45 years old and they got to work at fucking Wendy's you don't see that shit how's that sunrise look now motherfucker it looks pretty shitty doesn't it because you fucked off on your whole 20s and your whole 30s and the reality of life is setting in which the reality is this nobody's coming to take care of you nobody's here to save you and if you don't invest the time up front to build a real skill set you're going to have problems in life real shit okay and then on top of it what kind of vacations do you want do you want to take a road trip to uh you know the lake an hour away or do you want to go to fucking Greece okay do you want to do you want to um you know fly southwest to to Disneyland on the discount fucking ticket or do you want to fucking fly first class and and take the Disney VIP experience what the fuck do you want what do you want for you and your family do you want to drive that rest of out piece of shit forward focus or do you want to drive a new Mercedes or a fucking new brand new truck what do you want okay because what you're investing now is going to determine what you get later and that's reality i'm going to tell you this all those dudes that you drink beer with when you when he says 23 all them dudes that you drink beer with at 23 are going to lose in life period they're going to grow up very few of them will ever snap out of alcohol culture and by the time they're 40 they're going to look like they're 60 they're going to be broke and you're going to be somewhere else and they're going to be looking at you being like um man i'm so proud of you you know except you know when you were staying at home working on your debt removal by the way there's a ton of money in that by the way a ton of money and paintless debt removal but they're going to be looking at you thinking like you know oh he changed you're oh no it's called being a grown up it's called investing your time in your energy knowing that there's going to be a payoff it doesn't mean you can't have a good time it doesn't mean you can't go to a barbecue once in a while it doesn't mean you can't day drink on Sunday once in a while with your boys watching football but what it does mean is you can't do that every Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday for 15 years and think that you're going to fucking win it's not going to happen all right so um at the end of the day bro you got to choose what you want do you want to win or do you want to lose do you want to be comfortable do you want to do you want to do you want to be fun now or do you want to be fun later all right and that doesn't always pay off look at Kobe Bryant Kobe Bryant worked his ass off built a fucking amazing career uh Hall of Fame one of the best players in any sport ever he retires gonna spend time with his family what happens to him he dies in a helicopter crash so there's no guarantee either way so just so you know and and you know soft people who want to have fun now they will justify their life yellow you're I'm only just now look dude it's not this or that it's it's deciding what you want doing what's required to get where you want and where you want to go is going to be different than where I want to go or anybody else wants to go so it's an individual decision but you can't be fooled by all these knuckleheads on the internet who don't have shit going on for them pretending like they're fucking Buddha and Yoda mixed together you know and living this carefree life you know we see all these people dude and if you really think about what they show you what else could they show you what else could they show you they don't have anything else to show you or they'd show it you see what I'm saying so they live in a shitty they have a shitty life they have a shitty fucking bank account and they take the free shit and by the way some of the free shit is the best shit I'm not here to say that but what I am here to say is that you shouldn't feel bad or be made to feel bad by internet Yodas who tell you you know peace harmony and fucking rubbing the thing whatever dude yeah all this weird ass shit these people that's all they got dude that's all they got and so you can't let them make you feel bad and if they continue down that path until they're 40 45 years old they ain't gonna they're gonna have less than they have now because they don't understand that when you're youthful that's your opportunity to set the foundation for the rest of your life you are likely to be alive if you were 20 years old to be over 100 years old based on the technology that's happening how the fuck are you gonna pay for that how what kind of life are you gonna live past 40 or 50 you're gonna be in poverty what are you gonna do like people don't even think about this I don't even see people thinking about this like they used to when I grew up dude it was very much understood like if you didn't handle your shit life was gonna be very difficult later in this generation of kids 20 to 35 years old in my opinion bro they're fucking they're in for a rude awakening because they've been indoctrinated by this this cultural philosophy that you don't have to really be effective you don't have to win in fact having too much money is bad and it's a morally bad thing why do you think they tell you that why do you think they tell you having too much money is greedy and materialistic and I tell you why they tell you that they tell you that because they want you to struggle and they want you to be dependent on their systems all right and by sitting there you know thinking that you're the internet Buddha you know you're you're deferring your ability to build something that matters that you're proud of that provides for you and your family um probably forever you're probably never gonna get it so I wouldn't let these people fuck with your mind I wouldn't let these people make you feel like you're missing out you're not missing out if you've been out three or four times and you drank beer it's the same thing every time is it not the same conversation it's the same shit bro you drink some beers you look at some girls you're fucking go home you feel like shit that's what the fuck it's about it doesn't ever change you got to realize it's not a sacrifice dude it's an investment all right and delay gratification is the number one understanding of successful people they understand that if I invest now my time my energy my effort into building a skill set that skill set were produced income when I have that income that opens up other opportunities for me to develop new skills or scale out my life in a bigger way so you got to start somewhere you got to start somewhere where you can bring some money in and then once you get some money coming in you have more decisions and then you can make another decision that is the you can continue to level up as long as you want to go all right so it just depends on where you want to go dude I'm not here to tell you what level you want to play at I know what level I want to play at and it takes a lot more than what most people want to put in but I'm okay with that because I know what I'm trying to do here and most people don't most people put more time and energy and plans into what they're going to do on Friday night or Saturday night or Sunday then they do planning their whole life and career and your friends who are making you feel guilty for not hanging with them when you're working on your skill set and you you're trying to become the best paintless debt removal person in your area so that you could make good money and pay for a life those people are becoming you saying hey man uh can I give 500 books can I get a thousand bucks bro I'm a little short this week and that's what's going to be and you're gonna you know that's a whole nother conversation because you're gonna have to learn to say no um but yeah man you know it's it's hard to see when you're young when you're my age it's very easy to see because a lot of the people who live that life that you call your friends are suffering now they're they're in hard times now they're not kicking ass they're not building their dreams and honestly they're very regretful they didn't put the time in earlier so don't be one of them and and you have to trust me because you can't have the perspective when you're 23 that someone would have in their 40s and the 40s it's very easy to look back and be like oh yeah that guy did this oh yeah that guy did that oh yeah that guy did this and then you could see them where they are now now they look 60 now they're fucking they don't have any money now they're living a shitty life you know you see what I'm saying what to the same bar yeah and you could go find them at the same places dude so that's that's it man you have to be willing to know where you want to go and you have to be willing to make the investment and you have to be willing to trust people like me when they tell you that those people who are trying to dog you out make you feel stupid and drag you along their path they end up becoming nothing and I'm gonna tell you dude you don't want to be that you don't want to be one of those people because when they're in their 40s now they have way less options how are they gonna outside of creating their own business and spending 20 years at 10 years to put some in their 50s or 60s how are they gonna get an opportunity nobody nobody's higher in 45 year old people to come in and fucking you know be a key part of an organization when that person drank for the last 25 years it's not it doesn't happen dude so we got to be real about the way things work and here's the way things work if you put in time when you're young and you put in hard work when you're young life gets easier later if you fuck off when you're young life gets harder later it's one of the other so you get to choose which hard you want do you want it hard now or do you want a hard later do you want to fucking have fun now or do you want to have fun later and you can have a little bit of fun now but you just can't let it affect what you're trying to build and yeah that's it dude it's a very simple choice from the perspective of where I sit but I can understand why you know someone who's 23 can't see that yeah man I love it I love it guys Andy that was three yep all right guys we'll see you tomorrow with CTI don't be a hoe
