Andrew Bailey what's going on brother hey man thanks for having me on yeah it's amazing to have you here appreciate the opportunity appreciate you guys spread in the word yeah yeah well you're doing amazing work and we figure we you're right here in Missouri so be a good stop for you to come in and talk about I think the most important issue that's going on in the world right now because if we lose the free speech here everywhere is over right that's right it's or wellian what's going on right now for sure I think George are well on his most creative day couldn't have contrived the vast censorship enterprise that is permeating big tech today and it's not permeating big tech organically to big tech it's at the demand of the federal government right from the very top levels of the White House across a spectrum of bureaucratic agencies thank you all for covering this and for continuing to cover this this is the most important first amendment suit in this nation's history and that it's exactly with a fifth circuit court of appeals most recently said and let's put that in context for just a minute in 1789 the second president of the United States john Adams and the federalist passed a bill through congress the alien in sedition act designed to imprison anyone that questioned the president's foreign policy that was bad but the fifth circuit says what's going on here is worse there is no enabling legislation the people's elected representatives had had no say in this vast censorship enterprise and everyone who uses big tech has suffered anyone who was deprived of information is now a victim of the censorship campaign from the federal government that's that's crazy where you because i mean i think that's the biggest key right like people didn't understand like it like they think that it's protected you know it's okay for these big tech platforms to do this on their own if it was on their own okay cool that's our argument right that's the art private business but that's not the case like that and and no that is the case but that's not what's happening right right right like it's been it's been it's been it's been discovered that like no like our own federal government and actors inside of our own government are are controlling these different figures figures at all of these platforms exactly the silence the censor and and to you know prop the narrative however they see fit and like it's dangerous yeah and this isn't just the three of us talking about this and imagining this is happening that we have evidence I mean a lawsuit that my predecessor Eric Schmidt launched that we pushed forward and continued you know we've scratched the surface preliminary discovery to go get a preliminary injunction against the federal government to protect our first amendments 20,000 pages of documents numerous depositions we put that evidence on in court on May 26th and when we followed our motion for preliminary injunction and the court believed the evidence and that's why we were able to get that preliminary injunction on the 4th of July and celebration of the nation's independence now the DOJ is incensed by this they want to be able to silence any voice in opposition to the government they filed the appeal like isn't that a red flag right there right like they're committed to the vast censorship enterprise man so then we went up the fifth circuit court of appeals we won there as well at the end of the day we're headed for the highest court in the land United States Supreme Court I think 100 years from now kids in constitutional law class and law school will crack open the con law book and we'll be reading the case Missouri V Biden and think about the fight for freedom we made at this at this space at this time in this state I think we're indifferent I actually agree with that I think what's happening right now in society both in the political realm and the cultural realm is legitimately one of the most pivotal and historic times that this country will face and I know people say that right they say it every election cycle and you know they said that in the 90s they said in the 80s they said in the 70s but I actually think right now is really that way and if we don't bring awareness to what's actually happening because they've done a really good job at keeping everyone sort of ignorant to the level of what's actually happening right they have like you were saying DJ they have convinced people of this of this opinion that you know hey that's a private company they can do whatever they want but they've left out the truth which is that we have three letter agencies and government officials literally calling and sending emails and meeting and threatening yeah and saying hey this person needs to be to platform these people need to be censored this is what needs to happen and that's what's been happening since you know I actually think it's and you you were probably no better than me but I I think this has been going on for a very long time and I think where people really started to raise their eyebrows was during the 2020 situation with COVID and the censorship and I think people started to pay attention like oh this is something this is not right yeah because I remember in 2015 I made a critical post on Facebook about Hillary Clinton as you should yeah and Hillary and I got destroyed by like 10,000 comments in like five minutes yeah and I was like how because at the time I didn't have a following like I have now I was like how does happen and what I found out was that these were actually just all fake accounts that that that organization that social media platform owned and they had put them onto me to silence me and so the censorship is not just the government reaching out there's all kinds of different ways that they're doing it they use bots to prop up narratives that they want they use bots to attack people that they don't want speaking they they do things like this and you hear them say this all the time it's freedom of speech but not freedom of reach okay so they think that they're justified to cut your traffic if they don't agree with what you're saying which is the same as any other form of censorship you know do we do we are we getting that far when we when we are suing these people with with that yeah I you know a couple points number one I don't think what you're saying hyperbole because it's actually happening like you said and it goes beyond just targeting specific posts the example that you gave which I think is really salient is that the and this is what the fifth circuit court of appeals found as well again this is a in a judicial opinion this isn't just Andrew Bailey positing this this has been proven in court the terms of service on these big tech platforms the algorithms were manipulated at the demand of this of the federal government so when you had that attack from the the big tech bonds essentially that's because the algorithm was changed to satisfy federal officials demands in order to discredit a narrative that they disagree with that that is same that's also censorship yeah I would also point out that and I think you guys establish this point at the onset here the harm is ongoing it's not like okay this one post was taken down or there's this period in time and we're past it now that's not true at all yeah because individuals are now self-sensory to avoid the vast censorship enterprise how many people don't want to talk about Donald Trump don't want to talk about election integrity don't want to talk about covid because they're afraid the big tech is going to de-platform de-emphasize or they will be attacked well they do that that's real stuff like people like people are giving DJ and I say oh you're you're censoring no they have things in the first 30 seconds of YouTube where if you say a curse word they automatically turn your page to yellow and you get no traffic on the episode so you guys that criticize us you should ask yourself would you like the message to be out there or would you like it not to be out there because you only get three strikes yeah and then you're off the platform yeah yeah you know if you don't if you don't if you cut within the first seven like it's insane bro or it's the same thing though it's what Andrew is saying if you talk about covid if you talk about election if you talk about any of these things that are controversial Trump right we get clicked into yellow or or or put it in age restriction immediately yes immediately every single time and and by the way whenever they asked us to come on the platform they guaranteed us that would never happen because we were just an audio show for many many years we're a huge huge huge audio show and we've just started on on YouTube and they told us oh we're we're getting away from that we're not moving in that direction anymore you're you're going to be safe on this platform and to be completely honest it's not been that way yeah yeah yeah well I think the if I may I think the censorship enterprise is actually counterproductive people don't trust the government don't trust the information if they think they're only getting one side the whole purpose yeah behind the first amendment rights of free speech is to guarantee a free fair and open marketplace of ideas where those ideas can compete and we can invite dissenting voices and come to the conclusion of what is this is a truthful based on our debate not based on government censorship the government censorship is counterproductive to their ultimate aim now it's harming us in the short term yeah but in the long term it's counterproductive fewer people trust what the government saying fewer people trust what they're hearing and seeing for the very reason that we're we know we're being censored it's like a spiral that they're they're not even aware they're in you know they they it's like okay well they don't trust us so we got to make sure they don't hear this other stuff so we censor this stuff then they don't trust us some more so then they censor more and it just continues to feed the beast right well that's the thing because they don't think the trust is coming back for a long no no no there's gonna be a hard time for for our government to regain the trust of its citizens and the thing and well one I mean there's things that's helping improve that like the work that you're doing like the work that our estimates doing um you know but the thing is it's like you know what happened to us just being able to be in a room have disagreements have open dialogues and say you know if there was a dumb idea that came up okay cool yeah bro that's just a dumb idea like no stop right but but that's not the world we're living in what we're living in an island that's what we talk about all the short and show all the time is these people think that they have the birthrights who have the authority over what we can say what we should think what we should buy who we should support what we should believe you know and they genuinely believe that they have that power over us and and I believe their days are coming I mean I think did we have a revolution to get away from that I mean with a whole point of the United States of America was to end authoritarianism yeah and yet we're slouching towards our authoritarianism here's the problem I've got we used to elevate the rules of the game above the players and the outcomes and yet the left has jettisoned that approach the rule of law doesn't matter anymore the constitution apparently doesn't matter to Joe Biden anymore I mean he's the one that's directing the vast censorship enterprise we know that it's grown so fast they had to develop a new bureaucratic structure to manage it it is time we build a wall of separation between tech and state to protect our first member rights the first brick that wall was laid on July 4th when we got that preliminary injunction we're going to keep fighting to build that walls we move into an election cycle it's it's more important now more more than ever yeah you're a big believer of states rights absolutely so and I am too so is there a solution here to where like you and the guys here in Missouri could create a situation where they have to have an open algorithm here for the users in Missouri yeah is that is that something that like you see happening where it starts to go state by state or is it Texas and Florida have enacted that exact legislation really it's challenged right now yeah I mean there I think the root of the problem I think again senator Eric Schmidt very quickly pointed out the the accurately pointed out through the problem it's section 230 the communication is decency I could spend misinterpreted by the courts and misapplied and that is that is the problem that we've got right now with big tech and and that's why that wall of separation is so important but but yeah Texas and Florida have both enacted state statutes that require some clarity some publication of the algorithms some acknowledgement that the terms of service that if you're going if you're using the product you it's clearly labeled so you know what you're getting you know if you're going to be censored and and why you would be censored now that doesn't completely solve the problem but at least it begins to chip away at it unless and until we can get either amendment to section 230 or a proper judicial interpretation of section 230 and I think that Eric Schmidt's concept is is really good I mean that's good legislation if you can ever get it get it moving I mean you they're going to be those in Congress who on the left who want to support the vast internship enterprise because they think that's the only way they benefit it from it today they're silencing voices in opposition like Eric Schmidt and so only that when you got you know Mark Zuckerberg that's dumping half a billion dollars into these left campaigns why would they vote to overturn 230 yeah you know he's keeping them in lexicon point yeah why would he do that it's a cash cow for the monopoly but also for the politicians to support they understand that if they protect him that he's going to dump money yeah it's just recycling our money right it's insane yeah I do want to point out a couple of things to though before we get into the show Andrew so you're a background right you got you're a veteran born and raised here in Missouri grew up here in Missouri yeah Columbia Missouri yeah so can we talk a little bit about that because I got some good pitches out you man I would pull a couple of these up here man oh there you are yeah that'd be Kuwait in 2005 man was a hot order it was warm now you now you you were in look at that tank battalion right that is super cool dude yeah armored cavalry the last heavy armored cavalry regiment in the United States Army wow actually a third ACR it was originally a mounted rifleman it was formed in Fort Jackson Missouri to fight the the frontier wars and then you know was in the civil war world war when it's one of the oldest units in the army man that's super cool so did you were you on a tank yeah I was trained on tanks at Fort Knox Context what was your job on the tank I was up the tank commander head at tank school you know you're trained to be a tank commander so you have four tanks you do every job on the tank to kind of learn the jobs I mean shooting that 120 millimeter main gun and having going off right at your head and putting a 120 millimeter round down range at a pinpoint actually I mean that's pretty exhilarating yeah got to my unit and I was assigned as a scout platoon leader so I had six Bradley fighting vehicles and 30 soldiers usually two platoons of Iraqis the the Bradley isn't you know designed as an armored personnel carrier it's got a 25 millimeter chain gun holds up to six dismounts in the back I spent equal amount of time in the turret and on the ground you know setting up traffic control points doing cordon and search operations and training I reckon we need to ask that is badass man bro I got an APC I got I got a VF 432 when can I come check this yeah let's go we can be we do some YouTube content that's what's the teachers have a drive yeah we have no idea yeah for real man we should do something I mean man yeah all right cool you see Andrew you can see Andrew Bailey on the on the YouTube as I'm saying so so what made you so what made you take the fight from abroad then bring it back home I care about the freedoms we enjoy in the United States America this country was founded upon some timeless principles of individual liberties and individual responsibilities principles that I see around me here you know that that are part of your culture and it bothers me that those principles are under attack they're under attack in the early 2000s by foreign enemies yeah they are now under attack by domestic enemies and it's time that folks wake up you don't have to agree with everything we're doing you don't have to agree with all of my speech but can't we all get together and agree that free speech is a good thing we used to be able to agree when I say we used to elevate the rules above the players and the outcomes that's what I'm talking about yeah and the left is has jettison that approach one wonders if the New York Times and the the legacy media would be you know as silent as they are now if they were the ones who had suffered censorship it's viewpoint discrimination yeah our our basic freedoms are under attack and we it's going to take courage it's going to take discipline it's going to take take sustained efforts to defend those freedoms against attack this nation was founded that our constitution isn't a lot of ways our national identity other countries were founded by homogenous homogeneously ethnic groups but but the United States America everybody can come here and have an opportunity to grow to work to to achieve and it takes freedom to do that and the constitution is the is the playing field upon which we play the game of democracy but the structure matters so fighting for those individual liberties those individual freedoms fighting to to maintain that structure the the role that states play in our federal democratic republic that's important and we can't overlook it we can't forget about it and it's going to take discipline sustained forward progress I love that man I do to you uh one more question real quick uh what were you like were you teaching him the grill mark he's showing me man okay yeah he's showing me yeah there's an art to that it is there's a lot to get the right angle man yeah you got you've got to get the grill marks going the right way dude I just saw that man that's the burger school we don't like about this picture here it shows that that that our attorney general here Missouri is a man for the details yeah I can appreciate that you got some bicep I can appreciate that you need my protein after work at man I love it man well guys let's get into this show uh before we get to our first headline I want to bring up a trending topic right now um that there's a lot of uh it's it's like a mysterious topic because there's just not a whole lot of info on it but I want to get you guys as initial opinions um so I don't know if you guys have seen this headline but this headline reads Arizona governor mysteriously steps down for one day um have you guys seen this have you guys saw that late last night late last night it came out I didn't know if that was real or not it's it's absolutely real yeah so let's dive into the song Wednesday evening the Arizona treasure announced that she will be serving as acting governor beginning later uh this evening which was Wednesday night um until mid-morning tomorrow Thursday afternoon amid a mysterious disappearance of governor Katie Hops uh in a press release on Twitter formerly uh or x um Arizona treasure uh Kimberly Yee announced her brief tenure as acting government so uh acting governor this is her official statement that was released September 27th um and it reads quote I have been notified that I will be serving as acting governor beginning later this evening until mid-morning tomorrow while I am pleased to step into this role I will refrain from naming directors to the 13 agencies that currently have vacancies and will not call the Arizona legislature into session to confirm them that being said I do hope when the governor returns to Arizona she will promptly name qualified directors to these important state agencies and remove the legal uncertainty that exists for all the regulatory calls actions taken by the agencies I expect to see a swift resolution to this matter so we can get back uh to getting the work done for Arizona taxpayers um it is it is just very very weird right and like even the line of succession in the Arizona's constitution was not followed here like they skipped over two people um Arizona unlike many states they do not have a lieutenant governor um but it's the the power should have went to the secretary of state um if it wouldn't have went there would have went to the attorney general then the the the state treasure it's just weird I don't and like and here's the thing they say what what you know is yeah so so yay the the tre- yee uh she referring to comment um hops did not comment um nobody's talking about it all we have to go off so she back in now I've yet to see anything to confirm that it is it is super weird and I believe it's uh you know like this one they finally arrested for stealing an election listen I mean we're low to be amazing all right we're low to the foil but I don't know man have you seen anything like this I've never seen anything like that and I think it undermines the rule of law like you said the order of succession has prescribed in the Arizona constitution was not followed no but there's also a transparency problem you know right if something that majors gonna happen it's up to the the governor and the other uh officials in state government to explain what's happening and why it's happening and I think that that level of silence on something that important is bad for our democratic republic I agree dude like it's it's a complete violation of what this country's about you know we're supposed to be we're supposed to be uh electing people who are acting in our interests who are sharing the truth with us who are saying hey these are the things we're dealing with this is reality this is what's going on and uh things like this just further dilute the trust that we have in the entire system I think you made a really good point here when you talk about diluting the rule of law because we we consistently see this right like especially with all the Soros nominated prosecutors and supported prosecutors all through the country you know it's almost like it's almost like if you're part of their it's not almost like that has gotten to this point if you're part of their team the rule is not applicable and if you're not on their team the rule is applicable to a harsh extent you get the whole book yeah dude and it's it's really scary man for for what's happening and uh I personally am very grateful to live in Missouri because of this no one benefits from elimination of the rule of law no one look at what happened in the in the city St. Louis when we had a Soros bag prosecutor who was unlawfully refusing to enforce law five hundred five hundred forty two businesses left downtown St. Louis yeah 96% of crimes reported she wouldn't charge think about never gonna say this crimes report that's not crimes committed it's something people stop calling the police and the police stop taking police reports because she won't do anything about it so yeah I mean it and who benefited from that no no one is better off for that it's certainly not any of us yeah when it became a regional I mean if you were intentionally trying to destroy our country and that was your goal you'd be benefiting from that it's what the enemies in a Trojan horse and it's behind the gates exactly bro yeah yeah those days you saw me we'll we'll keep updated on this man I'll see if there's any updates that come out about this Arizona situation I've been seeing some like listen there's been some very very interesting commentary coming out of Arizona I hope they rest her that'd be awesome it'd be cool but just say that like but I mean at the same time I get it like like well they're not gonna say that's what I said me yeah exactly that's what I get it notice all the things she said she wasn't gonna do right yeah this almost seems a little self-aggrandizing to me like don't worry I'm not gonna do any of the things that a governor does like this I know what the governor does but you don't have to worry about me doing those things even though I am the governor right now like weird I put that in the press for yes it was weird super weird and they came out like like seven o'clock eight o'clock last night whoa she stole listen man this is she stole the election while everybody was watching to see if she was gonna steal the election like you oversaw that process yeah she oversaw the process they the voting machines were turned off like it like eleven o'clock in the morning at half these places where people voted like dude she stole the election like we all why we all saw it carry like as 20,000 people at every single rally she's doing this woman didn't even do any rallies is the same play they ran with Biden the same one yet another example about how much she doesn't like transparency and accountability yeah yeah for sure man it's crazy man let's get into this show man we're gonna have some fun guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you can find them link there or if you're watching on YouTube check the description below you can find them linked there as well so with that being said head on number one head on the board reads Missouri AG sues local school board says members knowingly excluded parents from trans bathroom discussions if only we could have them on you know the maybe I'd love to have them all I talk about this I'm saying oh there he is I can confirm this one's true let's dive into this a little bit so material Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is suing members of a local school board for allegedly violating the state's open meetings law by discussing a policy concerning the treatment of transgender students during a closed door meeting rather than at a public one in a lawsuit that was just filed Wednesday against the Winsfield School District Board of Education Bailey alleges members of the board quote knowingly excluded parents from policy discussions about bathrooms and locker room access for transgender students during two private meetings over the summer and that's not all you you've done a little bit some more work very very recently here this head on reads Missouri AG sues health provider for allegedly not giving mental evaluations before sex reassignments Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey you know he's doing some big work that's insane it's insane it's insane yeah so Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a lawsuit against the health care company last week after it provided puberty blockers and cross sex hormones to minors without a mental health assessment as required by state law before sex reassignments were banned on august 28th Missouri's save adolescence from experimentation or the safe act was implemented as law in the state after the law was passed Bailey's office sent a letter to providers across Missouri warning them to stop providing experimental treatment on treatment immediately now here's the thing man I like you I like you a lot you're doing some awesome work so I was like you know I I just like to see what they have to say about somebody who's who's doing the good work right and I don't I found one article okay and I just I don't know if you I'm sure you've seen it I don't know but but this is what they have to say about the man that's bringing the fight to him this hell I read the Missouri's unelected a g has taken aggressive steps to expand power has he gone too far that's what they got to say that's it has he gone too far because he doesn't want parents to be left in the dark about decisions being made about boys being in the bathroom with their young girls or vice versa you're you're so responsible what what is what is wrong with you yeah you know this is so crazy I don't think he's going for enough to thank you yeah I'll never apologize for fighting to protect parental rights to know what's going on in their kids schools and to have a voice in that process or to protect kids from dangerous and experimental drugs and procedures when the providers were not providing adequate mental health services pursuant to the evidence that we have in front of us and so this is a a scourge upon our nation in our state we're fighting to protect kids and you know if I'm the bad guy for that that's fine yeah sometimes it's good to be a bad guy so I don't need mental health things you're saying so you're saying that you know these kids were walking into these healthcare facilities right and without any screening just like I want to I'm a boy I want to be a girl boom down here you go I think it's a lot of the evidence we have is it's even worse than that that these kids come in with gender dysphoria I mean these are young impressionable children still children going through tough times in their lives the hormones are flowing right I mean we all remember that time in our lifeless lot of society has changed it's a lot more intense now than it was so these young young boys and girls come into these clinics and are deprived mental health services deprived psychology psychiatry even a mental health assessment even a talk even a talk like what's going on how about we talk through this yeah and instead are put they're being pushed powerful dangerous drugs and have zero FDA approvals for treatment of gender dysphoria and ultimately referred for irreversible surgery so imagine if you've got a 10 11 12 13 year old daughter who's going through a tough time it says well I think I might want to be a boy is administered these pills gets the surgery and 20 years later wants to have a child themselves and can't their life is that happen every day brother it has happened every day there these are victims of a system we're fighting back against that system yeah this is this is ridiculous this whole this whole transgender children stuff that's been happening for the last four or five years it personally it's disgusting okay like we're removing these the reason these kids are becoming into these doctors offices confused is because they've listened to their teacher talk about it for the last four years about how there's something wrong with them because they're actually just a normal little boy or girl like that's going to confuse a little kid and that the the fact that we have grown adults who we are supposed to trust to teach our children basic skills of how to operate in life and be effective in life and they're instead teaching them their own personal gender ideology opinions or fetishes right it is a finish okay and they're pushing this shit on these kids instead of educating them that's a problem in itself and then we have a problem on top of it where people are so afraid to even stand up and point or say anything because these people have been vicious for the last 10 years in attacking accompanying with the big tech censorship accompanying with the big tech supported attacks and the propping up with these narratives to where people don't even want to say anything about it and now we literally have predators ruining kids lives and it's not 20 years down the road the detransitioner movement is getting massive and a lot of these kids have just been you know they're they're 16 or 15 and now they're 20 and they're realizing holy shit my life is ruined and bro I'm with you dude I can't stand around as a grown adult man and not call it what it is like it's psychological manipulation it is predatory it is lifelong damaging and it's completely wrong and it should be criminal in my opinion well that's my question pop quiz here so so I'm a parent and I don't homeschool my children but if I don't send my kids to school I get charged with what true and see right yeah there's a crime for that if you know I let my kids throw a house party and you know they're 16 17 years old and there's alcohol and law of the cops come I'm gonna get in trouble for that right there there's countless of things that are put into our criminal law our law-abiding citizens must follow when it comes to protecting kids is there a path to hold parents accountable who are sending their kids to these facilities who you know because I'm not paying the parents adjust to sick as anybody else yeah like if you think it's okay to take your own child into one of these facilities and remove the genitalia or give them pills that's gonna make them sterile right like what is there a legal path to hold parents accountable who are you know offering their kids up to these type of treatments yeah I mean I think if you look at chapter two eleven's definition of abuse and neglect that's it but but let me say this too you know the evidence that we have that is in a lot of these clinics what's going on is the parents are confused too and the parents like I don't know because this is a new thing right this generation and so the parents will take their young children to these clinics and put yourself in the parents shoes and all of a sudden you well they're told they're told the the stat right they're set they tell them the stat you know what the stat is 46% of these kids that don't get this treatment commit suicide you want a live center dead dog that's right and and then all of a sudden the parents are sitting there's what they say these are medical experts I don't know what to do yeah and I would also point out that at least some of the evidence we have is that the clinics were specifically targeting the parent most likely to acquiesce to coercion and isolating that parent from the other parent that was objecting in order to obtain quote-unquote consent now that doesn't meet the legal definition of consent that's coercion under duress but yeah I mean this is an enormous problem and and and to your point you know one some of the evidence we have in the the Winsville school board issue it's not only that they unlawfully close the meeting to adopt a transgender bathroom policy but that the policy itself was intended to avoid having to tell parents when their children chose to use a bathroom of the opposite gender so we have layer upon layer of at what point did the education system become okay with like them you know like like we have Biden coming up and and and kareen jompier are coming up and saying those are our children they're not the parents children that's some evil shit dude how do we get in the way yeah we miseries don't co-parent with the government not not while I'm aging yeah well I mean dude it's it's it's really scary how far this is gone and how much this sounds like legitimate you know communism from the 1930s and 40s and 50s you know what I mean yeah I like dude it's so crazy to me because I remember like like the state owns our kids right no it doesn't it comes to like just school choice man it's like you know what happens to basing the the quality of the school off of their reading math levels right like I thought that used to be the baseline standard of like what made a good school and now it's like well damn like you got to check the bathroom science to make sure that this thing is good think about the same think about all the stuff that we all did is kids like think about like you know dude we ran around we wrote our bikes we play baseball we play with the kids in the neighborhood like you're stuck at homeless people bro like we started liking girls and your buddies were like your buddies were like oh you like that girl you're like no I don't yeah right like just normal kid shit now these kids are five years old reading books about sexual acts you know what I'm saying they're getting pressured by mentally ill deranged teachers who are telling them that they are in the wrong body imagine if you're five six seven eight years old right you're you're little and you have a grown adult who you're told to listen to and respect and trust and and all these things okay teachers have and and and like even even a more amount of trust than a normal human being would have because the parents are trusting the teacher to like take care of these kids and then we take we get them in there and they start teaching them all this shit my fucker with them bro this is insane like don't like you say who should be held accountable those teachers should be held accountable nothing teachers should be able to teach this kind of shit in schools to these young kids like that dude they're stealing their childhood these kids are running around their neighborhood talking about how they're trans now or how they're this or they're that or they're gay or they're like bro you're you're five you're supposed to be like playing in the dirt man like the mud but mud pie yeah yeah whatever a celebration of diversity to sexualize children now and to your point you know what we see section I think it's 17015 is the statute that governs how human sexuality is allowed to be taught in schools and there's really specific guardrails of what can and can't be taught and it has a parental opt-in or opt-out procedure and so where we where we see the problem is that schools are getting around that with it that's a transgender bathroom policy or this is a book on on diversity in the library well you're still exposing our children to sexual behaviors and sexual concepts that may not be consistent with the parents values that's why we're going to continue to fight for the parents rights to have a saying that process and understand what's going on in the schools do you like hold you 42 okay so we're close to the same age like do you ever like look around and you're just like what the fuck is going on because that's what I think like that's what I think all the time I'm looking around it's like am I just old my old now and I just don't get it or just like get off the lawn yeah but it's not that because when I was a kid and the old men were like old it wasn't like they were like like we weren't over here like mutilating our genitals or you know giving testosterone to six-year-old girls like yeah like dude I'm embarrassed for our generation for allowing this to happen like what's happening here should be an embarrassment to every single person who is above 30 years old like you guys should be embarrassed this is absurd shit it's evil shit and we will be judged as humans based upon what's happening here this is some of the most evil stuff that's ever happened in the history of humankind we are allowing to range mentally fucked up people to convince kids to sterilize themselves or cut off and mutilate their genitalia that like and it's like some sort of cool noble thing to do yeah I think those doctors need to have their their their the rapture happen today I'd say yeah that's a good thing that we needed that yeah you know those doctors need to have their licenses like bro taken in history that's what's happened yeah in history that's what's happened to these doctors who are doing this stuff they've been held accountable and that in fact multiple times in history who the doctors have done these things have been put to death later so I'm actually hoping that's where we go that's my personal opinion look at the 1940s and 50s at the time the leading medicine and science said that lobotomies were a safe and effective way to treat a mental health disorder yeah we're gonna we're open part of your brain out right and we look back now that that's an abomination I don't know man but I mean I mean I think that he's bad decisions yeah we're gonna look back and everybody needs one we're gonna look back at this period in time and in horror and you know it luckily there's voices like y'all that are standing up and saying this ain't right this hour and it's important to get that message out there to combat the other side that wants to silence it wants to mischaracter rise it that wants to silence the voices in opposition and say that somehow we're heatful for wanting to protect kids yeah all you have to do is spend all you have to do is spend 10 minutes like looking into the detransition movement and listening and hearing and reading what they have to say and you will not any there will be no confusion anymore it's over or if you can actually find some pictures of the actual surgeries of the transgender surgeries most people have never seen those pictures and they're not easy to find yeah why if you go on google and try to find them they're very hard to find why is that because if you saw them you would immediately understand how evil this actually is it's real shit man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what your thoughts are down in the comments hashtag show me state let me know what you guys think before we get to our second headline we got a little special segment here we like to do all the time we are going to cruise the mother freaking comments this is where we pull a comment up from our youtube page and we let's just see what the people have to say so this comment is coming from at haters underscore 10 locks 34 after listening almost 350 episodes I'm slowly getting convinced DJ is secretly racist oh yeah you got me bro that's pretty funny I think he's well you got to for you guys listen to our audio he puts like 10 laughing faces after it like but that's a pretty funny joke it listen why is comedy so funny because it's true I'm not a promise but no guys we appreciate you guys commenting like what do you have to say bro you got to respond I plead the fifth you you okay I got the a g I'm gonna plead the fifth I like the username yeah the user names great I see this I see this person on there quite a bad I don't know if it's like a guy or girl but bro that's pretty funny they're they're they're they are a real ass fan so you know what the funniest part is what secretly so I feel like that's a bad mischaracterization of yeah you're reading wrong bro and she's secret you know I'm saying I hate oh my god that's so funny I promise but yeah guys keep keep logging keep commenting keep keep keep supporting us keep being real ass fans so let's let's get right back into it we got headline number two secretly headline number two reads second Republican debate here's the biggest winner and the biggest loser so we have around two of the GOP debates this is a Fox News article so let's dive into it now I shall advise everybody this is an opinion article but we got some some pretty cool stuff about this so article reads expectations are everything in life and they certainly were key to the outcome of the second Republican debate held at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California the winner of the evening was governor Rhonda Santis for whom expectations were low the audience was reminded of his achievements and why the Florida governor is running second in the GOP primary polls Nikki Haley from whom much was expected failed to live up to her performance in the first debate but held her own the vape Rama Swami was not as annoying as in the first debate but he is yet to show he is ready to be president South Korea who who who's right is just an opinion it's a opinion yes so this is a Liz peak okay cool so nobody yeah so nobody's opinion got it yeah but she says that South Korea line to send to the Tim Scott was more combative as expected but probably did move the needle on his changes as for everybody else with respect of this time for Mike Picks Chris Christie and to sleep yeah to drop out the race you lived a good life yeah that's it yeah time to sit down now here's the interesting thing so I like Daily Mail I'm not sure if you guys are familiar with there we we put them on here all the time it's a great great source they ran their own poll for who they thought won the the second round of the GOP debates it's a very very interesting winner so this headline reads Donald Trump yeah declared winner of second Republican debate in Daily Mail poll even though he stayed away he went even there so this is their poll has Donald Trump at 27% with Vivek at 26 DeSantis at 17 and Haley Pence tied for six goes down and down I don't think that they are doing themselves a service when they are constantly just bringing him up like that's not helping it's not helping Trump yeah well I mean look dude they're trying to compete against Trump sometimes when you're competing you gotta talk about your competition but here's the truth you're only talking about your competition yes Donald Trump is a branding expert he is actual literal branding genius you guys can hate him all you want the guy's super smart he's more strategic than anybody that's out there buy a lot he knows exactly what he's doing by not participating in the debate and he's creating a vacuum for when he does decide to participate in what he's doing so I could see exactly what moves he's making very clear but these people I tried to watch some of the debate and I caught some of it and and Vivek did well I real talk like I like Vivek you got a lot of people who say oh he's a plant or he's this or he's that I've not seen any proof of that I've seen um I've sat he sat right here where Andrew has given me an honest conversation we've stayed in touch he treats me good he seems to you know he maybe he's made some mistakes in his past life I don't know bro I'm not perfect either so I don't judge because I'm not perfect but here's what I'll say um he was the only candidate up there the only single one including Donald Trump who actually went on in public television in front of the whole country and said that transgenderedism in children is a mental disorder that is propagated by the teachers the exact conversation that we just had that we all agree with he's the only one when Donald Trump was asked the same question Donald Trump bought that it Donald Trump uh uh who was it uh Megan Kelly yep asked him and he he was like well uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh bro listen I know you guys down there at Marlago listen to the show he's got to come out and say what Vivek saying yeah cuz like that's the thing people are sick of the crazy shit and I don't think Vivek can win this time I don't think it's possible I think it's 100% Trump but in reality dude there's some talking points that he's missing that would drive everybody over the edge that I think he's still hesitating on because of the pushback that he received during his four years in president yeah well what should take on uh on these candidates here you know we're in the debate when Donald Trump's not on the stage the other candidates just remind us how much they're not Donald Trump that's right and that's why Donald Trump benefits from these other people getting up and debating issues you know at the end of the day he made America great again there is tangible I'm all about productivity and accountability and it is hard to deny you may disagree with what he's saying or how he's saying it or how he behaves but you cannot deny that things were better when Donald Trump was the president of the United States that the economy was better our border was secure uh he was you know fighting violent crime in our cities uh there were so many wins you know the trade deals were cut I mean again the foreign policy you didn't have Russia invading you crane you didn't have China threatening Taiwan you didn't have North Korea saber rattling because he kept everybody in check and it is hard to deny the wins and at the end of the day tangible productivity tangible results tangible wins matter and Donald Trump delivers yeah I agree 100 percent and it is what it is I'm I'm listen I'm gonna tell you right now I'm voting for Donald Trump real talk you guys can be mad at me all you want you can say whatever you want I don't give a shit because of exactly what you just said I'm a result-driven human being all right you guys don't like them you don't like his tweets I don't like have to shitty says either but I'm be real I like the way that my finances look I like the way that could go to dinner without feel like I'm gonna get robbed I like the way that like people were getting along outs like with a few other changes had he been a little bit more aggressive in regulating some of the things that you and Eric Schmidt have been working on and kind of like cleaning up some of this corrupt bureaucracy that's been going on right this country actually could be a free country again and and I think he's the only guy out there that has the motivation to do it with experience to do yeah like I don't think and I don't think like let's just say any of these other guys got elected pick any of them it doesn't matter none of them have the motivation to go in and truly ruffle the feathers that need to be ruffled to clean up what needs to be cleaned up this man has been persecuted this man has been punished this man has been drugged through the mud over and over and over again and by the way he's been exonerated on all of those things like the things where they talk about the Russia collusion that was made up okay we could go down the list down the list down the list now they're using a weaponized DOJ to to persecute this guy because of his political positioning which is literally the behavior of actual dictators and tyrants over the history of humankind and so if we are able to get him in back in I really think honestly it's the only chance we have to even have the United States of America ever be the United States of America again and I think it's going to take more than just him it's going to take someone behind him and someone behind him and so like maybe some of these guys can be behind him I doubt it because it's probably going to be me let's be real all right sorry to bust spoiler dude did you got to see Chris Christie's uh Chris Christie's going to diet bro did you know your mother fuckers got a 70 inch waist dude like like dude how do you walk around like that bro he sees Donald Duck comment he looks like Donald Duck bro he's built like Donald Duck I haven't seen it let's watch this report we need going on our back in our suburbs people are threatened there we needed in our rural areas people feel threatened there and we needed in Washington to see also and Donald Trump should be here to answer for that but he's not and I want to look at that camera right now and tell you Donald I know you're watching you can't help yourself I know you're watching okay and you're not here tonight not because of polls and not because if you're indictments you're not here tonight because you're afraid of being on this stage and defending your record you're ducking these things and let me tell you what's going to happen you keep doing that no one up here is going to call you Donald Trump anymore we're going to call you Donald Duck oh from a guy who knows she practiced that bro no shit and from a look from a guy that legitimately looks like Humpty Dumpty bro okay let me be real I used to be 350 pounds so I have no problem making fun of you if you're big like that same that statement would be taken seriously if that guy was like taking care of himself and was presenting himself and lived a healthy lifestyle and looked a certain way people that comment would have came off a completely different way so you guys that give me shit when I tell you and this is off the topic Andrew but I tell these guys all the time I'm like look your physical fitness matters to people's perception of you and this is a perfect example nobody tastes Chris Christie seriously no matter what he thinks because he looks like fucking Humpty Dumpty this is true fair yeah it's when they're you know I would say to it it's not believable like to say Donald Trump's scared of debating how many times does that guy gone on CNN these aren't yeah friendly environment he crushes it yeah I mean he's winning hearts and minds he and he's reinforcing the message and he's doing it in such a way that you know he's going up against competitive adversary so I also I just don't believe what governor Christie's saying there I think it falls flat I think it looks really contrived yeah dude this guy he's a joke staff fun listen guys you know we're real good at jokes over here it well I mean that's debatable some of us are good at jokes other others of us have a long way to go listen we know a little we know a thing or two all right but I thought that was the most shocking thing Pence also tries to do a joke I don't know if you guys saw his Mike Pence you made a sex joke now who wants to hear 115 euro man make a sex joke well I mean I think we should nobody well let's go do it anyway here's Mike Pence oh man here we go but I want to answer the question as well Dana that you just asked of Burr because my way of full disclosure Chris you mentioned the president's situation I my wife isn't a member of the teachers union but I got to admit I've been sleeping with a teacher for 38 years and full disclosure bro what he doesn't even think it's fun no what what got what people do you have on your team man like you know that's something young you interred being like Mike listen they don't like you all right you're not funny you got to be more funny so I wrote you this joke and Mike says like this I'm not saying that he's like look you want to win polls they say just like they say we're a blue fucking suit in a red tie bro like holy shit so I've been sleeping with a teacher does authenticity still matter absolutely that's why truss popular exactly yeah and and I think these two the juxtaposition of those two against Donald Trump is the perfect evidence that that authenticity does still matter Donald Trump comes out on scene and he doesn't know what they're gonna ask him yeah and it's not prepared scripted lines like that and stuff like that false flat because it is so controlled yeah I think I think that's where Vivek is feeling a gap for these guys yeah like a lot of the young people who are who are not for Donald Trump who are maybe voted for Biden this last time they really like Vivek I hear this all the time a lot of my friends I have a really good friend Hayden who owns a pretty big company and he's more of a libertarian you know he's not he's and he loves Vivek because and we were talking about it and and it's all because of the authenticity dude like yeah he see Vivek does a couple of things he's done have been rehearsed but after that when he realized I think that he messed that up he's been pretty authentic you know I think authenticity is what matters the most we want real yeah I mean I think the public wants real I think we inherently want to know that something's real and this kind of polished scripted politician yeah it's like you want to be a politician more than you want to be a leader yeah that's problem yeah yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments hashtag round two let us know what you guys think let's get on to our third and final headline headline number three and number three reads first Biden impeachment inquiry hearings commences Thursday morning it's getting started oh they're done with yeah now I think I think so I think so that it appears there's still a little bit of fight in there but uh but let's do this check this out so let's just get through the facts of what's going on right now um so fast facts this is from Fox News house Republicans will hold the first impeachment inquiry uh hearing into president Biden on Thursday at 10 a.m. Eastern time uh according to the office of House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer out of Kentucky the hearing quote will examine the value of an impeachment inquiry and will present all evidence to date uncovered by the committee in its investigation into the Biden family finances the witnesses who will testify at the hearing include Bruce debinski a forensic accountant with decades of experience and financial investigations and consulting and who the committee says it's testified in over 80 trials including trials that involved financial fraud former assistant attorney general can I just say the US Department Justice Tax Division those people know how to party today if you want a good time that's where you go the DOJ tax division oh I guarantee it oh my gosh farmer assistant attorney general ilean o'connor who served in the United States Department of Justice Tax Division uh and law professor Jonathan Turley who testified in the Clinton and Trump impeachments will also testify president Biden has denied any involvement in his son Hunters business dealings the White House has dismissed today's hearing as a uh as in quote evidence free probe and a political stunt um now these reports keep coming out apparently the the total's up to now like 50 million dollars has been uncovered um and trace back uh one of the wires that were sent from China was actually like directly addressed to Biden's home residents right um all these things are are still coming out um but here's what I think I found hilarious let's check here with CNN um we know how those guys are doing over there um of course they're rolling out their fact checks um fact check house Republicans first hearing and Biden impeachment inquiry um so they listed out they only have three of them so far but let's just dive through their fact checks maybe see if we can pull any uh BS out of it um so the first one is uh Republicans have presented no evidence Biden himself received foreign money and the fact check they're saying is uh the 20 million dollar figure is roughly accurate for Joe Biden's family and associates according to the bank records subpoenaed by the committee but the phrase the Biden's and their associates obscures the fact uh that there is no public evidence to date that President Joe Biden himself received any of this money uh and it's worth noting that the majority of the money went to the associates uh quote unquote uh Hunter Biden's business partners not even Biden's family itself so yeah there's money there so I still I still the least amount yeah yeah one conspiracy like participating in conspiracies no longer illegal I guess yeah and also you know I I mean is it legal to just take money for policy decisions when you're elected official the United States government absolutely not yeah one like the one you were used to do something to those people like back in the days like you know like lock them up stick their head and like this little hole and this thing like comes down and you know like remember that thing I remember that yeah yeah it was I'm talking about how French engineering is like you get something yeah start with the ghee yeah yeah like it's good stand for good times yeah that's what it stands for yeah I've got a question though yeah so we the Biden crime family is the basis for the impeachment hmm why not willful knowing continuous constitutional violations why not take the evidence from Missouri V Biden because Congress is already held hearings on the weaponization of the federal government why is that not also a basis for impeachment hmm the Biden crime family is bad enough but we've got a president who took an oath to protect and defend the constitution and is willfully knowingly and dedicated to continuous violations yeah is that not also an impeachable offense I mean I isn't I mean so like I so I mean why is that though like is there no communication between the states and federal no we like what's the senator Schmitt has testified in in Congress about the Missouri V Biden that held multiple hearings I've testified in Congress about it you know representative Jordan has certainly uncovered so we can show you the the ripple in the pond effect like I can show you the emails where the the White House is targeting censorship on big tech is demanding censorship on big tech but what Congressman Jordan can show you is big text response internally that they knew that they were violating since the the first of them they knew that they were censoring it the demand of the federal government I mean again the the evidence is now clear it's beyond a reasonable doubt there's there can be no longer be any confusion that's why you seen the legacy media walk away from this idea that there wasn't really coercion and collusion because we can not only show you the direct communication but then the subsequent internal communications at big tech I don't know I think it's worth a conversation I think that there's ample evidence that President Biden himself was personally involved we can show you the email where his director of digital communication says that the demand for censorship is coming from the top and he emphasizes very top levels of the White House who is that yeah the big guy yeah or it could be Obama yeah well I think it is both of them yeah what at one point you know I talk about this all the time on the show you know I talk about the border being left open I talk about our strategic oil reserves being depleted I talk about our gas projects are natural energy products being canceled I talk about the crime in the big cities I talk about you know them shipping all of our military equipment are leaving it in Afghanistan and then shipping the rest to Ukraine leaving us over here with a with a problem where we don't have enough equipment I talk about like the endless printing of money and I talk about this money that is coming from these countries that would benefit from those actions and what point is this considered legitimate treason towards this country yeah I mean clearly President Biden has no interest in American sovereignty he's using the government the government is absent were needed and present were unwanted so he has no time to secure the southern border from an all out invasion at this point that's making Missouri communities less safe ventinal human trafficking cartels have taken over he's seated control the southern border of the cartels and yet at Chinese spy balloon flies over the state of Missouri let's across country pause over US military installations shoots it down after it's finished its mission and yet he's going to go after your gas stoves the car you drive the fossil fuels you need to heat your home and transport your kids to and from school in a time where Americans are hurting because of Bidenomics and this the inflation and so yeah I mean it is deplorable he and go back to Donald Trump and accountability productivity immigration laws largely unchanged from the 1980s the same statutes are on the books because they can't get anything through Congress president Trump used the tools at his disposal to reduce border crossings by more than 90 percent and yet Biden has abandoned those policies and border crossings are through the roof so yeah it's an invasion it is I mean again one man has done more damage to this country in less than four years than a foreign attack likely could have in that same amount of time so so at what point who determines if it's treason who determines I give it the people who determines that you know that man and office here's where I would really like to understand you know and this is this this may be an uncomfortable topic to bring up but you know our constitution says that the citizens of this country have a duty to step in when the government is behaving exactly as these people are behaving so you know at what point in time are we supposed to cross that line and actually handle what's going on you know what I'm saying like like are are we are we waiting for to see what they're going to do this next election or like I think I feel like it's somebody because I feel people I'm not the only one that feels this way bro like there's there's millions of people out there they're like what when is something going to happen and in my opinion I think they're I think that there is an intentional agitation to call for why I think they're trying to instigate violence the way I'm describing it so that they can crush the people who are organizing it or imprison the people that are organizing it as the leaders and I think the January 6th shit that's been going on is all about scaring people from actually organizing to actually create any sort of change on their own and you know when our founding fathers who were very smart they wrote this into our constitution and and so like for a reason yeah and we're here and that's what I'm saying like so like I mean like is it like what are we waiting on is it somebody to designate like hey okay yeah like we have enemies within our our country right and like you know we all take a oath I think is a citizen like that oath isn't like you've signed up for not even knowing you've signed up for but we have to protect this country from all enemies for I don't believe they're going to I don't I don't think there's any there I don't think there's any chance at all that they allow Donald Trump to win that election yeah I don't think they totally agree yeah yeah and I think the day after that there's going to be a massive gut check in this country dude there there's so many of us feel like we've been left behind by a system that ignores our voices silence our voices prosecutes our heroes weaponizes the government against us the constitution exists to protect us from the government and the government exists to protect our rights but what we see is the Biden administration weaponizing the government against those he disagrees with like you like me like president Trump and again going back to the impeachment talk I mean I think that if you've got a president that committed to violating the right to free speech that evidence needs to be put forth in as part of the impeachment inquiry it's just another another accusation that needs to be analyzed by the House of Representatives yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean in back to the CNN fact check two man like they brought up like they're saying that Jim Jordan falsely claims Hunter Biden said he was unqualified for Bereez Mabor it's not true that he said that but it is true that he's not you know I'm saying like all like like bro they play this game of it's a game of controlling the language that's how the communist manifesto bro like if you read any of Karl Marx or you read Salo Linsky or you read Mao's book you read any of these things they talk about the controlling of the language and and the manipulation of the language like when these people say our democracy is at stake or our democracy is going to fail they use democracy interchangeably with communism okay so like when these people these progressive left people say our democracy democracy threatened they they're really mean what they mean is is communism from our definition right they're planning yeah it means they're losing it's never been about truth it's always been about power yeah yeah subscribe you mean that I mean guys let us know what you think man I think this here's another thing I'm gonna ask you to I feel like this stuff gets so delayed like I feel like like the the amount of time that it takes to do these things like you know we are in 2023 is there no way to I don't want to say fast track because you want to make sure you're thorough I get all of that right but like why does it like why hasn't taken us to 2023 to get to this point for this you know for the small amount of transparency that we do have like are we not able to speed that process up at all man you know I in my mind it's a double-edged sword I mean the separation of powers inherent in the structure of our government is essential to prevent authoritarianism the downside to that is change comes slowly and the problem we've got again is that we've got our opponents who have jettisoned the rule of law they no longer elevate the rules of the game above the players and the outcomes and quite frankly policy rule statute can't keep pace with the nadir of depravity from the left right transgender's and let's take that as an example most people didn't even know that was going on that children were being raised towards sterilization or that the parents were being lied to and coerced and that the detransitioners were suffering as a result it took time to realize that this abomination was even occurring and then we got to get a law passed him who would have thought if you asked my grandmother do we need to pass a law to make sure doctors aren't sterilizing kids you say well were you talking we need a law for that yeah I mean again the depravity of the left is so far gone that it is tough for us to keep pace from up from a the legal perspective the policy perspective yeah do we really think it's the left though like if we're being honest like it's I feel like there's a lot of people who are legitimately like just they they lean more towards the left that are still common sense people who have been completely abandoned by this like radical progressivism that really is communism that's what we're dealing with and and I feel like a lot of though like I feel like a lot of you got because we have a lot of these guys listening to show now you guys are going to have to like say like okay well I don't believe in what these people believe anymore there's this is not what I'm about like I'm not I'm not for it's not what they believe it isn't like it's really trained yeah and to sit there and still ride that train when you understand where it's going we're entering a phase now where like you're complicit in some very evil shit like it's time to like wake up dude and say hey we're not for this that's real man guys joining on this conversation let us know what you guys think on this final headline join us in the comments hashtag down goes corn pop let us know what you guys think so that was our third and final headline we have our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is where we bring a headline up we talk about it typically it might be like a Florida dude or something you know doing something crazy I like the Florida guys I like the Florida guys yeah I mean Florida man they're just Florida being good yeah so we bring this article up and then we'll all vote on it whether or not it gets that so our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads someone tried to bring an emotional support alligator into the Philly's game definitely from Florida the gator has a social media following oh big one too yeah big one yeah so you've heard of bark at the park days celebrating cats also are a thing across the leaves of arm at the park celebrate day celebrating cats are also a thing across major league baseball but there isn't a gator day and a very Florida man twist there it is there we know there it is an emotional support alligator reportedly was denied entrance to citizens bank park on Wednesday night where the playoff bound Philly's were set to take on the Pittsburgh pirates while a gator is a working emotional support alligator this is real okay he's owned by Jones town resident Joey Haney who can be seen holding Wally's leash in the third photo above the reptile has a sizable following on Instagram and TikTok Haney earlier told the inquire that Wally helps him battle depression and that he likes to give hugs he said last year when Wally was spotted splashing around at love park last summer the the gator has never bitten anyone yet animals are no stranger to sports team sports arena think rally cat we at rally squirrel here in St. Louis yeah already number of cameos by squirrels birds and other creatures but at least for today looks like Wally will have to cheer on the fields from home now I went to MLB's website and their policy on service animals and I found this it says guide dog service animals or service animals in training are welcome all other animals are prohibited now I don't know how the letter of the law is written yeah do we have a suit here you know okay so this is taking me back to first year law school we had a case where it was like which animals qualify as service animals there's there's if I'm remembering correctly there is some ambiguity in the law and so yeah I mean service gator I mean I mean look big too man I have I have concerns if you've got an alligator with a with two social media accounts any sizeable social media following it doesn't feel like that as a service animal so much as an attention seeking device and so I kind of question you know our wheat or is this a stunt to try to and look at it does give hugs that's like he's smiling yeah I am I don't get it looks like he's a good guy he looks he looks swell I mean make a great pair of boots or yeah that's that's a no for me I'm not doing that no no gator no bro gators are dinosaurs bro like this is for millions of years ago this is left over from like the age where we were the food I'm not trying to be the food I eat a gator bro I'll eat a gator for yeah I've had one too whereas so here's what I love about this story though this is the kind of thing that gets the left all knotted up because they want to be for the guy bringing the service animal yeah for sure but they're also against animal abuse yes and so like that if you ask somebody on the left they're like their steams coming to their ears right now because they don't know what to think about this and like they're so conflicted on this so it actually is a fun story in that regard look at him giving all the hugs man he really likes give some hugs man he does yeah I'll tell you why dude I highly and this is like by a score of a hundred to zero like animals better than people oh no that's not even closer yeah no that no that like animals are pure except for cats bro those things are funny dude I get invited to go hunting all the time and do all this stuff by the some of the biggest hunters that do all this bro it's just not for me man this is not for me like and like we're gonna go for people I'm in bro I am in but I am not I just can't do it they didn't do anything sure you know like it's just not it's just not you know that billboard we've we've talked about you know that have you seen the billboard where it's like I think it was like a pita billboard it was like you know they showed all these animals right it's like you know guinea pig all the way up to like where's the line where do you draw the line I'm like yeah well about there we draw the line we draw the line at keese cat that's what I'm saying that's right like I'll fuck it out you to cat bro hey seasoning what kind of seasoning well for cat dude I don't I mean I don't know like I think at the little little little Chinese restaurant by my house I think they use like like teriyaki or some shit so you're basically saying well I'll tell you this I'm not put I'm not I'm not putting any seasoning on mine yeah that's right that's right that's real man so what are we giving this gator while in a gator what we got I think it just thumbs up or I like I like walligator but you know I'm disappointed I didn't see him have a
