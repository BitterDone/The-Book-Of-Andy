So we fought at the battle San Juan Hill and came home and we can go down that rabbit hole if you want, but he was one of my heroes when I was a kid and so I would I would interview him and talk with him about his his experiences in Cuba He is his The salient piece or one of the salient pieces of his experience was what happened when he came home so the Can I tell the story? Yeah, yeah, so Cuban the Spanish-American War in Cuba lasted about three months. So it was a very short low-intensity war by modern-day standards, you know, not a lot of American casualties But they brought back tens of thousands of troops who are all sick. So they all had mosquito You know mosquito-borne illnesses, dysentery, malaria, you know, whatever and they they put up a few tents up at the top of of Long Island the very tip Montauk point and they put up some tents and they they started bringing these six soldiers home and mustered them out right there and and had them in that camp Till they got better and it was just a big muddy field rose of tents not a not a hygienic place And it was it became a national scandal a national disgrace and even the president went up and and surveyed it There was a woman Mrs. Bean Mrs. Jack Bean who took her she lived in New York City. She was wealthy And again, this is 1898 so she's got a butler and a carriage and she went up there and she took my great grandfather and Four or five or six other men and brought them to her home and Nersed them back to health in her house with her family there and It was a you know for me that was a really powerful narrative story. I don't even quite sure what's the right word to use here But he and then she I think he was there for about six weeks I mean this was not you know three days and then you're gone. This was he was very very sick He believes she saved his life and she gave him money to get home to Michigan Where he was from and for the rest of his life he talked about her and that effort that civilian effort to save his life So when I was a Young man I wanted to after college. I wanted to help veterans I wanted to I was never never served never not not a warrior never put on a uniform But I wanted to help those who did so I went got a PhD in clinical psychology and then I went my first last year of training And my very first job was Charleston VA Charleston South Carolina VA So I spent 15 years working with veterans there and that that was what I wanted to do I wanted to I wanted to be part of the solution and Part of my perspective today is we do have a VA and the VA does some things very well And it's obviously very important and and and meaningful to many veterans But we have a very disconnected and in different society So our our soldiers our warriors our veterans Aren't really connected very well or maybe I'll say it the other way around our civilian societies not very well connected to the men who Who who protect and serve everybody and and I'm gonna I'm gonna lump and include I'm gonna include in the the men and women who who I try to serve in honor or not just soldiers And veterans private defense contractors who have been quite a bit of work with but also first responders So law enforcement EMT firefighters and so on So that's what got you inspired to do the work that you're doing. Yep. Yep, so When you when you started on your journey, did you know that that you were gonna do what you're doing now? No How to start? So I did 15 years at the VA hot the VA system and this is after you went to school After my to PhD, right, okay. Yeah, so I here. I am fresh PhD clinical psychology and I met the VA in Charleston, South Carolina 1991 and I left in 2006 and I love the patients I worked with I really appreciated and enjoyed and most of the colleagues I had in the mental health service and throughout you know all throughout all of the hospital But there are also some massive problems systemic problems I know that I would say are more than anything policy not about the individuals people there But policy that was being set by our government and the leadership of the VA and By the end of by the end of those by by 2005 I was very I was demoralized because what I was seeing was we as the mental health service and much of the VA were we were doing at least as much harm as we were doing good in a lot of ways and And some of my research was was oriented in gear depoining some of this out and It was not well received it was not welcomed by the VA So we'd have old conversation about the VA and why why I believe it is failed You know and not yet another generation of of our soldiers and and warriors So you were putting out some criticism about how in a place of we need to improve Yeah, and they didn't want to hear it. They didn't want to hear it And in fact, I kind of got spanked for so I was a I was a clinical psychologist the therapist for full-time Seven for about seven years and then I started getting federal research grants from NIH Nations to do to health to study Veterans and other populations with PTSD and anxiety and depression depressive disorders and But also included in that there were some studies we did some studies related to How the system served individuals served veterans and some of the incentives to be sick I mean essentially the VA has has a disability policy People don't know this but the VA spends more money on disability payments than they do on providing health care It's not really even that close. Yeah, it's a pretty significant difference and so they're just saying hey your messed up We're just gonna pay you that's right. That's right. And you don't even I mean, and you don't even have to get treatment Yeah, to be able to receive that that money many veterans do pursue treatment and do get do receive treatment But they're not getting better. At least not as far as the VA can show The I was just reading a paper yesterday that even even up to current day present day The number of veterans with PTSD disability who get better and then come off PTSD come off that disability is A fraction of 1% so 99.99% of veterans don't get better from from VA PTSD care That's crazy. What the hell, you know, what are we doing if what are we doing? I mean, this is tragic Yeah, why are we why do we spend 13 billion dollars a year on mental health care That that cannot show any results. I mean, would you Run you you guys are no you're your fucking business Yeah, so you find once one of your business important business units isn't producing any Movement of the needle at all and you're gonna keep putting money into it probably not well that probably cut I would just Suspect that probably comes just like every other branch of the government the money's getting funneled into people's pockets Yes, yes, and so here we have big government and and we've gone right now down the rabbit hole the VA which is cool There you know you could and you could look at many different policies No accountability for employees or little accountability for employees little accountability for management little accountability for the veterans and and so There's a book called wounding warriors Wonding with an I and G as in it's still ongoing and the subtitle is how Policy makes veterans sicker and poor and it's it's a really good book published in 2020 by a by a former West pointer who lost a leg in Fallujah combat and He in a in a Wall Street Journal reporter Analyze the VA's policies, but they put it into real human terms I mean, it's a page turn. It sounds boring and dry But it's a page chart or to read about how veterans lives are being affected and in the book There is a chapter the interviewed me and there's a chapter on some of my experiences in 2005 Where we had done a study And this sounds so like almost obvious that that I'm almost embarrassed to kind of describe this but we we did a we just took a 100 consecutive men coming into our clinic saying they were Vietnam veterans and We evaluated them and you know, we did what we did at the whole thing and then About a year later we did the and I mean that wasn't part of the study that was that was just clinical care But we we did a freedom of information act requests We wrote directly to the St. Louis military personnel records and we got their DD214s You know the the one page document that lists everything of their military career and what we and then we compared it We compared that document to what they told us they had done during their career metals deployments Training you know all of that kind of stuff and there was a massive discrepancy Between what people reported and what was actually true With you know, we I think we had five or six guys who claimed they were Navy seals or green berets They weren't there were not they were not We also published a series of studies showing you know, just very gross Malingering and over reporting of symptoms in order to get the disability So because I know it's incentivized. It's incentivized exactly their rational actors, you know You put a great big you know pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and people are gonna go Yeah, they're gonna figure it out. They're gonna figure it out. They're gonna go get it and why shouldn't they and many of these people Many of these people needed help I'm not our I'm not I'm not saying we shouldn't give help, but why put it in the box of Of PTSD disability First of all PTSD is a very treatable disorder civilians get better from it And I've treated many civilians who got wildly better very quickly Many my many of my patients at the VA got better But then they say please don't document that because I don't want to lose my disability I understand that So what happened at some point in 2005 we submitted this this paper You guys heard of the book stolen valor or the concept stolen valor yeah, yeah, so The stolen valor act was inspired by and facilitated by a named jug berkett who wrote a book Called titled stolen valor in the late 90s jug was a Vietnam veteran and He he noticed that just everywhere he looked in the 1980s and 1990s there were people using the Vietnam veteran status as a way of getting getting things in society elected to sheriff You know advertising For a business and you know just you know you name it people who are appearing in in episodes of 60 minutes and such And he would do this freedom of information act Request get the records and then document that they were liars. They weren't even veterans Most of them that's crazy and he wrote a book about this and it's a lot more common than people think it's very common Yes, and and it is it is a it is the illegal now to do that and it's illegal to wear medals you didn't earn Um order to represent medals you didn't earn, but so jug berkett and I became friends and he he helped me do the study I worked directly with jug on this study in 2000 I guess we did the study in 2004 and we published it in 05 We had initially submitted the paper to the American Journal of Psychiatry one of the top two psychiatric journals in America And it got rejected right away with a very short review usually you get extensive reviews that you know in the peer review processes Is the quality control? But what they said was They didn't have any criticisms the study they just said this can't be true Because if it if it is this upends everything the VA is doing so therefore it can't be true. We're not gonna publish it A few days later I get a phone call from one of my mentors one of the senior people in the in the field of PTSD who's who was one of the directors of of a one of them the there's a network of PTSD centers nationally and he was the director of one of them for the VA and he called me and he said You can't publish this paper. It's too explosive if you publish it It risks, you know congress might cut our funding it might ill harm veterans if you do this And so he and you know in a we have a discussion, but he eventually said if you if you do this It's gonna you know it'll your your careers a scientist will be over you know severely damaged and I basically thanked him and said but I'm not publish it anyway and we did we submitted to the British Journal of Psychiatry and it got published like they took it and they were like wow we want this and not only did they publish it but they had one of the top British Military historian psychiatrist kind of a mixture both history and psychiatry wrote a really You know eloquent Commentary companion piece to it That guy now by the way is now and has been knighted since knighted so it's sir Simon Wesley with that And a few months after it was published I get a phone call one night about nine o'clock saying hey Guess what you're being investigated by the VA I know it's nine o'clock at night, but we just sent you the questions you need to respond to and we'll see us tomorrow morning at seven a.m In the director of the VA's Office and so I show up there and there was a We had a conference call with people at central office in DC and they it was a witch hunt They were looking, you know, did I have IRB approval? Did I have R&D approval? Did I have this document signed? You know it was basically they're trying to find a hole anywhere any technicality show me the man I'll find the crime exactly right just like we're seeing left and right today, but this was 2005 So not that I was surprised by it. I'm gonna say because I had started to see more and more of this kind of stuff coming my way But guess what Every eye had been dotted every tea had been crossed and they had nothing And they said okay, we're done and that was it that was got dropped But then I'm getting phone calls and requests for interviews bbc the economist Wall Street Journal LA Times New York Times Washington Post and they're all calling me for interviews because people want to talk about this And so with the VA did write write right early on was I basically had a full time not a full time But there was a PR person who became my handler Everything I every request had to go through her and not only that, but she had to She had to be present at the interviews and she had the ability to interrupt she had the right To interrupt the interview So a question if but if a question got asked she had the right to immediately interrupt and say nope He can't answer that question and if I did answer a question she had the right to Say strike that he's not supposed to he's not allowed to answer those questions so It was it was that was I only that's crazy like communism it It exactly It was censorship now I do understand that organizations when you work for an organization You can't just go out and say whatever you want and you know Especially if it's false or something like that But I was speaking truth and I had data it empirical data that supported everything I was saying and And after that I was just I was just fucking done with the VA So I left the neck, you know a few months later and I was like well, you know, I wanted to help veterans. Oh well so but the VA is not really wanting My thoughts my ideas so I left the VA at that point. I moved to the University of Hawaii Thinking I was done working with veterans and I was for about for about eight years until kind of this next chapter of my life developed and what happened in the next chapter So I was I had a I had a really Kind of a weird Weird job situation. I had a full-time job in Hawaii But I got recruited away to Baylor College of Medicine in Houston to be director of a research Director of research programs at the Meninger Clinic which is a very famous old psychiatric hospital Used to be in Topeca, Kansas and had now just a couple years prior had moved to and and affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine So I was a tenured professor at at at at BCM And I would direct the research at this hospital and and so I moved to Houston work there for six months Some shit happened The economy changed the the research budget as a result changed No harm no foul. I wasn't you know Really good terms with everybody but I decided to go back to my former job at the University of Hawaii And when I did that the You know my immediate the chief of staff at the hospital said well in the chair of the department So we'd like for you to continue your work here if you're willing to do this for for a few months four or five months until we find your replacement So I said okay, and we we agreed I would come back for one week every month commute to keep the work going and then of course, you know working doing some stuff remotely and It was nice because it fit with my research interests, you know that that matter for my my academic career and my work at University of Hawaii But they never found my replacement. So I did that job for a decade And Houston became essentially my second home. They never you know, I just it worked out so well. We just kept it going So I every month for ten year about ten years. I was commuting so I had and then from Hawaii to Texas. Yeah from Hawaii To use the cheese that's crazy, dude man. Did I wish I had a private jet back there? Yeah Delta Southwest were yeah Delta Delta took care of me. Yeah and so So I was making friends and I am a so-called PTSD expert and that was a neat a little bit of the nature of what we were doing And we were doing brain scans. We we one of our philanthropy philanthropists the McNair Foundation that that owned and on the Houston Texans NFL team funded a lot of our work most of our work Much of our work And so one of the things that they had bought for us was essentially an all you can scan coupon So we had a deal at the Baylor College of Medicine Neuroimaging Center We were sending every single patient that came into the hospital over there to be scanned as part of clinical But also mostly research. I mean this was all done under an IRB ospices And so I started meeting people just in the community not affiliated with with with the hospital or the medical school And a lot of them you know they were I'm just making friends with people and some of them were One of them was a former seal recently Separated and then there was another guy who was was army sf and then one of the tier units on the army side And so I kind of developed a small group of just you know friends, but part of their Part of our early conversations were hey, you're you know stuff about veterans. You know stuff about mental health So let's have some conversations And I began that just began the con and so it was literally just informal conversations over beer coffee or pizza And essentially the conversations pretty much all went the same way Doc Chris What's wrong with me? I don't know what's wrong with me, but something is different something's off I look in the mirror and I don't look the same Even my face physically doesn't look the same I don't have any energy. I don't have much motivation It's not I don't think I'm depressed, but I'm not sleeping. I'm irritable my girlfriend Doesn't want me around very much drinking too much Oh, what's wrong? Okay, I got this I'm a PTSD expert. I know how to help you So I thought and Turns out I didn't I didn't know what I was doing And they didn't have PTSD not in the prototypical Sense of PTSD. There was not the fear There was not the fear reactivity. There was not the you know helicopter fly over overhead or fireworks No problem. I didn't that didn't spark you know that didn't get the pulse up at all So and there was no avoidance. That's the other that's one of the other key features of PTSD is avoiding those things Avoiding the things that will be reminders of military experiences and war and training experiences So now what the hell's going on Just through trial and error we started trying things. Let's get some testing time. Let's draw some blood Let's let's get your brain scanned. So I got brain scans on a small like five five of my friends Through this through this uh, you know through this deal we had um and Started getting sleep studies and it turned out. Whoa. I've all these things. I was not expecting to see So all of my friends now in this circle are from special operations. They're not all seals They're not all army. They're from from different groups, but they all have the same pattern low testosterone Clear brain injury They're the ventricles in their brain on an MRI F MRI were We're atrophy to the point that they look like 80-year-old men They're 35 38 low testosterone in a brain. So they're libido and their testosterone and their brains are all all look like 80-year-old men These guys are studs. So what the hell's going on here? um on the sleep studies it they they start showing up as with sleep apnea obstructive sleep apnea Which again, I think of that as a condition that middle aged overweight men have So what the fuck? This is not PTSD. This isn't even mental health. This is physiological problems in multiple systems in the body and You know as we figured these things out and and and for those of you who may be for the listeners and those of you who aren't familiar if a man who has low testosterone The effect of that is going to look a lot like depression that man is going to have He's going to be irritable. He's going to have insomnia. He's going to lose muscle mass He's not going to feel motivated. He's going to be apathetic He's going to be down and he's just not going to know you know what's going on You treat that testosterone and all that stuff pretty much goes away And there's many ways to treat test-tostosterone so I'm not I'm not saying everybody needs testosterone replacement therapy But you address that you address the sleep apnea um You start doing some of the things that are good for the brain and and wow game changer so 2014 2015 pretty soon. I have I have not just my friends, but I have their friends and then their friends So it was literally just a word of mouth snowball if if we So we go fast forward today I've probably consulted with about 500 operators over the last decade Some just two or three four conversations, but some in dozens of conversations spread over many years um of of that whole group of people I would say uh large per se a large portion of them are have been private defense contractors who I I do get paid for that work. I do that that work is through a through law firm Um, it's trying to help them with defense-based act claims, but same pattern Same exact pattern of injuries. So that that's what my book. So that's what operator syndrome is what operator syndrome is So it's tbi Well, before I even say that we wrote a paper in 2020 Medical paper we published it and I think it was the international journal of psychiatry and medicine and it was me and a good a good team of people, but it was a very simple paper Anybody who wants to read it can find it on the internet just type in operator syndrome that paper is out there You can download it easily for free And it's just descriptive. So I literally we literally wrote the paper for guys To read and for their spouses to read so that they could start to at least begin to get a sense of Shit, man. This stuff is not abnormal. This is this is this is normal for people who have had 10 15 20 25 years in special operations So what is operator syndrome? TBI Chronic pain sleep apnea insomnia low testosterone as well as other hormonal Disregulation estrogen levels often spike way up in fact There's a VA surgeon who who reached out to me and said that after the papers published reached out said that was amazing paper Because it helped her understand why she's doing so many breast reduction surgeries In men coming out of ranger battalions or air force PJ They're gonna come ask you kind of command. Yeah, yeah, and and and I mean think about that how I'm how humiliating that that must be yeah to be it You know to be a badass mother fucker and then you're grossing then your ruby's yeah man boobs Um, and then of course so operator syndrome all those things which are very physiological cellular molecular injuries At that level and then of course you do have depression and anxiety and anger a lot of anger addiction Some have PTSD most have some of the other symptoms of PTSD and and then what does that do that just kind of goes out and in a ripple effect it affects your family your marriage your sexual functioning your emotional intimacy connection with other people and they transition out of the military Um, and then you got all the existential issues The survivors guilt the horror of killing the thrill and enjoyment of killing which a lot of guys have And are feel pretty pretty guilty about having because you can't talk about that typically with most people Yeah, can I actually this cuz I love this I love this shit. I love it um Did you see a difference you know looking at like the the the afghan withdrawal right was there a difference in In Function or how these people you know how these veterans, you know after witnessing that did it was there a change in and mental status is like with the guys that you were seeing coming in Well guys you see now. Yes, so that was about 2021 right? Right DJ. Thank you for asking that question. Uh, I don't get at ask that question often enough and I'm so I'm really happy to speak to that so I'll say a few words about what kind of what I saw about that In the two months prior to our withdrawal. I did I think four evaluations via zoom via distance communication with Afghani interpreters who were in Kabul So it was like the slow motion disaster that I could see coming because I was talking to these guys who are in Kabul And they're they're saying to me help us get us out of here We are going to about to be overrun in a few weeks by the Taliban and they're going to come and slaughter us in our families To those guys to those those interpreters took me around and you know, remember this is a zoom video and they introduced me to all their family their wives their children Just trying to show how you know desperate and and they are I don't know what happened to them It it uh, it you know, it kind of rekindled some of my childhood experiences one of my favorite babysitters in And as that when I was about 11 was a Vietnamese man studying in the US and in 19 Uh, I don't remember what year it was, but he went home Um as the country was falling to the north North Vietnamese he went home to be with his wife and his um and his uh children He was working on a dissertation at Mizzou, you know, Rissim Missouri right right down the road And uh, he went home um, man, it's probably mid 30s went home and was picked up and murdered You know executed by the north Vietnamese government far I don't know what happened to to my guys that were that that I was evaluating um, but you could see it coming They knew what was happening. They knew what was coming. They were terrified. They were absolutely terrified and they were um They they knew what are apparently our state department and and leadership in the US Claimed they didn't know and we were saying oh everything will be fine the Afghan government will hold Um, the Taliban they're not they're not gonna they're not gonna get get in here. Yeah, it took like a day Uh, yeah, uh, let no not even a day. Yeah, they were there before we got out So then I was talking, you know months later. I did I was a I I did I have evaluated and talked with extensively two different guys who were contractors who were there at the airfield uh During that literally during that time So one they described the firefights that were going on around the perimeter of the of the airfield the day before Very intense firefights with with Taliban and other insurgents one of them was near Abbey gate when it when it blew up and killed those 13 Marines plus dozens maybe hundreds of of Afghanis that were packed around that and then they were A little bit later uh, they were sitting Or they were guarding, you know, one into the airfield when the Taliban approached. They were in an active gunfight They were they were troops in contact moment when the bodies start flying out of the falling out of the sky Remember those afkis that were grabbing wheels of freaking crazy those bodies were were landing on their position Like you're you're shooting it, you know, you're engaged with the enemy and boom thud splat The state department guys didn't get to sit at sit at the ramp ceremony. They didn't get to participate in the ramp ceremony for those Marines they were Prevented pretty forcibly from from being at that ramp ceremony So how did this affect people? Well one thing is I mean This story I think just kind of telling the story a little bit here gives you some sense of what was happening on the ground the um I know a lot of guys For months afterwards that were sleeping two three hours a night We're last because they were on the phones. They were there was a very organized effort from service members who were in the US and other places Around the world trying to get their buddies their friends the interpreters the afghanian interpreters who who they had Known and trusted and worked worked with and closely and viewed his brothers. They were trying to get them in their families out And many have gotten out but many you know many many didn't And we still don't know how many I still don't know how many Americans are or were Never got out of afghan well. They're certainly not gonna tell us. Yeah. No. No. No. They're not They uh, you know, they've treated those Families of those 13 victims like total shit. Yeah. Yeah Yeah, they have So it's demoralization. Yeah, that's right. I mean did that affect hormones did that affect mental mental health and pain Yeah, probably negatively But but that demoralization was just crushing yeah and Now you have we have a We have a generation of soldiers who are going why do we do this why what were these last 20 years about and And it's not just that their sacrifice Was some of them feel that their sacrifice was wasted but also asking the question of Of why do we lose so many of our brothers both both Americans and in our allied forces and our local you know local Forces so that demoralization is something that I don't think most Americans see or really haven't aware of Because our our society is just so removed from the realities of our military and the men and women that serve Considering what's going on. I mean it makes sense you would demoralize the military first or the veterans first You know when you when you create a situation Let's just be real like January 6 where they say it's something that it really isn't Um, and then you do the Afghanistan which we're all right after that That's that's going to be very demoralizing to any of the veterans that serve absolutely. Yeah, yeah for sure So dude you have a just a cap this on operator syndrome and then we'll get back we're getting into the show But you have a very interesting uh The way you look at mental health is much different than What most of what we see on the internet as mental health um And you and I have talked about this before you know the therapy industry For the most part industries a good word. Yeah, it's it's not really geared towards getting people better It's geared towards propagating customers and keeping them in therapy for as long as possible Um, and at some levels it's predatory You know and I'm not trying to discourage anybody from that that's not what I'm saying But I'm saying that you know, there's good and there's bad But you're you're opinion on this Or what you know operator syndrome is about and I agree with you is that It's actually in verse of what most people think most people think that mental health and correct me if I'm saying this wrong But most people believe it is mental But you've discovered that it's actually a physiological thing and a lot of people That's my perspective. Yeah, I think we put the mental illness up front and everything else is just kind of background We need to to to reverse the foreground and the background Um, something that that you know that I feel terrible about when I really kind of reflect back on my work at the VA was we never checked hormones We never tested hormones Ever That doesn't mean that they weren't getting the hormones checked if that would if something was picked up But that seems like it should be a pretty obvious process. It should be required I would say it should be step one or get you that that should be one of the very first things that we do and when we don't And that's that's on the field that's on the mental health field Because I like I said I've worked now in three different psychiatry departments psychiatry departments are pretty large, you know, you might we've had probably 120 150 faculty And they're multidisciplinary so psychiatrist psychologists social workers nurses geneticists neuroimagers Neuropsychologists you know and more Not once that I ever do I did I ever have an endocrinologist in any department. I was a part of hmm not once That's not to say that there isn't a so you know there there isn't research on hormones and psychiatric functioning But it's that's just that's just not at all do you think that do you think the opinion of Of that kind of like I feel like Society has changed their viewpoint on things like hormone replacement therapy or just monitoring hormones over the last 20 years, you know, I can remember um, you know when I was younger how villainized testosterone was right and I am of the opinion that it's villainized intentionally to keep men uh in a you know Weeks state quite honestly um, I think it's done for control Well, let me sorry to interrupt but let me just say the American psychological association put out guidelines about Five or six years ago guidelines for how therapists should treat men and boys and those guidelines are an abomination Those guidelines encourage therapists essentially to feminize men Yeah, well that makes it goes along with what I'm saying toxic masculinity is now considered to be part of the mental health problem Okay, so we got it. We got to somehow shake that out of them. Yeah while they're growing manboots while they're you while they're growing man Yeah, and that's boys and that's not just yeah, it's not just men So a big problem with this mental health dude is it men aren't allowed to be men That's a real that's real You know, we've let we've dealt with culture so long the last 20 years that has gone along with that where it's been villainized And now you have women get punched in the face on the streets in New York every single day Saying where's the man? Well fuck bro, you didn't want any man. You say you didn't need men socially castrated. Yeah And now chemically yeah, right, right. I want to actually this because I think this is a cool cool thing I said I love the the psychological psychological that's where DJ went to school for Psychology psychology and yeah, you know, and so there's a saying psychology, you know genetics loads the gun environment pulls the trigger Right was there have you noticed any like you know, are there are there any like genetic predispositions that you that you guys have noticed With operator syndrome of like okay, these are some common denominators have has that been a a focus pointed on I have not studied This I don't think anybody specifically has studied it related to special operations Not that I know of but we certainly do know that genetics plays a large role in anxiety and and depression and bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and addictions So there's no question there is a significant role for genetics and we're starting to kind of identify some of even some of the genetic variants that Specific genetic genetic variants that you know that are you know, you're probably be more successful to getting PTSD Yeah, right and we've long known that if you have a parent with depression you're more likely to have depression Well, so you learn that behavior too, right? That's the environment. Well, it's nature. That's the nature So the nature is the genetics and the the nurture is is what you've learned. What society has taught you and and everything else that's that's been around you What's your opinion on victim culture? Oh Well, I mean that That's the heart that's part of the heart of the matter right now is We are not telling people to be resilient. We're telling people You're oh you poor person you oh you need help. We're gonna give you everything Oh, you you're you're downtrodden you're you're struggling We can't say to somebody work harder That's not allowed anymore in our culture in so many ways Um if you are if you're or push through or get a little tougher man like this is how it is yeah cowboy up right Yeah, and I'm for you know we look before we get into that Yeah, there's situations where people are truly fucked up. Oh, absolutely. That's not what we're saying absolutely Yeah, but you know, it's become a it's become a badge of honor, dude There's real trauma like going to war and and having to do you know Things that that are necessary and then you know, there's losing your stuffed animal when you were fucking through you You're still crying about it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know like there's a difference. Yeah. Yeah, there's a difference I mean what do we what message are we sending our veterans when we when we say to a veteran Congratulations you have PTSD your fucked for life and you're gonna get disability. Yeah, I present disability Yeah, the psychiatric invalid forever and deal with this shit and be miserable exactly Because they're not getting better. Yeah, I mean what's the what's the most important thing Well for a for a person to feel alive and and healthy and vigorous It is having a sense of meaning and purpose. Yeah Just to call somebody and invalid and tell them they're they're done Being productive members of society forever. We've just stripped them of I mean, we strip them of their their manhood in a sense if they're man We've taken away their mission in purpose and their structure their daily structure. So yeah, yeah It's that's tragic. Yeah, huh? Wonder why we have so many veteran suicides right no shit Or you know the biggest mental health crisis of all time Well, we're enabling it because it's a massive fucking business It's a almost four hundred billion dollar industry Right like where do those customers come from right? You know, do you actually think it's healthy to be on your cell phone Nine hours a day you're a human being bro. You're supposed to go out and do shit build shit create shit Have a sense of purpose be thankful for where you are exercise some personal development some discipline these things These things create yeah, yeah, be take charge of your life Yeah, dude, and we got all these people who are told by these therapists. Oh, you're broken. Oh man. That sucks Well here read these fucking passages and Affirmations and maybe you'll feel better like dude Yeah, yeah, it's a terrible system. Yeah, uh real quick. I wanted to bring this up because uh right right before we get into our headlines You're a metal guy Oh, yeah, have you metal? Have you seen his list? Yeah, no Okay, so we were I have a list here. I didn't know that either. That's awesome. You know that no Oh, yeah, listen, I just know you guys were stalking me That's okay, so so this is uh dr. Chris Freeze fit top 50. I have his top 10 here of the greatest metal bands. Okay, I just want to see if there's a All right, let's hear it any agreement in the room. So you got black Sabbath is at number one. No question. I mean, that's easy That's just like I don't even think I've heard of some of these iron maiden You don't know iron maiden bro. I'm not a big metal guy. I like dancing. I fuck with bands. It's sick. Yes Yeah, that's an age thing. Yeah, that's all it is. Yeah, yeah, that's probably true. Yeah iron maiden kind of hit the scene in 1980 Yes, okay, yeah, deep purple Early 70s slayer. I think I obviously I know Metallica Metallica top five five. Okay, is that accurate? Dude, this is a this is look there are ages of metal Chris is a little bit older than me and I'm older than you right so like all these rankings are gonna be slightly different Okay, yeah, right and and actually this is kind of an old list. Okay, I you know and I've moved these I you know like every few months I oh, I listen to a motorhead now. Let's get oh, I gotta move them up So you know, this is just this was a snapshot. Yeah, that that looks about right I might push slayer up a little bit. Okay, slayer is good. I am no now. I am slayer blow every time I hear a slayer out of my go Oh my god, they're even better than I was what's your favorite slayer song Song I couldn't I couldn't say that but rain and blood rain blood. I guess the album in the song Yeah, yeah, you got the uh Some albums here. Yeah, yeah, you put with the greatest albums are two of these are top 10. Yeah Master of puppets. That's for sure top 10 album. Yeah for sure although P cells is For me it's tough. They're like neck and neck. Yeah, and they came out in 1986 so the both same year and of course Megadath was Dave Mustaine's band after he got ejected from Metallica. Yeah, right so That's a cool story if people that don't know metal. Yeah, go kind of read the original Metallica and the day must And Megadath story. Yeah, yeah, he got it. He got it. Mustaine got rejected or got ejected from Metallica right before they recorded their first album which kill them all. Yeah, kill them all and he wrote co-wrote several of the songs three or four of the songs on that album. Yeah, kill them all is underrated dude. I agree. Yeah, yeah, that's War Horseman man. That's a great song. That's the first seeking destroy. Yeah, that's the first Italian album I listened to it was their first me too. It was just like Though it sounds like it's recording in a garage. I feel like you this is just like the best dog like you walking His office playing fucking bro we talk every week great. We talk every week for this now. That's awesome. I think if you I think This sounds funny, but I listened to heavy metal when I'm trying to to to work deeply So when I'm writing when I'm trying to think That's this is what I go to yeah, I mean sometimes jazz sometimes sometimes classical. Yeah, but but if I really want to get in the zone and be productive I'm that means I'm putting on the same way Yeah, you know why though. I was just gonna say this about Chris Because at his core he runs hot As calm as he is and that's the same for me when I get into that When I get into that zone, that's what I'm the most creative dude And I start feeling like a bad mother fucker. I'm like I can do I can do anything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a cool feeling That's sweet man. Well, let's do a good list man. I respect it. It's solid. Yeah, like even I don't know most of them But I know a few of them on there. Well DJ what so I mean set the list aside What it what you know in the metal sphere? What would you like is there other bands you would put up there? DJ just started learning metal Yeah, I just got into it when he started working on it four years ago. Yeah, I just got into it He's been you're like a meant a metal mentor. Yeah, sort of. Yeah, he he started like this We were working out together and I started playing this shit. He's like, what's that? What's that? What's that? This is awesome. Yeah, so like we were listening to a lot of rage against the machine Metallica Danzig guns and roses stuff that's on my workout playlist Five finger death points. Yeah, five finger All right. Yeah, so it's just all stuff like that and you know, he was I don't know what were you into before that like R&B stuff and yeah, you know Just DJ plays the piano and shakes. He's really really good. Really. That's awesome. Yeah And just just to say this I love pretty much all you know, I like all music. All the other two Yeah, R&B is one of my favorites classic rock blues. I had a blues radio show when I was in college. Oh, that's cool Blues is cool, man. Oh, it's great.

I can do a little country. Yeah, just simple man. Yeah, let it skin Yeah, I got a little bit of anything man. Yeah, it's good. It's good shit. I had no idea we were we had the black drive show We had the black rifle coffee guys on the show and uh and they were we were hanging out at the house afterwards and uh Fucking Matt picked up the guitar starts playing. Mm-hmm. And I'm saying I was JT JT was it was however I think one of them picked up the guitar and they started playing and And I'm like watching them play. I'm like this is pretty good. This motherfucker starts singing and I'm like I had no idea and I'm sitting there like what's going on? Yeah, I'm a good good example of inclusion Yeah, you know that diversity Good example of it. Yeah Well guys, let's get into let's do some cruising. We got we got some stuff to cover um Guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures headlines videos articles links go to Andy for seller.com You guys can find all of that stuff there. So with that being said, let's get into our first headline um Now you know, we record CTIs that come out Tuesdays and Fridays right and so like there's gonna be some gaps and coverage But I wanted it to kind of readdress this um, you know of this big uh national event we just had this earlier in the week um The the ship crashed into the bridge, right? It's been a big story Baltimore ship black box data recorder taken by investigators as search for missing continues So they recovered the black boxes. There's there's multiple of them um on this uh this massive cargo ship named Dolly um, and they're still doing recovery efforts trying to pull through pull through all of this Here's the video of the ship crash and this is um This has been circulated as the like the actual video, right? I know there was some there's some fake ones Yeah, there are some fake ones um, but this is this is the official This was from the streamtime live Baltimore cameras Supposedly allegedly unedited um, here's the clip. What time of what time of data? This was one thirty one thirty one Yeah, one thirty uh eastern time. Yep. Yep There's no audio on this, but you see it going um It's passing out then it loses power Oh And it's just a slow motion disaster. So it's going about nine miles an hour And I'm not sure how much how much weight that thing But this video come from so this is coming from streamtime live Baltimore because I saw Okay, the power comes back powers back on Then it loses power again So they don't know why it lost power yet is that I think they know why I don't think they're saying why okay Thick smoke comes out of the uh, the lost their loses power again This is when they're saying oh fuck Well, they did send out a mayday may days were sent out and the They recovered like to see a truck just went across the bridge Yeah, so so one thing to notice here so during this whole time while they're going um And they were able to confirm this with the black boxes that were recovered then there's some interesting things with the black box But um so the bridge was under construction so you can see lights like what here Those pillar lights and now where's the vehicle? So those are construction worker vehicles the bridge was getting worked on Yeah, one of the lanes going They were on the bridge were on there and so this entire time that it's losing communication um They already started the notification process which is why there wasn't as many or more people on the bridge that went under Because they were able to start closing down but they were stopping traffic correct from going out um Yeah, so these are all construction vehicles here and so during this process um, you know Everybody's just running top of the side trying to get away from from uh each shot, but then it makes contact with the bridge These are the last little few vehicles that go by Now they're saying stop stop stop they're holding the traffic The The workers see it coming Mm-hmm. So they were scrambling, but We're enabled some of them. Then it makes contact bridge goes down. Oh my god. Wow. That was instant too Yeah Now Do we know who filmed those this video like yeah, so that video was coming from off of off the dock um And one of the periods is just like a static camera. That's okay Now so that's so that's the clip of that right Now the issue is is that you know there there there was a report that was done that apparently allegedly the the black box recorder Stopped recording for there's about a two-minute gap What Right and then don't take my word for here's a clip Has 0124 and 59 seconds numerous audible alarms were recorded on the ship's audio bridge audio About the same time VDR sensor data ceased recording However, the VDR audio continue to record using the redundant power source At around 0126 and two seconds The VDR resumed recording sensor data and during this time the restoring commands and rudder orders recorded on the audio At around 0126 and 39 seconds the ship's pilot made a general VHF radio call for tugs and the vicinity to assist About this time the pilot association dispassure Phone the MDTA duty officer regarding the blackout Around 0127 Yeah, so there's two-minute gap there From when it lost power so there's two sensors you got the audio recording that's happening There's recording people's voices and the conversations both in the bridge room Um, and then in the rear of the ship as well But then there's a sensor recorder that records all of the mechanical inputs into the ship the steering the power That went dark for two minutes or two-minute gap and then it cuts right back on right when they collide into the bridge Would that be because the power went out? Well, so here's the thing the audio recorder was on the power back up The sensor is just put should have been on the power back up per the ntsb regulations So now there's been you know, there's been some talks but let's let's talk about the impact Um, but I will say this I want to say this too So I got when these things happen um, I usually get some feedback from people That were there. Yeah, and I did get a message from a guy who was a longshoreman who worked on that boat And he had pictures to prove it like he was in the water Right after it happened take him up He set me a couple of the pictures where they were up on the boat from another boat Like literally right after it happened. Yeah, so I know it was legitimate And he said he told me that that ship on the way into port had a power failure And he said they worked on it in port and immediately after it left port it had another power failure So he told me that this was an accident And that it wasn't a legit power failure because I put a pull up in my story that said what do you guys think an accident Are intentional because a lot of people were saying it was intentional and that's how he DM me so There's that too. Oh, yeah, I mean like but the effects of it is real right yeah, they're they're saying that this is probably going to take anywhere from five to 15 years To rebuild that bridge at the cost of over half a billion dollars To the tune of like six hundred million dollars to repair And of course we're paying for it taxpayers are paying for it Biden has already made that promise In how much are we is it going to cost to have that that artery interrupted? Yeah, that's the real that's the real damage because you know this this port Um, it's it's the ninth I'm sorry. It's the fourth largest port on the east coast ninth largest in the country um It's a massive input for the country A lot of our vehicles go through there Um to the tune when we find the numbers Oh, I got in here It was something like almost every car that we ordered from Europe goes into Baltimore. Yeah, it's like almost like 900 Thousand or so a year Um, I'll come into that that port Um, and uh, with their projecting I mean we saw like this Ryan Peterson. He reported on this Um, he says this will surely cause even more cargo to shift to the west coast likely leading to congestion and delays As we saw in covid even a 10% or 20% increase in volumes Can lead to a compound feedback loop of congestion and delays most ocean freight contracts are signed between march and may each year So many companies have the flexibility right now to sign contracts the ship that containers to the west coast to avoid likely congestion and delays on the east coast um Now See you in and put this article out because there has been a lot of a lot of theories about this I wasn't this was this intentional was this an actual cyber attack right Which are things that you know, I don't feel like you can easily just throw off the table Right um, but you obviously want to make sure that you actually have some evidence or some type something that can back up your Uh, your your your your theory right um, but see and then immediately puts this article out Calling out all of the typical people for being conspiracy theories um and how dangerous they are Call of them wilds can so wild conspiracy theories about what supposedly had quote really happened We're running rampant at uh, we're running rampant online now lara Logan What do you think fucking happens when you lie to people over and over and over yeah exactly exactly Exactly um, you know what's and and it's their same it's their same war cry All the claims they're all baseless entirely baseless Right makes me think it wasn't attack which which freaks the you know It does that doesn't help calm the people we don't trust you. No, we don't trust shit We're at a point where everything the mainstream media says We've found the opposite to be true over the last four or five years And so when they come out and say this shit. It's like oh well shit. I guess it was that yeah, you know Well, I was just gonna add I mean the rush to say these claims are entirely baseless Yeah, and then the next set and it says officials are investigating the crash. Yeah, how do you know? How do you know it's bet their baseless if the I mean I guess they're saying there's no evidence for these at the I mean that could be one interpretation There's also no evidence for you to say that it's not yeah, that's right exactly, you know And so like I mean I think we end again when you look at the the history of the mess Even on intelligence like we don't trust you You know like there is so little trust right now they have completely that that expectation of trust or like You know the like the reasonable expectation that we can trust These these news outlets or trust are even our intelligence 80 agencies to some degree. It's gone Yeah, it's gone and so when we come out, you know two hours after this massive incident happens and immediately can jump on and say Oh, there was nothing wrong here Nobody's really taking your word for yeah, you know like we need a little bit more You know, and like and that's the beauty of you know the you know the the social world that we're in right now is that you know People are able to put in different inputs and one thing that I've seen consistently From ex members of intelligence agencies the the consensus was that if If this wasn't an intentional attack That's exactly how it would have been done though does that make sense right like like if you were to try to do an intentional attack on america's infrastructure That would have been the the the standard Play to do right it was it was executed perfectly if that was Is how they're is it's kind of the consensus there but but here's the interrested so why everything what why everybody was you know kind of looking over there There's always something else happening in the background right Um, and so I was able to find the story and I thought this was very very interesting um literally, you know that same morning rush time of news headlines And things rolling in while everybody's focusing on the bridge Um, the united nations comes out and they declared that There is actual actually a genocide going on with the conflict in the middle east Um, and they put in a ceasefire in which the united states um basically sat out from Voting on which passed the ceasefire 14 to zero with the us Obstaining from the vote um, and so that's a big deal going on right now a lot of people not really talking about it But the United Nations did you now they recognize it as an official genocide as an official I saw the clip you know, and so it's like Nobody's really talking about that right and then y'all Fortunately, it's the only genocide in the world right now right for now Sudan and Darfur And we always talk about any of that none of that and none of that those don't count. That's it's just well or or That we have more slaves in and slavery now than have ever existed in the history of the world ever and know and people want to talk about what happened 400 Fucking years ago The none of us did We wouldn't even here for but it's happening right now. Yeah, I'm a fucking colonizer Fuck that we that caused slavery because I'm white. Yeah, my fucker. I didn't are family even come here to like 19 fucking 20 right Whatever yeah Yeah, so that's an interesting thing that y'all who's pissed about that he actually The Israel delegation they had a trip that was planned here. There's supposed to be going to DC I believe in like a month or so they completely pulled out of that And now there may be some communication issues between our diplomats and the diplomats of Israel So and I saw a thing Shortly after Israel pulled out there was a new story about Israel pulled out and the US diplomats are confused and they don't understand What's going on right like hello Yeah, I mean Listen, I mean, it's a tough ball to play because I mean one minute you want to be on the side and one minute You know diplomatically they're on the side but in the next minute they're abstaining from votes They can have easily voted an abstained vote is a yes vote. The tensions are definitely rising between the US and Israel Well, because Biden and Harus have both come out because dude the left has you know completely turned on them They both come out and said hey, we've warned them. We've told them Biden got caught on a hot mic saying I told BB he better stop this shit like You see that and so like now and and Netanyahu's like yeah, you know what fuck you. So now we have a situation where Israel's telling the US to fuck off and the United Nations has figured has decided it's a genocide It's going to get interesting be real interesting because I don't see Israel back and off at all. No No, they have no intentions to But yeah, so I mean the like said the search operations store going on believe they're still looking for six people There's six six missing citizens right now and could I could I just I'm looking at my phone because this story's been up all day on CNN the lead story on the mobile CNN says headline Deadly bridge collapse reveals a truth about immigration. Oh, that's interesting. So now we've changed the story It's not about the bridge. It's not about the ship It's about all of the people who remain missing and I'm reading here all of the people who remain missing were immigrants outsiders who had come to the US from Central America for a better life Fair enough, but this is a truth Well, that's because you're led in 20 million of them and you say it's 12 but Yeah, and then also this that's true Chris. You know what this really was This was white supremacy That's that's the that's the this was a domestic terrorist attack. That's the implication. Yeah And the win because of the climate change. We did it. That's the implication white people fucking white people fucking white people white people ruining everything Came came make fucking chicken right doesn't make sense man fucking racist white people turn down the bridge to get six immigrants Dude These people think we're fucking idiots. Yeah, they do well, there are a bunch of idiots. They probably believe that to be fair Yeah, nobody listen you guys The term influence operation Are do you think Americans understand that term no do you think Americans understand the concept of an influence operation? I don't think they understand that or propaganda yeah, or they don't understand that Obama wrote out of the law that propaganda was illegal when he was in office Right, and we're being propagated At 100% propaganda since fucking COVID started full steam. Yeah, full steam ahead They're they're just the goal here is to make people lose faith in the government So it will destroy their national pride. They don't want the American men to have anything to fight for they don't want American men to have anything to stand for and if they can demoralize them enough by lying and you know Propaganda and doing things like the withdrawal from Afghanistan or letting in 20 million illegals You know putting people like Daniel Penny in prison while all these fucking criminals that are punching people in the face and killing people Are getting out the next day. This is the demoralization of the American Man for the intention to avoid some sort of revolution. Yeah, come on Combined that with you know, you talk about it with the opposite. I actually think it's just fueling that Yeah, you know, but like low testosterone. That's not just you know, that's not unique to the everybody should be on testosterone Right like a fucking I am drip. Yeah 2000 milligrams a week drink it. Yeah, you know, I'm sorry. It's lunch and dinner And don't take my advice. I'm not I'm joking. I'm joking, but that's a real crisis maybe half that though You know a lot of the men this not just you know military veterans like I mean well, right I mean we have a crisis of men and boys on our 100% what are young men doing right now and I'm more I know we've got more headlines cutting off their dicks. Well Some of that yeah, but but I think the bigger issues. They're not in the workforce They're not in college colleges are 40% male 60% females undergraduates. That'd be good enough reason to go Absolutely That's enough for Yeah, one and a half one and a half Bro, you came to handle one you shut up over there But that's the thing where are they they're in there. I mean, you know, this is an oh you know This is obviously a stereotype and a big generalization, but they're in their parents basement. Yeah, I'm playing video games Right playing video Give me another hot pocket Then they're on the internet being like you fucking DJ I get they don't even wait for the shit to cool down they eat it when it's hot You know what I can see it what was that Is that how you know how pockets show down bro I let mine cool down bro when I do you know there's a good medium temperature Yeah, no, if you follow directions it has to like rest for like two minutes before you release to at least two minutes. Yeah Anyway, yeah, let's get on that you mentioned the influencer campaign. Yeah, let's talk about that influence operation Influence operation. What's that just sorry? Well, influence operation is when the KGB decides we're gonna undermine American society and it could be CCP too, right? Yeah, I'm just as an example. Just for example KGB says you know what it's 1960 and America's our greatest enemy Let's undermine their entire society How do we do that? Well, let's let's go let's put some things into the educational system Let's let's fund green piece to To stir up concerns about the climate change. So they got they got I mean in the 60s we had books about how over population was gonna Destroy the world now we're on the verge of a population collapse that's coming So quite the opposite of what was predicted by so many people in the 1960s But the idea of the influence operation is let's destroy America from the inside by By creating a you know havoc You already said it. It's like let's convince Americans that their country is evil Let's convince Americans that that one group is better than another group and they should hate each other and fight each other And what what what better ways to do that than to create Then to undermine the idea of what we were doing during the civil rights era Right work that's already been done right. Yeah, we did it and hey and we so I think it started in the universities. I think they got into the universities that they and then essentially Influence operation you start changing the minds of some influential people who go out and they become act activists no longer scientists but activists who are who are spreading What is essentially a virus you know When they say in mind virus. I mean a mind virus. Yeah exactly. It's ideology, man I've watched it happen in my life, dude Like when I when I graduate high school which was 97 There you know Yeah I'm 44 years old bro. That's the math That's why I'm fucking silver silverish and good looking you still look like a little boy Yeah, so It is what it is man Get the fuck up put your fucking hat back on improvement So so dude I watch this right like when I went through school There was no such thing as a participation trophy There we we pledge allegiance all the way through high school at the beginning of school every single day Competition was taught it was encouraged achievements were encouraged they were celebrated Decegregation programs were in the schools all the schools Uh, so that it taught you know inner city culture black culture and white culture to to go together And everybody was getting along for the most part boy. I was okay. Yeah, huh? Boolean I said bring about yeah, yeah bro like real talk um there was it was okay to have physical fist fights Now you got suspended for like a day and that was it and then you shook hands and it was over there's now now they've Right after I graduated they changed a lot of shit they they stopped desegg okay, and what's the product? What's the product of stopping desegregation after 20 years? You have a black community and a white community do not know how to relate They don't know all these white kids that you see on the internet post and BLM shit They don't they're doing that because they think that's what they should do right if they actually understood They wouldn't it wouldn't be the way that they that's what makes them feel guilty It's the white guilt all that shit comes from the end of desegregation And then they removed competition and then they started villainizing capitalism and achievement and the rich man and all this shit And now we have a generation of complete fucking pussies with they don't know how to operate in the real world For the most part now there are some really good ones. There's the kids whose parents taught him right it But they're the minority now and um And those parents are vilified for being too hard and too hard irresponsible because now watching their child in a moment. Yeah, it's crazy. Let a let a kid cut their penis off And then they're praised as a model smile. That's gonna go down in history No different. This has already happened in history bro. This happened Fucking Jill Biden said it yesterday. Mm-hmm. It's she's like Berlin was the capital of progressive is no shit That's what the fuck the problem was that's what caused that all the shit Fucking people were doing all this crazy shit. They were doing all they were cutting off their dicks They were doing fucking there was mother daughter prostitution kid prostitution and pedophilia was normal No shit that wasn't the height. That's not a good thing Jill. No like we don't want that here and uh She's this has already happened and so this era where parents are allowing themselves to uh Bend the need to this ideology and letting their kids make irreversible like dude Those parents like 20 years from now are gonna be like completely First of all, they're gonna be complete failures as parents, but second of all they're gonna they're gonna be vilified and looked at like what the fuck were you doing? Your kid cut off his genitalia you allowed him to do that you see what I'm saying The good news is is that now it's been banned in like 30 states a lot of states like I mean dude, it's it's crazy shit and this has already happened and it's destroying lives Uh, it's not just the parents. It's organized teachers. Yeah, these teachers. It's organized medicine dude I think these people to do this shit like legit the the medical doctors that do these things should go to jail That's my personal that's my personal opinion Then they should go to jail. They know that's bearable. They're fucking doing it for money, bro They're not doing it for the kids if you listen to these detransitioners They they will tell them like bro. They put me on hormones after one fucking zoom call my surgery was scheduled for two weeks after that Yeah Not like well not that's that's a little exaggeration, but yeah, dude I mean they're putting them on puberty blockers and hormones and shit off one consultation like And they're shaming parents. Yeah, don't play along too some of them are legally removing the kids from home Yeah, yeah, you lose your child. This is crazy shit dude And he's gonna go down to history as one of the more one of the biggest moral Corruptions and tragedies that's ever happened in human history. Yeah, Sacramento, California I think just declared itself a sanctuary city for children who want to transition Didn't so haven't they learned not to call themselves sanctuaries For other reasons no Apparently they want that yeah, they want that it's insane insane That's insane.

Let us know what you guys think with that being said Uh, let's get over to our third and final headline headline number three headline number three reads Sam Bankman free sentence to 25 years in prison For illustrating FTX fraud This just came out today is a big topic. I don't know if you call this a win, but let's dive into it Uh, SPF was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison for his role in defrauding users of the collapse cryptocurrency exchange FTX In a federal courtroom and lower man had in U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan called the defense argument misleading Logically flawed and speculative He said Bankman freed had obstructed justice and tampered with witnesses and mounting his defense something Kaplan said he weighed Weight in in his sentencing decision Bankman freed wearing a beige gel house jumpsuit struck an apologetic tone saying he had made a series of selfish decisions while leaving FTX and quote through it all away Uh, quote it haunts me every day he said in the statement Um prosecutors have sought as much as 50 years while Bankman freed legal team argued for no more than six and a half years He was convicted on seven criminal counts in November and have been held at the Metropolitan detention center in Brooklyn Since um, an statement following Thursday's sentencing Damien Williams United States attorney for the Southern District of New York said Bankman freed Had orchestrated one of the largest frauds in financial history quote Today's sentence will prevent the defendant from ever again committing fraud And as an important message to others who might be tempted to engage in financial crimes that justice will be swift And the consequences will be severe uh, Bankman freed uh plans to appeal both this convention and sentence a spokesperson for its parents issue to statement I'm on their behalf quote. We are heartbroken and we'll continue to fight for our son um I just want to know this is my only burning question. Okay, because we're talking I'll leave with something to the tune of like eight billion dollars. Yeah Eight billion dollars the company at one point was valued at like 30 billion right but eight billion dollars Of people's hard earned money was given to this man it all went to the democratic platform or large majority of it did Where's that money yet What does it cut is it gonna go like what's the actual restitution on the people's part like sure He's going to jail, you know, might get a salad tossed a few times, but like Where's the money? Well, let's remember that jisling Maxwell went to prison for trafficking Minors to nobody right Right Right well, no, this is note. This is no different. This is the same thing that I believe That this dude Was placed in a position to do that this guy's an idiot. He's a patty. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, this guy's an idiot He's a useful idiot. They played to his ego. They got him tons of money He got to be around celebrities bro. He was so smug hit that troll of a girlfriend he had too. Oh fuck yeah Fucking thought she was hot shit. They were on the internet on podcast talking about all this money They made and how rich they were and how they had this alternative lifestyle with like 40 people living in a house And they're all having orgies every night and they were like so smug about it all the hot pockets Yeah, they didn't earn a fucking single penny and they took everybody's money And then they gave it to the Democrat who Very likely the intelligence agencies are the Democrat unspeculating Place this man in this position to do this to do that And I don't think he's saying it because dude they know that he'll get killed immediately Was but holes definitely bro. I had the craziest conversation last night. I didn't even get to tell you about this So there's this guy With this diddy this puffed outy shit. Oh man. That shit. It's our list. I'm not gonna say this guy's name But this guy was very close to diddy very close And if I said who he was you probably recognize his name. I spent two hours on the phone with him last night Okay, this dude Went from a to z All the shit these people do like and it was insane Like and I even told him I'm like bro. I don't know that you should come on the show And talk about this because like it It It's a lot of the shit that people speculate about like dude like satanic Codes and free masonry and like all this crazy shit. He's like dude He's like look man. He's like they fucking kill people all the time They don't even fucking think twice about it. He's and dude he dude it was My understanding of the ditty situation is that diddy was a bro Epstein for the rap industry Is that that's pretty much what I got but there's these people everywhere. Yeah, that's the thing and all different This is how they control all the shit right dude We've said this on the show a hundred times and this this guy who I was talking to Confirmed all of those things and it like dude. It was it was crazy dude Like I mean, and he wasn't it wasn't bullshit. I mean he was crying and like It would you know you could tell when people were full of shit this guy wasn't full of shit He was scared as fuck and he's like bro. I'm afraid they're listening to me right now And I said what if you're talking to me they definitely are yeah So you know But dude it was crazy. He went through like this Isaac capy shit You know that is that guy that got killed after we start talking about all the people in Epstein's island You apparently committed suicide off the bridge. Oh, yeah, just dude. It was It was crazy shit and like he wants to come on the show. I think But like I don't know like how this I don't know yeah, and plus dude. I want to vet there. I don't want him coming on Just saying all this shit without proof. I have some evidence. Yeah, I mean we we there's ways to do it We could put a voice change on them and you know them the lights on him. I can't ask yeah Give him a Kanye mask and do his voice Well anyway bro, it was so crazy I walked in the house and I had to put the put it on speakerphone so that Emily could hear what what was being said because I was like I've never done that my life ever I'm like I just got to have someone here this so that they know they know I'm not just making it up It was fucking insane. That's crazy. Yeah Yes, I mean that's my biggest question like Because they know he stole the money. They knew it was stolen money before he they even pressed submit on the fucking trend as actions Do those will the people get their money back? No Fuck no Yeah, I think I think where's the money that's my question. That's the question you ask that and that's the right question I think In 25 years I was looking at a chart. I think it was in today's journal Wall Street journal that he I think 25 years for a financial crime is either number two or number three in terms of the longest length of a sentence And they have to serve 80% I think is that correct? That's typical Bernie made-off was given 150 years that was his sentence Did he steal as much as Sam make me free? I that I don't know. I don't think so. I mean this was let's pull it up How much to Bernie made Bernie made-off steal was with Theranos was pretty far down the list she I think she got 11 or 12 years Yeah, dude. I think this guy's just an idiot and he had he he got placed in the situation Oh, yeah, no, but made-off was way more you 20 billion. Oh, okay, but this is saying he died right? Yeah, he died in prison Yeah, right don't steal people's fucking money. This looks like a like a porn hub thumbnail Yeah, he's gonna have problems in prison. He's gonna have He's gonna have this ain't Shawshank redemption bro. You going down. Yeah, there's no chance this guy knows how to fight or anything Look at him. They forced him to take the picture. Yeah. Yeah, he's gonna have problems. Oh, man I don't feel bad for well. I don't either. Oh, why is the guy standing next to him? Why is there an unablack dot over his face? Oh, I don't know who is he because they don't like it's weird There's four guys with black dots covering their face so you don't know who they are, but there's that one one guy who doesn't look very friendly No, he doesn't look friendly at all Maybe that's his boyfriend. He's taking all the cornbread. Maybe there a couple It's possible. Yeah, he's taking all the cornbread for sure. I mean that does Sam does look like a little woman next to him Like whatever you want, baby He's gonna have to stock up on that syrup a jelly bro and that Kool-Apex man.

We're going with this one. Oh you want the you want the twins. Yeah Well, it looks like a woman has two heads with what's called she has yeah, so you always so this is where we're going Yeah, oh, this is great. It's perfect. Oh, this is when you thought was good. This is about yeah, this is both good This is what this was the one I was okay, you want them with this one. Yeah. All right. Let's dive into it Our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads Abby Hensel is married Conjoined twin who rose to fame and reality show Abby and Brittany secretly tied the knot with an army veteran in 2021 So these these twins they are conjoined right at the upper the rassic cavity, but they share everything else Okay, everything else they got they got they got two heads, but one body one sign right yeah, I get it Yeah, one whole body though. Yeah, right. Okay. There's not like multiple right just one of the giant That's what one body means. Okay, I got it. Yep. Yeah, two heads up Um, but yes, they were on a reality show mean they're probably lucky to still be alive Yeah, it's possible. Yeah, I mean I mean surgery is not an option. You can't really remove that Um, I just put it over China Yeah, all right, come on. Let's go What do you say What do you say you split a atom out of eve? All right, so an American teacher shot the fame on a reality TV series with her conjoined twin quietly married three years ago 28 years after captivating the world with an appearance on Oprah Abby Hensel now 34 from Minnesota tied the knot with Josh bowling 33 a nurse and army veteran in 2021 According to public record obtained by today Abby and her sister Brittany only uh one of only a few sets of dicefilis twins and histories to survive impency Rose the fame on their eponymous TLC show which chronicle their major life events including their high school graduation and job hunting The parachute a single body and from the waist down all of their organs including the intestine bladder and reproductive organs are shared Um, in a documentary film when the girls were teenagers their mother said they were keen to have children Of their own one day explaining quote that is probably something that could work because those organs do work for them Quote yeah, we're going to be moms Brittany agreed and another interview Brittany reiterated their desire to have their own family To have their own saying quote the whole world doesn't need to know who we are seeing And what we are doing and when we are going to do it, but believe me We are totally different people Abby added quote yeah, we are going to be moms one day But we don't want to talk about how it's going to work yet Abby's relationship with Josh who is a father of one has gone under the radar until now With the twins leading a quieter life out of the spotlight in the last 10 years, but here's a video from the wedding day You Call that to for the bice one i Don't think that's a deal I don't think that's a good deal. I mean, okay, so he so the reason I say that is not because like they're weird or anything But like you got to listen to two sets of two mouths. Yeah You know what i'm saying like you got two complaints two two sets of rules two people tell you take out the trash. Yeah So So you see we made the one on the left Oh, so what's the other one she's yeah Voyaging does the other one get a husband or a partner as well I that would be really awkward And Matt oh, you know the original famous simis twins who lived in the 1800s Were were two men that I think they were they They were a little I don't remember the details, but they were I think it was their torsos were connected. Mm-hmm. And they each had their own wives Mm-hmm, and they had children and and very Very see they were financially successful And I mean they were I think sime they think they were from siam what the country of what was then siam I read about all this in the Guinness book of world records back when i was a child, but like that like they had Phenomenal lives. Yeah, oh, they had children and families and happy marriages and and Amazing, I mean look dude my take on it is everybody's got a right to be happy You know i'm saying like yeah, and like dude, you know Can't help that you're born and different and You know even if you're not born that way when you can be different I learned a lot of that when I got stabbed Like when I got stabbed and my face was disfigured real bad for about a year and a half My face was swollen up like like this big like the size of grapefruit outside of my head And it never went down so like I had not just scars, but I had like a actual Fucking grapefruit stuck to the side of my face for a year And like everybody treats you weird. Everybody would look you in the face Everybody looked away nobody would make eye contact and it and it taught me Uh a very important lesson about people who have differences or physical disfigurements or like bro, those are people too like and they have hearts and they have brains and they're They deal with this every day so like I mean is is you know like You can make little jokes about it or whatever right. Yeah, it's probably awkward that they got to like Fuck the same dude and shit, right? Like yeah, but like at the same time You know it's it is what it is and they're figuring out a way to make it work and I think that's cool Absolutely. Yeah, I agree So yeah, I don't you know who are we to judge? You look happy. Yeah, they do look happy Yeah, and I think that's cool. I think that's happy. Yeah He does he looks like he loves it.
