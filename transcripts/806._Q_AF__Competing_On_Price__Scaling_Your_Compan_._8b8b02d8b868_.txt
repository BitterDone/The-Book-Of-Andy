AF that's where you submit the questions and we give you the answers if you want to submit a question be answer on the show which can be about anything business life how to kick ass entrepreneurship what's going on in the world you could submit your questions a couple different ways the first way is guys you can email these questions into ask Andy at Andy for selling that calm or you go on YouTube on the Q and A F episodes drop your question in the comments we'll choose some from there as well now this is your first time listening we have shows within the show tomorrow you're going to hear crews the internet we call that CTI that's we put topics on the screen we speculate on what's going on the world we talk about what's true what's not true and then finally how we the people that solve these problems going on in the world sometimes we're gonna have real talk real talk is just five to twenty minutes and me giving you some real talk and then we have what's called 75 hard verses that's where someone who has completed the 75 hard program comes on the show talks about how their life was before how their life is now and how you can do the same thing they've done using the 75 hard program if you're unfamiliar with the 75 hard program it is the world's most famous mental transformation program in history and it's available for free it's also the initial phase of the sustainable lifestyle called live hard all right you get that for free on episode 208 on the audio feed only it's not on YouTube it's on the audio feed only there is a book available the book is available at Andy for seller dot com it's called the book on mental toughness it outlines the entire live hard program top to bottom it's much more detailed than the free podcast plus I have a whole bunch of chapters on mental toughness how you can use it to transform your life along with a bunch of case studies on people that you will recognize who have used it to transform their lives all right don't have to buy it very popular book we're almost always sold out of it I'd highly recommend it all right now we do things a little bit different on this show we don't run ads on the show you're going to notice that we're probably the biggest show in the world in fact I know we are that doesn't run ads all right and I ask very simply that you trade us something for that all right trade us helping us grow the show okay we've been at this messaging for four and a half years and had we grown the show to a proper place we wouldn't be in the situation society and the reason that the show hasn't grown the way that it should is because a lot of people listen to the show and don't necessarily abide by the fee okay so since I don't pump your ears full of advertising for 40 fucking minutes I ask very simply that you help us share the show we're constantly dealing with censorship shadow bands traffic throttling and it's up to you to help us grow the show all right so don't be a hope show show all right what's up man I'm a sound a little bit a little bit you know fucking taken forever yeah where do you think it was like was it just like weather or like bio weapons from from the fucking chemtrails I don't know dude it's I get this like twice a year man yeah get it in the spring and I get it in the fall and it fucks me up every time every time you're hearing on the show twice a year I'll go horse for going out to be a golden fucking pipe slap working everybody stops getting paid yeah you know it isn't our form though the whole like even speaking thing the what like just speaking in general it's an art form man I just practice dude yeah you know people that want to be good speakers they go out there and you know they recite in front of a mirror they join like toast masters I don't know if you know what toast masters is and then whether you learn how to do yeah you go in front of a bunch of people and you get speeches and all that shit's effective but dude really if you want to learn how to be an effect of speaker it's reps you know starting a podcast even if nobody listens to it and just doing episode after episode after episode you're gonna learn how to speak a lot better yeah you know getting in front of people one of the best things I ever did was you know obviously hold meetings in my companies I got another one to hold tonight you know I hold multiple meetings a week where I have to and I have for 20 years where I have to speak in front of people so like you know the more of that stuff you do bro the the less anxious you're gonna be about it and the more effective you are and let me teach you a little secret because I know there's a lot of people out here that want to become more effective speakers the number one most effective tip that I can give one of you guys see we're gonna get some extra sauce we're just gonna give it to beginning I love the other sauce but the number one tip that I can give you guys about becoming a better speaker is to have the right intent if your intent is to go up there and be celebrated as a speaker you're not gonna do very well if your intent is to go up there and recite a bunch of shit that you know you planned out to recite perfectly you're not gonna do well if you go up there with the intent to deliver value and help people it really doesn't matter what you say or how you say it because they're gonna feel it and they're gonna remember it so if you're worried about giving a speech or you're worried about giving a meeting or you're worried about giving a talk or you're worried about a piece of content that you made simply ask yourself did I make this for me or did I make it for them did I make it for me to get celebrated I make it for them to get benefit and if you make it for them to get benefit it's always going to be received well it's a number one tip you could ever get about public speaking that's fucking awesome yeah that's that's what I love it it's true try you know there's a lot of you guys out there that run little meetings and do you do speaking try it dude I promise you to work yeah because I mean I like I've seen you speak and and I don't think I've ever seen a speech where talk you've given that was like planned and rehearsed and I don't prep anything you just know I gotta fucking fix them shit the only thing I might know before I go up is I might have one or two stories I want to tell yeah and and those stories will help me guide the rest of the speech but I don't ever plan a speech outside of just two one or two stories I'm trying to tell yeah that's crazy yeah and I can give and then if it's a tactical lesson I mean I can talk for eight hours without notes but it's like a speech it's just what's the stories I want to tell what's the intent and yeah I might not be the most eloquent I might not have no I'm serious yeah I might not have the best vocabulary of anybody but because my intent is so real people feel it and it's it is real that's why they feel it through the podcast bro yeah this shit's contagious too bro I love it well little extra sauce to get started yeah I got some good I mean I got I do got some real ones for you okay well I mean we just end there because like that's probably the best tip you ever done yet a special sauce show the show yeah all right see you guys any question number one hey Andy I own a landscape business and in the offseason we install Christmas lights these are not your average Christmas lights bought from a big box store we use professional grade products and hold a certification in installing these lights my question is other installers in our area are pricing the install so cheap it's hard to be competitive this is a luxury service that isn't for everyone but other companies are so cheap I can't even cover my supplies for what they are charging I refuse to lower my prices and I feel like my work shows my worth do you have any recommendations this is very frustrating to me as I take pride in my work what's your thoughts on this well listen first of all you don't determine your worth the market does and just because you feel that you're worth more doesn't mean that you're actually worth more it depends on what the market's willing to pay okay I think my house is worth a hundred million but the market won't pay that yeah okay so all day long I could say how much it's worth but when I go to sell it and ain't gonna sell for that that's reality so we can talk about how good we are what job we do but the reality is with the internet today all of our jobs almost all of our jobs our commodity jobs meaning we can easily find someone else to do the exact same thing that you do probably for as much money or less so what does that mean for you selling a product that is superior all right what that means is and by the way I'm putting superior in quotes for you guys on the audio we don't know if it's superior how the fuck do I know if your Christmas lights are superior or everybody else's lights what is the difference to me I go I come home it's got pretty lights all over it I come home and I see your lights do they look prettier right okay I'm not saying maybe they do but you need to educate around that point that's the point I'm trying to make any product that you serve that is a superior product that you know is superior it is on you to display how it's superior and why it's worth more money and just because you say well I'm worth it that's not a good enough reason so what is it that makes your lights better why would I pay more for those lights okay so you have to craft stories around that you know listen everybody in the neighborhoods got these little twinkle twinkle little star lights they get a fucking lows bro and everybody knows they look like shit you want to be the best in your in your neighborhood right I know you do look at your neighborhood look at the car you drive look how you keep your lawn look how you dress bro you are clearly someone who cares about appearances these lights are going to look like this here let me show you a picture of our lights versus their lights and yeah I understand it's a little bit more but like I said dude you're not skimping over here over here over here you're someone that appreciates quality see what I'm saying so we develop a story and a pitch around why our shit is better we educate on why it's better and you're gonna have less customers than the cheaper guy because most people when they deal with good better best categories the good has the most customers the better has less customers than that and the best has less customers than that and that's the way it goes so you're gonna have a specific customer you're not gonna have as much customers as maybe the the good guy the guy who uses the shit from lows but if you could charge your premium to make up for the difference in the amount of customers which is the math that you should be trying to figure out you can figure out where you need to be priced at to make it worth your while but ultimately this comes down to you educating and by the way this goes for anybody who sells a quote unquote commodity product okay if you sell a car washing soap you're gonna have to explain the difference between using dawn in your bucket or using turtle wax 5000 right like right that one cost nothing one cost 50 bucks about I'm making the shit up you see what I'm saying though we have to make a story we have to display the value and we have to educate around why we would use this versus that and just because you say oh well I'm not lowering my price well that's fine but you're missing the link that you need to show to the customer to get the sale yeah I want to ask you this because this is actually something I've always wondered and I feel like most people see this in action like on the consumer side of things we see this right where you know the big box store is able to charge less for a product of similar quality right then you know the smaller mom and pop shops right what is it like what's happening there is that more of a relationship thing that like you know there maybe that's something while they can charge cheaper because they have a better relationship with the buyer is like I mean yeah if the products are the same I mean if you buy in quantity you're gonna get a cheaper price okay so you're always gonna have a disadvantage against a bigger company however you can make that up with little bonus extras you know things that create the customer experience you can always compete with a cheaper price if you make a great experience and over deliver on the value all right so if you're the little guy you got to figure out how to make your Christmas light business something that people look forward to to you coming every year how how will we make like if you were sitting in front of me I'd ask you and we would get on a whiteboard figure this out how do we make our Christmas light customers so excited that they look forward to you coming and doing their Christmas lights over you maybe it's a gift maybe it's something else you do maybe maybe you take a professional photograph every year and have it framed for them with their house during Christmas time maybe you offer to take a family picture do there's all kinds of things and no limitations if you just open the boundaries up of what you can do and this goes back to what I said in the beginning of the show if you open up your mind with the proper intent you'll find solutions that will allow people to look forward to the experience which will then help you grow your business because if you can create that kind of presence what do you think they're telling their friends and then all of a sudden you're doing more business than the guy with the cheapest lights you see what I'm saying really kicking in yes so like dude you guys have to think outside the box man everything we deal with nowadays is a commodity it doesn't matter what you do bro if you do concrete if you do retail sales if you are a fucking marketer whatever you do there's a 50 there's 50 million other people to do it just as good protein powder there's fucking millions of protein powders okay all of these things have to be educated around why they are better and we have to figure out how can we make the experience good enough to where they spread the word for us and that's what this game's about dude people are tired of automation they're tired of fucking you know not dealing with someone or getting an answer machine or getting treated like another number so if you can humanize the process of getting people Christmas lights which by the way should be pretty easy because that's a very emotional time for people where they have a lot of nostalgia and a lot of care and emotion and they want to they want to you know create a good thing for their kids and memories and this this is this is an easy thing to build a nicer experience off of because their emotions are already involved okay so what can you do and you have to think about that what can I do some of you guys out there gonna hear that and you're gonna come up with all kinds of amazing ideas and by the way it's not just Christmas lights it's any kind of service some of you are gonna hear that and say well fuck do you you know I don't know and you're gonna continue to get your ass kicked I'm just telling you if you listen what I'm saying you're gonna do great if you don't you continue to lose so what can you do extra that's low cost that makes people say holy shit I'm never doing business with anybody else that's the bottom line what can you do and you can do a lot because nobody's willing to do anything anymore look at the restaurant service that we get now after covid look at the customer service we get from everybody after covid I mean you got fucking Amazon running over people's mailboxes and shit you know I'm saying throwing throwing fucking shit on people's porch from 10 feet away right that's the level of service that we're dealing with now and if you can come up on the polar opposite of that you're gonna get the business a hundred times out of a hundred yeah I love it man I love it guys Andy question number two uh Andy what was what was the most important thing you learned when you started scaling s2 I'm about to put my company in a new phase of growth and I'm seeing that a few of my key people who I thought were my guys they just can't handle the adjustment and new workload did you have this issue and if so how did you handle it I love these guys and I wouldn't be here without them well loving guys and then being effective is two different things okay and I can appreciate because when you spend a lot of time with people you develop friendships and I understand all that but the reality is is we have to remember we're here to do a fucking job we're here to do a job at a high level and if we don't do a job at a high level there is no friendship because there is no money to pay anybody with all right so sometimes when you scale there's going to be people that do not level up their own skill set which will unfortunately find their way out of the program when you have high standards and you want to grow you have to have people that also have high standards and they have to want to grow I can't walk in and download information into people's heads I can't download discipline into people's heads I can't download knowledge or skill set into people's heads they have to go do that on their own and if they're not hungry enough to do that on their own as the system scales they will naturally wash out and you will replace with people who do this is a natural part of scaling a business and unfortunately it's very tough part because if you're an ethical operator bro you do care about people you care about people you care about the fucking families you care about everything and that becomes very hard when you start to move up and the people aren't following along because now you got to make hard decisions and that's not cool that's one of the worst things about being in charge or being a manager or being the CEO or whatever and unfortunately you have to over time sort of detach yourself from the emotional aspect of it and realize that that's their responsibility not yours and if people aren't willing to scale up and if people aren't willing to do the personal development on their end and they aren't willing to raise their standards on their end then there's going to be a limit to how far they go with you and that's just the reality you know unfortunately a lot of people think that once they're in a good situation the good situation is guaranteed and it's just not so if you want to scale just like when we've scaled there's been people who have who have leveled up and those people who have leveled up are still here and are making a fuck ton of money and then there's people who didn't level up and who went other places which by the way is totally fine it doesn't mean I don't like them it doesn't mean I don't care about them still it just means they could not operate and row the boat the way we needed it road and we're going where the fuck we're going like there's no gonna there's not going to be any hostage holding in terms of where we're taking the business and that should go for you too you know and what I mean by hostage holding is you know people who think that you're just going to fucking go at their pace instead of you go at your pace so I would highly recommend that too I would recommend realizing that there's going to be people that you care about that don't swim as hard that don't want to fucking level up and you know if you don't make the proper decision around those people then you're going to hurt everybody else on the team and that's how you figure out what the fuck is is what if you got a person who's not leveling up and the rest of the team is leveling up remember you lose the respect of everybody else on the team by not doing something about it because you're costing them so that makes it a little easier to make those moves but you know at the end of the day you set a standard the standard has to be high if you don't set a high standard you lose period because nobody's going to come and push you along down the path to grow the business so the answer is very simple some people are going to go some people aren't some people will surprise you some people will surprise you both ways some people will step up and just level up some people you think will step up won't step up and you'll have to make decisions and it's it's a part of business man yeah let me actually this because with s2 if I you went from the one store to like six stores right and so that's new employees new people you've never worked that was in 2006 yeah we went from two to six two to six stores right now and you didn't like you didn't personally hire those employees it kind of it came in right so let me actually this when it when it comes to this scaling because that was a big scale growth for you how important is it to make sure that you have a good like foundation culture in place because like if this guy is going to get new people in it's like how important is it to set it then did you set it then no I didn't it's super important but I didn't okay and I only have two people that I inherited out of that out of that five stores that we took over because what happened was we had two stores we purchased quote unquote basically we took over five failing stores we closed one then we had six and then we started opening our own locations so out of those employees still got friends that were there like good friends that were there that yeah but they're off to other things yeah um you know and uh we have two guys who were still there from that day and both of them are on major parts of first form um and you know it's it's just part of the business but ideally if you could set a cultural standard before you have to scale it's going to be that much easier to scale because if you can create a living breathing culture inside of your company before you scale then what happens is the people that you bring in while you're scaling will be monitored and coached by the existing employees not just you so what I mean by that is this how many of you guys have joined a team or joined a company or join an organization you go in and the the guy to your left or the guy to your right not your manager they're like yeah they're saying this but that's not really how we do shit here okay that's poor culture all right that will kill you toxic that will kill you okay well you want is the opposite of that well you want to create a situation where the person comes in they fuck the standard and the person to the left of the right hey bro that's not how we do shit here because you're fucking hurt me now okay now think how much easier it is to scale a company when you have the second kind of culture versus the first and that comes from you setting it up intentionally from the beginning or right now where you are I did not do that because I was not informed about how to intentionally create culture it took me many years past that to figure it out to me five more years past what you're actually asking to figure that out um so if you can do that it's best that you do it now if you if you can't do it if you haven't done it yet you should still do it now um that involves setting core values that involves communicating core values that involves having a literal mission statement a big vision the how we're going to get there this is what we teach an artist indicate okay so like this is we could do a fucking two week long podcast on all this shit but at the end of the day you have to establish culture before you scale if you want your your company to be strong um and manageable if you if you try to scale without culture I'm not saying you can't succeed but the customer experience is going to suffer you might be able to hold it together for a while you're going to constantly be dealing with employee issues and if you do it right the employees will wash out the other employees on their own so you want to deal with shit except good things so you know that's what I take on that if I would have known to do that in 2006 probably more of those people would still be here um I didn't figure it out until 2011 and we have a number of people who are still here from 2011 so it's a huge deal in terms of longevity it's a huge deal in terms of commitment it's a huge deal in terms of stability and you know it's a huge deal in terms of how you feel about other people because there's a number of people who have been here since that time that I'm very proud of who have built nice careers and built nice lives and and dude that feels good you know I sleep good at night because of that and and that's why I come in here and why I do any any of the things I do now is because I want those people to continue to progress because it's one of the most rewarding things that you could experience and I realize it comes down the road for a lot of you guys but you know it's it's it's it's a lot more valuable than getting a cool car or fucking nice house I could tell you that yeah and I know you said like this definitely probably could be like a fucking 2 week course or talk just on this can we dispel a quick myth though about culture is there a number of employees required to have not culture set how you could do it with yourself hmm if you're the only person you could do it with yourself it's the standards you set for yourself and the standards you hope for yourself it's about saying I'm gonna I'm gonna stand for this this this this this this I'm gonna do things this fight this way I'm not gonna compromise on those things and then when someone joins you you're already living that they adopt the culture so it can start with just you even if you're a single operator but you have to live it you have to be it even if and that's called integrity what are you going to do when no one's watching how are you gonna operate when no one's watching are you gonna operate to your standard you're gonna cut corners I can tell you this dude I try very fucking hard to operate in my standard all the time 24 hours a day even when no one's watch watching especially when no one's watching because that's when you actually gain more of the discipline and strength that you need to uphold both standards so you can start it with just yourself and in fact I think every single fucking human should have a set of core values and emission statement and a vision for their own lives and most people don't most people just go along with the flow they they swing into someone else's vision and they stay there for a little bit and they swing into someone else's for a little bit and then they get to be older in life and they're like why the fuck is nothing worked out for me well the reason nothing's worked out for you is because you don't live what you say you're about you don't have a plan for yourself you don't have a mission statement for yourself you don't think about the culture that you set for yourself you don't you don't you try to cut the corners when no one's watching bro that you'll lose that way that's just it you know and a lot of people in this world fucking think that you can somehow you know what at real talk I don't know what's wrong with people I don't know what's wrong with people you know I sometimes I think because I've had like two near real near death experiences where I fucking thought I was for sure gonna die it's installed some sort of insane fucking like driving me because I'll be real dude I don't see it from a lot of people I see a lot of people either they don't believe in themselves they don't believe they can be great so they don't try or um you know they think they got all the time in the world and they think she's just gonna work out and like dude I know for a fact that's not the case and it's very frustrating dude it's it's like like dude imagine if you saw someone that you care about and you saw them standing in the road and 18 wheeler was coming and no matter how fucking much you yelled at them no matter how much you scream they couldn't hear you that's what it's like for me with other people that's why I get so fucking frustrated that's why the internet sees me and they're like what's what's going on with this guy why is he so angry I'm angry because you guys don't understand what you're actually capable of and you're the guy standing in the road and I'm the guy screaming at you and you're not hearing what I'm saying and then they'll say well everybody wants different things yeah everybody does want different things now when you're young and you don't have to worry about real shit but I'm gonna tell you when you're older you're gonna fucking feel differently and that's real shit and there's a lot of people that I that I've grown up with who have had that attitude of whoa whoa it'll all work out and you know what now they're struggling now they're having to do a bunch of shit they don't want to do so when I come on here and I talk to you guys and I get intense and I you know I'm the way I am it's because I fucking know what the fucking roads like and I don't want you get run over by it I love it man guys and let's get your third and final question got a young gun here he's 20 years old hey so I'm 20 years old and I've been hustling hard for almost a year and a half I finished 75 hard the spring and it really benefited my life so thank you kindly for creating it recently I've been working almost nonstop and as could be expected I am lucky if I get six hours of sleep in a night one night I was heading home late after a networking event and fell asleep behind the wheel I told him my vehicle and thankfully nobody was seriously injured or killed I am now stuck in a paradox where I both need more money and also need to dial things back a bit I've seen other people's lives completely derail after this type of situation because they stop caring about making progress what are your suggestions to ensure that I stay on track as I continue to make progress well I wouldn't fucking work yourself in new exhaustion where you're going to wreck your car I hope you learned a lesson there look dude there's going to be four or five times in your life where shit is really bad where you you feel like you don't have options okay there's going to be times where you feel like no matter what you do you're going to lose I don't know how I'm going to get out of this and that is when people quit all right and you have become one of the people that realizes very simply that when other people quit and you keep going you're getting a bigger advantage okay if you all start at the same level and you get to level 10 and fucking half the people quit now you're competing with half as many people if you get to level 20 and half of those people quit now you're only competing with a quarter of the people that you started with and that goes on and on and on and on and that's the game the game is longevity the game is endurance the game is consistent progression regardless of what's going on so while I don't have an exact answer of what you need to do you got to get your ship back together and you got to keep moving because this is one of those key moments when everybody else will quit and you will continue to move forward and that creates success okay so if I were you I would work through this and I would look at it as a time as a major test that you pass okay and that's going to give you a bunch of other things too besides just an advantage you know people will say oh I'm not competing with anybody know you are there's lots of other people out there they're doing the same shit you're doing and there's a limited amount of places for the fucking winner that's it that is reality okay but when you go through a test like this and not only do you gain a a perspective of you know what it takes to win and not only do other people quit and you get a real advantage but you gain the confidence and you gain the belief and you gain the self-esteem and the know that when bad things happen you can push through them all right so the next time one of these bad things happen where all the storms come together at once and create this fucking shitty situation you can look back and say well I got through that I got through this I got through that that one time I'll get through this too okay and that becomes a habit so if we had a guy on the show a couple of weeks ago about he wanted to quit his football team remember that okay that guy if he doesn't quit he will have another situation just like that where he doesn't feel like it's fair it's not going well and if he works through that he'll gain more confidence he'll gain more belief he'll gain more momentum and the more you go through those the more likely you are to win by the numbers okay and the more confident you're going to be because of what you already know that you over overcame all right so we have to understand that what we overcome not only allows us a higher likelihood that we're going to win but it also teaches us that we can go through the hard things which is where most people quit so the more you go through and don't quit the more likely you are to win a very real way all right so whatever you got to do to get through this you get through it you know and by the way don't believe all these people online to tell you don't have to sleep that's bullshit okay and that might have got you in this problem in the first place I think there's a lot of lies on the internet about how much you got to sleep and you know you got to work 40 hours and 24 hours it's impossible all right it's not safe no no it's not safe it's not good for you it's not real it's it's it's people who are lying that's it it's people who are lying so that you will glorify them be like oh my god look how great they are and by the way look how shitty I am I I can't work you know I can't get by on two hours of sleep well bro neither do that by saying they're sleeping before just so you know bro half these motherfuckers wake the fuck up act like they're doing something and then go back to sleep yeah you know what I'm saying so half of them are on drugs like you don't know what the fuck people are doing stop listening to these goofballs yeah one one thing I want to add on this to bring in man it's like you know like you're 20 you think you're having a hard time just wait till you're 21 wait till you're 25 like bad the bad things are always going to happen yeah it's how you choose to look at it yeah right can we I mean just just like I feel like there's a lot of expectation bro you know people don't get that like they see even like you see someone who's successful and like okay I just use myself okay a lot of people from the outside they look and they say holy shit look at all bro you don't have any fucking idea what I've gone through bro I stabbed the fucking face I had fucking girls tell me I was fucking bullshit I had friends fucking make fun of me I had fucking you know car accidents fucking almost being broke literally more than the times that I made money the amount of stress the amount of turmoil I had stores broken into I fucking I mean bro you could go on and on and on I could I don't even know how far I could go with that you know what I mean yeah but every time you go through one of these hard things you get better you get stronger and it provides a situation for you to learn from and become mentally tougher and the more mentally tough that you become and the less that they are how can they beat you how can let me ask you this how can you beat someone who cannot fucking quit how can you beat someone who every time they go through a hard time they get better and they get stronger instead of getting weaker and getting demoralized how can you beat someone who looks back on all the tests that they've had and said yeah that wasn't shit dude bring it the fuck on okay as opposed to the person who's like oh my god I can't believe this happened and then fucking two months another thing happens oh my god I can't believe this happened it's gonna be the person who has a stoic mentality who looks at it and says this okay all right we'll get through it and then the next thing happens well won't do that again but we'll get through it right not freaking the fuck out like the world's ending every two weeks there you can't live like that and that's why I tell people you know most people aren't built for entrepreneurship because they make way bigger deals out of things that shouldn't be they they can't handle the ups and downs they can't emotionally take it they can't live with what ifs and unknowns right and your your success is going to be in direct proportion to the amount of uncertainty that you're able to live with all right so if you're not able to live with uncertainty and you're not able to tolerate the ebbs and flows and you can't figure out how to get better you can't do it dude it's impossible because it's such a hard road like the road to building something real I'm not talking about some internet fucking funnable shit that you sell some widget I'm talking about building a real company talking about building something sustainable talking about building something that has actual valuable equity on the back end that you can retire on or you can sell or you can take care of your family with that's hard and there's a reason why most people can't do it and it's because they don't have the emotional resiliency to deal with it so if you're going to become one of these people I would suggest that you invest a significant amount of time of mentally toughening yourself up intentionally so that you can deal with the inevitable ebbs and flows that are going to happen the inevitable hard times because they're going to come and it's it's not like it's not a surprise like for someone like me when hard times come it's not a surprise like I just understand it's part of the recipe just like you would understand that putting chocolate chips is required into a chocolate chip cookie recipe struggle and hardship and fucking bad times and tests those are all part of the journey so you can't be surprised when you when you get to I mean if you're gonna take a fucking trip from here to you know California you're gonna realize that you're probably gonna have to go up some hills and down some hills and there's probably at least some flat times probably gonna hit some rain storms maybe some snowstorms but if every time the hill went up or every time the hill went down or every time you hit some rain you turned around and went back home how the fuck you get to California you see what I'm saying so you have to be someone who can tolerate these natural ebbs and flows emotionally and in reality if you're gonna build anything so so it's more about building yourself into someone who could tolerate it at then it is like finding a path without those obstacles yeah you see what I'm saying yeah I fucking love it make a chocolate chip cookies fuck you call some chocolate chips I didn't know this that's what I'm saying huh like like bro it's coming with the same thing it's obvious shit dude and we have to understand hard things have a hard path easy things have an easier path hard things are more valuable than easy things so if you want a better life you're gonna have to build yourself into someone who can deal with the hard path and if you can't you won't make it and that's that love it man I love it guys Andy it's good on Monday started man all right guys see you tomorrow with CTI
