I don't know how to so You know just take some time man. Yeah, I you know I'm sorry man We can't all be yeah, I get it. I get it But yeah, I wanted to bring this this this article in man because it's great. It's great And you know, we like to expose a pock or see on the show like talk about You know the left's attempt to you know Fuck everything up. I think this was a great example of that. I want you guys to read this headline From Rolling Stone magazine, okay, check this headline out Trump loving neo-nazi crash maga boat parade Okay And they talking this article about you know, there was a Trump boat parade in Jupiter, Florida on sat Sunday Was joined by neo-nazis waving swatts to keflag shouting white power Helly hail Trump and make America white again, okay The show boating of yachts and wake boats on behalf of Trump's candidacy is the revival of the Trump Armada trend From 2020 when maggot don't Magnet Magnetonians I haven't heard that when you did it. That's a new original Magnetonians with boat loads of disposable income Met up to cruise around the harbor and create more than a little white water while waving Trump flags This event in Jupiter one of the wealthiest areas of the state was touted by Trump ally Roger Stone as the quote mother of all Trump boat parades It promised the well-heeled crowd an incredible air show with paratroopers Descending with Trump 2024 flags But in the wake of Trump using openly fascistic rhetoric on the campaign trail including pushing bigoted blood libel against Haitian migrants And even parading white nationalist by describing America as an occupied country it fucking is an occupied country I don't understand how that's a white nationalist That has nothing to do with white people who are occupied aren't even white Well some are some but uh, yeah, they're putting out that these this group of people. I guess they're talking about me We as I say occupied all the time. Yeah, but we didn't go to the boat parade We didn't go but this is It took social media about storm that was his boat of dumb folks That tried that that join that they snuck into the parade line of this boat. They're not sneaking in with that shit over Yeah, well they put that out there right how are you supposed to stop someone from flying a certain flag and by the way When the Democrats protest you guys get a lot of fucking dumbasses there and we don't say that you're all dumbasses We say that the people all the way over there dumbasses. Yeah, for sure Yeah, they're on this boat screaming things like white power and you know other Interesting things they were Hurling messages about Jewish people and they yelled the inward while Trump and swastika flags Which way? Huh which inward? I don't know if it was soft or hard. No Nine that today But yeah, I mean just be a complete douchebags, right? But here's the thing Here's the thing how do we know that those are actual Nazi people and how do we know these aren't just Antifa dressed up as Nazis or the feds dressed up as Nazis Andy that is a damn good question I know that's a damn good. Why? Because I'm just a dumb internet Podcast or this shit just pops in my brain dude. I'm I know how happens listen. That's a great question. Yeah, it's a great question and people tend to forget that you know in this world Of information there's plenty of things that are accessible a public record like boat registrations and they pulled the boat registration because they were clearly seen on that boat and On Tuesday Donald Trump's campaign told Newsweek the group were liberal activists shocking Liberal activists in a statement to Newsweek Caroline leave it Trump's national press secretary said quote, Kamala supporters are reaching all time lows Social media posts show that genuine Trump supporters identified these idiots as liberal activists trying to create fake news They clearly responded accordingly. Yeah, they they started shouting like I guess they used the engines to like Douse the fucking boat with a bunch of water. I saw that yeah, and they could clearly unwelcome by everybody else everybody and then media try to make it like all the people there were those people exactly and So I just thought that was interesting. Yeah, I thought that was interesting. You know what's interesting to me though like People don't even understand historical reference at all, right? Do you know that the swastika for like 12,000 years before the 40s? It was actually a symbol of good luck and positivity and prosperity Mm-hmm, and now it's now it's by ancient humans of all different cultures hardware unity I'm just saying mental and then and then this one dude comes along and they paint it as like it's the worst thing ever Forever like that's kind of weird. It's weird. You know what I mean? And I'm not advocating obviously for Nazism or any of that shit, but what I am saying is at what point Do we tarnish historical symbols that are part of human history? because Some people use them in a bad way. That's all I'm saying. That's no different than the rainbow I mean, that's what is is biblical. Yeah, that's what a cool thing that's being used for yeah For gays and I know people have a hard time swallowing that because in our lifetime that symbol has always met that one thing, right? I don't know. It's just weird. It's weird. Like how do you recover those like are they like how do you get the rainbow back? Yeah, well, I personally I don't want the rainbow back It's a little bit longer. I'm just saying is it tarnish so bad that every time for the rest of your life you wear a rainbow shirt you standing with the stuff Maybe well, I know I'm just asking I think in this I'm having I'm asking a legitimate discussion These symbols were hijacked. That's a good point the symbol the rainbow has been hijacked by the LGBTQ plus TIA community It is it is weaponized by the furthest people on that scale like most normal Regular everyday gay people are disassociating with the rainbow because of how it's been used, right? So at what point do we take it back and say no fuck you you know, that's all I'm saying yeah Yeah No, I don't know man. I think that would be a big stretch for a lot of people with the swastika. Yeah, right? Because they're for your whole life you're told like I can remember when I was a kid and You know rainbows that rainbows, you know what I mean like what what what what is it? What does Google say swastika means? So While we are discussing and finding out that I'll show you something So here. This is the swastika symbol. Yeah, and this symbol over here slightly tilted This is widely used in Indian culture especially in the Hinduism religion which means and it comes from the ancient Sanskrit book which means like prosperity yeah starting something new They use a special kind of mixture just like a semi-solid not not liquidity and they put it on stuff like you're starting a new business You get a new car or something, but they look awfully similar Yeah, and and dude if you travel buildings all over the world through all different cultures You find that symbol on all these ancient buildings and you know this because People that go places for the first time are usually shocked about it. They're like oh, man I'm just offering up discussion, right like When somebody hijacks a A symbol that has meant something to all humans for a long time. I don't know maybe like our American government is hijacked our flag Right when when do we get it back? When do we take it back right because when I look at that flag? I don't think Kamala Harris and Joe Biden I think you guys and I think the people I see out here on the street And I think the military and the police and the first responders and The all the good citizens of our of our country. That's our fucking flag, dude That's our flag that is not the flag of Tyranical rulers and they've hijacked that from us And I think there's a lot of Americans that even hesitate to fly American flag because they think that supporting those people And we have to remember that like dude these are our symbols These are our symbols that matter to us to stand for things that we believe in these are not for these people to hijack Whether they're fucking Nazis or whether they're fucking rainbow people or whether they're tyrants like You know what I mean? Yeah, it's definitely interesting conversation But yeah, the swastika definition. It's an ancient symbol in the form of equal armed cross With each arm continued at a right angle Use especially in South Asia as a symbol of good luck or spirituality. There you go Yeah, it's just an interesting discussion Here you go you go you go The other man hey, I just think that it's important You know that we as people as humans regardless of if you're in the United States or Europe or fucking Asia or anywhere Especially in the United States But we have to remember that history is Curated by people who win the battles and that necessarily does all the great people always win Do you think through history and time every single war was won by the good guys? It wasn't So we have to we have to as human beings be open To Looking a little bit beneath the surface to figure out what's actually going on Because we have seeking how they've tried to gaslight us and lie to us the last four or five years, right? We've seen All these different things, you know, COVID black square you crane All these movements we've seen them go up like Kamala Harris goes up on TV just a few days ago and says What are they hiding Trump and why are they like dude? We know that this was a complete lie Like when J6 happened in a year later They did a super Hollywood produced Candle-like visual on the steps of the capital. Well, how come they haven't continued to do that? Right Why don't they know what once because people bought in and realized that it was bullshit and people realized that they were doing that for the future history books Okay, so The only reason we knew that is because of the internet and the ability to translate information amongst each other so quickly What would it how hard would it be for these same people to lie to us about history with no internet? So that's what I go to think about I go to think about like okay If we were lied to About this and the only reason we know that these were lies is because the internet existed How many lies have we been told about human history over the course of our lives where there was no ability to whistleblow or tell the truth or or any of these things the difference Dude, that's what I'm saying and so we have to we as people Have to be willing and open to have discussions about things that may not be Exactly the way that we were taught and that's just reality, dude We have to be smart enough to do that because in my opinion, brother I think they intentionally lie to us about a lot of things to keep us suppressed I think humans are so much more capable of things that nobody knows but they know And we're not told of our own capabilities are taught of our own capabilities Because it makes us very fucking hard to control and very hard to rule over And I don't know about this called the giver About what I'm talking about. Yeah, it's very it's very similarly It's like this, you know utopia society and but like the truth of history is only kept by one person Yeah, throughout the fuck he passes down to a selected person that's you know, that's all I'm saying It's like dude, we are we have to be careful To buy into stories that are told That we have no ability to corroborate Scientifically and we have to look at anthropology and these guys who go out and do this work that can historically verify What actually happened There's a lot of anthropologists who go out and they say well My evidence shows different than what history's told and then they're made into You know goofballs right the crazy people right. Oh, no, listen to that guy. He's insane. Oh, he's a he's a this guy or he's a Conspiracy you see what you say yeah and dude that's We're past that a built like these people's ability to do that level of gaslighting and information manipulation about humans I believe we are past that and the next phase is going to be okay Well, we realized that they were lying what actually happened and for us to get to that phase We all have to put aside our emotional reactions to certain things and say Okay, um, what actually happened and what's the evidence and how did this go down and there's a number of Over the course of you know the last fucking 12,000 years that that are just straight up Bullshit, yeah, yeah, that's a dangerous thing with this you know before we get on to our head rest of our headlines It's a dangerous thing with that right because you know we sit here today in 2024 And we can see their obvious lies and how they don't care about lying and we see them You know simultaneously writing the history books and we know what the truth is that's happening right now. Yeah What do you think they plan to do with us that know the truth Remove you from see you know I'm saying I get a very dangerous game That's what communism has done. Yeah listen man When you really died into what communism is and what they've done And they've done this over and over and over and over in the 1900s bro communism kill more people than any other cause It killed more people than wars it killed more people than pandemics They killed more people than fucking anything it killed the most people Why did it kill so many people because they were trying to instill a new system of operating that doesn't work And the people who resisted they killed And dude, this is this is You you can see this in the language that they use when The emotions get ramped up right like during covid when everybody was pissed at each other They started in with the real fucking aggressive language like like true. No did what are we gonna do with these people They're a danger society like Biden did Words suffering from a pandemic of the unvaccinated these are irresponsible people they have to be exiled from society You see what I'm saying? Where do you think that next step is and people say well you're you're speculating Well, yeah, this is a speculative show But it's also Lurgical deduction of what the next step would be the net so if they're gonna put you to camp you think there's gonna let you live in the camp Right no, they're gonna eventually fucking let you starve or kill you because they don't want to deal with you They don't want to pay for you. They don't want to operate with you They don't want your ideas to infect the rest of the people which is the main reason why they remove these people from society so You know what's going on in the world is much more dangerous than people think and for us to truly get past it Not only we're gonna have to have people that are willing to stand up and ask the right questions and tell the truth We're gonna have to be open to hearing that and examining that and saying man Fuck they lie to us, right? Yeah for sure man And we got some shit to cover today though On this topic man, so let's let's get into these headlines guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos Go to Andy for seller.com guys can find all of that stuff link there So with that being said let's get into our first headline and on number one Uh, we have an election in less than 20 days Right, um, and we've been this is a very interesting topic. We've been covering it Throughout the last four years. Uh, we covered you know the 2020 elections and how We believe that was fucked and there's evidence out there to show when we've talked about how they're potentially gonna Do the same thing this time right? Um, and it's a very real probability This year right Um, I wanted let's go down to Georgia to start all right Georgia judge blocks ballot counting rule And says county officials must certify election results Um too much too late so a judge has blocked a new rule Um, the requires Georgia election day ballots to be counted by hand after the close Of voting the ruling came a day after the same judge ruled that county election officials Must certify election results by the deadline set in law which is the following day of the election by 5 p.m Local time Uh, the state election board last month passed the rule requiring that three poll workers each Count the paper ballots not the votes by hand After the polls close Uh, the county election board and cop county in a lenses suburbs had filed a lawsuit seeking to have a judge declare that rule and five others Recently passed by the state board invalid. Um, they were heavily supported by Guess who? Democrats. Um, saying they exceed the state board's authority Um, and they weren't adopted in compliance with the law and are unreasonable I'm in a ruling late Tuesday fault in counties a period court judge Robert McBernie wrote that the so-called hand count rule quote is too much too late and blocked its enforcement while he considers the merits of the case now Uh, so no surprise the Harris campaign is uh celebrating they're happy about that vice president Kamala Harris's campaign is celebrating after a Georgia judge temporarily blocked a rule that would have enforced Election officials to hand count ballots after they have been machine tabulated quote from the beginning this rule Was an effort to delay election results to sow doubt in the outcome and our democracy is stronger Thanks to this decision to block it a joint statement to several media outlets read now. It's interesting Because all over the other the country there's been you know these pressers that have been coming out from these Election boards saying that hey, you know, it might take some days to process these uh, these votes But don't worry that you know has nothing to do with election you know integrity and you know your votes are safe And so it's interesting that this comes out and they're saying that You know them trying to hand count this and make sure that the votes and the ballots more importantly are real They're saying that that was an effort to delay the it's just it's weird. It's weird. It's weird uh, it's weird talk And like we know it's not weird what why why Would anyone Want to not get an accurate count of the ballots Why it's very simple answer me that question why would anyone Not want an accurate count of the ballots on time no answer me that question So they want to cheat no shit and everybody knows it and that nobody wants to say it and I think it's pretty fucked up that We have people in this country that legitimately don't believe in America and these are the same people that cry about democracy and talk about democracy and They aren't willing to accept any other outcome than the one that they want And they will cheat they will lie they will steal they will undermine their fellow citizen and say what you want is not important what I want is more important even if There are more people that want that idea and that is fundamentally un-American and it doesn't go along with what this country is about And quite honestly in my opinion people that think that should not be allowed to live in America because that is not What we are about we are not about cheating We are not about stealing we are not about Getting our way at all costs. This is supposed to be a compromised community This is suppose and so dude what's happening here Is very simply people think that their opinion is more important than everybody else's opinion Okay, what does that say that they think about us They do not think that the other side is worthy of having a say in the direction of the country Okay, but these are the same people that cannot be found in Eastern Tennessee or Florida or anywhere that citizens are required to come together To help other citizens these same people Are nowhere to be found anywhere when hardship needs to be handled by American citizens So why are we the American citizens that handle all the hard shit tolerating this from the actually physically and emotionally and mentally weakest people on the planet and Quite honestly the most evil people on the planet because they are and I don't say they're evil I don't just throw that word around but no They think you and I and everyone like us is shit and they think they are above us And in that case that makes me think they're evil. Okay, and I could go on and on and on and on But at the end of the day, why are we tolerating it? Yeah, it makes no sense man. It makes no sense and we've been covering this guys like we've been covering You know the policies and these rule changes that you know have you know the the bills that have been trying to get passed through to secure our elections We've been covering how you know the left these liberals time and time again do everything they can it's not liberals bro It's left us left it's a different thing far left progressives like bro I'm a fucking liberal like I'll give a shit if gay people get married. I want everybody to have the same rights I want everybody to have the same opportunities. I don't care what fucking race you are. That's liberal. Yeah, okay I think that people should be able to choose whether or not you know what they believe and I don't think religion needs to be In government right there's a lot of things I disagree with with the conservative side But the left has gotten so communist that they're impossible to tolerate or yeah or reason with or anything and so I think most people feel that way. I think most people right now Almost feel politically homeless and they are hoping that Trump is who he says he is and we'll come in and clean the shit up Yeah, you know, but like dude, you know He had a chance to do that. He didn't do it So it makes me wonder like What's gonna happen? I mean, I think we all know who I'm voting for and who we're voting for here uh but You know We're gonna have to see some execution bro like we're gonna have to see some shit change to match your action Yeah, man, but like you know, it's things like this that they keep coming out the the you know They're worried me right like this this head on here Arizona voters Registered with residents as a boashing clinic strip club high school Cardinals training center They have a shit ton of voters uh at least hundreds of voters and Arizona have commercial businesses listed as their residents on their voter registration forms The public interest legal foundation or Piala P I O F reveals those businesses include a boashing clinic strip club a high school and the Arizona Cardinals training facility Not just in Arizona and Nevada is well where people have listed strip clubs casinos airports and smoke shops Who are these people Because you know you're supposed to be listening your home address to make sure that you know who are these people? I would bet they're probably illegal migrants It'd be interesting to see right and then you know you keep seeing or Dead relatives or dead relatives. Yeah, it's possible Um, but you know, or the same person registering 10 different times possible But my point is is what I was saying earlier, bro is like how fucked up is that like I would never think in my whole life to go register 20 times and vote 20 times like I believe in this country dude Like I believe that we should all have a fucking vote for these people are doing that I know that but like dude if we need to stop and truly think about how fucked up that really is Like that is those people should go to prison here. Yeah, it's treason. Yeah, it's treason And but you know, and then you see other things like Biden Uh, this headline says Biden says the quiet part out loud admits his DOJ is working to jail Trump after the election Have you seen this? No, yeah, listen to this same guy Was through the major cases waiting for many loses and by the way 34 felonies So far he had to get sentenced he got the sentence kicked back but I want to watch that sentence Well Donald Trump's not run if he was running for himself Think he's running out of jail How could you say he's running for himself when this guy was Literally one of the biggest icons in the whole planet one of the most recognizable men on the whole planet The extremely wealthy in the highest circles with the the most recognizable names and faces as friends He's got houses and apartments. He flies around on a full-sized airliner And he has for a long time So how can you say that this dude is all about himself when he gives up all of that to come do this at the end of his life On top of the assassination of Jim's and still goes the average person cannot comprehend What that's like like you don't know what it's like to be able to just fly anywhere you want whenever you want You don't know what it's like to have three or four houses and drive any car you want and do anything you want it any Fucking time they have no idea and he gave all that up, bro And I'm gonna tell you I've had enough of a taste of that life in my life to know that it would take a lot for me to give it up It's pretty good especially when you built it Okay, and that dude's 10 million times down the road than I am So I don't understand how anybody can look at Donald Trump regardless of what you think of him And say he's in it for himself. Yeah, there's it's just not a real statement. No No, man, but um You know and I think another part too with all of this you have to be very very uh Very cautious and very aware of the language that these people use when they use it But more importantly the the steps that are being done in the dark. Okay. I'd like you to introduce you guys To mark Esper Okay, um, he was a uh, he was the the Pentagon chief under Trump Okay, uh, when Trump was in office And uh, he just went on a uh, a CNN interview Um, and he said Uh, take Trump Trump's words seriously He will try to use military on citizens Okay, and he won't see an end let's let's let's listen to this interview real quick Well, I just think about what you wrote in your book and that during the George Floyd marches and protest in 2020 He asked about shooting protesters and as you wrote you said you quoted him saying can't you just shoot them Just shoot them in the legs or something and so when he's saying that the enemy from within should potentially be handled by the national guard And if necessary the US military do you fear that he would try to to utilize the national guard the military against US citizens Uh, yes, I do of course because I lived through that and I saw over the summer of 2020 where uh, President Trump and those around him wanted to use the the national guard and various capacities and cities such as Chicago and Portland and Seattle and of course there was a moment in time as you just described where he uh On that early date in june where he wanted to bring an active duty military as well So that's what equally concerns me about his comment would be the use of the military in these types of things now The good news is I don't believe he has the authority under the law to use the military Unless there was some type of civil civil disobedience or insurrection in which case that would be used to the insurrection act But otherwise these other roles that he's described in the past are law enforcement and that is prescribed under the Posse Committata sacks so he would not be able to use it now I'm not a lawyer But this would be a good discussion to have but my sense is his inclination is to use the military and in these situations Whereas my view is it that's a bad role for the military. It should only be long. It should only be law enforcement taking those actions That's very interesting. Well, I'm gonna say this. I want it before you get in. Mm-hmm She Is sitting here trying to paint this picture that Trump wants to go Handle the enemy from within as if we're talking about the people that we're protesting during George Floyd That's not what he's talking about. He's talking about you. Mm-hmm. He's talking about her He's talking about people who are willingly lying to the people and government officials who are subverting our entire country committing treason. Yes That's what he's talking about the enemy within. He's not talking They're trying to deflect it and scare the shit out of every single person that doesn't like Trump Trump is not trying to Shoot those people or prison those people. That's what they were trying to do during COVID Okay, we had we had Tim Walls Mr. Turdball Having his own police force shoot paintballs at their own citizens to keep him in the house Okay, how long till paintballs turn into rubber bullets? And how long till rubber bullets turn into bullets? Trump didn't do that. Tim Walls did that Okay She Her and everybody else that acts like her who willingly goes on TV and Pushes this crazy shit those people are guilty, dude. They're guilty of treason I mean, you know what yeah, and and that's why they'd work so hard to do this There's a very important thing man And there this is a common thread that we see all the time that These this fucking deep stake ball would everyone to call them that they do right? It's like I know you are But what am I right and they they They tried to guilt trip people into you know, oh, he's gonna do this You know and blaming the other side for doing all of the shit that they are actually doing. That's a communist tactic Right. Yeah. Well, let's let's expose some of that. Okay. This is very very important and all of you guys listening and watching Please pay very very close attention to this next portion Because it's extremely important all right now just a little side note on mr. Esper here Like I said, he was the the former defense secretary um and He also is quoted saying that you know trumps a threat to democracy. That's a common occurrence common, you know Catch phrase at these people like to use Let's go to the dod. Okay, Department of Defense Um, here's a screenshot of the website. I spent literally a couple of hours diving into this uh and making sure That we have all the facts right um and it's very very important Um, this is the Department of Defense. Okay, the senior intelligence oversight official Uh, this is the an official website of the United States government. Okay, and we're gonna pay very very very close attention to this Uh, dod directive. Okay, the dod directive is uh directive five two four zero point zero one Okay, which is the dod intelligence and intelligence related activities and defense intelligence component assistance to law enforcement agencies and other civil authorities Now this was updated uh September 27th of 2024 have it right there All right, and this was approved by Kathleen H. Hicks who is the deputy Secretary of Defense under uh defense secretary Lloyd Austin uh this lady right here. Okay, um and To no surprise she was put in in 2021 under the Biden administration. She's a registered Democrat Um, and she's been in office since 21 now I read through this uh this dod directive. Okay, again, it was amended and they knew uh they they called it a reissue It was reissued on September 27th of this year All right, and there's a very important piece in this new directive Which is that third bullet point there, okay, which reads assigns responsibilities and provides guidelines for defense intelligence component intelligence assistance to law enforcement agencies and other civil authorities All right, now it goes on. It's a it's a pretty big document. We'll link it here for you guys But we're gonna pull the very very important pieces here, okay? um And three dot three it talks about levels of authority Okay, and it says that uh the DIC may provide personnel to assist a federal department or agency Including a federal law enforcement agency or a state or a local law enforcement agency When lives are in danger In response to a request for such assistance and accordance with the following approval authorities Saying that it must first go through the defense and the secretary of defense for approval All right And I want you guys to pay very very close attention to that sub point C Okay, so a point C reads Assistance in responding with assets with potential for lethality Or any situation in which it is reasonably foreseeable That providing the requested assistance may involve the use of force That is likely to result in lethal force including death or serious bodily injury It also includes all support to civilian law enforcement officials and situations where a confrontation Between civilian law enforcement and civilian individuals or groups is reasonably anticipated Such use of force must be in accordance with dod directive 521 0.56 Potentially as further restricted based on the specifics of their requested support What this just did was gave our military The complete authority under this defense secretary to use lethal force on American citizens while they're on TV saying Donald Trump's going to do that now. It's very very interesting. Okay, because like I spent hours literally just on this one subject here Um, and I found this other directive Okay, this other directive that came out. This is the same directive before it was amended Okay, before the reissuance in September 27 Okay, um, and this had a very interesting Update the last update to this directive the date you guys can see right here was March 19th 2018 Okay, who's who's in press who's the president During that time Trump right Now we talk about you know, Trump being this evil dictator right It's it's interesting because you know in this directive There was a change and Trump is the one that put the change in through his defense secretary Um, where he clearly stated And it was put in that no lethal force was included That yes military can go assist law enforcement local state and federal For you know these massive National events, but no I mean, here's the the direct policy there um, and so we're looking at section four there It's pretty much the same thing But it does not give the military The authorization to use force especially deadly force So point C uh point C is the same as point four here and you can see the difference. So this is Trump's version All right point four there And they added in the use of force This administration added in the use of force all right now And as you can see that change was made again March 19th of 2018 Now I've been looking all over and you know seeing seeing a bunch of things on this and like you know What people say all over you know no president can use the military on its people. Man, that's not true Right um, and we're gonna circle back to mr. Mark Espriser because he plays a very very key role in this piece that I found Obviously, we got war powers resolution. There's a bunch of acts that were put in by congress That limited the scope of what the president can do with the military right And there's this very important phrase called posse comatitis, okay, which was an act that was put in Um and what posse comatitis basically does is that's the the the law that bars federal troops For participating in civilian law enforcement, okay unless it's authorized by law, right? um And it's a very old term All right, the it was actually passed back in 1878. It's been around for a long time and and guess who put it in Democrats Democrats put it in and they put that in specifically to stop the president from keeping Uh, you're using the military during the June Crow error Right uh, that's what it was put in for now. The work is very very interesting here. Please stay with me All right, the weak points of posse comatitis And they note that it was events in 2020 and in 2021 that highlighted two loopholes of the posse comatitis act Um, the first involves the DC National Guard where you know, it's not really considered a state Um, and it's typically always under presidential control And they refer to 2021 what happened to 2021 the January 6th thing right That was yeah, right And it's funny because Trump tried to get them to use the DC National Guard to assist in a civilian law enforcement situation And it was denied. Yep It was denied the request was denied by the Department of Defense Guess by who the same fucking guy that is saying That Trump's gonna use it on America. Yeah, it's guys full shit So they they re-change this directive which just gave permission for our American military to be used on American citizens and use lethal force And they're still trying to say that it's the other side Yeah, dude, we're not gonna miss man. I got that Believe that what I've been saying this entire time. They're not gonna allow Trump regardless of the election results to peacefully assume power in the United States And I believe that they're preparing to do whatever they have to do to make that a reality doesn't matter what and I think there are no limits to what they are willing to do To make that happen. I just don't civil unrest. I think they're going to cause and yeah, and I think If I I mean look If they steal it again and this many more people are voting for Trump everybody's gonna know that they stole it And it's not this this Thing that they call an insurrection in 2021 Is is going to look like a fucking you know Boy Scout troop meeting compared to what people are gonna do if they just rip it off right in front of people You know this worked in Brazil this worked in Venice, Waila this worked in other places. You know why because they don't have any guns. Okay, so It they're setting up for violence between our government and our citizens and Then they're going on the news and saying that Trump's going to do this violence when they are clearly preparing to do it themselves And there's gonna be people that believe them which is really screwed up so Yeah, man, I I sent that to some of my buddies who were senators and they put an official dod request for explanation So maybe we'll have more information soon, but I think it's very clear why they would do that there wouldn't be a reason they would do that if they weren't planning on some sort of Something yeah, you know Since wild man, listen dude, you know many Democrats have come out and open and said dude I'm vote for Trump I voted for Biden last time vote for Trump a lot Should turn a lot and they're not gonna be able to like fudge it this time like the the vagus odds as of this morning were almost it was 60 something percent to 40% for Kamala so there's a there's a huge swing there that I mean people know like people are they're not going to be able to fudge that and if they if they can't I think they're just gonna say well fuck off. What are you gonna do and we're gonna have decisions to make at the local police level at the state level at the national guard level and You know, there's gonna be decisions made as soldiers of what side you're going to take and what orders you're going to follow because um You know these people took an oath to protect this country from enemies both foreign and domestic and I think it's very clear that we have a group of domestic enemies uh And there's gonna be some hard decisions that are gonna have to be made my opinion Yeah, man That yeah guys Jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think like say we'll link all of this stuff here before you guys It's all there. I saw this first on Twitter and like all that's bullshit and then buddy of mine hit me up and like point Like hey, you see this. Yeah, I'm like, I don't know. Is it real? Is I've been getting it? I've been getting it from I got it from two guys that I know that were x CIA guys.

We'll say that and we appreciate you for being real ass fans Uh, without being so let's keep this cruise moving ahead line number two Uh, Kamala She went on uh Charlemagne the gods podcast. Oh see that yeah completely uh doesn't she pay Charlemagne Isn't he like an influencer for them? He is he seems like he is. I don't know if it actually seems like it I mean he tried to call it out, but I mean it didn't even end right. Let's talk about how it ended They ended by cutting her off rambling and it just fucking cut I guess how it ended yeah, he probably realized how bad she was doing. He's like oh shit Well, it was weird because like you know, I mean we've seen clips of Charlemagne, you know In a race, but they didn't allow the the actual video to be shown Right, so they kept it just audio. It was weird But this is how the show ended check this out historically black majority population or VR SM HD1 That was it All right, we've been listening for almost an hour long Town hall and audio town hall. We're hosted by Charlemagne. That is weird Now it's weird. Um, now we know they both don't do Kamala doesn't do good neither does her President who she's uh kicked off through the coup because uh, you know that comment about Trump getting sentenced Wasn't the only dumb shit that he had to say Uh, yesterday either. I mean talked about the debate. Joe Biden says uh Kamala beat Trump quote So badly in the debate he scared to death to beat her again You know what he say it dude. Check this out She beat Trump so badly in the debate. He scared to death to beat her again That's a fact tough guy right tough guy. He hasn't even know he said it Dude Listen man listen we can laugh and shit It's not funny. Listen, they're gonna try to steal this bro They're gonna try to say that more people in this country want them than want Fucking Trump. There's no fucking way bro. There's no way man. I'm not there's no way look around Dude even the old Democrats are like fuck these people, bro. It's not possible. Yeah. Now I gotta give Charlemagne Like no one one tibet of credit. He did call her out on a couple of things Um, and one of those things that he called her out on was the border situation Um, he also called out for trying to filibuster one of his questions that he asked Um, radio host Charlemagne the guy Called out vice president Kamala Harris for her filibuster Of a listener's question on reparations and pressed her on doing quote a lot of things wrong at the border And they highly anticipated town hall focused on her appeal to black voters Um, now I want to get to the clip about uh the border situation Um, because this is how that conversation went down But there's nothing to buy the minister should have to take some blame for the border though a lot of them blame Because I mean the first three years y'all did get a lot of things wrong with the border no Charlemagne Within hours of being inaugurated the first bill we passed before we did the inflation reduction act before we did The bipartisan infrastructure act before we did the the the safer communities act to deal with gun violence First thing we dropped Was a bill to fix the broken immigration system Which wasn't broken Which wasn't broken at all All right, I'm in his interest because again like and we've said this before countless of times like people don't start seeing change and you know Start caring about shit until it starts affecting them right um and the border is definitely starting to affect more and more Americans We've talked about you know Aurora Colorado when we talked about Chicago now it's in fucking Texas Evil super gang ceases for apartment complexes in major Texas city and new terrifying show of strength. It's just a handful though, right Just a handful A dangerous Venezuelan gang has taken over at least for apartment complexes in San Antonio, Texas as it expands It's reached and yet another America city a dailymail.com can reveal dub the epitome of evil trend derringa Or a TDA is known to run drug smuggling child prostitution and human trafficking rings in South America With its members crossing over into the US in recent years amid a wave of Venezuelan migrants The tattooed mobsters have since unleashed a wave of crime across the country from Miami and Texas to Denver and New York The gang's activities in the American cities are back in the spotlight after ABC news Martha Raditz claimed The instances of gang members present in the apartment complexes was limited to a handful of complexes in Aurora, Colorado Just last week a small army of police officers rated an apartment complex in San Antonio and arrested 19 individuals including four gang members Um and they've been running ramp it now She lied in Charlamean. We know the like we know they lie right and they lie about fucking everything I'm gonna remind him me of this time not too long ago Where Kamala Harris released this uh the statement About record declines and crime Right and in this statement that she released she says today's new data submitted to the FBI Confirms that are dedicated efforts and collaborative partnerships with law enforcement are working Americans are safer now than when we took office last year We saw the largest ever one year decrease in the homicide rate which now stands 16% below its 2020 level Huh violent crime is at a near 50 year low. Our progress is continuing this year Uh and builds on substantial decreases during the previous years of our administration You would have to you would have to be a complete moron to believe that dude like we what are you gonna go outside and look at our things and then say that's not happening It's happening Do you have the do you have the information? Oh, of course we got good because the FBI just had to update their fucking information with no fucking Press release for statement letting people know they had to update it. Yeah, which is what they've done the entire time Did it with jobs they did it they did it with crime they do it with immigration They'd say oh we have one million no and then they come back six months like oh actually it was 10 and then don't say anything about it Yeah Listen to these people are destroying the country intentionally and they're misleading you to get you to believe it's not happening And then if you see it and you pointed out you're crazy That's coming to shit So let's dive into this. This is an article um by real clear investigations. He's the one that uh this man by the name of John lot John lot junior is the one who uh, I mean we've talked about this show. We know Trump alluded to it But here we have the actual facts now right it's not just speculation Um because again anybody can look outside and see its bullshit, but here's the numbers. Here's the truth All right when the FBI originally released the final crime data for 2022 in September of 2023 It reported that the nation's violent crime rate failed by 2.1 percent This quickly became and remains a democratic party talking point to counter Donald Trump's claims of storing crime But the FBI Has quietly revised those numbers releasing new data that shows violent crime increased in 2022 by 4.5 percent Almost twice as much The new data includes thousands more murders rapes robberies and aggravated assaults the bureau which has been at the center of partisan storms Made no mention of these revisions in his September 2024 press release our c.i I discovered the change through a cryptic reference on the FBI's website that states quote The 2022 violent crime rate has been updated for inclusion in c.i.us 2023 But there is no mention that the numbers increased One only sees the change by downloading the FBI's new crime data and comparing it to the file release last year So one of the actual numbers so they're being intentionally deceptive about showing the numbers Also, I don't believe that these numbers include any of the crime committed by illegal migrants none of them. Yeah, none So what are the actual numbers the actual changes in crime are extensive the updated data for 2022 report that there were 80,000 more violent crimes than in 2021 there were an additional almost 1700 murders 7800 rapes 33,000 more robberies and 37,000 more aggravated assaults question naturally rises should the FBI's 2023 numbers be believed absolutely not So this is the change. I mean, even just the property crime It was off. This is 20 21 and 2022 They're not even showing you 23 and 24 which has progressively gotten worse So that statement that they're saying about crime is at a 50 year low that is complete and utter bullshit and they know it's bullshit You know, and when you look at comparing what they released By what the actual numbers is for so for example This is comparing Violent crime, okay, if you look at 2021 the FBI stated The violent crime Was down 6.6 percent when in reality was actually up 13 percent I'm in 2022 FBI stated that crime violent crime only rose 4.5 percent when in reality The rose almost 30. Yeah 29.3 percent You know that's 30% These people are fucking Maya now my question is in 2023 they said it was down 3 and half percent when it's actually up 4.1 percent for a swing of a 7 percent that's on top of what the crime rates were in 21 and 22 so we saw the biggest increase in 22 and then we saw another 4.1 percent on top of that in 23 Allegedly without correction. What do you think's happening in 2024? Okay, so them saying You're imagining it crime is under control violent crime is down All these things that those are complete Lies that are being made Intentionally to get people to believe something that they can very clearly see isn't the case when they go in their cities And they go in their neighborhoods and they go out in public, okay? So these people again are willing to lie Cheat and steal to maintain power over you and when you consider what they've done over the last four years Do you think they're gonna change that in the next four or do you think they're going to accelerate that work These people are not incompetent. They are intelligent. They are not stupid They play stupid which makes us stupid for believing it at all I mean, I don't believe it, but there's people out there that do There's good people out there to believe it too And so like we have to get to the point where we understand how much they're willing to do to see the American people to get the Resolutions they're looking to have yeah, because I mean look at what this causes right like oh, you have to look at the point What's the motive behind all of this if they can put the American people in the state of fear and the state of chaos Then they can control us and whatever the hell they want they did it with COVID you know Case counts like how many people are dying the videos people falling out in the street And now in this situation with just the crime in general man like it has so many negative effects on the community But then they a lot of us say that it's not happening So we don't believe the things that know are the results of these things and we can blame it on other stuff For example like when we cover in Chicago right like they they don't promise Prosecutive violent crime and all these store robberies and then those businesses start losing money They leave the area and they can come in and install communist fucking grocery stores Right like there's so many other things that they try to They try to gain by doing shit like this and they just want you to believe that it's all make believe and it does not happen It's complete bullshit man Yeah Complete bullshit guys let's get to our third and final headline headline number three I thought this was interesting the game would like to call out hypocrisy here I just thought this was funny. Let's check this headline out The headline reads many schools are still closed weeks After hurricane lane teachers worry about long-term impact That's funny so we closed the schools for two years And you ain't worried about long-term impact but you're you're now you're worried It's been just a couple of weeks I got it bro it pisses me off man It's so crazy. Let's let's dive into this tens of thousands of students in the southeast Are dealing with school disruptions after hurricane lane rict havoc so severe On homes campuses and municipal power and water systems that some districts have no idea when they will reopen While virtual learning helped during COVID-19 school closures That has not been an option for the crisis because internet and cell phone service has remained spotty since the storm struck in late September It hard hit western North Carolina some districts one students will miss up to a month of school Another say that they can't yet determine a timeline for returning to classrooms quote I feel like a month is a lot But it's not something that can't be overcome said merissa Coleman who has sent her four children to stay with grandparents in Texas Because their home in North Carolina is Buncombe County has no running water quote But if we get further into things giving and Christmas, it's like how are they actually going to make this up? And mountainous Buncombe County lane swept away homes cut power and destroyed crucial parts of the water system for ashville city of about 94,000 people the storm decimated remote towns and killed at least 246 people throughout the Appalachians where massive cleanup efforts have been complicated by washed out bridges and roads There's the deadliest hurricane to hit the United States mainland since Katrina in 2005 The Buncombe County school system which serves over 22,000 students told families on Tuesday on the district's Facebook page No decision has been made quote with regards to start date or length of day Because of a need to repair buildings restore phone and security systems and redraw bus routes Even when schools reopen educators worry the disruption would have profound effects on students learning an emotional well-being Let's hear point Andy. That's that's a very interesting concern One that did not exist. Well, I think it's a I think this is a real concern Okay, having your kids out of school for a few months is a big deal. So I'm not upset that You know they're concerned about that, but were we not concerned about that earlier? Or were we playing up Political ideology at the expense of our own kids and we knew that we were doing that because now we say oh my god, they're gonna miss a month So you're willing you're willing to throw kids under the bus for your own beliefs and your own car In your own fear mongering But now it's different Now I'm not saying it's the parents doing that. No, it's not the parents. Where did this school? Where did this school? What did they do during the pandemic right? You know the part I don't know what they did. Yeah, but I'm just asking you know Maybe these people out here in North Carolina they got common sense and they understand that this is wrong Well, I mean the statistics show that for over a year 60% of us schools We're fully virtual 20% were operating a traditional in-person schedule and 20% were completely closed or hybrid um And so you know But the part that pisses me off about even just that. I mean we go back to the covid shit. We now know And experts are saying that the extended closures it did little to stop the spread of covid It didn't do shit keeping these kids out of schools It didn't do anything right That's the part the pisses me off the most and we knew that then they knew that when they pull this yeah, bro Yeah, you know, like when we talking about like the importance of kids to just be around other fucking kids Like there's an emotional like societal need that has to be met to accomplish that yeah, you remove that bro And we wonder why we got so many kids at a socially awkward right now or Two years behind in school or thinking that they're having behavior problems exact or thinking they're girls When they're boys. Yeah, thinking they're fucking cats and one fucking yeah Litter fucking things. Yeah, it's the worst. It's the biggest failure of our children collectively that America has ever had Period and out this isn't an attack on these people. I understand these people like they they're not well How they go to school when they're too busy trying to collect bodies and Opened town and you know like you can't Do that you can't do virtual school with no internet and this is not a shot at the people out in North Carolina or Asheville But it is interesting how we didn't have any of this dialogue when that was going on really from anybody right Everybody just went along with it. Yeah, well, I'm saying like the AP news you guys put this article out But you guys were one of the biggest proponents pushing this fucking close down nonsense right you know I'm saying but now you want to write articles saying you concerned about the kids. Yeah, it's bullshit. Yeah, it's bullshit It's fucking bullshit. There's one of the point that out man. I thought that was it Yeah, it's just whatever's convenient at the time to create the most amount of uh You know emotional Connection to them being quote unquote Good sources and good people that care about us. They don't care about us dude They don't give a fuck about those people's kids No, it's emotional clickbait Yeah, man guys jumping on this conversation.

They found that analysis comparing the pitch of Straight and homosexual men's voices found key differences in how they speak mr. Moth it explained quote Results find that gay men speak with higher pitch variation meaning that they're range from low to high is much more extreme than straight men Mr. Brown added gay men were also found to have longer vile durations for a I and you They hold these viles longer in general when they speak compared to straight men One interesting aspect of these pitch Analysis was the results weren't language specific And were replicated across english french and dutch So gay is universal It's universal to western language.

Yeah, hey, listen, listen, breaking, breaking, groundbreaking shit. What do you got me? I'm not surprised. I'm glad that they have their own language. It's not a thing. Yeah. It makes me happy. It's funny. Like it's some funny shit. It's not funny. It's not funny. It's funny. Like it's funny when these dudes get all worked up and they start talking like that. It makes me laugh. They say it was because they thought it was theories around their testosterone level. Well, that's probably the atrazine in the water, bro. Probably what it is. Too much atrazine. Yeah. I don't mind gay voice. I don't mind gay face. But I'll tell you what I do mine. What do you mind? Vocal fry. What's that? Do you know what vocal fry is? It's where girls talk. Like this energy drink, it's just so good. It's vocal fry. It's fucking terrible. Is that like valley part? I don't know what it is, but people do it and it's horrible. Men do that too. It's horrible. Men do that too. Use your mother fucking voice, dude. Speak it from here. Yeah. Oh. Hi, how are you doing today? Oh. And you wonder why you're fucking broke, bro. Nobody wants to hear that shit. You know how men do it? They'll speak like this. What I'm going to do today, you know, guys. Yeah. What's up, dude? No, not much. Not much. Yes, it's true. Yeah. You know what's crazy? How many people don't even know they have an amazing voice? Because they do that stupid shit thing and it's cool. Like your voice should come from here. Should come from your diaphragm. It doesn't come from your fucking throat. Yeah. Okay. Let's just say it with a full chest, dude. That goes for men and women, bro. Like, a lot of you guys have amazing voices that you're ruined with this shit trying to be cool. I cannot stand vocal fry. It is the worst. When people start talking like that, I walk the fuck away. I do, bro. I can't even, I cannot, like, dude, like gave voice. That shit's funny, dude. Like, look, man, it's cool. It's like, all right. Like, no, yeah, I do. What's wrong with that? It's funny. No, I would know. It's fine. It does not bother me as what I'm saying. Right. It does not bother me. Like, I've known this my whole life. Like, gay people talk a little different. Yeah, that's been the thing before internet. Yeah, but it's only gay dudes. You don't see gay girls talking like that. Oh, fuck that. Yeah, that's weird. But you do see some gay girls talking like. Hey, bro. Yeah. Check out my Subaru. It's all good, man. Listen, dude, I don't give a fuck how someone talks as long as they don't do that vocal fry shit. Yeah. God, that shit's annoying. No, that's real, man. The first thing I think of when I hear someone talking like that is like, what is the person who's married to them? How do they do it? Oh, we're not married. Yeah. They can't find a mate, bro. These are the people out here screaming about how no one wants to date them. No shit. Like we need to make our own shit. You know what's weird, bro? It's the amount of people in the world. And this is men and women. And they're like, nobody wants to date me. Well, have you looked at your shit? Like, have you looked in the fucking mirror? I'm not talking about your looks either. I'm talking about your whole life. Like, you're not in shape. You're not taking care of yourself. You're not eating right. You're not working out. You're not having anything going on your, financially for your, you know, you're, you're, like, you don't have nothing going on, bro. Not even trying. And you wonder why nobody wants to date you. Nobody wants to date you because there's people out there that try hard. And we want to date those people like, dude. It's pretty simple. It's such an entitlement mentality. It's like, if you want good, you got to be good. If you want great, you got to be great. It's real simple, man. Like, you got to become the kind of person that that person that you want to date wants to date. And just because they don't want to date you, because you don't have your shit together, doesn't say anything about them. It says everything about you. Like, that's a major problem in society these days. I see it everywhere. I see all these girls and all these dudes talking all these shit about how there's no good men and there's no good women. And then you look at them and it's like, well, yeah, those people don't want to date you, bro. Like, I don't know how to tell you this. You don't have nothing going on. Like, build something out of yourself, become that kind of person those people want to date and they want to date you. It's not magic, bro. I think Alex just has like a weird fetish or kink or some shit. Well, I mean, listen, I was 350 when I met Emily. She's chubby chaser. There's no fucking doubt, bro. I'm over here trying to get in shape and she's like, I made this amazing thing. Like, what the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Yeah, I don't know. I got some snacks. I love snacks. Yeah. I mean, I got a lot of discipline, but fuck dude. Snacks are snacks. Snacks are snacks, man. Anyway, yeah, sweet man. All right. Well, good job for that groundbreaking study, man. That's awesome shit. Yeah, and quit that vocal fry shit. Yeah, man. And if you're gonna be a gay voice, do it right. Be loud and proud. You ever heard how I got voice, my first voice coach was gay? No. Yeah, I never told you this story. You heard this story, right? Bear, big bear. So dude, back in the day, this is a good story. This is what we're sharing. Especially since all of you now are podcasters, then you all have a microphone in front of all your content. I'm gonna help you out here, okay? Free lesson. When you speak, whatever you say into this, it comes out the other side, 20 notches down in terms of excitement, emotion, what you're trying to convey with the tone of your voice, turn it down 20 notches, and that's where people hear. So what you put in here, gets filtered out down 20 into their ears, okay? And the only reason I know this, and I would say a big reason of my success in audio, podcasting, and speaking comes from this lesson. When we were first starting in business, back in, in 1999, 2000, we occasionally would save up our money and we would try to run radio ads. I didn't have any money to pay anybody to do the voice work, so guess who had to do it? Not Chris, okay? I had to do it. I went in there and I went and cut a few of these commercials for like, you go in the station, you're standing from the microphone, you read a piece of paper, you know? And I'm like, hey guys, I'm Andy from Supplement Superstore. Like this is what we got, like, you know, just not knowing what the fuck I was doing. And then after like three or four of those, eventually I went in and there was this guy, his name was Bear, and I started to read the ad and he's like, hey, he's like, let me help you. You're gonna let me help you? And I'm like, yeah, for sure. And he's like, listen dude, and he told me what I just told you. He said, you gotta put your emotion into this microphone so that it comes out the other side and affects people. And he goes, look at me, I'm the biggest, gassed guy in the world, and you gotta be loud and proud and gay like me, right? Into the mic. Yeah, I swear to God, that's what he said. He was being dead serious, and he was legitimately trying to help me. You know what? It's a legitimate real lesson. Is it not, Joe? Joe has how many platinum audios? Three, okay? So three platinum albums, the best audio engineer I know right here in front of my face. And the second best audio engineer I ever knew was that guy, his name was Bear. I hope he's still kicking it and doing great because he taught me a lesson in 30 seconds that fucking legitimately affected my life in a major way and millions of other people's lives. That's awesome. So be loud and proud. And gay. That's legit what he said. I love it. And bro, so like you feel real weird, you know? And like you're, I'm like, oh man. And I fucking let loose and you know what? The commercial went good and we made some money and I learned and got better from there. And the guy, I'm just saying, and he had gay voice. That's awesome. So that's awesome, man. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you. Just a real lesson, man. Just a real life lesson. I thought I'd share it, came from a gay man. I love it. Yeah. That's it, man. You're the fucking man, bro. I love you, dude. Not like that. God, Sid. Bear. That's all I got. All right, guys. Don't be a hoe. Show the show.
