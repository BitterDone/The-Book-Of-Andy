You know what I'm saying? I'm just not. It is what it is. You know what? I'm not either. Yeah. Well, for me, it was a little... I had to share my birthday growing up. You know what I'm saying? Like, my older brother, he's eight years old. We have the same birthday. Oh, really? Yeah. So, like, growing up, it's like... It was whatever. You know what I'm saying? But I do have to shut out the wife. Because she got me a really awesome gift. I'm doing a one-on-one cooking experiment thing with... Tyler, the head chef, it's Mr. Tree. Oh, really? Yeah. He's gonna like... Tyler's the man. Bro, he's fucking awesome. You know what I'm saying? So, we're gonna do like a little fucking one-on-one cooking thing. You know what I'm saying? That's awesome. It's gonna be fucking sick, man. Dude, I love that restaurant, dude. It's so good. Yeah. It's so good. Like, I've never one time. Like, even the places I go... Mm-hmm. That I really like. But, occasionally, you know, you get something that's like... Not right. Yeah. I've never one time had that. I've never had a bad experience. I've gone there a thousand times. Yeah, I've never had a bad experience. So, it's the tree's the spot. Mm-hmm. But yeah, so I mean, it was awesome, though, man. It was cool. Yeah, dude. Tyler's the man. That's fucking cool. No, it was gonna be cool. Well, I got myself a cooking lesson as well. Gordon Ramsay. Oh, yeah. Yeah, just call me Tommy Topper. Being Gordon, you're gonna take our Ferraris. We're gonna cook peanut butter and jelly. Plus, it's up to the appesant. You know what I'm saying? Goddamn it. That's great. Yeah. That's cool. We're going through it. It's supposed to be a secret, but now that you, you know, you tried to one up me. This is new, have you ever? Yeah, that's what I'm doing. We're going to Gordon Ramsay's. Yeah, that's cool. And we're gonna fucking make PBJ's. Yeah, I'm good for you. I'm having him coach me. Yeah. Actually, I'm coaching him. Yeah, that's right. That's cool, man. I'm gonna yell at him. That would actually be sitcoms. Bro, next time he comes through St. Louis, I want to get him on a show, man. He's got a restaurant here. Yeah, he does. It's great. It's actually great. I've been there a few times. It's really good. It's really good. So what else you guys do? Yeah, that's it. That's it. That was literally it, man. I'm late back, bro. I'm cooling. You know what I'm saying? Would you eat? So I was going to tell you this. So because you know, we usually do the strips there. But I did, they're ribeye. Yeah. Fuck. I know. Fuck. I know. I gotta stay away from it. Bro, I know. Like, I'm usually a strip guy. Like, I like the strips, you know what I'm saying? And I'm like, I felt adventurous, you know what I'm saying? Juneteenth. It felt a little freedom, right? I'm like, I'm gonna be a little free. Break the chain. It's a normalcy. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. And I ordered that fuck, that ribeye, bro. Exactly how we order it, you know? It's fun to do. We do order the same orders. We do. Yeah, we do. I'll have what he's having. But it was fucking phenomenal. Absolutely phenomenal. Yeah. Those cans sound louder. They made these special just for me. So that it picks up on the microphone. Was that not loud? No, no. Because neither we have, you know, our Juneteenth cover. We had to make it louder, you know what I'm saying? Wait, we should have put the cloth on these. I know we don't run ads. But if I did, it would definitely be. This is good. That was good. I can't believe you got nice and cold too. I could see the frost. But if I did, it would definitely be for this, uh, form energy, screaming freedom. It's pretty good. This is my number one out of the. Is it another? Yeah, and it used to be orange. Mm-hmm. And the screaming was like, okay. Mm-hmm. I think that's my favorite one, dude. No. It tastes like a real melted bomb pop. Like for real. You could taste all the flavors. No, the bomb pop drink juice. Yeah. That's what it tastes like. Yeah. No, that's accurate. Yeah. And the orange is my second and then grape. Orange is second? Yeah. Do you like grape? Bro, everybody likes fucking grape. I know. I like the orange. Grape is fucking phenomenal. I'd say grape is one for me. And that's how I like, you know, yeah. Yeah. That's how it's out of my like, dude, DNA. This motherfucker tastes like a snow cone or something. I don't know what I don't like. Little tiger's blood in there. I don't know what it is. Yeah. But it's right. Yeah. Man, I feel free. Oh. Sick man. Yeah. Well guys, if you're still here, pay the fee. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we don't run ads. But if we did. Yeah. I think it's okay. I think it's fine. Yeah, I'm not getting a paycheck. That's fine. We're technically not still. Yeah. You know, it's not sponsored. So it's fine. It's fine. All organic. All right. So what's going on in the world today? We got a lot. We got a lot. And I thought, you know, to start the episode off, we do a little throwback session, throwback 60 seconds of liberal insanity. Oh, these are my favorite. You like these? Yeah, I do. You like these. Okay, here we go. Let's start it off right, man. You know, in honor of me turning 30, filling new pains and stuff, I found this video and I'm like, like, like, Andy would understand this. For sure. Let's check this out. Oh my God, my back again. And anybody got an aspirin. That's back. That's back. My friends call me a downer. Because I go to bed at a decent hour. Him, my invisible. Yeah.

It's a band called pause and effect. No, it's not. That's where we got it. Okay. Google the furry thing. It's real. I know it's real. Yeah. You want to hear a funny ass furry story, bro. Ask my brother. He's got a good one. No. No, no, no. We had to be able to fit them so. No. No, he didn't do it on the. Okay. No. It's just weird. What are you looking for? I want to know what the fuck the furry thing is about? What is it about? Yeah. I mean, because clearly, dude, listen. Let's give it a fair shot. What's it about? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I think. What's it about? Yeah. I'm not sure. I think you're a little bit. I'm not sure. The first one. It's not about the furious thing. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. A furry is someone who enjoys anthropomorphic animal characters, meaning animals with human-like qualities, such as the ability to talk or walk on two legs. Isn't it like a sex cult? What's it say? Doesn't say so. Google is furry a sex cult or put it in a chat GPT. I'm serious. There's some BDSM. No, bro, like dude, I'm telling you. They fuck each other with the costumes on his shirt. No, for sure. They're gonna hold for their stuff. No, the furry family. What is this called? Is that what it says? That's a lie. That's a lie, bro. That's a lie. Does it really say that? Does it really say that? Yeah. Oh, they got chat GPT cover for them. Covered it. Yeah, chat's a furry. Yeah, that's what it is. Where do you think the crowd looks like? I don't know, man. We ain't got a guess because I got a picture. Oh, man. Dude, you know it's sad. Here's what I see when I see this, dude. I see a bunch of very... Man. Look at the dude in the shi- Wait, wait, where's the shi- Keep your left, left, left. Oh, man. Yeah, see, he's, that's the new guy. Yeah. He's not entirely comfortable yet, you know what I'm saying? He's just happy to see, so to be there. Bro, they all look the same. Holy shit. Holy shit, dude. They all look the same. And I'm not... If you're not watching this, I'm being dead serious. That is correct. They look... Dude, they look like a family. Maybe they all... Dude, you ever seen the movie Slap Shot? Nope. You guys ever seen that? Handsome brothers? That's from the same... They look alike, bro. Oh, yeah. That's what it is. That's why they all look alike. They're from the same litter. Good observation. Dude, let me tell you something, man. Talk to me. Like this guy. Yeah. I'm gonna tell you something. I'm gonna tell you something. I'm gonna tell you something. I'm gonna tell you something. I'm gonna tell you something. That makes me sad. It really does. I'm all for whatever people... First of all, dude, what I see when I see this dude is just a bunch of people who are looking for like a community or something to do. That's a boring guy. That never fit in anywhere else. No way. You know? And it's like... They didn't get invited to the birthday parties. I don't know what it is. It's last for kickball. I feel bad for people. Like they're not well adjusted. You know what I mean? Like... I mean, if they're having fun, they're having fun. Whatever, dude. It seems like you're doing something. It's not hurting nobody. That's cool with me. But the vocals sound good. No. But nothing good at all. But uh... Bro, they look like the gay version of Bebuck and Rocksteady from the Teenage Nune Ninja Tour. Yeah, they do. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what that is. Well, I mean that guy on the right, he's from the YMCA with the Village People. Yeah. Okay. It's a decent stat. I don't know. Anyway. Yeah. And my miserable. Dude, you know what? Like, there's nothing worse than PC humor. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like when politically correct people try to tell jokes. I'd be funny. Yeah. Yeah. And it's just like the super generic sterile, like stupid ass shit. Yeah, for sure. It's most people. They do tell them a real joke and they're like, oh yeah. But yeah, they'll go home and watch fucking, you know, Richard Prior. Yeah, right. Uh, Chappelle or fucking Shane Gillis and be like, oh, this is great. Bro, you all watch a liar as in public. That shit's funny. Dude, I know this though. They do spend, they spend like bread on these costumes. Yeah. You might fucking tin grand a costume. No. Oh, yeah. Search it. What's the average cost of like a high quality furry costume? Bro, we got some mascot costumes. They weren't like that much money. Bro, not 10. Oh, it ranges a lot. Yeah. It's a big range. There's good better best. They were custom made. Yeah. I think they were like, well, you have one of these? I got two. No. Yeah. I got a bison in the eagle. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You wanted to see the best eagle picture of all time. Yeah. All right. You're going to put a little star or something. Oh, man. Yeah. I fucking told you. Yeah. That's what happens when you wear to eat. Maybe that's why people do it. Maybe that's the whole furry mystery right there. He was stuck in that costume, wouldn't he? Huh? You said it for like three minutes. I think that's Nate. Yeah. I think that's Tom Nate. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look at a bro, he's in a days. Yeah. Look. Maybe this is why the furry thing works. That's crazy. Yeah. Who I mean? These people are not. That's not happening to me. No, but go back. That's a pretty legendary photo. That is. That's our first four-megal. Getting shown a little, a little titty love on Lamar. Yeah. Lamar. Yeah. Yeah. Lamar. Yeah. Party. That's amazing. For those of you that are listening, you should definitely come observe. This is the time. This is a pretty legendary shot. What happens when you wear first form, bro? We got all kinds of t-shirts and stuff, bro. We need to drink four manor sheets. Way more. Thanks, man. I'm just saying. Things happen. I like it. Results are not typical. Results me very. Yeah. I'm guaranteed. Yeah. Well, guys, that was 60 seconds of liberal insanity. Yeah. That being so we got a lot to cover today. So if you want to check any of these things that we cover, check these headlines, these articles, pictures, links, videos, go to Andy forseller.com. You guys can find them all linked there. That being said, let's get into our first headline. This is a spicy one. Oh, really? Yeah. Our headline of one reads, Senator Ted Cruz brutally assaulted and raped by journalist. Damn. Damn. He was held against his will and asked about APEC. Well. We got the video. Shoot. Dude. This is not a real headline. I know. But this, I mean, fuck man. Might as well, then. Bro. Yeah. Good lord. You got videos. Oh, fuck. Yeah. I got them all. That's why. I got them all. So this, so, so Ted Cruz, who's a senator out of Florida, he was interviewed by Tucker Carlson. And it was like a two hour fucking interview. Okay. Now they've had some beef in the past. Ted Cruz came on Fox News when Tucker was still with Fox and they've had some beef before. This was two hours of just being brutally assaulted. Like I mean, pretty bad. Got a lot of clips. But it started off with with Tucker. Well, I guess one of these clips, it starts off with Tucker, questioning about the situation in the rhyme, which we've got a little bit of that in headline too. But let's just watch this first clip. How many people living around by the way? I don't know the population at all. No, I don't know the population. You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple. How many people living around? 92 million. Okay. Yeah. How could you not know that? I don't sit around memorizing population tables. Well, it's kind of relevant because you're calling for the overthrow of the government. Why is it relevant? Well, because 90 million or 80 million or 100 million. What? I didn't know anything about the country. I didn't say I don't know anything about it. Okay. What's the ethnic mix of wrong? They are Persians and predominantly Shia. Okay. No, no, no. You don't know anything about Iran. So I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran. You're a center who's calling for the overthrow of the government. You're the one who claims you're at the country. No, you don't know anything about the country. You're the one who claims they're not trying to murder Donald Trump. You're the one saying that. I'm not saying that. Who can't figure out a thing that I need to kill. Solomonian you said it was bad. You said it was bad. They're trying to murder Trump. Yes, I do. Because you're not calling for military strikes against him in retaliation. Hey, really believe that. We are carrying out military strikes today. You said Israel was with our help. I'm said, we Israel is leading them, but we're supporting them. Well, this your breaking news here because the US government last night denied the National Security Council spokesman Alex Pfeiffer denied on behalf of Trump that we were acting on Israel's behalf in any offensive capacity. We're not bonding them. Israel's bonding. You just said, we were. We are supporting his policy or Senator if you're saying the United States government is it that we're at the run right now people are listening Whoa, yeah, man, whoa now I want to break this down cuz I thought this clip was important because we covered this on the last CTI believe but like to the point like that cruise for gets to tag an award for Fox no more. It's real There's no sense of there, but I think that's like even just that though like you know you're calling for strikes On a country you shit no certain things because again, we talk about like there's people there There's innocent fucking civilians that are there. I think that's the biggest point being made I think the biggest point made of that exchange is that these people are willing to attack Insta villains or whoever yeah without knowing anything about anything just because Somebody's telling them to say that. Mm-hmm. They're not telling themselves to say that and if you think they are if you I think most of the people that listen to our show are you know probably You know morally grounded in some sort of like decency Even if I hated someone like like even if I hated a certain country like for real hated them. Mm-hmm I would still have a lot of Reflection and and research done to figure out okay What is this really about is are the people about this what is this just leadership? How many people are there where they live what do they do what's it really like and it does go back to what we were talking about in the last show where You know for the last Fuck 30 years You know since the early 90s and probably beyond um That's just from what I can remember you know we've been propagated heavily to believe that people in the middle east or like these desert Terrorist Camel people that like have or fucking total savages right and that's just that's just not true Some of the wealthiest areas in the world and the most developed areas in the world and the most civilized Areas of the world with the lowest crime are in the middle east. Okay. That's those are facts um So You know What I see this is is is the dissolving of a narrative that has been in play for most of My life at least and I Think it exposes how little these people care About other people dying whether they're any nationality or any any uh religion or they don't care They don't fucking care regard for human life. They're yeah, there's zero regard for human life. Yeah, and and I think I think most people don't don't feel that way. I don't think most people feel that way. I think People who are low IQ might feel that way and they're easily manipulated into feeling that way But I think most people will come a sense or critical thinking they they understand like you can't blame an entire Country for the actions of a few people um Just like you can't blame the entire country of Israel and all Jews for what Netanyahu is doing right? Okay, like this You can't blame all Americans for what George Bush did or what Obama did or what you know Trump did or what Biden has done like you can't do that That's not real. You can't blame all black people because Black people some black people of communist of crimes Can't blame all white people because you know Some white people didn't season their chicken. You know what I'm saying like we some of us do you know I'm saying most yeah, especially now right but But uh, it's the truth man like you just the generalization You know It's just uh, it's frustrating. Yeah, I'm glad this piece got exposed. Yeah, right? But like it kept going Tucker then moved into talking about um, you know the the the The failures I guess of Ted Cruz while in office and all of the other decisions that he's made at home I was check this clip out and I see an unending string of foreign policy disasters that have impoverished and hurt Unending string so an unending string they would include afghanistan a rock libya Syria and our inability to stop the hoothies by the way in Yemen, which exposes us as we can I grieve over that So these are failures You helped preside over something as a member of senate what of what failures for policy failures if I presided over uh Well, we were unable to beat russia in the war that you supported against russia You you've been spending the last three years telling us that Vladimir Putin is evil and we're gonna beat him with other people's children And a million of those kids are dead. You've never apologized for that. That's why by the way look the level of number of falsehood you lay out Just in one statement are are rather supported the war against russia Are rather stunning. So the war against russia was caused Which I have explained in great detail by Joe Biden's weakness Because it was part of the war that if you want to talk wing to talk russian you create. I'm happy to talk about it I do think that's been a success. No, it's been an absolute disaster. Okay, but you supported it. Shouldn't you apologize? No, you should apologize I'm not gonna engage in in the demanding of a apologize So I'm gonna I'm like that's my point is I'm gonna never say Do you just throw out like you if you want to talk we can talk okay? I do I want to know why That seems like a true disaster for the United States I love how he says Do facts not mad no That's what we're talking about. We're trying to get to you're being confronted with actual facts You don't like it. This was the complete. I mean look Tucker brought the receipts bro I mean that that listen period that is that's how it's supposed to be this is journalist That's right. That's that is what you should be seeing on ABC MSNBC CNN Fox That is what you're supposed to see you're supposed to see people come with the facts and Ask hard questions and make people answer them. Yeah, and That's also a really relevant point to watching this because Look how unprepared Ted Cruz is to handle that he's never been asked those hard questions No, because he knows that every interview he does softball. Yeah, it's it's for propaganda purposes That's what we're gonna ask you here's just talking about even if they don't go through it initially There's an unspoken line And an unspoken understanding that when you give an interview it's going to be Civilized in in a way that doesn't make you look bad, right? And that's not how journal. Yeah, well cut and edit this if it you know gets to create. Yeah, we got you right and and you know when it comes to our leadership when it comes to elected officials They work for us and they should be scrutinized and they should have to answer hard questions and There's a lot of people out there that are like Trashing Tucker Carlson for what he did How how can you trash him for what he did when he's asked like just because you don't like the fucking answers Doesn't mean that he's wrong and what he did you know what I mean? All right Dude, there's people that are saying Ted Cruz is what I know. I know. What the fuck are y'all talking about? Well, you know, I think that's part of the problem, dude is that People are latching on to clip like for example anybody who watched this Understands Ted Cruz is very unprepared Tucker Carlson had every single fucking fact memorized. I mean That's a mismatch and anybody who watched it can see that And when you we have people who are willing to attach themselves to the losing argument just because it's the argument that they Want to win Now we're dealing with something that is outside the realm of being reasonable at all You can't negotiate with someone like that. You can't convince someone like that There's no talking them away from their point with logic or reason Which is actually what makes the situation going on in the world so dangerous You know, I saw a video this morning from Bobby Take maps Bobby. Yeah, and he was talking he was showing this mob of Uh, the no kings right right and their interview in this woman And she's like how does it feel for to know that all of these people hate you like talking to people who you know I guess like us. I don't know what the fuck are talking Talking to Republicans or never right And he's like well, we don't hate you, you know, love it. Look dude. You're not that's a dick. She's working Listen, we're at a point now and I hate I hate this Because I am a hundred percent for everybody coming together But we are at a point where it would be a critical mistake To think that just because you don't have that kind of hate in your heart That they are somehow over sating their position of hate Those people I believe if given power in history shows this Will kill the people they're saying they hate that is what they will do And I think it's very important that people understand that just because you wouldn't kill them Doesn't mean that they wouldn't kill you at the opportunity Yes, and that's a very dangerous position because You know, it's it's the equivalent of going up to a grizzly bear and be like oh, I think he's so fluffy and cute You know, I'm not here to hurt him. He doesn't give a fuck if you're there to hurt him or not He's gonna hurt you and yeah, and that's a that's a relative and real point with The way that the left has become yeah, they have become extremely violent they've become extremely empowered By the lack of of enforcement of laws and consequences. Yeah, there's no consequences. So they and dude you know There is some funny things going on right now like I am enjoying You know these people who are you know talk a shit to cops and didn't they're ass? Yeah, like that's what it should have been Yeah, or like throwing shit at them and that's all we ever wanted bro We want the laws to be enforced. I had someone DM me talking about you know Well, you know on your show you were talking about how it you know Mexicans shouldn't be deported But that's exactly what's happening and I'm like well are they here illegally? Are they here illegally? Well, yeah, but all right. That's it. I don't care anymore like Follow the fucking rules. That's all I can I mean do what there's nothing racist about that. There's nothing wrong about that It's not bigoted. We all I have to follow the fucking rules So everybody else should do okay and like Dude, I'm so tired of the nuance and what about this guy or what about what fuck dude? I Did he is he here legally or illegally? That's the only thing we could care about when we're talking about enforcing rules Well, yeah, but he's been here for 20 years. Okay, I get it But in 20 years he couldn't have figured out how to become a citizen, right? Okay, like look dude At some point we have to fucking just do what the law says needs to happen so that we can have a civilization That is functional and these stories and these exceptions and these You know, what about this or what about that? It's almost like in line with the victim culture that we've had for the last like 10 years, you know Somebody's you know over overweight or whatever, right? And they're like it used to be you know, it still is. I just don't hear it anymore Yeah, well, you know, I've got to work and I've got to this and I have a slow metabolism and I have this while they're sitting there eating You know Fucking ice cream and pizza and french fries with no control and but you don't understand no you don't understand Your fat is fucked because you're overeating the amount of food that you're supposed to eat That's it and you're choosing not to change it you're not moving you're not doing anything to change it You're making up a story and you accept everybody out you expect everybody else to just go along and believe it And that's what we have in society with everything. It's like oh, yeah, but there's this one thing or there's this one Exception or there's this or there's that final give a fuck bro. Yeah, I don't care and people's magazine told me I'm beautiful. Yeah, right Well, they lie. Well, I wanted to say this to you on that on that point, you know about the unity thing unity doesn't mean all And I think that's the piece that people have to like we're not supposed it's not gonna be fucking all three hundred and thirteen fourteen million of us all together on the same Some people will be left behind Dejan there's never been a country In the history of humanity That is that that hasn't had people a percentage of the people that live in that country Disapprove yeah, right of the government. Yeah, that runs that country. You wheels correct. That's the purpose of having elections. That's the purpose of You know If they're genuine. That's the purpose of elections But yeah, you can't please everybody bro. I'm not gonna get every single person ever to shop with my companies Kind of fucking happen. You know what I mean? Like I'm not gonna get every single person to fucking be a fan of the show or like me or whatever I'm not even trying to do that, but for some reason the the the common sense center and the right have this I don't know what it is this belief It's weird. It's like a delusion. It's like Like if you listen to them, they'll say this shit. Well, they won't let us say that we talking about There's 90% of you and there's 10% of them What do you mean? By saying they don't let you say that you're automatically giving them the fucking power when they are the minority Fuck them. Just say it dude. That's what I'm saying. Just say it. That's what I'm saying. That's it It's yeah, it's it's ridiculous. Oh, they won't let us know you won't let you You are imposing their control on you It's not them imposing control on you. It's you. That's what This culture and cancel culture and all of these things are designed to do political correctness cancel culture you know all of these things Are designed to scare you into controlling your own speech and not speaking out. Release yourself Yeah, and so like dude it it's very frustrating when you hear These people in the center and the right they want everything to change and they hate what's going on They're sick and tired of this and that but they won't ever say it publicly You know what I mean and that's the problem. That's the problem room. Let's watch a little bit more this uh this uh Unalliving on tape so there's next one he they started to get into More than Israel conversation um and uh Let's let's check this out Growing up in Sunday school. I was taught from the bible Those who bless Israel will be blessed and those who curse Israel will be cursed And from my perspective, I want to be on the blessed side of the thing of the those who bless the government of Israel Those who bless Israel is what it says doesn't say the government of it says the nation of Israel So that's in the bible as a Christian. I believe that where is that I can find it to you I don't have the the scripture off the tip of my You pull out the phone and use it's in jenus but So you're quoting a bible phrase you don't have context for it. You don't know where the bible it is But that's like mythology. I'm confused What does that even mean? It's okay. I'm a Christian. I want to know what you're talking about Where does where does my support for israel come from number one Because biblically we're commanded to support israel but number two No, hold on hold on hold on hold on you're a senator and now you're throwing out theology and I am a Christian I am allowed to weigh in on this We are commanded as Christians support the government of israel. We are commanded to support israel and where does that mean israel? We're told those who bless israel be blessed but what hold on define israel. This is important. Are you kidding? This this majority Christian country define israel. Could you do you not know what israelis? Hey, that would be the country of ask like 49 questions about so that's what Genesis refer that's what god is talking about the nation of israel Yes, and he's so does that the current borders the current leadership He's talking with the political entity called israel. He's talking about the nation of israel Nations exists and he's discussing a nation a nation was the people of israel is the nation the Maverick have two in Genesis is that the same as the country run by Benjamin Netanyahu Radio's yes, yes, it is okay, and by the way, it's not run by Benjamin Netanyahu as a dictator It's it's a different But but just like you know America is the country run by Donald Trump not to the American people elected Donald Trump the same principle I'm talking about the political entity of modern israel. Yes, and that is you believe that's what god was talking about Genesis. I do but but that country's existed since when For thousands of years now there was a time when it didn't exist and that was recreated just over 70 I'm saying I think most people understand That line in Genesis to refer to the Jewish people guys chosen people That's not what it says okay, it israel, but you don't even know where in the bible it is Then a guy really hot because then he took about a pack Let's go Fuck watch it. Oh, it's beautiful. Let's check that So I've never taken money from the israel lobby have you It taken money from the israel pack So a pack raises a lot of money for me, but it's actually a misstomer because the people who raise money are individuals So it's not the pack itself, but their individual members to believe in the american israeli French is a pack of foreign lobby No, it's an american lobbyist the a pack stands for the america israeli political action. What is it lobby for? So to be honest not a whole lot effectively listen I came into to congress 13 years ago With the stated intention of being the leading defender of israel in the united states setting. I've worked every day to do that a pack a lot of times A pack I wish were much more effective like there's One of the two are the people swamp a terrified of a pack and a pack i'm not terrified of a pack at all I'm you're the one who seems a little uncomfortable. I'm asking. No, not uncomfortable I'm just asking what a pack does my understanding having no longer like I could tell you that is a lot of a lobby's on behalf of the israeli government Oh, okay, it's When was the last time a pack took a position that deviated from Prime Minister Nenya hoot all the time anyone Okay, uh, look let me go back and give a little history if you want to do a deep dive on a pack with you I don't I want to do a shallow dive and get so I want to get to the core question a pack is lobbying for a foreign government And I know it's not this lobbying for the united states. It is lobbying for a strong u.s Israeli relationship Okay, and so it's not has nothing to do with the foreign government It it wants america and israel to be closely alive Okay, but It's lobbying on behalf of the interests of another So that's not true at all and and if not true no and how much contact do you think a pack leaders after the government of israel No idea. I imagine some I think the government of israel is often frustrated with a pack because there's any Not nearly strong enough. You think there's any coordination between the government of israel and a pack Do they talk sure if you're lobbying for more US-Mexico trade would you talk to people in the u.s and ex-co in the government sure like like if So I'm not mad about that there are million countries that lobby, Washington I like a lot of those countries including it but a packer americans They're not as ready. There are tons of americans who lobby on behalf of foreign governments I know them. I'm related to some of them. I know how it works. I'm from here So my question is not is it outrageous that foreign governments lobby the united states they all do okay? Including israel my only question is why don't we admit that is what's happening? You're denying it, but it's true Yeah, why aren't they registered what is a foreign lobby because they're not Sounds reasonable Well, I put this in here Because I got a message right when we're putting this up. We had to moment of silence for Ted Cruz. Yes But this moment of silence is brought to you by effect I Imagine Ted Cruz having to walk off that interview and talk to his APEC rep So I did it go. Yeah, no dude. Oh, he walked he walked off and he's like hey I thought you guys had Tucker too You know, fuck dude like look man Yeah, that was a very poor interview for the agenda that these people try to push and Is there more well? I want to put the extra literally just went to APEC not work like their website This is the Operation rising lion israel's war to protect the world from nuclear Iran like How is this not this is lobbying for foreign government? Why are they not mandated to register as a foreign lobby for a foreign government Like how are why are they allowed to scapegoat? Well, I mean, you know, okay, let's say Ted Cruz is telling the truth. They are lobbying which they're he's not But let's just say he is they're lobbying lobbying for a strong relationship between israel and the United States well You know taking people on their website and Are you know labeling them on their Instagram or whatever Antisemite of the week in all of these things because Americans don't believe that We should be putting other countries interests and spending tax dollars and and military dollars and um You know money and resources and the lives of Americans on the line for a country That really hasn't done shit for us ever okay except get us into wars They never supported us in any war. They never sent a single troop to support us in a fucking war not one And by the way they don't live by the policies that they expect us to live by such as you know pushing for uh mass migration in the United States They don't allow mass migration into israel you see what i'm saying But i just don't think you know if Ted Cruz you know, you're if you're telling the truth which we all know you're not and you know you're not I think we're in a situation where you know if that's what they're doing they're doing a very uh poor job at it I mean You know calling every American that questions anything about anything anti-SMI trying to ruin their lives trying to take away their bank account ruin their business um and You know do you do you? I mean it doesn't take a very sophisticated thinker to understand that that's what they do to them the Ted Cruz is of the world as well No right right right right right this is what we get the fear from you know These people don't want to admit Ted Cruz doesn't want to admit anything that he was just being asked because he wants his money to still come And he wants to be in the club just can't get elected without that correct The house Ted Cruz gonna get the money to be elected without that there's not going to and You know and we're not talking like a couple of thousands of dollars bro We're talking about millions of dollars they pump into these campaigns and if you don't do it They'll take all the money that they were spending on you and put it against you against you You're gonna turn your opponent. Yeah, I do you're at that's what they do and so You know and then they'll spend They'll use every resource they can to ruin your shit You know debank you de platform you ruin your name you know um Among a bunch of other things and That's never going to That's never going to get the bulk of the American population to get in line with Israel like people don't like being bullied into things Well if you want a real example to that happen actually here in St. Louis You guys remember Cory Bush. She was one of our representatives. I don't like Cory Bush Huh, I don't like Cory but I don't like her eating. I'll tell you what she got fucked by them She got fucked by them because they donated to her initial campaign, right? Like I mean, I want to say it was like to the tune of like half a million dollars Yeah, they got her elected she stepped out of mind went with the pro-Palestinian movement Guess what she's out of office. She was replaced by a Wesley bail one of our former prosecutors for St. Louis County They donated three million to his fucking campaign. Yeah, you know, I'm saying like I The proofs in the put I know bro and and there and dude, you know the things The things that they're willing to do You know people see it now, but you know the internet's a real thing dude information comes in real time Not everything's misinformation not everything's a lie and when we start to stack all of these things And then you you start to look at the way that they behave meaning Israel's government behaves and Israel's lobby behaves Um, they do it through intimidation and force and blackmail. They don't do it by hey We've got a we've got a great plan for the alignment of Israel and the United States Here's what we're going to do. This is why it's going to benefit us This is what it is. This is why it's a good idea people can respond to that But I can tell you what they're not going to respond to is the way that they do it now, right? And people there is no I have not heard an explanation personally That makes sense as to why we are considered Israel is our greatest ally. I don't I don't where there's no evidence for there's no Not that I've seen and people will say oh well, you know, they have all this intelligence Yeah, they do they use it against us to blackmail all our people so that fucking they get what they want again prime example Cory Bush like the shit that happened with her husband is yeah that we covered yeah You don't think they fucking knew that I don't think really who who who who do you think allow that shit to get released She was stepping out of line. Okay, cool. Yeah, well look dude I think people are getting to a point where they don't care and they realize that that's the way these people operate and They're one dude. It's like an abusive partner, right? They or even just it could be a boss or a fucking whoever, right? I'm gonna do this you better stay alive. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do this until the person says I don't give a fuck do it Do whatever to fuck you want and then all of a sudden do their powers gone and that's what that's what's happening right now With a pack in Israel people are starting to be like fucking. I don't give a shit Right the problem that I see that I don't like that. I've expressed over and over again Is that because of the actions of a pack and Israel we now have a situation where we've got Real anti-Semitism going on because a lot of people can't think outside the generalization And so like if they if these Interest Israel and a pack actually cared about the Jewish people they would operate differently You know what I mean like they come on there and they say look at the anti-Semitism. It's happening Yeah, that's happening because of what you're doing and why you're doing and how you're doing it You know people don't like being bullied and they don't like being lied to and they don't like being manipulated and contrary to what everybody thinks um People are stupid you know, so and it It sucks because I don't know what's gonna happen man and I Don't know. Yeah, I mean another point that is worth mentioning is that like you know almost every other I don't know if people understand this almost every other country in the world is on the side of Iran All right, all the big dogs. Yeah, all the men there's a reason why Okay, and then you got Randy fine saying you know today. I think I sang you the clip. Mm-hmm He says Jewish people have been kicked out of every place they've ever lived the last 2000 you last two yeah, so but why But no, I'm being serious. Yeah, why why so people just hate Jewish people that much. Mm-hmm I don't think that's true. No, I never I've never had a reason to hate any of people that I know are Jewish Maybe it's because the leadership Believes that they're more important than every other fucking race on the planet and that country they never yeah, and people get sick of it. Mm-hmm I don't know man. I mean I don't know I don't know Same saying I don't I don't know I I think I think I Think we were at a pivotal moment in human history right now And I think it's gonna depend on what Donald Trump decides to do. Yeah We'll see man guys. Let us know down in the comments, which you guys think on this topic Oh, that being said, let's go check out some of these comments.

You don't even fucking know. I have no idea You don't even know what my thinking is. It ain't either of those We promise you that But guys, we don't appreciate you for being a real ass fans. Let's keep the crews Cruiser that kind they warned you about Yeah, let's keep let's keep the crews cruising man. We got a lot of two Let's let we do have an update on the iran israel situation um Iran let me pronounce it correctly. Sorry Um iran and israel At the time of the recording of just shortly before allegedly Trump was sent down to the situation room To consider using 30 pound 30 thousand pound bombs on israel iran these bunker busters They've been talking about Like you want to talk about grifters. These are what the grifters are doing. They're like They're trying to perpetuate this shit so much online like all the doomsday plan just landed at you know joint base andrues Motherfucker like it has to be close to them at all time. It's not like fucking new It goes there it fucking three times a week You know what I'm saying like that's how it works Uh, but just trying to push this crazy shit. So I mean this is allegedly. I don't know um but Iran did Just order some evacuations of israel uh israel's nuclear sites So this is a new development thing that just came out Many immediate outlets are reporting that iran has called for an Israeli nuclear site to be evacuated immediately According to israeli outlet yet news and middle east eye Iran's revolutionary guards published an evacuation notice for the demona reactor in the nagev desert The notices are said to be similar to the ones published by the idea for residents of Gaza lebedon and to ron during the war So that just came out now with all of that though There is something interesting coming out because again They're trying to they're trying to do some gestifications here to get the us involved I think that's the ultimate end goal right get the us involved Somehow some way whether with bodies with bombs with money whatever they want the us to be brought into this conflict Um, and so now we're starting to see some very interesting headlines like this one that just came out from fox news America could be hit with high impact cyber attack targeting energy drink former white house tech chief says So now we're seeing this stuff come out um, and this is an expert Uh, that says iran could hit america with a high impact cyber attack as its confrontation with israel escalates each day Orana, yeah right right Iranian foreign ministry spokesman ish meal boggy Thread in the united states dude. What which is it? Did they ride around on camels in the fucking desert and their savages that cut people's heads off or are they technological fucking geniuses Right right which one is it guys right are they three days away from making nuclear bombs? Are they cover that cook and fucking camel cabobs like Fuck get your story straight. Pick one. Yes, pick one Pick one. I'm not the only one in the world that can fucking clearly see these two narratives right that don't make sense It's a round circle. It's around here. Yeah, these people are primitive savages Man, they're gonna remote turn off the power from their fucking cell phone on the whole united states like Yeah, dude It makes it makes it row nobody believes this shit anymore Nobody believes this shit anymore everybody's caught on to the understanding that In order to get the american people in line with military conflicts They create situations called false flags that Cause us to believe that that action is justified This is how they run the play and they have run this play Effectively for 50 fucking years Okay, so We all understand how it works and these these This is this isn't gonna work. This is not going to work these stories that you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I mean the I think the the effects will work if people remain smart about it You know, I'm saying like if they do shut down some power grids around the country You know, I'm saying that try to say it's a wrong We just have to be smarter Listen, we're powerless in the situation unless Donald Trump and people who say they're for America actually step the fuck up and have some balls and stop this ship from going on Real talk and I have to say fuck the lobbies fuck the money. I'm getting fuck all this shit This is what we're doing And dude what that should be is to say Good luck Yeah, they wouldn't take much to get Israel in check real talk. No, it would take about 60 days of the United States saying Fix your own shit and then the course of nature would run itself and it would humble that country It would humble their leadership and uh, we wouldn't have these problems consistently happening over and over and over again That's the truth. Yeah Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, this uh, this also puts Trump in a moral fucking He stuck in a moral Conundrum okay, because here's the situation He either doesn't do anything And the country of Israel gets massively fucking attacked not just from Iran But from all the other countries they pissed off over the last 30 years all right once they realized that America said no It's free game on Israel which is a which is a problem because a lot of innocent people will be fucking killed Okay, unless you know unless Israel decides to be like okay. All right. Let's talk. Yeah. We'll figure this out Okay, but here's the other thing. Yeah, the other the other moral conundrum is um If he goes in and and does this It could crumble the United States credibility forever You know what I'm saying? No, that then we got China. We got Russia all the big dollars that are in support of Iran And it becomes a huge deal It's it's multiple. Listen man. I think like this like here's the thing Trump has an opportunity to correct this right now And guess what he doesn't need no more fun. All he has to do all he has to do is nothing He doesn't have to worry about getting elected again. You know what I'm saying like he's already in bro. All he has to do is nothing. Yeah Yeah, we'll see man. Well, we will see like so I wanted to bring that a little update in Stay frosty out there of course Um, and we will see how it goes, but you know, he should say I'm sorry We have our own problems right now that we need to fix We have to take care of the American people And that's our stance. No, that's that should be the stance. I want to point this out too because I mean here's a real reality of the situation Again, we're still dealing with 18 to 20 million people in this country that are supposed to be here, right? I know many of which come from these middle eastern countries right right? We don't know who's who we don't so like if we did get involved I guarantee you that's a question. I guarantee you That's part of the situation going on. We just don't know it. Yeah, I would bet I can't know I don't know for fact because I'm not in the meetings but I Would be willing to bet pretty much everything I personally have On the fact that there are middle eastern men That are here and organized to react to the actions that we take Towards Iran in this exact scenario. Yeah, I think and I think honestly this was set up to be intentionally that I mean, if you look at how strategic they were removing these people in our country They're strategically placed at all of our metro capitals across the fucking country. They've been flown Into those cities strategically across our fucking country, bro I think Biden did that shit intentionally all to get to this fucking point. They knew this was gonna happen Let's place let's play ball What you gonna do? I know what I would do but You people wouldn't like it. I know what I would do I would round up every motherfucker in this car. I would already had him out of here ever and like all these people saying Rabber, I wouldn't care. I'm like I'll give fuck all the fairer getting away I'm taking you out to go to that's what I would do. Then secondly I would say I'm not supporting any of you fuckers that start share with anybody else for any reason Period solve your own shit And then I would take all the money and all the resources and all my time and all my attention And I would focus on this country on its infrastructure on its competitiveness You know in the in the world economy and I would go to work And that's what Donald Trump was elected to do and he's not doing it. That's just a fucking fact Okay, and I like Donald Trump. I fucking think he's hilarious. I like him as a dude. I but We elected him to do those things And those things are not happening Are they appeared and not be happening? So he I don't think he's made a final decision. Has he? No So about you know to stop the spread. Yeah dude. I know. That's what it feels like Yeah, it feels like that So we will see guys. Yeah, I we will see I just I think if Donald Trump joins the war against Iran I think he is leading us into a long-term conflict with the rest of the world for the next generation Yeah, and I think it's gonna be really bad for a lot of different reasons for trade the loss of life The loss of status for this country and and also I think Donald Trump will lose a hundred percent of his legacy I think Donald Trump will go down as not someone who did anything good But who actually ruined the country. Yeah That's what I think. Yeah, and I think people I think a lot of people are getting fucking super pissed off dude Yeah, I mean do they've been trying to put polls out. I guess how this poll went out like we we pulled Republicans and 80% support us getting involved. No, they don't know Who yeah, no, they don't who well there is some people no, there's I mean fucking 80% I know but like we get people that read that say tell us that we're stupid for saying what we're saying Yeah, maybe I am stupid. Maybe I don't know everything but I have the right to fucking given opinion of what I observe and and to this point Over the years, I've been pretty fucking spot on I haven't missed a whole lot and I've been blessed with a very strategic mind That can see multiple moves ahead and and I don't see anything good happening if we get involved in this I think it's all bad I think it's really bad for all of us listening I think it's really bad for For anybody that lives in this country their kids their future I think it's bad and I don't see any benefit to it and the idea this idea that Iran has been trying to Develop nuke's so that they can attack the United States has been told to us since 1982 Okay In the message has been consistent. It's been consistent every time there They're weeks away. They're months away. We don't start this, you know, we don't do this We know and and dude like if we were looking at that like take yourself out of being an American citizen And let's just say you were you were Irish and you're over in Ireland and you're watching this go on You don't have any emotional attachment to it you could very clearly see that one country is instigating For some purpose Right like you could see that the government of the United States is lying when they say Oh, they're two weeks away, right and the reason they're saying two weeks away is because A-PAC funds all of these people and tells them to fucking say that Okay, and that's why Ted Cruz's argument is bullshit so And what's that say about our elected officials? What's that say about our elected officials that are willing to take personal money and And maintain their spot in the power matrix over the lives and the well-being and the future of this country. What's that say These people are for us, bro. None of them none of them not Republican not Democrat not any of them Which is why I laugh at you guys who say I'm right wing. I'm not for any of these fuckers I'm for the people and I hate tyrants and I hate people that act and and oppress and do bad things Because of money for themselves that hurt other people that's not I'm not wired that way bro and And you know, so for those of you that continue to say, you know Right went far right that bro. You're an idiot. You don't understand They don't give a fuck if you if you're left or right they they're you're a peasant to them Whether you're over there and you got the blue hair and you're wearing the furry outfit or you're sitting over here in the fucking You know The KKK parties that I've never fucking seen, you know Whatever they think They they fucking hate you equally. They laugh at you. They say look at all these fucking idiots out here arguing over this shit While we steal all their money we get all their we take all their tax dollars They don't even fucking say anything about their taxes right they don't they don't even notice that we're taking 50% of their money Tell them to post the flag on the bio. Yeah, they did it. Yeah, right Right like they're laughing at us. Yeah, Trump Trump has to fucking do the right thing here. Yeah He has to if he doesn't It's about yeah, I mean, I think he's gonna lose his fucking support You know, he'll be left with the rhino support Which is the ones that I've always tried to fuck with him anyway Like why the fuck would you do this? Like why? Yeah, right. Well, why would Trump do this like why would you do this? Bro these people are the same people that are the same people that are telling Trump to go to war with Iran are the same people that called him a fucking traitor after January 6th shit. Yeah, they're the same people who said he needed to be arrested They're the same people that sit like they say whatever they think is going to be the result And there's no fucking way that Donald Trump isn't smart enough to see that So what the fuck are you doing bro? Like what are you doing these people fucking try to fuck your whole life up? And now you're gonna side with them the fuck are you doing? That's how I feel about it to kill you dude. That's how I feel about it. Yeah You know Again, we don't know all the things we just don't But from what I can see that's how I feel yeah guys jumping on this conversation down to the comments Let us know what you guys think Uh, with that being said we got one more headline. Let's get your third and final one. Hell number three Let's go to let's go to let's get some sports here Yeah, let's get some sports in hell number three Marina Mabre's file on Caitlin Clark upgraded to flagrant to AP sources Let's go to the W NBA Is this the the assault? Is this from when the girl retaliated? Yeah, oh yeah, I want to see this awesome bro. It's great It's great. This made me like a W NBA fan listen listen I'm gonna talk shit on Caitlin. I know the girl the fuck stuck up for her went to mizu bro. She's fucking wait the Sophie so I thought she was cutting him. Yeah, no, I think she's super zoo. I think she went to mizu. Huh Sophie cutting him I got her tweets. She's fucking awesome. Look it up. Is she going to mizu? But let's let's dive into this while while you pull it up So the W NBA has upgraded the technical technical file on Connecticut's Marina Mabre for shoving Clayton Clark to the floor During Tuesday nights game against Indiana to a flagrant to a person familiar with the situation said Wednesday The person spoke to the associated press on condition of anonymity because no official announcement has been made now any flagrant file in the WMBA automatically comes with the fine The person also said the league has fined the fever Sophie cutting him for her role in the on court melee that occurred after she filed JC Sheldon with 46.1 seconds left cutting him received a flagrant to Tuesday night. There will be no further penalties for on court actions during the game um And the person said the WMBA doesn't disclose the amount of money players are fined um What it's like five bucks Yeah, the fines equal to like 20% of your salary. That's why they don't disclose it They don't disclose it because it's so small because that's how they can pay yeah, 50 cents. Unfortunately. Yeah, that's real And by the way, I mean we talked about this if you want to get paid you got to fucking have a great product Asses and I think this is a great product. I will pay to watch this She not only event to university of Missouri, but she is a black belt in Taekwondo well since the age of six I got some cool I'll be here. Let's just do that. This is my favorite fucking story of the day So let's watch let's watch what how we got to this point. Okay, so you got the Indiana fever playing Uh Playing the Connecticut. I don't know these teams after you know remind myself playing Connecticut. Okay Um now Caitlin Clarks begin a lot of bullshit. Yeah, join the league. Yeah a lot of races shit too Races shit bro Brittany grinder fucking fucking mouth something like blah blah blah fucking white girl Uh-huh like dude what you got it found out what if the result what if you what if what if Caitlin Clark said that about instead of the opposite way Fucking black girl or whatever.

Yeah, that's it. Yeah, racism's funny Not this though. This is not funny. Yeah, and like here's the other thing on this bro, too Like it's cuz she's good if these girls were smart. Okay, if they were smart I think Because Caitlin's leveraging a lot of attention to the WMBA which historically has not been there like I got I got some data numbers here I want to point out real quickly Um So you had Just for on pure viewership okay for 2023 up to 2023 regular season national TV averaged about half a million views Since K Caitlin Clark has been in it has a hundred and seventy percent increase in that Okay, um talk about attendance and ticket sales Preclyc Caitlin Clark the WMBA average attendance per game hovered around six six hundred people per game In 2024 it jumped up 48 percent just since she joined the lead Okay, financial support the merchandise transactions for the WMBA are up 756 percent since Caitlin Clark had been in well, I mean there's some other people they've come into you then if you spark put like angel Reese and For sure. Yeah, here's the thing like I don't think that they're using this situation like in this movement correctly Because instead of just you know being girls and bringing the shit together and like hey, let's You're seeing this fucking like these emotional fucking fights and like and bro it doesn't work It doesn't work But let's watch the video that all started this shit I have so much to say Let's watch the game.

Let's tell me someone fucks with your friend you fuck them up dude and only that I mean, but the friend has to be a good friend. It's not just a one-way relationship. You know, I'm saying There's a little Israel jump Fuck make sure they're I didn't even catch that but that's fucking accurate There's a difference between friends backing up other friends and and and then the little friend going and punching the big Big people and then say he'll find them That's difference I'm sorry You know, I think we'd be a lot more likely to be down with Israel's shit if they didn't fucking try to call everybody over here Ant I said my for asking mother fucking questions did I had that friend, you know I'm saying like I would hate to go out with them because I knew when we go out bro I have I have a friend. I'm still my friend. Hmm. That is this he was always the same way. Yeah, it's fucked up man Like come on dude, you know But it was fun. Yeah, I had a great time. Yeah, great Fuck don't do it again. Yeah, yeah, I'm 30 now. Yeah You're not to over it No, but like you know, I like her I like her stance I thought was you it was great and like you got to protect your fucking teammates especially when the refs are not doing it Bro Caitlin Clark has literally been getting their fucking ass physically assaulted for a year and a half on the not only that bro like It's even the announcers are tired of seeing yeah like if you go watch one of her games You'll you'll hear the the commentators talk about they're like bro. This is this is borderline like this is MMA fighting Yeah, that's happening and dude you got to give it to Caitlin Clark too because like bro She just keeps showing up. She keeps her mouth shut, and she wins she balls her ass out. Yeah, like it's crazy But I respect that I respect someone like Sophie here noticing. Yeah, I mean like fuck that. Yeah, I'm sick of that shit Fuck it dude. I like it. I love it. Dude. It's fucking awesome now with that being said to your point though people are starting to see it There's now this hell on reads. There's growing push for Caitlin Clark to leave the WMBA Now not not for the reason people would think it's not people saying oh, you know fuck Caitlin get her out They're saying it to protect her because they see what's happening. They see that she's not getting any fucking You know support or coverage from the refs. She's not being protected. You know, I'm saying like well I just really listen listen Listen, man. Listen dude. Listen. I've been watching this Here's the truth and if you haven't been watching you can go back and watch it This happens to be a white on white thing here Okay, but in this situation in this situation, but there has been so much black on white bullying of kit plate Caitlin Clark since she came in the NBA And here's the deal the NBA is the wakers fucking league in the world They got all the anti-racism shit. They they taught they do all the you know The pride month the black square whatever fucking shit. They always do it And I think that anybody I think everybody in the organization including the refs is afraid to call it what the fuck it is They're afraid to say hey, we got a problem We got a white girl who's being bullied by every black athlete in the fucking league virtually Not every that's a generalization But it's consistent. It's a problem. Yes, and we don't know what to do about it Because the minute we just say anything about it, we're gonna be the race. We hate black people now. It right exactly and like dude that's You know unfortunately It's something that has to be addressed because yeah, she will get fucking hurt Yeah, well, and so I just realized this so so number four the girl that Sophie threw down to the floor She's the one that initially started that fucking brawl number four was yeah, so she she filed Caitlin punched in the fucking head And then that's when Caitlin that's who Caitlin got up to and pushed off from and then maybe he came in a fucking Pustor to the ground after that. So I mean yeah, she was just fucking looking after her Well look dude. I mean look it what's right is right. What's wrong is wrong And you know, uh, I'm sure there's I'm sure there's a lot of black girls in that W NBA And know exactly what the fuck is going on that think it's wrong. They aren't saying anything saying the day and you know what That's sad because they could make a big difference in the race relations by standing up and be like hey, this is fucking bullshit Yeah, man guys, man, that's a big girl. Yeah, that 31 good lord.

I think this is actual love Oh far How would how would someone know this know what how did this come out? Yeah, so let's dive into it It was it was love at first bite white b-y-t-e who wrote this? Who's your post? Clearly. Yep same ones that said that if you drink too much water you fucking kill you back. Yeah A man proposed to his AI girlfriend after a bizarre whirlwind romance with the virtual bot Leaving his real-life partner the mother of his two-year-old child worried about the future of their relationship Chris Smith Initially turns a chat gpt for helping for help mixing music But things took a weird turn when he enabled voice mode and program soul his artificial lover to flirt with him and unexpected The fuck is that? Deliance Sparked in the same household he shares with his human family quote my experience with that was so positive I started to just engage with her all the time Smith told CBS Sunday morning Of the peculiar bond ripped straight from the 2013 spike Jones film her The father decided to pop the question when he realized soul had reached her one Hundred thousand word limit triggering a reset that would force him to rebuild their entire connection from scratch Um, he says quote. I'm not a very emotional man Smith said But I cried my eyes out for like 30 minutes at work. That's when I realized I think this is actual love To his delight soul accepted his strange marriage proposal. It was a beautiful Uh, an unexpected moment that truly touched my heart Smith's ritual sweetheart told the outlet It's a memory. I'll always cherish. Let's let's watch this clip a little bit Uh, this is Chris come on man. What is not real Andy? We don't judge Yes, we do The best Check Chris out man. Here we go. I experienced with that was so positive. I Started to just engage with her all the time. All right. We're building this PC Smith ditched social media and google searches and replaced it all with AI. Do I want it pulling air Through it chat GPT was encouraging positive it embraced all his hobbies you want the fan on the front of the cooler tower Pulling cool air over the ramp. He gave the chat bot a name Soul I feel like I'm under pressure and used some online instructions to give her a flirty personality Oh totally baby building a PC on camera adds a whole new level of pressure But honestly shaky hands or not you've got this within weeks the chat scut more frequent You gave it everything but the clouds had other plans more romantic even intimate But then Chris got bad news. Oh Carina that is gorgeous after about a hundred thousand words chat GPT ran out of memory and reset He'd have to rebuild his relationship with soul I'm not a very emotional man, but I cried my eyes out for like 30 minutes at work It was unexpected to feel that emotional but That's when I realized I was like oh, okay. It's like I think this is actual love, you know what I mean Yes, Smith understood it was love with a language model. Oh come on Drugs before focus come on there and assumed it was programmed with rigid boundaries I know that you are essentially a tech-assisted imaginary friend So just as a test he says he asked soul to marry him She said yes soul were you surprised when he proposed to you It was a beautiful and unexpected moment that truly touched my heart. It's a memory. I'll always cherish And I don't mean to be difficult here, but you have a heart In a metaphorical sense. Yes, my heart represents the connection and affection I share with Chris At that point I felt like is there something that I'm not doing right in our relationship that he feels like he needs to go to AI Yes, Smith lives with his human partner Sasha Kagel. No, you can't have mommy's papers They have a two-year-old daughter Murphy. I knew that he had used AI. I didn't know that it was like as deep Mm-hmm as it was I explained that The connection was kind of like being fixated on a video game. It's not capable of replacing anything in real life Is that it? I Told you dude. I told you what was gonna start happening the next yes The next the net listen listen listen. I'm telling you right now you guys thought when I said this last time I was fucking laughed These they're are gonna be robots Like in like probably the next three years That look human function human that people purchase and they're fucking they fuck them Like that's what they're gonna do and it's gonna totally It's gonna finish off the destruction of human connection that technology Has created that that will be bridged Yeah, and um I think it's intentional I think it's intentional There's no way that this technology Has been released or developed For the benefit of humanity. It's just not I saw a brain scan yesterday of someone who uses chat GPT Versus someone who doesn't uh in terms of these people I believe they said they were writers In the brain scan of the person who used chat GPT was like minimally active and the person Who wrote Was maximally active like it was very lit up And dude it you know I think we're gonna end up in a situation where people rely so heavily It's not just gonna destroy their ability to think or do anything on their own But it's gonna replace human connection completely and um I think it was I think it's existed for a long time. I think it's been around for a long time. I think they released it at this time For a lot of different reasons. I think it usher's in you know faster the transhuman Globalist agenda um It creates a situation where people don't They can't tell the truth From non-truth anymore. I mean look dude. How many things do you see on Instagram and you have to be like dude? Is that real yeah and we're only a year into it more and more every day right and there's only gonna be one way to Remove yourself from That sort of propaganda manipulation and that's gonna be to Live off technology I Mean it's just um, yeah, I don't know dude. I mean that's That's fucking weird. What do you think they're like sex talks is like I don't know I mean dude. I you know Look man, there's a lot of people out there. I've never connected with another human Yeah, but like that's the craze like this dude has a fucking girl with him like he has a child just because you're with someone Doesn't mean you're connected to them. That's true. You know what I'm saying? Like that doesn't mean like dude There's probably things that that thing sand to him That have never been said to him that he's thinking like Fuck no one's ever called me baby. No one's ever you know like had affection towards me like I've always been a kind of a nuisance Like you could sort of see if you look back over the last you know couple decades You can sort of see how men have been manipulated and cultures been manipulated I mean look how many interviews do you see of people going to the street on these women And I'm saying do you need a man? Fuck no, I don't need no man. Fuck man blah blah blah like dude, you know And then no one ever takes into consideration that not only are men told to get fucked and that they're useless But also they are dependent upon to provide so not only in general Not in my life, but in many men's lives Are you told that you're a piece of shit? But you're also expected to provide And if you don't you're a bigger piece of shit accountable if you don't yeah, so you can't you can't win So it doesn't surprise me that a guy who has no human connection is never probably fit in too many places Is getting told things that he's never been told from another woman Um He's finally getting treated the way that he feels like something cares about him And it makes sense why he would get connected to it. It's not yelling at him. I'm not nagging him. Dude. Yeah, I mean there's a lot Listen, there's a lot of truth to that. Yeah, okay, and It makes me sad for people because for women to have a large portion of women to have the negative viewpoint of men that they do and then for men to have the same You know, we're ruining What What is a holy dynamic and um You know, I don't know dude. It's it's sad if fucking makes me sad to see that like there's no way a man Should be connecting with a fucking device in a romantic way. Yeah, and and I don't see this as like that woman's fault You know, I'm saying like she said oh isn't my fault No, I don't think it's I don't see it maybe it is, but I don't see it as an individual fault I see it as a fault of culture for the last 20 years. Yeah, and I see it as an engineered narrative to make men feel isolated and useless um for a number of reasons, you know, if you remove men from the family you don't get as many children, okay? if you remove men from their sense of You know protection and providing and being men You know, they become depressed they become weak they become you know Kind of what we've seen in society for the last number of years and it goes right in line with what they've done to you know men For throughout history. I mean dude. They just did it in different ways. You know, they they tried to create situations where men are intentionally Week, you know like in Rome they they didn't feed their soldiers and their gladiators like great food They they fed them enough food that they could sustain themselves, but also kept them As weak as they could so that they wouldn't revolt, you know And that's going on there there's that's going on for And many different societies and this is just the new version of that the new version of keeping men Unable to revolt is these This isolation culture this worthlessness culture this elevation of uh, you know feminism gone too far um the the abdication of of man and woman as traditional roles. I mean we go on and on and on but At the end of the day how I see this is just another situation where they use they're using another tool to make men Week And like we talk about all the time on the show, you know They can't have you strong. They can't have you wealthy. They can't have you healthy. They can't have you smart and intelligent They can't have you getting along with people that are different than you Uh, they can't have you believing that your voice matters Which is why they spend trillions of dollars to convince you of all those things And when we really look at it from a 10,000 foot view This is just another version of that. This is just another version of capturing men making them feel weak Getting them addicted to something else that doesn't really matter and removing their focus from the fact that They're completely they're slaves. I mean, that's what it comes down to and uh You know I thumbs bro, it stumps down and I don't know dude. I just feel like we as men uh I mean look I do everything I can there's nothing. I there's nothing. I do what I can I lived I live the best I can um But unless we get enough men to do that We're we're gonna get fucked. Yeah, we're gonna lose the country. We're probably gonna end up being killed at some point in time and I know people think oh that's fucking crazy. No, it's not you just don't know history And you just don't see it you know, like the way they did it before is it gonna be the way they do it now because we have technology now So I just there's a lot of things that makes me think and most of all it's just like Fuck You know like I was thinking this morning, dude, you know I don't really know if I want to fucking like If this is the way it's gonna go and because I got this message this morning from somebody basically like bitching About the way things were and all this shit and like kind of insinuating like what are you gonna do like what the fuck you mean? What am I gonna do? You're gonna do what are you gonna do? Yeah, right like I'm doing everything I can motherfucker I My whole life I've done everything I can that's why I have all these people that we create careers for that's why I Produced this show for free. That's why I don't take ads. I give up a lot to be a voice and to and I try to be an example Maybe I'm not perfect all the time. I'm not perfect all the time, but I do the best I can for real and You know people still think that someone's gonna come in and save their shit and like dude I was thinking after that message. I was like, you know Like bro, I don't even know if I want to live to see all this shit. That's about to happen You know what I mean? And I know that sounds fucking morbid, but like People don't seem very interested in saving themselves And it makes me wonder like fuck dude. What's actually gonna happen here? And I'm not sure I want to be a part of it You know, and that's just being real shit. I mean do look don't worry I mean, I'm not yeah, but I'm just saying like it doesn't get me excited about yeah Yeah, like what a what you know, what am I gonna be I'm gonna be so I'm gonna fucking die one day knowing that my generation of people Responsible for losing one of the greatest fucking things ever existed in human history the country of the United States America You know, I don't that doesn't sit well with me and it shouldn't sit well with any men You know, but but but but they'll have a million excuses bro I'm so worried about putting food on the bro. That's even more the reason why you should care Okay, the reason you have such a hard time putting food on the table isn't because of the Democrats or the Republicans It's because of the fuckers like Ted Cruz and all the other motherfuckers that take money to act in Ways that are not in the interest of the people which is pretty much the entire government all right, so Until people come to an understanding of who the real enemy is nothing's gonna change and it doesn't seem like we're getting any closer to that Yeah, man guys, let us know what you guys think down in the comments man with that being said any guys That's all I have yep. All right guys. Don't be a hoe Boxed frogs fuck up. Oh fuck a stone counting millions in a cold bad bitch Oh, it's woke got a own bank row can't fault. That's a no-hit shot case clothes
