fucking laugh to the point of where I get tears of my eyes yeah all right yeah so you know but we do talk about things when I suppose to talk about one of those things that we're not supposed to talk about is the plan of communism and how they use use for idiots right we talk about this quite a bit and I can't help but are one of our favorite ladies you all know her and love her Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton she's such a peach she's a she's so likable oh bro this video is I don't know what it is I don't know what it is about her but she I just she just warms my heart when I see her talk and I see her face it makes me so happy like a warm peach pie that's right yeah so this bitch Hillary Clinton Tucker Carlson is Putin's useful idiot he's like a puppy dog hmm okay tell me you made the Hillary Clinton list without telling me you made the Hillary Clinton list tell me you're projecting without telling me you're projecting this woman's favorite book by her own credit is rules for radicals by Salo Linsky it's one of the communist playbooks they use the term useful idiots in their way to take over what's going on if you go recall mark see this is the problem bro people don't read they don't read them they got they will not reach it they will not read because it's all there dude it's all been put there it's not like they're hiding it from us bro there it's legitimately a term that they use in the communist manifesto you know what I'm saying these are the people who help install communism and then when they're they didn't yeah when they're done with it bro that's insane yeah so let's talk about this now now by the way I know we covered the Tucker Carlson thing on the last cti but there is it is getting dropped tonight so this is it's Thursday when the show's being recorded so by the time you guys hear this tomorrow it's out the man how hard are they gonna go they might shut the motherfucking grid down tonight they might it's possible you guys may not even see the show we might we might be the warlord status by tomorrow yeah yeah well so so the Tucker Carlson Putin interview it's coming out tonight 6 p.m. Easter and I believe but but yes a former secretary Hillary Hillary Clinton said Wednesday on the msmbc's Alex Wagner tonight that Tucker Carlson was a quote useful idiot in quote to Russian president Vladimir Putin so Wagner said quote Tucker Carlson is in Moscow right now interviewing Vladimir Putin the first american I'll say journalist to interview Putin since the war in Ukraine began what does not what does not what oh no that's that's a typo that's not your fault yeah that's not my that's a first time ever listen I'm oh fuck holy shit bro that's an actual typo you didn't actually fuck out this show my holy fuck yeah no that it you bro it's it's them I almost understood it because well something right fuck it let's get to the clip here's the clip dude it's fucking them Tucker Carlson is in Moscow right now interviewing Vladimir Putin right yeah first American I'll say journalist to interview Putin since the war in Ukraine began what does that tell you about Tucker Carlson and right wing media and also Vladimir Putin well it shows me what I think we've all known he's what's called a useful idiot I mean if you actually read translations of what's being said on Russian media they make fun of him I mean he's like a puppy dog you know he somehow as after having been fired from so many outlets in the United States he I would not be surprised if he emerges with a contract with a Russian outlet because he is a useful idiot he says things that are not true he parrots Vladimir Putin's pack of lies about Ukraine so I don't see why Putin wouldn't give him an interview because through him he can you know continue to lie about what is you know objectives are in Ukraine and and you know what he expects to see happen it's really quite sad that not just somebody like Tucker Carlson who has as I said been fired so many times because he seems unable to you know correlate his reporting with the truth but also because it's a sign that there are people in this country right now who are like a fifth column for Vladimir Putin and why I don't know I mean why are certain Republicans throwing their lot in why are you know other Americans basically believing Putin why did Trump believe Putin more than our 11 intelligence agencies I don't know do you have a working theory you're working theory what the fault but but it's it's it's more than just the political part is an advantage there is a yearning for leaders who can kill and imprison their opponents destroy the press uh lead a life that is one of impunity unbound by what the fuck is she talking about what they're doing certain people in our country for that kind of leadership and I find that absolutely gobsmacking terrifying you should be terrified lady holy shit you're the biggest piece of shit liar in the history of humankind all the shit she just said they're doing right now they are doing all of them and by the way Tucker Carlson doesn't need a contract for Russian media because the motherfuckers gonna make 10 times more money than you ever made with Fox because he's the only mother fucker that's out here telling the truth why do they not want Vladimir Putin to be heard okay this lady made up a fucking document from Christopher steel okay that was blamed on fucking Russia for seven years to divide the American public and now she's on TV talking about how we yearn for blood thirsty leaders that ruin the media and oppress people and put people in jail what the fuck are you guys doing the only reason that anybody wants to hear what Putin has to say is because you guys are doing crazy shit dude it's insane it's insane but row these I can't believe that she is do you think of who think of how untouchable you must think you are to legit go on TV and say that shit when it's all the shit that you guys have been doing the entire time and just projected out there by the way by the way if you read the the calm if you read marks and you read the uh uh salulinsky's rules radicals it tells you in that book to do exactly what she's doing which is to say blame the other side for the same things that you're doing they talk about that in there that's that's the take so she's bro this is insane and people are so misinformed and so uneducated like who do you really think there's many people that actually believe her no you do you do I'm not at this point no I think if you'd I think there's a lot but I don't think there's nearly as many no I don't think there's that many you agree with that yeah but you know I want to take this time dude because you know she talks about useful at least I feel like let's let's show you what an actual useful it looks like and I think we take that time to take this time to do that so this head language watch KJP tries to shut down foxes p.2ducey for asking my Biden talks to dead people you seen this no okay let's let's watch this clip um and how is president Biden ever going to convince the three quarters of voters were worried about his physical and mental health that he is okay even though in Las Vegas he told the story about recently talking to a French president who died in 1996 I'm not even gonna go down that rabbit hole with you sir we're gonna go go ahead he said talk to mid-orange good you saw the president in Vegas in California you've seen the president in South Carolina you saw him in mesh mesh again I'll just leave it there go ahead yeah right that's a useful idiot yeah that's correct actually I don't think she's even the useful idiot she's in on it okay the useful idiot is the person who believes all the propaganda of the media of the government and advocates for the big farm industries okay they believe all the social movements they believe all of these things they believe that the media is telling the truth the government has their best interests pharma has their best interests they believe that cova was a thousand percent real j6 with thousand percent real Ukraine was a thousand percent in our interest the Middle East is a thousand percent in it they believe everything that the media tells them to believe and then get activated around it that's what the useful idiots are they believe all the social narratives all the propaganda and then they call everybody else a fascist not realizing that fascism is the coordinated effort between the government the media and the biggest companies on the planet to oppress the common person which is them and they don't understand that whenever the revolution happens the revolution they're fighting for that they want the redistribution of wealth the universal basic universal basekin come all this shit if all that shit came to pass okay and it all we talked about this when we had a Curtis Bowers on the show who did agenda and agenda to he's dedicated his life to communism what these people don't understand is that once that communist revolution is locked in in place they are the first people that are killed because they will not fucking work they will not contribute to the common interests they they think they're going to sit on their couch all day and and Viva la revolution you know and bro they're going to kill you and like we're over here fucking common sense people saying hey this is what this is and those people like fuck you fascist those are the useful idiots bro yeah I just thought it was funny though I mean she's like well you seen them in you seen them in South Carolina you've seen them in all these places I gotta clip let's watch what he what he looked like we know what he looked like some of those places the beer brewed here it is used to make the brew beer do in this the final oh orthrider thanks for the great legs I wonder why this time makes sense yep it makes me completely confident in this guy let's watch it one more time let's give him the newt coats oh wait he's already got him right no shit the beer brewed here it is used to make the brew beer do in this the final oh orthrider thanks for the great legs I wonder why this time could you fucking you know you know who I feel bad for I feel because you know like every time the president speaks there's a report like a type that shit out that has a type that's cool what do they call that got the court reporter stenographer stenographer stenographer that's what it is that's what it was I feel bad for that person because like could you imagine having to sit there no and like what the fuck did you did they got a fucking private stenographer fucking Facebook group and they're like fuck I got you all by today oh like bro that's gotta be a very painful job oh come on man like you know they just sitting there you know they you know what they do they just here they just trying to they they're making the decisions they're like fuck I think he said this and I remember like okay so you know you can go to a whitehouse.gov and you can actually pull the transcripts like you can see it like you can actually see what the fuck they do when they when they do they are they are on the spot bullshitters they gotta be because there's no way to fucking interpret that oh fuck man all right man let's get it to the show guys remember if you were to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to andyfacela.com you guys can find them link there that big set head on them boy let's get into a talk of the day Supreme Court Supreme Court justices indicate they'll keep Trump on 2024 ballot in landmark case oh this came out today yeah really what they say yeah so let's dive into it so you know we covered the pellet court turn them down and all I got I got so to everybody all that does just fast tracks it to the to the Supreme Court and so let's dive into this article so a clear majority of the Supreme Court's nine justices signal Thursday that they would overturn a Colorado ruling barring former president Donald Trump from the states Republican presidential primary ballot so there's two cases they're taking up this is the first when they come in that comes from the Colorado's kicking Trump off the ballot right and then the case that we talked about the other day is I believe they're turning on Monday they'll start reviewing that one so this is about keeping Trump off the ballot and if the state has the power to do it so the former president 77 and his lawyers were appealing the December 19th decision by a Colorado Supreme Court that found Trump ineligible for the March 5th GOP contest by virtue of violating the Constitution so-called insurrection clause during the J6 2021 Capitol riot and it's everywhere now once you guys look at the language that MSM is using in these headlines this headline reads justices appear hostile to Trump's disqualification effort or this one that's pretty poor it sounds broadly skeptical of efforts to kick Trump off ballot over Capitol attack so they're not going for it and more than two hours of arguments both conservative and liberal justices raised questions of whether Trump can be disqualified from being president again because of his efforts to undo his loss in the 2020 election ending with the J6 attack on the US Capitol the primary concern was whether Congress must act before states can invoke the constitutional provision that was adopted after the Civil War to prevent former office holders who quote engaged in insurrection from withholding office again now there are also questions about whether the president is covered by the provision eight of the nine justices suggested that they were open to at least some of the arguments made by Jonathan Mitchell Trump's lawyer at the Supreme Court uh Trump could win his case if the court finds just one of those arguments persuasive only justice Sonya Sotomayor sounded like she might vote to uphold the Colorado Supreme Court ruling the found that Trump quote engaged in insurrection and is indelible to be president the state court ruled Trump should not be on the ballot for the state's Republican primary on March 5th so what exactly is Trump's attorneys arguing Trump's attorneys argues before Supreme Court that criteria for insurrection was not met quote the Colorado Supreme Court concluded that the violent attempts of the petitioner supports justice Katanjee Jackson acts Trump's attorney Jonathan Mitchell in this case to halt the count on January 6 qualified as an insurrection as defined by section three and I read your opening brief to accept that those events counted as an interaction but then your reply seems to suggest that they were not so what's your what is your position Mitchell clarified that quote we never accept it or concede it in our opening brief that this was an insurrection what we said in our opening brief was president trump did not engage in any act that can plausibly be characterized as insurrection quote so why would not go another one bro what the two in the same show is it me it's not me no it's not you bro that's not I would not be an insurrection I'm assuming why would that not be in this yeah shit bro they're about to get you today try to get me down that's right I just want to read that's fucking racist these guys are fucking racist oh man fuck what is your what is your argument that it's not your reply brief says that it wasn't because I think you say it did not involve an organized attempt to overthrow the government Jackson acts quote so that's one of many reasons before an insurrection there needs to be an organized concerted effort to overthrow the government of the United States through violence in this Mitchell was interrupted by Jackson so the point is that a chaotic effort to overthrow the government is not an insurrection quote we didn't concede that it's an efforts over through the government either just as Jackson none of these criteria were met this was a riot it was not an insurrection the events were shameful criminal violent all of those things but did not qualify as insurrection as that term is used in section three and trump's pretty happy about how it went he's quoted saying I think it was well received trump argues among other things that the clause doesn't apply to him and said he thought the presentation of his attorney Jonathan Mitchell made in front of the spring court was quote a very good one and what do we got on all of this I mean look dude uh there's like three times the amount of firearms in the United States then there are in every single country in the entire world combined okay so when we think about what an insurrection is and what these little fucking pussy bitches think one is they should think twice about what that actually looks like because there are 400 or something how many guns in the United States it's like 400 million some crazy amount yeah fuck it might be warning that what is it 494 million 494 million how many guns are in the rest of the world I know it's bigger than all the military no it's three times the size it's it's I'd read a stat on it just like two days ago anyway it's irrelevant the point is there's five hundred million guns in this country there's fucking basically what two and a two guns for every single fucking citizen in this country and by the way now there's a whole group of political there's a whole political group that I know any guns and then so that means all 500 million of those guns are on one side of the political aisle and in the middle okay so when we think about what an insurrection would actually look like that should be considered in the conversation I think it should not because a bunch of fucking little weak disgusting fucking people that come out when violence is going on with their nerf pool noodles and shit and their trash can lids think that it's an insurrection if it was an insurrection you'd fucking know it wouldn't be here right now now you wouldn't bro they couldn't stop it there's too many people there's too many guns and the military would be incapable of fucking doing shit about it that's the honest to God's truth no nobody knows that hold on so if we're going to call an insurrection a bunch of people who showed up to support president Trump regardless of what you think of president Trump as some sort of you know and do we can break this down all the bullshit right all the FBI involvement that's you know been allegedly shown uh and then the videotapes that are with hidden 12,000 hours of footage J6 prison there's not a single one charge with insurrection okay this was a fucking intimidation tactic to keep people from protesting the last three and a half years and it's worked that that is why they put the domestic terror list out and it's worked it's kept people in check because and now people are to the point where they're like and this is just reality and I'm not saying I'm not saying violence is the answer but I am saying that if this shit continues violence is going to be on the table for a lot of people in this country and and so when we talk about what an insurrection actually is that's not an insurrection by any definition of the word no definition in history yeah it's bullshit and these people you know this goes back to what Hillary Clinton was saying on the intro bro you know she's talking about the government being weaponized against her political opponents that's what this is that's why they put fences up around the White House for six weeks when they did the inauguration that's why Nancy Pelosi said no to 20,000 troops to come regulate the crowd on January 6 when they were having that rally that's why they that's in the troops that were there to make sure that there was no bias towards bro bro like they're listening dude they're guilty as fuck of what they did that dude in my opinion this is my opinion and you could say whatever you want they stole the fucking election they know they stole it there was highly manipulated and they did everything that they could to fucking protect themselves and get him in the office and now we're going to do everything they can again to steal this next election you guys don't realize it yet but they're going to do it and there's going to be a there is going to come a time in this country in the next 12 months where we are going to have to decide what country we're going to be are we going to be a communist country with two fucking classes of people the ruling class and the oppressed slave class or are we going to be what America has always been designed to be that is going to be the choice that we're all going to have to make or in the next year and that's real yeah and do they even bring up the fucking tweets they got to leave it like to me that's like that's all is it all bro the guys on Twitter I don't care what you think of them the guys on Twitter while it's going on saying hey go home don't do this we go home blah blah blah they fucking delete his Twitter account no why would they do that because they don't want people to see it's the same reason they want they don't want Putin to be on fucking TV yep you can leave no place these people are completely exposed the emperor has no clothes they're completely corrupt they're acting in their own interests not in our interests and they know they're exposed and they continue to push because they realize they are exposed so I would expect them to get a lot more aggressive with their pushes and we the citizens are going to have to decide where to line is and I can tell you this because dude you you guys can imagine I get a lot of messages from a lot of people there's a lot of people that are way more fucking aggressive than I am want me speaking of our pushes but I just see the shit they did to Bolsonaro in Brazil no they rated his house in tart and then now they're accusing him of espionage and a coup yeah they're going to try to kill him they took his passport like bro I mean like yeah you talk about pushing they're going to try to kill them they're pushing bro the Brazilian people all those millions of people they cannot fucking tolerate this no like these and I know a lot of you guys are in Brazil and you listen you cannot tolerate that bro you cannot let them kill that dude your fucking country will be ruined you the millions of you cannot be cowards you cannot stay home you cannot let it let just let this happen you can't do it eventually at some point very soon citizens across the world are going to have to decide how much more are we going to fucking take that is something that is going to be very difficult for people to decide because there could be real sacrifice there but these people are all full committed on globalism they're all cooperating with each other they're all working in a global coordinated effort and they will stop at nothing to get what they're trying to do that's the truth so what are you going to let them take from you are you gonna you know that's that's where we're going to have to fucking come come to you in terms of our decision making no and these are use these are use for idiots this picture we're showing right here let the reckoning begin Trump is a traitor no the mother fuckers you believe are traders are the people have stuff mask on me yeah I actually feel sorry for people to still wear a mask I we I you know I've been to a couple restaurants in the last couple weeks and they're still waitresses and shit wearing a mat and do those people are psychologically abused they were psychologically abused so hard that they can't even feel safe in public yeah it's it's fucked up man say I mean guys jump in on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think that being said let's head to them cruise comments yeah this uh this comment comes from at Ryan holder 423 says first episode back listening after four weeks as soon as I heard quote cruise the mfing internet with no sensor I knew this was going to be a good one yeah we're done with that shit we're done with that shit I like we're over here let me tell you something I'm gonna tell you guys the real shit okay YouTube came to us ask us to put the fucking show on video which has been a net positive all right I'll say that they promised us that they would not censor our shit promised us like I had what we have I was money first they offered us a lot of money yeah to come it was a special promotion they were doing to get audio pop because my audio my audio listenership platform is much much much bigger than video okay we just started a video we've got what 450 thousand subscribers we just started trying on YouTube a year ago okay so up until then it was random videos posted once in a while and so we've had some success it's been a positive I think the show works well on video however they have not upheld their end of the bargain they made it extremely hard for us we spent the first six months with our channel dinged and all these fucking things and and they they made us start bleeping words out cuss words this that the other to even get in the algorithm and if you notice this is why our personal development shit rockets off into space and our cti shit doesn't it's very obvious yeah I think that's actually that like that that happened because we didn't take the money because you stood strong with values and we were like what did they do that we did fuck up where we started trying to fucking you know start playing their game a little bit we shouldn't play their game none of us shit take us off yeah so occasionally there will be a few times where I might drop like 30 f bombs and we might bleep them out for the sake of like little kids in their house and stuff sure but at the end of the day I'm done with these people they lie to us they told us they wouldn't fuck with us and they do and so I you know it is what it is so if you guys like the shows please share them out that's that's why we ask you to share the show super important so even Randy Consella agrees with you that is not me no no that's fucking you I don't want to hear that shit look dude everybody this fucking room got a fucking you know do that shit that's you that is me but it's not me bro I don't get in the comments on the internet dude I don't I don't do that shit I don't get in the comments section I don't I'm I'm beyond that shit bro like it is what it is people are gonna like me they're gonna not like me I'm not gonna argue with people I think my body of work speaks for itself I am what the fuck I am if you don't like it that's okay if you do if you do pick these up on the fuckers yeah that's what I say like I don't dude it's it is what it is I'm not doing that I got too much other shit real life to this this is one of the reasons I don't fucking post anymore because I would get so many comments I'd be in the comments talking to people it take two three hours in my day trying to think you can respond yeah I think I might start posting again though I'm thinking about posting again in my in my actual feed on Instagram for the main reason of I want to give these young entrepreneurs a visual understanding of what real entrepreneurship looks like because I feel like the internet has gone a weird direction in terms of entrepreneurship culture and I'm start her mose he's been telling me this dude Alex is such a good dude and I fucking love him dude he's he's he he's fucking brilliant especially for being 10 years younger than me but he's been you know on my ass you know he's been trying to go to me's I brought my fucking smoke you if you don't start you know he started to talk that shit but I love him for it because dude what he wants is people to get the benefit and you know the value yes and it's it's I think he's he's getting through to me because he's been hammering on me for like a year on this and I think I do have an obligation you know I say this a lot I talk about the obligation for successful people to show their success but I don't show my success like I used to you know what I mean because it makes me feel weird dude I'm not a like I'm a normal dude that's just worked really hard you know what I mean and but that is like more reason why to show it yeah but I don't want to come off as one of these fucking turds that just you know what I'm saying you know you know you know you're gonna say it's like a it's like a hard thing for me to do but anyhow I think I am gonna start posting because I think the good outweighs the bad yeah so yeah I just want to start telling stories again about my journey and what I think is relevant to people and you know I might like just make the comments you know or turn the comments off so I don't have to fucking deal with them or whatever right or make the comments people I follow just so I don't have to get in there and fucking

great eyes shut the fuck up for photography he's fucking good anyway we love you Dave I want to show DJ's a big it guys at line number two and on two reads Trump said to sweep the Nevada caucuses after Nikki Haley's embarrassing loss to no one bro that's great bro how do you lose listen just tell him because that matter everybody knows so you gotta do you lose to nobody explain so Trump said to sweep Nevada caucuses after Nikki Haley's embarrassing loss to no one as senior advisor cash potato reveals how she got trounced by ex president even though he wasn't on the ballot stopping to this so Donald Trump is preparing a second victory in Nevada as he heads to Las Vegas for the caucuses Thursday following his symbolic win on Tuesday Republican voters in the battle-born state selected none of these candidates at a 32.9% higher rate than opting to vote for Nikki Haley in Nevada's primary election so even Donald Trump's team was shocked by the amount of Nevada voters willing to cast her ballot for no one instead of former UN ambassador Haley who is the final primary competitor for the former president cash potato a senior advisor to Trump to dailymail dot com during an interview in Las Vegas on Wednesday that Haley quote overshot by thinking she could avoid campaigning at all in Nevada and still win the primary on Tuesday quote maybe you wouldn't have got trounced by no one if you showed up and put in the work potential set of Haley's campaign quote this is emblematic of the whole entire thing like where do you go with that you the billion dollar candidate lost to no one we convinced 45,000 people to circle quote none of the above that's insane he laughed that's better than right in candidate levels so Trump was not on the ballot okay and the people of Nevada had a choice to make that had a couple options they could go with Nikki Haley they could go with none of the above I think it was all the options now there was like a bunch like no name people yeah there was a few now no people well that's embarrassing as fuck 63% of the votes went to none of bro imagine being one of her donors imagine being one of her donors giving her millions of dollars yeah millions dollars you're not going to get back because she ain't going to win all right and you keep giving her money they keep running ads in all these places and she's getting her ass beat well that's nothing to the most people don't get to like with these campaigns right like the candidates they're making money not directly right but all that campaign money comes in whatever's not spent at the end of it or whenever she decides to quit they send that to a special pack with gin goes right back to Haley she's gonna make some money off of this shit dude listen to me at this point that's almost like like you're rolling it makes you wonder why she's still going like exactly you know what I'm saying like when I watch what's going on here with this at first I'm like laughing okay yeah dude this lady's getting killed everywhere she goes obvious nobody likes her and the more she goes the longer she goes here the the more people are not liking her she's not gaining ground she's losing ground there's where's the sportsmanship of just bowing out because dude I believe there's a bigger plan here you know the vacant has been talking about how remember when they came out and said hey there's there's a bigger plan here it's Nikki Haley she's the controlled op she's one of them and you know you guys say whatever you want about the vague I've talked to the event quite a bit I like him I think you know he has some past situations like every single fucking human and the history of earth has but I think he's a genuine patriot and I think he's very intelligent and I think his assessment of the situation is correct because when we look at what's happening with Haley there's no reason for her to stay in unless she knows something that we don't know yeah like is because she knows the poll yeah she sees the fucking dude what I'm saying is what so what is she counting on happening you see what I'm saying yeah why would people continue to give her money and by the way some of her donors are also big huge Democrat donors you know she does not represent conservatism and by the way I'm not a conservative I mean middle of the road person I have some liberal beliefs I have some conservative beliefs I would consider what I am closest to if we're going to put a label on it libertarian I fucking knew it well I am I am I don't agree with some of their stuff too I think I think I have better policy ideas than what they have true and I think their organization is very weak because some of their policy ideas are so outlandish that the regular person cannot grasp it which is what makes it hard for them to gain traction but I would say if I identify with a group I identify with those guys you know what I mean I have liberal social beliefs which a lot of you guys listening disagree with and that's okay that's what makes America America but I have conservative fiscal beliefs and unfortunately I I side with the conservatives completely now even on the social issues because I've recognized a slippery slope that has been created by socially liberal ideals so we have to have some correction to move back towards common sense so we can have some structure and civility amongst our country and when I look at Nikki Haley and she runs as a Republican or a conservative bro she is none of those things she is a she is an establishment pawn that is in there to fleece America as hard as she possibly can she's going to continue with these neck like Joe Biden doing all these things do it these wars and the inflation all the shit she's going to do the same shit like you know and people got to stop voting for people because they're a woman or because they're a black or because they're this or that and start voting for who's going to do the best job for you who's going to make your household run better and I think most people are starting to understand yeah dude when Trump was in office I had a lot more money I had a lot less stress my life was a lot better and ultimately I think that's what's going to swing the vote in favor for Trump but unfortunately I don't know that the vote's going to be enough I don't I mean I I put it this way I will be shocked shot and I mean when I say shocked I mean completely fucking shocked if we don't have a major COVID level disruption in the net between now and November because remember dude this is February when did COVID happen it was like March the beginning of March yeah okay and then all of a sudden the world was completely different and so I believe they have some and I've talked to the options endlessly on the show you know war pandemic cyber attack whatever it is illegal migrants revolting right there's going to be some sort of major disruption and division attempt amongst the identity politics because that's all these people can do all they can do is divide us all they can do is get us to hate each other that's their mo because it gets them the space to do whatever they're going to do and so when I see what's going on dude I would be shocked if we if we if just a vote puts Trump back in office I would be completely fucking shocked by that that's my personal take and that's why I think Americans need to decide what they're going to tolerate are you going to stand by and watch people legit pull a coup in our country or are you going to stand up and say something and do something about it that's going to be a decision that we're all going to have to make in my opinion because I don't think just showing up and voting even if it's fucking clearly obvious like bro when we went and voted when you and I went and voted together every single motherfucker and I'm talking about in 2020 every single person there was a Trump supporter all of them bro it was like a party okay and I will say we're in Missouri okay so that's not abnormal but St. Louis has a lot of Democrats we didn't see any no in fact we talked to a number of people who said I've always voted Democrat I'm voting for Trump so we'll see man but that's just what I think they're guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let's know what you guys think she doesn't represent anything that we the people need at all she has no she has so many like there's so much evidence of like blatant contradictions that she makes like she says this but then you go back four years she says she's saying listen you got to remember and no give me that people can change but remember remember this bro being president of the United States like little kids grow up with that dream you know what I'm saying like there are people that grow up with the dream of being president for no other reason than they just want it for themselves they don't care what they don't care about doing the job they care about being called president and this is what makes this is actually a good entrepreneurship lesson because good CEOs and people who win they don't give a fuck about being called CEO they don't care about being the leader they care about getting the job done that is what the greatest leaders of organizations of teams of countries do she is not one of these people all right and I'm not sure that any of these people are entirely aligned that way but eventually we have to get America back to a point where the people who are leading this country are solely fixated on the best possible outcome for our country not because they're the man or they're the president or they're the most powerful leader in the world that position appeals to a lot of people with you know crazy amounts of ego because they want to hold that power and they want to be quote unquote president you know and so we have to consider that bro she's just one of these people she's just one of these people that wants to be president so bad she gives no fucks about any of us and we need different kinds of leadership man and dude people will say to me when I say that they will always get the people who hate Trump will say oh you're gonna fucking say ego look at Trump's ego yeah I know I think that's a fault of Trump's I think Trump's ego is a fault of his but it also requires a massive ego in a big set of balls to do that job the right way and when you consider what this man is given up to become that bro this got people don't understand this when you're at his level and you're worth billions of dollars you get to do anything you want there's no limit there's no restrictions and if most of you had that resources those resources available to you what would you do would you give all of that up to go get attacked and get berated and get harassed every single fucking day would you like honestly dude like would you and I think so so when we look at Trump and I agree I can understand people have different opinions on but that's what I see because I've experienced a little bit of that in my life I've built some things I've I've I have pretty much no limits to the things that I can do personally because I've dedicated my life to business for the last 25 years and because of that I have a lot of freedom and to trade that freedom and say I'm not going to live this life anymore I'm going to go instead get my balls kicked in by everybody that's in my opinion that's respectables fuck and so I can look past the ego issue and some of the other things because I think out of all the people that are available to us he's got our interest in mind the most yeah and and you some of you may disagree with that and maybe I'm wrong maybe the history books will show different but that's how I read it yeah guys let's get to our third and final headline headline number three let's check in with congress okay um you know because they they didn't they didn't do too good I think they fucked up all right but it's okay because I got something for that so head on to house GOP fails to impeach my orcs over boarding handling so yeah they didn't get them they didn't get them house Republicans high stakes gamble to impeach Alejandro my orcs just barely failed on Tuesday and embarrassing political setback for an already imbattle majority the articles of impeachment against the homeland security secretary failed in a 214 to 216 vote after four Republicans sided with Democrats to oppose recommending my orcs be booted from office but Republican lawmakers quickly predicted they will bring it back up once majority leader Steve Scalise who is undergoing treatment for blood cancer returns quote we'll bring it back the guy deserves to be impeached at homeland security chair Mark Green from Tennessee who has led the effort against my orcs so the account was initially tied after reps Ken Buck my Gallagher and Tom McClink talk voted with Democrats against impeaching my orcs Republicans including Green I spent several see broke that's three spent spent look at that shit damn dude they're getting you today it's his races Jesus how's it feel bro listen how's it feel to be the victim of real race I'm offended for me yeah I'm offended for you think this is bullshit we're gonna go march around the building Jesus man this is crazy it's gonna march going it's been several minutes huddled with Gallagher on the floor in an apparent effort to change his vote one person close to the conversation grants it anonymity to speak candidly said members argued to Gallagher that he would be inviting strong blowback from the base so these guys know that the people want them out it's very obvious that the people want them out and yeah they they started with the other side but like I said that's what I mean okay they didn't do that they did something good right our Congress our people that are elected to to to represent us they did something good US Senate advances wartime aid package for Ukraine and Israel Jesus man yep completely leaving out the border this is insanity so the synonym these people should all be removed from office immediately every single one of them dude every single one of them they are not acting in the interest of this country we are not at the peak of power and prestige and great economic situations and wealth and strength and we're still pretending like we are and we're sending all these people are stealing our fucking money it was a hundred and fifteen billion dollar bill right that included Ukraine Israel some foreign aid stuff but importantly 20 billion directed towards the border because they can pass it they redid it took the only thing they took out was the border deal so still a ninety five billion dollar emergency bail that those US Senate is advancing and pushing through do you not remember when Trump could have finished the border wall for five billion dollars when he was in office and they wouldn't fund it five billion dollars we wouldn't even have this issue but they're sending hundreds of billions of dollars to these other places that you and I and most of us will never ever ever fucking go he's going tomorrow I'm talking about us no no people who are paying for it no how does that make you feel guys like how do you feel about that how do you feel about paying all these taxes and seeing all this money go all over the place except here what's your community to look like yeah for real dude what your streets look like what you're what you're down town look like what's your homeless situation like because I could tell you here in St. Louis it's not great people are hard hurting people are struggling people are I mean dude in dire need of a better situation and I feel like this is across the country and yet these people who are completely out of touch who don't give any fucks about you or me or any of us out here they don't have any problem going on like going out there and sending all of our money all these other places they do not care if we don't like it how is that a representative government that's what this country was built around taxation with representation and they're not representing us at all but yet they are taking from us at every chance they can get how do you guys feel about that for real because that's got to be something that we can all found common ground is the misuse of our tax dollars the over taxation of us the financial oppression of our own citizens for the gain of 500 to 600 people in Washington DC how is that okay there's nobody it's okay with that the only people that are okay with that are people who do not have a job and do not pay taxes this is why people who do not pay into the system should not be allowed to have a say on how the system operates they should not be allowed to vote if you have a job and you're 15 and you pay tax you can vote I can respect that I respect that a hell lot more than some person who's 35 years old who's waiting for the government just to fund their existence and then voting our government away and our systems away to their benefit while we are the regular people I hear trying to work you see what I'm saying or vote to make it harder for us to work that broke that well that's what they vote for the whole game is to get every single person that they can to buy into the idea of a socialist situation where wealth is distributed and so what they want to do is they want to take the wealth of the people who work and they want to make equity in equality happen equality of result not equality of opportunity America was and is supposed to be a quality of opportunity not equality of result but they get these people to vote and what they're trying to do is shift enough people over to that side so they have a permanent base of people who do not pay into the system who are actually calling the shots of the system and then they can come in every two years and promise you more free shit and they'll continue to get voted for that's their whole play here their whole play is to get enough people from the working class to be unemployed and accept the idea of government assistance that they will continue to vote for the people who say we're going to give you more government assistance and eventually what's going to happen is and this is described very detailed through a very long book that you can go on Google and summarize called Atlas Shrugged they talk about this the per when the producers stop producing because it's not worth it to anymore do you know what happens to those people the rest of those people over here on right now they're on the left who all want free shit they starve because the producers are always going to produce for themselves like if I said today hey fuck this I'm done I'm closing shop I don't care it's not worth it because they're taxing me to death they're making me jump through all these hoops I don't care anymore which will happen eventually it will we will come to a time where it's not worth it to stay in business because it's it's too hard because the government's taking too much and we're almost there like it's almost at that point you ask any business owner small medium where we are like yeah according to the data it's like 40% of eligible workers aren't working right now yeah so so when that when we when that happens those people they'll go home and start a garden and they'll be armed and they'll handle their own shit and if you come on their property they'll put a fucking hole in your head okay that's what will happen those people will continue to survive and the rest of the people who have continued to vote for this dependent state will starve and this is what happens in every single communist revolution in the history of time there are books about it there are there are lots of books about it but people don't read books anymore they only look a tic-tac books are racist I'm just saying man like people don't understand what's about to happen the minute the the government makes it too hard for private businesses to to be around and not provide jobs most of these people will starve they will fucking starve it will be called a famine which happens in every single communist revolution that's ever happened in the history of fucking time and that's why it happened yes it happens because the people producing the shit are like fuck it's not worth it that's why it's called Atlas shrugged because Atlas is the guy with the world on his back and that's the entrepreneur class by the way and eventually when it's not worth it they shrugged and say fuck it and the world fucking crashes and they keep going no dad something on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck um Andy like sonos who sonos like a sona I'm not like the co plunge no not really I like the co plunge but the
