We'll answer it right here on the show Now this is your first time listening. We do have multiple formats of the show We like to say shows within the show. All right, sometimes we have Q and a F That's what you're gonna get today other times you have CTI that stands for cruise the internet That's where we talk about what's going on in the world We throw some headlines up on the screen. We speculate on what's true and what's not true And then we talk about how we the people need to solve these problems going on in the world Other times we have real talk real talk is just five to 20 minutes and we give you some real talk Some things I think you need to hear and then we have 75 hard versus and that's where somebody who has completed the 75 hard program comes on the show Talks about how they were before how they are now how the 75 hard program has helped them get their shit together and how it can for you as well too If you're unfamiliar with 75 hard it is the initial phase of the live hard program It is available for free at episode 208 on the audio feeds It is not on YouTube. We just started YouTube about a year ago. So That episode is only on audio and you get the whole program there for free 75 hard is not a challenge. It is not a trend. It is not some internet bullshit It is the world's most popular in history mental recalibration program that will help you figure out How to get your life online and on track? There is a book about this. There's actually two books There's a book called 75 hard and then there's a book called the book on mental toughness I would buy the book on mental toughness, but it includes the entire 75 hard book on the inside plus the following phases of live hard and also 10 plus chapters on mental toughness and Case studies on some real world examples about how they use mental toughness to build incredible lives These are people that you guys have heard of so Get the program for free episode 208 you can buy the book at Andy for cella.com It's called the book on mental toughness is not required, but it's a great book and I know you'll love it So other than that you'll notice we don't run ads on the show I don't take money from people that are gonna tell me what I can and can't say on the show the shows call real a f It's not called listen to these sponsors AF.

We might have a new podcast launching soon Called the MSCO project you might have heard of it only been trying to relaunch this for a year and a half But we got that coming down the pipe. I think that's something that's important to talk about though I mean people you know when you talk about launching something especially something that is gonna provide as much value It is that should take time. Yeah, like you want to make sure that it's right Yeah, just jump it into things. That's not true. That's how you do it It's important you guys understand this podcast will not be on iTunes. It will be on a private server So keep an eye out for my stories on Instagram keep an eye out for what we got going on the show because it's not just gonna launch on this YouTube channel or this feed It's gonna be kept on a whole new feed and you'll you'll understand why when I explain it to you But we got that coming down the pipe. That's exciting Yeah, man energy drinks rolling out good picking up accounts every day things are going well people love it Off to a good year. Yeah, yeah, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good start.

I do post every single day That's what you forget I post every single day on my Andy Graham it comes to your email directly to your email All right, and the reason I did that is because I get fucked with almost more than anybody on the internet and Quite honestly, I was scared they're gonna delete my entire account my whole following and I wouldn't have shit So I started that specifically so that I could keep in contact with you if they deleted my shit So I took my post from Instagram. I put them into an email list and a blog Fuck four years ago and we've been doing it that way. Yeah, so Andy grams of fire. Yeah, well It's a nice people should subscribe if you guys want to read my shit and what I write and what I think That's a great way to get it plus we always stay in contact no matter what these guys on social media do to us So if you're not registered there and you're not on that list You're not gonna know when the the new podcast launches because that's worth gonna get launched at yeah through my email I love it, man, so sweet. Well, let's get some people better here, man. I got three good ones for you cool guys Andy question number one Hey Andy, I have recently been promoted to assistant manager in my workplace This is coming with a few more responsibilities including holding monthly meetings with our small group of employees Mm-hmm. I'm struggling with these meetings I tend to freeze up and just completely forget all I had planned I'm lucky to have a manager that is working with me and help me through the first meeting I want to succeed in this role and eventually move into a sales position. What advice do you have to get better speaking to groups? Reps, man. It's reps. Okay, nobody's born with this skill of holding a great meeting or being a great speaker Or going up there and just you know delivering a message in the way that needs to be delivered from the get go That's not a real thing. I've never seen anybody be able to do that ever now are some people a little bit better naturally than others Sure, but usually that What we perceive to be better has more to do with them not being a self-conscious Mm-hmm And just going up and doing the job as opposed to people who overthink and get paralyzed by the pressure of Delivering a meeting or public speaking So this is a very important skill for you guys to develop if you do not develop how to hold a meeting or how To public speak you're you are going to be very limited in your income producing capabilities that's reality all right, so when it comes down to Having a meeting and you're just getting started realize that we all start there all right when I started given meetings You have to realize the first six years of our business It was like me and Chris and then some friends who kind of filled in just to help us run the first store in the second store And then we went from one store to six stores because we bought out this failing business and took over a bunch of stores at once So we went from one store to six stores within 30 days So we went from not having to have any meetings to Having to manage a whole bunch of people and I had no idea how to do that because I had never done that before like real employees Yes, yeah There it wasn't just me and Chris and three of our friends from the bar that helped us run these two stores anymore Now it's there's 15 20 people that are we have to coordinate to do what we're trying to do and I had no experience with that So I can remember sitting in those meetings and Standing up and legit holding my piece of paper and it like shaking because I was so nervous and that went on for years That went on for probably from 2006 To 2010 for so far about four years, bro. Every single meeting I gave I I was nervous It came out weird. I knew I always messed it up But after every single one of those meetings I gave myself an honest assessment. I said all right, how'd you do? Well, I delivered this point good. I delivered this point good I missed on this point in this point. I really got to nervous here I don't know why and I give myself some honest coaching and also this is translates to sales interactions as well If you actually take the time to break down your sales interactions in an honest way You'll be able to coach yourself into being a productive salesperson, but we're talking about speaking so I would break down my My speaking Play by play over and over and over and every single time I did a meeting I would do that and we had meetings every single week so for four years that's roughly what You know, we have 52 meetings a year times four. It's 200 and fucking eight meetings So you have 208 meetings that I put under my belt. Yeah, all right That it took me to get the jitters out right and here's the thing though You know a lot of you guys know me as a speaker right? I get paid a whole lot of money to go speak in front of a lot of people to deliver a message and that's where that skill came from That skill came from that scared dude who was scared to have a meeting in front of 10 or 12 people 15 people To someone who can go out on stage in front of 25,000 people and blow their fucking minds and that's the power of reps I don't have a natural skill set for this in fact when I took public speaking in college I got a D all right and by me doing this these meetings and then working the sales floor of a retail spot and then doing the Podcast on top of it it gave me thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of reps that allowed me to learn how to speak In a way that resonated with people and so To all of you guys out here who look at all these people, you know There's a lot of people who pretend like they have this natural skill and they were born with this and the reason they do this It's because their ego is overinflated and they want you to like worship them and think they're special But the truth of the matter is none of these people are special not a single one. I fucking know all of them I know them all all the people you think are big deal on the internet I fucking know them every single one of them I fucking know them and I'm telling you right now The ones who try to pretend like they've got it all figured out they're fucking lying because I also know their bullshit behind closed doors Okay, this is hard for everybody Everybody starts in a very difficult spot when it comes to Public speaking and communicating to a group. That's a hard skill to learn Actually, I think that that it's not that hard to learn You just have to be willing to be bad at it for a certain amount of time and then it starts to get better and better and better So my answer to you is to Understand that you're supposed to be bad right now you just started you given one meeting bro You're not gonna come in and blow people's fucking brains up, you know what I'm saying? Like you're gonna You're gonna suck. Yeah, it's not gonna happen that will come with time though That will come with time you're gonna get you're gonna give a meeting a meeting a meeting and you're gonna do hundreds of meetings and hundreds of reps and Eventually you're gonna get on like a little role in your meeting and At the end of it people are just gonna look at you and they're gonna start clapping and you're gonna be like what and That's how it starts you just start to get better and better and better and better with reps So understand one you're supposed to be bad to the only way to get better is to be willing to go down the path and look stupid Which is what most people aren't willing to do most people spend their entire lives afraid to even start Because they are concerned about what people might think they tell themselves all these stories They're gonna get laughed at they're gonna get made fun of people are gonna talk shit and guess what? They're gonna talk shit either way. They're gonna talk shit if you go and try and look stupid and fall on your face or They're gonna talk shit if you don't try and you become just a fucking loser. All right, so people are gonna talk They're gonna laugh. They're going to give you shit This is a natural part of life and they're gonna do it whether you go down the path or whether you don't And so you have to ask yourself do you want to go through all that At humiliation and then have something to show for it or do you want to go through all that humiliation and actually be what they say you are Which is a loser? All right, those are what your choices are so you're doing a great job by getting started brother Keep going show up every time try to get better break down your coaching and just get yourself in situations where you can give the reps This is why I tell you guys Do that exercise of going into public places and having real conversations with people I tell this I've told if you guys is your first time listening. I'll tell this story again. I used to play this game Where I would go to the local grocery store right up the street my house. It's called deerburgs here in St. Louis and I would go in there and I would force myself to have three conversations with someone Before I left all right, and this isn't like hey man. I choose this would be like a conversation right like Hey, have you tried those beans before? Yeah, what do you make with them? Well, but we have a real conversation right because what that does is it starts to get you in a skill set To be able to communicate face to face and a lot of you guys that listen to this shit you suck at this All right, the biggest problem with the younger generation right now is that they have an extremely difficult time Communicating not on their phone. They don't want to talk to people They don't want to meet people they want to text people and that's it And that's a severe handicap on your success because the reality of of building something real And life comes down to how well you work with other people because it takes a fucking village to be successful So if you lack the ability to actually connect to communicate with real life human beings You are to severe disadvantage and that also opens up the flip side of that equation If you are a young person and you are willing to get good at this skill and you are willing to invest the time to be great And you are willing to put in the effort to develop this skill set You are at a disproportionate advantage over everybody else because most of these people are tied to their phones When I was 20 years old everybody talked to everybody because we didn't have fucking phones So think about competing with everybody who's got great people people skills and working to have people skills versus You young guys you only have to compete with a small amount of people because they're believing this lie That connecting with humans is really irrelevant because we can just do everything through technology Motherfucker technology don't buy your shit people do and if you don't connect with them You're gonna be fucking broke so keep putting in the reps put in the practice put in the time get yourself an intentional situations to have to talk to people and that skill set will grow It's like any other skill. I love it I don't want to miss this point because it's something you said and maybe think You know we talk about how you after you got done with the meeting You would check yourself like you would go over play about play right? Yeah, what do I do after I after I talk now? You stood it to this day. I was that what you were gonna bring up? That's why I was I feel like you know people what do I say when I get in the car after a speaking event? Fuck man. What do you guys think? I don't know man, huh? And you start like you start really being I fucked up this part exactly. I'm better here This is right and even though everybody else think you did fucking amazing. Yeah You're just talking it out of my mouth. Yeah. What is that? That's called self-assessment That's a skill that most people lack most people either tell themselves that they were really great or they tell themselves They were really shitty and you have to learn to coach yourself from a Unemotional factual standpoint. Yeah, did you execute did you not execute did you do good? Did you not do good if you did good tell yourself you did good here? If you did bad tell yourself you did bad here We as humans have this natural propensity to beat ourselves up even when we do good or when we do bad Tell ourselves that we did amazing and these these lies that we tell ourselves because we are protecting our own ego are actually what can Stop us from becoming what it is we're supposed to become so it's very important to learn the skill set of self-assessment to detach your ego and say all right You know like for example like I think one of the reasons our show does so well with the current event stuff is because I And you both are willing to say man Am I right about that or am I wrong? I see in that wrong. You know what I'm saying for sure So like we have to just sucks. We're always right Well It is what it is, but I'm just saying you know we had to this this flows into a bigger conversation which is What have we lost in society? We've lost the ability to disagree and communicate or find common ground And the reason that we've lost the ability to communicate and find common ground is because our ego is getting the way of it Because we either want to be right as much as as much as we could possibly want it We want to win the argument winning the argument is not the goal Solving the problem is the goal winning the the idea contest in your office like I want to you know My idea has got to be the one that we do no your idea should be the best idea That should be the one that we do and this this this this not Our lack of ability to separate ourselves from the truth and what we want it the truth to be is what's damaging our own personal development and Our ability as a society to work together So we have to fucking be able to assess ourselves in a very honest way with it with as little bias as possible Clearly we're gonna have bias if you're having a great day and you think you're awesome You're probably gonna tell yourself you did a little better than what you did If you're having a bad day and you're feeling like shit You're probably gonna tell yourself you did a little worse than what you did So we have to be aware of those things too. Yeah, you know It's it's a skill set to be able to assess yourself Honestly that has to be developed through reps just like the actual delivery of the message. I love that man I love that guys and the question number two 80 I'm 23 years old. I Didn't have the best examples of success growing up and I never really knew what success looked like I want to win in life. I want to have financial freedom. I want a badass house and a bank account. I want a legacy Now I've been listening to your show for about six or seven months now And I feel like I understand and get everything you're saying when it comes to just going and starting my question is What happens if I do all of this work and learn all of these skills and it still doesn't work What happens if I still fail this fear is paralyzing me to even start and I can't shake it Well, first of all I think this is a great question because I believe that the reason that most people never start is because they can't pinpoint The desired result as a certainty all right They want to consume all the data. They want to consume all the action steps They want to make make sure of every single thing that they can before they start so They can get this guaranteed result But when they realize that the result cannot be guaranteed no matter if you do all the work Then they say well, fuck it. I might as well not do the work because the results guaranteed But what they're failing to realize is the flip side of that You do have a guaranteed result if you don't go the guaranteed result if you don't go is that your life is going to be shitty All right, and you're going to think every single day while you're alive Man, what would my life look like had I done those things? So it's not what's going to happen if I do it It's what's going to happen if I don't do it And if you don't do it your life is not going to stay the same as it is now It's going to get progressively worse because we live in a sliding scale when we talk about Culture and society and the way things progress And so if you're not getting better at the pace of everybody else getting better or everything else getting better You're actually getting worse by trying to maintain even maintaining where you are takes an uncertain amount of dedicated work all right Because maintaining is actually moving forward But the point of this is this there is no fucking guarantee bro There's no guarantee that you're going to do all this work and everything's going to work out and You're going to become a gazillionaire and you're going to live this crazy life But there is a guarantee that if you don't try you're going to live a shitty life And that's what you need to be thinking about and this is what paralyzes most people from ever going When we think about how the process actually works And the young the young bucks think of it as a guarantee What they're missing is is that yes, you can have all the steps Yes, you could have all the data. Yes, you could have the best plan in the world But once you go out and start executing on that plan, shit's gonna go wrong You are going to make mistakes You are going to fuck things up and every single time you make one of these mistakes You learn a lesson and when you learn that lesson it helps sharpen a new skill that you didn't have before So now you go out you have this plan you get punched in the fucking face And then you say okay, well, why did I get punched in the face? Well, I got punched in the face because I didn't do these things and then you say next time I'm gonna do those things boom a skill is born a new skill is born You put it in your tool belt and you are now better prepared to go down the path again So you get up you dust yourself off you go again with this new skill so that when that situation presents itself The second time you know what to do so you could get past that it's like a video game, bro You learn how to get past the The hard parts by getting killed 50 times and then you figure it out And then you keep going and as these hardships happen You acquire more and more and more and more skills if you continue to go down the path which starts to produce a better and better and better and better result And so while there's no way to guarantee the the perfect outcome on your journey Your life will be exponentially better by going on it And so when we think about you know, what if I do all this shit and nothing happens and I follow my face And I get made fun of and it's super hard and it takes a super long time my fucker. That's how it's gonna be Okay, and you're looking at it the wrong way you want the guarantee of the big house the car the boat the big life When in reality if you don't go your guaranteed shit And that's what you have to think about so it's not what do I what if I do all this work and I don't make it It's what if you don't do shit and you stay right where you are that's how you should be thinking about it Would you say That that people too often they put way too much pressure on the external Uh Circumstances that could happen and those shit off the plan and they don't focus enough on what they actually can control 100% you know, I'm saying like like it's way too much. I will use politics and all these other things Yeah, of course, bro people want to listen man people People want this to be cut and dry. They want this to be easy. They want it to be quick They want it to be painless There's nothing easy quick and painless about being fucking great at building anything in life Creating anything at life becoming anything at life you are going to suffer It is going to be hard is going to take all of your energy. It's gonna kick you in the fucking face a thousand times You're going to be demoralized. You're going to be frustrated. You're going to be angry You're gonna be bitter sometimes This is why it's so important to build yourself into someone who can execute Regardless of what your mood is regardless of what your circumstances is because if you can execute when things are fucked up And everybody else bails and everybody else quits what kind of advantage does that give you over the long haul It gives you a tremendous advantage And if you could become the kind of person that cannot be fucking stopped by outside circumstances or going through a tough time or being in a bad mood or being unmotivated How can anyone fucking beat that who can stop that the only thing that can stop that is fucking your own death or god Okay, so this is the most powerful version That you can become of yourself by becoming a disciplined human being that can execute regardless of the circumstances And if you go out and you go on that path and you go that route The guarantee for sure is a much better life now. Can you say you're gonna have a plane and cars and a big house Bro, it depends on how good you are. Are you good? Are you smart? Do you have skill sets? Are you investing to build those skill sets? Are you trying to learn this on the job or are you taking all your free time and all of your energy And all of your efforts and dedicating it to become the most skill version of you in this lane that you're in as possible Because I can tell you that anybody that wins at the highest level That's how they operate it might not be healthy It might not be what most people want it certainly isn't balanced But it's the real story real mother fuckers are obsessed with what they do the people who win the biggest are fucking obsessed You cannot argue that I'm that Thousands and thousands and thousands of entrepreneurs and the best the best ones the ones that win at the highest level They are fucking obsessed It's a huge priority over everything else in their life and people will sit here and hear it Well, that's not healthy woman fucking don't be a winner man. I'm just telling you what it is Sure, you don't have to do it. Yeah, I'm not saying you got to do it I'm not saying it's for you I'm saying what a fucking actually takes and nobody else wants to say that shit because you can't fucking sell it You can't go out and sell the idea Hey, man, this is gonna beat your ass for the rest of your life And it's gonna be hard and it's gonna take everything and it's gonna make everything else in your life come second place And it's not gonna be fun most of the time And you're gonna struggle most of the time and it's gonna be how do you sell that to someone No one talks about that because you can't sell it to people who aren't willing to do that So there's all these people out here that are willing to tell people. It's easy. It's quick Just do this and do that and do this and these people then try that and they fail And then they find another one of these motherfuckers and then they try their shit and they fail And then they find another one of these people who promise is easy and they try that and they fail You know what they eventually say Fuck I guess I don't have what it takes and they quit and they reside themselves to some mediocre existence That's far below their actual potential because they're not being told the truth about the game The game will take everything you have and if you want to win at a mediocre level It'll take less if you want to win at the highest level It's gonna take more and that's the way to fucking cookie crumbles when it comes to this and you can argue about it You could bitch about it. You can judge it. I don't give a fuck, but that is the way it is I love it man. It's the fucking truth dude There's too many people out here that want this shit easy and notice none of them win on a big scale There might be a couple people out here that got some cars and have some shit and be winning the but what the fuck if they built We'll look at them in five if you're gonna be a world-changing fucking cleaner mother fucker like Tim Grover talks about It's gonna take everything bro. It takes free throws at three o'clock in the fucking morning like MJ and fucking Kobe did That's what the fuck it takes it takes total obsession dude and most people ain't built for it And we have this entire culture out here that's telling everybody that being their own boss is about freedom And it's about fun and it's about doing whatever you want and you get to and they're all liars They're all lying. That's not how the fuck it is bro. It's total fucking obsession to your craft Now I'm talking about the highest level winners if you want to win less than that It's gonna take less obsession if you want to win mediocre and just have some money and have a bass boat and like do live a life That's cool too. It's gonna take less But the reality is is I'm not here to talk to the fucking people who want to win less I'm here to talk about people that want to win at the highest level Hey guys Andy our third and final question question number three Uh Andy When you do have those times of fun culture building gatherings or parties What have you found to be the most effective after the event and pulling your team back into gear to focus On the mission and put the fun behind them and get back to work I'm struggling with this in my business after we have a company event and he thoughts on this I think you're thinking about it wrong. That's not how I think about it at all I think about the fun events that we get to do as reminding people How awesome it is That we get to do this shit every day There is an understanding that when we walk in the doors here it is all business, bro And yes, we're going to have fun and yes, we're going to fuck around with each other And we're gonna tell jokes and we're gonna keep it light and we're gonna play games and do all the fun shit that everybody thinks our Companies are on social media, but there's an understanding You're gonna fucking execute at a high level and everybody knows that and so how I How I look at the fun events Is that it gives us some momentum it gives us some boost it gives us to lighten up and and to remember why it is we get to do what we do How awesome it is we get to do what we do and it reminds everybody of What a blessing it is to be surrounded with the quality of people that we are here in our organizations And I want that feeling to last as long as possible I don't want to stop that the next day and say hey No more having fun. There's time for if you're doing that you're running your shit wrong So I would encourage you to look at it the opposite way that you're looking at it and I would say hey Use these events to remind people how blessed we are to go to do important things with this level of quality people And why it's important that we execute day in and day out so we can continue to do these things with these awesome people So it's just a matter of perspective. It's like the events the like that we're not talking about you know That should be a conference room for a fucking Karen's birthday, right? These are meaningful things right? Or we spend millions of dollars on summer smash yeah every year. Well, I mean, how do you how do you How do you convey that to I guess a business owner who doesn't have that type of expense report to I mean before before we were spending millions of dollars we were spending Thousands of dollars or hundreds of dollars when we didn't have summer smash we would have barbecues We didn't have this awesome headquarters We would have customer appreciation barbecues at the back of our fucking stores like the events always start small and they grow into things But you don't want to the the point of the matter is is you don't want to kill the momentum that these events create Because you want guys to get back to be serious look bro People don't do their best work when they're serious. They do their best work when they're appreciative of what they get to do They appreciate who they get to do it with They're aligned on the mission. They're aligned on the goal. They get to contribute into whatever that is whatever it is for you And that creates a cohesive team that does great work And if you say to that if I walked in here every single day and I said quit fucking around don't talk don't laugh So we'll do the work Bro we wouldn't we would be we would be a shitty company. Yeah, you see people would hate us. They would hate working here. So I think as The organizer of a organization the leader of an organization whether that be a church a charity a team a company Whatever it is A gang I don't fucking know like whatever it is. It's gonna drive by Tuesday. Yeah It's all the dynamics. I love that. Yeah, but the dynamics all the same We have a mission. We have a purpose. We're going to work towards this mission But we should also try to have fun doing it and appreciate the people that we get to do it with and I'll say this bro One of one of the best things in my life and a lot of people see the outside success They think you know, oh dude and he's made a lot of money and he's gets to fly around on private jets And he has all these cars and he does all this cool shitty knows all these people and they see that shit from the outside And they think that's what's cool. You know what's fucking cool is that I get to wake up every mother fucking day and walk in this building and go to Fucking war with people to give a fuck about what we do and they're damn good at doing it and that makes me proud That makes me excited that makes me have purpose in my life Why haven't I people ask me all the time? Why are you sold your companies? You could be do it. No shit I could but like I love what I do what the fuck what I do these are my people these are my friends these are people I care about Why the fuck would I do that? I'm gonna what what is that worth to me? What is selling my entire existence my entire friend group my entire purpose my entire mission life for some got what's that worth in dollars There is no fucking dollar amount for that. Yeah, it's not but it's not for sale man And so you know a lot of you guys who are running your companies you're missing out on a great opportunity To develop a lot of richness in your life by not appreciating what it is you do and who you get to do it with And instead you're walking in every day demanding some productivity and by the way, I used to be that way I used to be because when you're not succeeding. It's very important to produce But what you'll find is that when everybody's having fun and everybody is bonding on the mission and everybody appreciates each other's contribution and their own contribution the the productivity happens organically. Yeah, so So anyway Long story short I would stop trying to kill the fun and I would try to lengthen and Extend it into your culture as long as you possibly can and you're gonna have a better result You this this sounds like someone who's walking in being like man all these guys do are fucking around bro That's the wrong attitude man Listen, are they getting it done? Are they producing high-level results? If not it has nothing to do with them having fun It has to do with you're not leading them to do the job the proper way still you problem It is a you problem every leadership problem is a problem with the leader every pro this is this is where this is where people don't want to hear that No, they don't bro. They know that this is where they fuck it up They want to do how many times do we see people saying bro? It's impossible to get anybody to work these days really? I don't know we don't have a problem with it Yeah, we're all we have You know what I'm saying? What do we do? Where do we insulated? No, yeah We just have a different culture than you have and that culture comes from our leadership and you haven't put it in yet Really it comes down dude. You know what it really comes down to most of these people this is the truth man and like People gonna get pissed when I say this but most of you guys that run companies and lead people You're trying to fucking take advantage of people You want them to do all the fucking work You don't have any intention of growing something that's big enough for their dreams to fit under You don't really give a shit about them. You're pretending that you give a shit And because you pretend they give a shit they don't give a shit about you because these people are not fucking stupid You're trying to ride their backs on the success without actually going out and building something that's gonna benefit them And your people know that and that's why they don't respond to you because you're a shitty fucking leader And you don't have their their interests in mind. I have these people's interests in mind in my companies My you know why I want to grow first forming the one of the greatest iconic American brands. It's ever existed Because I need to build the company big enough For these guys who have put in all this time to have their dreams inside of that. I have to that's my obligation They help me do that now. I have to help them do that That's the way a fucking works if you're a great leader So if you're leading an organization here and you think you're gonna Fool these people into like coming this amazing team You're fucking wrong. It's not gonna fucking happen. Yeah, and then I'll talk about telling them not to have fun Yeah Look dude most of these problems from a leadership standpoint could be solved Very quickly by understanding your obligation as a leader You are responsible for these people's fucking lives. You are responsible for their career path You are responsible for their fucking families. You are responsible They are dedicating a huge part of their life to your cause That is an huge obligation for you to build whatever it is you're building into something that can support their dreams And trade for what they've put into your dreams You see what I'm saying? It's a huge deal And if you just thought about it that way if you instead of thinking about it What can I get you started thinking about what can I do? How can I grow the company? How can I create opportunities for my people? How can we get better? How can we do that? And you started thinking about it from a place of service and growth For the collective and not just yourself bro most of your problems will fix themselves But you guys can't connect that So connect that and a lot of this shit will solve itself. I love it man Guys Andy that was three. Yep. That's three guys Don't pay to fee
