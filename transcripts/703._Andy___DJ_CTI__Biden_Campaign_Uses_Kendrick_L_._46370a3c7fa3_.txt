Did you have the other thing to happen? Oh, of course. Okay. Of course Um, so let's dive into this so is it more racist than him saying if you don't vote for me you ain't black Is it more racist? Is it more racist than him bringing a bucket of fried chicken to a black house to do a fucking campaign ad? Is it more racist than him saying black people don't know how to get voter IDs so it's a racist? Is it is what level black kids adjust as bright and just the talented No, we say poor kids. Yeah poor kids adjust as bright and just talented as white kids Bro, so what level of racism are we talking? I'm learned about roaches and I've learned about Are we talking about level of racist like I pander to the black community for 40 fucking years and then put All the dads in jail the 1994 crime bill. Yeah, is it that level? I mean where are we at because there's levels to Biden and the Democrats racism. Oh yeah, I mean this is in there. All right in there. That one of those kids listening to these days Well, so they're using WAP well as you use it and so that's what they try to They try to do this so so presidents by president Biden's re-election campaign Uh has co-optic Kendrick Lamar's attack on Drake to attack Donald Trump overlaying the lyrics To the Compton rappers euphoria on top of text insults about former president In a bizarre tiktok clip the 13 second video posted by Biden's official re-election campaign On the Chinese link social media app features captions is like quote I hate the way that you walk over women's rights And quote the way you talk about immigrants. Let's let's let's check the video out So it's been about loving hate now let me say I'm the biggest hate. I hate the way that you walk the way that you talk I hate the way that you dress. I hate the way that you sneak this if I catch flight. It's gonna be direct We hate the bitches you f***er. They confuse themselves with real women and notice I said we is not just me I'm what the culture feeling how many more Well, wait, so he took Trump's video he made his video the Biden campaign made this video made this video with Kendrick Lamar Lamar soundtrack right All right Because black people will like it because black people yes, that's rap right got it. Yep 100% Uh Biden's re-election team said it will continue to use tiktok despite the president signing a bill into law last month mandating the app's parent company might dance divest due to its affiliation with the Chinese government quote a fragmented media environment requires us to show up and meet voters where they are in the hood Uh, and that includes online Um tiktok is one of many places we're making sure our content is being seen by black voters Well, I mean, or you could just show up their house for the bucket of fried chicken that works through that one I didn't work that's why I think they're doing the the rap shit no, okay, I didn't get them all right They don't like fried chicken anymore, so let's wrap Is because we forgot the watermelon Everybody likes watermelon that's bullshit Bro these people the fucker race. I love how they try to fucking paint the the Trump like these trampoline women's rights That's such bullshit, mm-hmm, okay I'm gonna say this again abortion is a below the line issue if you're having to have an abortion is a Is a fucking normal issue for you you got other problems, bro You might want to sow that motherfucker shut, okay? That's one way you can stop this shit more roast, but let's be real He does not trample on women, okay? He says the states have the right to decide the population of the states have the right to decide If they want abortion in their state or not, which is in line with the original constitution of this country There is no outlawing of abortion. There is the state decides some states made a side No, some states made a side yes, and on by the way Trump has already said that there are Exceptions to that incest rape the the mom or the mom's health These are these are exceptions reasonable. He says this, okay? So this is a lie and it's they try to make every but that's a strategy make everybody afraid of Trump especially women Okay, and not and by the way, just so we're clear women are equal to men They're they're equal in certain aspects are they equal in being able to carry a load of fucking iron up fucking 50 flights of stairs? No Manor physically stronger. That's reality. It's not a fallacy, okay There's a lot of capable women out here that could do fucking great shit and they're very intelligent They're very capable. They do awesome shit. They're awesome contributors to businesses and companies and households and men too They're just different. Yeah, so this whole division that they try to create around women is fucking bullshit Yeah, all right. It's a total bullshit lie but then We have this situation where you got come Fucking Kathy Holtz saying that black people are too dumb to get a fucking computer. Oh, you have it. Okay, keep going I just did some racist shit. Yeah So the rap didn't work but this came before the rap this came before the diss track Kathy Holtzhal Holtzhal Hey, she said that black children in the Bronx do not know what the word computer means And now she's saying that she regrets making the offhand remark You could tell she regretted it the minute she said if you watch the video. It's like oh fuck I should have said that yeah, they're going over and they've been lighting her up So this was the official statement that came out um From from Kathy Holtzhal she said quote of course black children in the Bronx know what computers are the problem is That they too often lack access to the technology needed to get on track to high-paying jobs and emerging industries like AI No, that's not accurate They they they don't lack the access every motherfucker in the country has a fucking cell phone you provide it for him and your fucking programs I got wafa. I got wafa Wafa is pretty good actually Yeah, but your kids don't know what computers. I don't know. I have no fucking clean. Yeah, I would not even in the Bronx Yeah, it's uh I love uh they that she tried to use some big words. I don't know what this one where it was All the article did I think that yeah, what the ex what is that ex-timp? Maybe I don't know what a computer is what is that ex-timp or it what is that Where Holtzhal Democrat made the ex-temporaneous That's because I had access to computers What I don't know what it means though Uh spoken are done without preparation. Why the fuck did they just say that? Because they want you to think they're smarter than you. Yeah Got it. Okay. All right. Well, yeah, so she tried to apologize and uh She said while the girl uh the statement from off or no, no This was a assembly speaker call Hestai a Democrat who represents the Bronx in the legislature came to Holtzhal's defense and her remarks began to gain traction on my You know, you say quote while the governor's words were an artful and hurtful. I don't believe this is where her heart is I firmly believe she wants to see all of our students excel Just not on computers, but um that's out of the relationship. I've got some other issues man He did a CNN interview Where he claimed that inflation was 9% when he took office Um, and that's being destroyed online Um That's because they're trying to gaslight everybody bro They're hoping that everybody forgets and they think they're trying to blame this all on Trump And they're hoping that everybody forgets what was actually happening four years ago. Good. It actually Yes, these fucks are full of shit. Full of shit. Here's the interview The cost of buying a home in the United States is double what it was when you look at your monthly costs from before the pandemic Real income when you account for inflation is actually down since you took office economic growth last week far short of expectations Consumer confidence maybe no surprise is near a two-year low This is the last six months to go to election day Are you worried that you're running out of time to turn that around? We've already turned around look look at the mission conservative For 65% of America people think they're in good shape economically. I think the nation's not in good shape But they're personally good shape The polling data has been wrong all along You know how many you guys do a poll with CNN? How many folks you have to call to get one response The idea that we're in a situation where things are so bad the folks that I mean We've created more jobs. We've made run a situation where people have access to good paying jobs and the last I saw the combination of the inflation The cost of inflation all things that's really worsen to people with good reason that's why I'm working very hard To bring the cost of rentals down to increase the number of homes that are available One of them, but let me say it this way When I started this administration People were saying we're going to be a collapse in the economy We had the strongest economy in the world Be said again in the world Although GDP last week was far short of expectations. Oh wasn't look GDP still look at the response of the markets overwhelmingly positive We're well-money positive and one of the reasons why people feel good about it Not being as strong as it was before is they believe that the feds are going to respond. They hope they're going to get a rate cut Yeah, well, so what I mean no presidents had the run we've had in terms of creating jobs and Bring you down inflation was 9% well. I can't office 9% but you look people have a right to be concerned Ordinary people the idea is Bro, this guy's so full of shit Duty they fucking dude listen They're trying to gaslight people and and Like not they're not telling anything sort of the truth The reason that it looks like jobs are up and they're with the stat that they claim on this is because they eliminated So they eliminated so many during the covid shutdowns, right? Okay, so he's counting Everything opening back up as new jobs and when you actually look at who's being employed in those jobs It is not American citizens. It is fucking illegal aliens. Okay, that's the first thing The second thing is It was 1.4% in January of 21 and he's on here on national TV saying it was 9% Okay, that is total fucking bullshit These people stand up here and lie to mother fuckers faces and then not only do they lie They paint Trump out to be fucking Hitler so that they try like do you know many comments? I see on the internet where people are like fuck Shit sucks, but I got a vote for Biden no matter what because dude the alternative is worse What the fuck are you talking about stupid? You guys are stupid mother fuckers, bro you're you're listening to a complete Fraud of an administration someone who is bought and paid for by China Someone who's willing to lie to your fucking face so that for the next four years They can make it a hundred times worse than it is now. That's the truth and if you're black And you can't see how the Democrats have manipulated black culture for 50 fucking years, bro I don't know what to tell you man like dude They come in every fucking two and four years and they say we're gonna do all this shit They don't do any of it. They fund it the money gets funneled back to them We're stolen by the local representatives. It never makes it into schools It never makes it into infrastructure and then they say oh, it's the it's fucking Trump It's the white guy you're right. It is a white guy, but it's name a Trump You know, I'm saying it like bro. It's these fucking Democrats and do when you really listen to their language The the amount of what they actually think of black citizens Shines through brightest day, but people ignore it. They ignore it Bro Biden straight up said if you don't vote for me you ain't black Uh voter ID is racist because black people don't know how to get IDs Hocus-ing black people don't know how to use a computer like what the fuck guys What the fuck the Trumps of it says some shit like that no bro? It's it's a But here's what I understand why in the black community do people not like why can't they recognize what the fuck is going on Like I saw that you know, there's I don't know 50% of black Americans are gonna vote for Trump this year 40% or something What about the other fucking 60% I don't vote Is that what it is? Black voted black like black voter turnout is low Well bro, I so they're just saying this because they don't know any better. What is that like are you paying attention at all? Because like bro, this is this election Is probably the most important election to the black communities in this country because they are at the lowest level of income Statistically not my fucking data the actual data they live in the highest crime neighborhoods They have the highest percentage of violent crime and the reason they have that is because the Democrats have intentionally Turn these neighborhoods into fucking ghettos so that they have something to promise them every four years That they never intend on making true Okay, so at some point it would be nice if the black communities would be like fuck These motherfuckers are racist. They hate they hate you They hate you bro, you know, and in a simple word games and shit like you know, we got this chart here It's the inflation on the Biden right and this is what they will say this is what they they preach to Like this is what they stand on. Oh, well, I brought I brought inflation down 6.5% But not telling you that they're the ones that raise it 8% yeah They create the problems that way they can kind of soft-shell the fucking solution To keep you voting for bro You motherfuckers that understand what's going on you got to have conversations with people you got to show them this shit You got a point to him be like no, man, that ain't true. Here's what's actually true Dude and I'm not saying that the fucking Republicans are the fucking answer either, but I'm saying right now like today That's only shall we got I think the Republican party needs major reform too all this funding that comes from other foreign countries That these people serve that's got a fucking stop Okay, we need American first candidates people who are patriotic people who are citizens of this country They want to go into the government and serve the people like it's designed to be not go in and get the most funding from like people who are like Well, why is Biden? How come Biden's not criticizing Israel for the attacks that they're doing? Why all his voters are fucking pro Palestine and they're like well fuck Joe Biden Well, what do you why what reason would he do that like logically what what do you think it would take for him to You know Ride defense like that. Oh here. I'll tell you all of their fucking money comes from those people So you think they're gonna spit in the face of the people who financed him for the last 50 fucking years Okay, do it People have such a hard time figuring that out dude. We got to get away from this foreign influence of any kind in our country We have to get back to America first and I'm not saying Trump is the king of the world That's not what the fuck I'm saying, but right now It's the only shot we got to get America back on track to what it should be most of the republicans need to be gone too That's real shit when 300 and something vote for a censorship against the foreign country of any sort happens to be Israel this time But if it were You couldn't criticize canada you couldn't criticize Russia you couldn't criticize China Whatever to fuck they do that's wrong and 300 and something republicans voted for that and fucking Why do you think that is oh? Because they get a shit ton of money from those Fuck dude that all of that influence should be illegal all of it It's a fucking money game and dude. We're the ones paying the fucking price on the streets So guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think That being said let's go cruise some yeah, oh buddy.

Yeah, that's it Yeah, you know, I mean bro, I you know, sorry that I didn't wake up to what was going on with the vaccines until 2020 2021 but you know what had I understood that earlier I have no vaccines Well, I'm gonna say I'm glad you're on the topic because I mean when you look at rates of like autism Where you look at rates of like ADHD and you look at rates of Of all this other obesity diabetes look at all of that stuff still born still born the miscarriages put that shit on the chart There's a direct correlation with the massive push and sense of with our vaccine program Yeah, bro, and you know who you know who talks about you know who taught me a lot about that was Linda We have a Linda yeah, bro because she's been on this vaccine stuff for years and years and years And I was oblivious to it man like I'm over here talking about business running you know doing that and You know I always wondered what was causing all the autism like I was like why are autism rate and I you know what I thought it was Dude, it's gonna sound so stupid, but I'm like I thought it was microwaves I thought like cuz microwaves came along right around the same time the autism shit started going up And I was like fuck dude. It probably ain't good to like microwaved your shit your food. Yeah, but I didn't stop but the point is I know with microwave that much food Well, I'm just saying that's what I thought it was and then when I found out that it was a vaccine I'm like oh that makes a lot of sense. What was funny about that That makes sense. Yeah What why was that funny That's good man why Okay, well whenever man my point is is that you know gotta be fucking Uh what what the fuck are we laughing at I don't know This is good, man. It's good. It's good See, this is why you don't get trophy because you laugh at shit that ain't funny. Oh, man. I'm just trying to see how you got That's good, man. I explained how I got there. I think that makes sense autism rates went up around the time microwaves fucking invented How the fuck what how the fuck do you not understand that? Oh, it's cuz you never had a computer Okay Okay, is it like can you is like two minutes too long like is that when it like it makes sense I know it makes sense He's brain is smooth no access to the technology computers It's not that funny. Yeah, it's not even funny at all Anyway, yeah Hmm Okay, hell out number two Hell out number two reads Stormy nails concludes testimony trump team to renew motions for mistrial so Trump case is going on you know all three thousand of them Um, and there's interesting developments. I have it You know, I tried to dive a little bit into this case. It's a little I mean, it's a lot going on in that way It's all going back to some shit in 2006 that They're trying to bring out now The interesting thing though, man, and I don't know if you guys noticed this but but you know The reason we have all of these cases that are coming out not not about trump But all the like the sexual harassment cases and these rape cases that are coming out and they're all being tried in New York is because of a law that was passed right They pretty much opened the floodgates for this right the interesting thing is Is that a lot of those law makers and policy makers in New York that you know voted for this shit now They're starting to get cases put on yeah, right so they eliminated the statue of limitations for rape cases right Or sexual harassment like really of it so now now Not their gatham and that other guy that's up there with them bro. They're all getting fucked Yeah, you know, I'm saying and so like I mean, I thought that's interesting But let's still let's dive in a little bit on this. There's some interesting stuff happening The most recent update that we've got Um at the time of recording Trump uh his team has put in another motion to For a mistrial right to throw the case out Um apparently stormy Daniels has been kind of like losing a mind up on the stand saying weird shit doing some weird shit um and so they're trying to get thrown out Um the defense in New York versus trumps at Thursday that we renew its motion for a mistrial following the second round of testimony of pornographic actress stormy Stormy Daniels the defense according to reporters inside the courtroom said that uh it had three applications to bring up Including renewed motion for mistrial and the gag order um, so those efforts Will be discussed following testimony this evening at 4 p.m. uh eastern time Now judge merchant has already denied uh previous requests for a mistrial um, but uh said that he would uh You know, it wasn't the right time to put that motion in so we'll see what happens in there But yeah, there's been some interesting stuff they uh they called her You know, they've been trying to catch her in these lives because the story that she tells constantly changes Right and again, we're talking about something that happened, you know almost 20 years ago Um, but she's told the story multiple different times and every time the story kind of changes a little bit Um, she said something about on the stand that she can speak to dead people I mean like it's just weird stuff happening on the on the stand up there um You know more importantly, I don't know if people don't really know this, but you know she she almost made or she was supposedly allegedly had made almost a million dollars off of this story um 800,000 of which came from a news outlet that she's or the book deal that she did She's making money off of uh selling merchandise um That kind of like alludes or references trump and this deal here She's making a shit ton of money off of this. Yeah, she's a grifter 100% like she worked for this man. She you know she came in She was a low low hanging fruit and employee and then worked her way up and you know She's a fucking porn star, you know and she gets high enough um and they actually unveiled that was a part during this I think was back in 2016 Uh where they thought trump she thought trump was gonna lose and she talked to her lawyer like if if he loses his election Then we lose all of our leverage right Further showing that this is nothing but a fucking witch hunt over it right um now um Rick Scott had commented on this during an interview with fox news. I'm gonna see what he has to say I support my friend. I support Donald Trump. This is just political persecution as they Cry to use the courts to for political persecution and and by the way, I saw this it happened to me I fought Hillary care and guess what happened why fought Hillary care Just it came after me and attacked me and my company. So think about this if we don't stop this All right, if we don't stop this it's because they're they can go after you every Americans are risk So I'm gonna go support this president because this is wrong. What's happening to the sky? He is just being political persecuted what they find him for not for where no one lost any money now They're trying to put him jail over an accounting dispute. Okay, this is wrong Yeah, not only that I mean the the fact that the judge um Uh, the prosecutor uh, he worked we cover that he worked for the Biden administration the the DOJ worked under Obama Um, and not only that um Uh, the judge's daughter she's a political operative who raises money Explicitly for Democrats like I mean like they're gonna call in their people to do the work And I think that's what this is um, but in other news Along with this there are some wins. There was another case uh, that that Trump had the the Mar-a-Lago documents case down in Florida Judge alien alien can and delays Trump documents case trial date indefinitely Um, completely took that off the document uh off the docket um, she delayed uh this past Tuesday Delayed the May 20 uh, 2024 trial date for the documents case involving former president Donald Trump indefinitely Signaling it will not take place before the November 2024 presidential election according to the file Um, so that's a win now she's had some hate because of that Um, like this person uh, George Conway A verified account on Twitter um, he tweeted out of course she did a competent and unbiased judge would have tried this case to verdict already Alluding that she's incompetent and biased right. I mean, that's what I got from that uh, this guy Right this guy Right follow follow by Adam Schiff. Yeah, and uh, who's ging ging ging All right, um, this is his Twitter bio vote for Joe not the psycho Okay um and in another interest that dude's hard drive Jesus haha Uh, that motherfucker's doing some weird shit bro. I've been to you. There is some weird search history is there. Yeah I guarantee it walks around looking like that's into some weird shit Yeah, I said it It is what it is y'all know it's true too. It's fucking true. Yeah Um, another interesting win coming out of Florida. Did you see that uh barren Trump? He's going to be one of the delegates for Florida Uh for the GOP former president Donald Trump's youngest son barren trump who uh was was chosen to serve as Florida delegate has a Republican national convention this summer Um, so him among a few other people were picked by the Florida Republican party to serve Uh as an at-large delegate for the convention set to place uh take place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and July Um, that's pretty cool You know, your son gets a you know get up there and cast his uh his is uh party pick for you I think that's pretty pretty freaking cool Um Andy, let's let's let's talk about this a little bit what we got on this Well, if you actually read in the details of the uh document trial the FBI Legitimately remember when they arranged that picture remember that picture they showed of all the documents. They're the range They did that they got the folders. No, no, no Yes, they they put top secret folders on top of them right and then took the photos and releasing the press Top secret folders that were not there. Yes correct that they brought in that's right right the state staged it correct And that's why she that's why she uh said hey the trials postponed indefinitely Because it's bullshit and uh when you get stormy Daniels on the stage and you know she's fucking saying all this contradictory shit It's implying that she's playing this out for years and years and years and uh you know when asked if she had sex with Donald Trump She said no Well, that's bullshit too And then you got this other lady who looks like she smokes fucking Parmesan cheese with Hunter Biden and they make this motherfucker pay her 83 million dollars Okay, like dude. This is clearly a political hit job the weaponization of our court system and the department of justice On somebody that they are so afraid of getting in because they are so afraid that he is going to wreck their little honey hole sugar pot Fucking inside secret handshake bullshit that they've been doing for fucking a hundred years now. Yeah, the clamshells. Yeah, so Yeah, no shit clamshell That's inside joke hey We might let you know about that we might we might know someone called clamshell We'll talk about that later though. Oh man. That's top secret. Well, that's it. That's top secret language. That's top secret language. Yeah, so So anyway Yeah, it's fucking I mean like that's a thing but like it's just weird because you know you're a strategy guy Right like you understand the chess board right you understand the cause of the fact It does not make sense to me how Every time they try to hit him He goes up he goes up in polls. He goes up. You know, they that makes sense I it's hard for me to see I'm gonna be real it's hard. It is hard for me to see it Well, I was you keep going there because people they're exposed. They're overplaying their hand They're exposing themselves for who they are and what they're about and the American people are starting to realize Oh shit if they could do this to trump bro They could do this to me or you for doing nothing And that scares people yeah, that makes people afraid and it's a valid concern Because if he doesn't win they will do that to everybody who supported him every single person They'll try to attack they'll sue they'll slander they'll destroy and you know if it's a full communist revolution They eventually kill those people. Yeah, so You know Did you see did you see Jen Saki talking about like basically fantasizing about fucking trump being assassinated on TV No, yeah, bro. Yeah, she was like oh he could die he could do this You know he could be like Bro and if I mean honest, I think these people are gonna try to do that I think they're gonna try to fucking kill this dude if they can't stop him. Yeah. Well, I mean, I don't think they're gonna be able to stop him so No and dude dude, you know, I mean the harder they push on this on this this These false Stories and the in this embellished exaggerated cases that they do against this man people are starting to realize holy shit dude Our country is fucked. It is taken over by psychopaths And the only defense that the Democrats have at this point is to make trump look like fucking Hitler And you know scare everybody in this keep vote for him, which is what they do to women right he's trying to take your rights away He's trying to remove your right no, he's not not at all Fuck yeah, it's complete bullshit man, and then that hill narrative both is picking up steam Hillary is the main person that keeps pushing that shit Yeah, for sure and on top of that dude Why the fuck are you voting for abortion anyway like there's so many more things that are important to your everyday life Then voting for abortion. Yeah, let's make it a number one. It's a below the line issue So they talk about this shit and try to get people fired up about it So that they ignore things like crime and like foreign policy and the economy things that affect us every single day and keep us safe and prosperous and you know Uh, I won't say free because we're not free. We don't we don't we are not free in this country. We are tax slaves So we're you know, that's the truth. So I try not to use free could we be free? Yeah, but it's gonna take major fucking reform of the government for us to be free We're not free we're tax slaves, but we're gonna be a lot less free if the fucking if Biden stays in for another four years They'll fucking they will kill this country. It will be over. How about we vote to abort this fucking current administration? I don't know for that abortion. Dude listen the more and more The more more I watch this play out The more more I'm starting to feel like it can't be solved peacefully or politically like I the more more I'm starting to real I'm starting to feel like fuck Because dude if they wake up if everybody in America wakes up like they are waking up And then they cheat in the election and basically say fuck you or still here. There's gonna be big problems like big fucking problems Yeah, you give what I'm saying. Oh, bro, it's gonna be problems. Yeah, but if everybody knows they cheated like last time There was literally, you know more than half the people that were like, oh, I don't think so. It's just you know blah blah blah But like if they know they cheated even people who are Democrats are admitting now that they think they cheated in 2020 after watching what's been going on so Not the not the polio guy though, you know, he's he's safe Like think of how delusional you have to be with all this data coming out dude No, for real think about your ego and how delusional you have to be with all this data coming out and because you made a decision You think it's still the right decision when the people who told you to do the decision are now saying this isn't right We have vaccine manufacturers taking a vaccine out to fucking market We've got I've remected openly prescribed for these kind of things like the people who were telling you on TV to take this shatter You were a piece of shit or now saying man, I got fucked up too And because you took it you're letting your pride me go stop you from like actually admitting what's going on because You think you're smarter than everybody else see the biggest problem that we have going on in this country is we live in a country of over Educated but unintelligent people, okay? They are people who go to school who to learn things from people who teach them things and they never question whether those things are true or not And then they leave and they think because they got a piece of paper that cost them 200 grand That they're somehow smarter than everybody else and they aren't and this is this is basically a huge cycle That keeps people from really understanding what's going on right like if you came to an anti school And I taught you that the sky was yellow and there's no such thing as gravity And then I said now look how fucking smart you are here's this piece of paper And you went out in the world bro you're gonna walk around thinking I'm fucking smarter all these my look at all these idiots that think the fucking sky is blue Fucking morons and university I want to end the university that's right like dude that that's what happens though at mass scale And so we have a bunch of unintelligent and doctored native people who can't think for themselves who still think they're right because they did what they were told And that's not Accurate at all, I mean, it's what's getting these people in trouble and unfortunately bro for you know I don't know how many tens of millions of America because I think they lie about the data But unfortunately, there's been a lot of people who have been pressured and taking something that's now making them sick or Fucking them up or or even killing them and there's certain guys like this dude still trying to deny that's happening Bro, what are you talking about? Yeah, I'm talking gibberish You know I'm saying Yeah guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think with that being said Let's get to our third and final headline Hello number three Uh bring it back to St. Louis. Got a little update. Uh head on number three reads Where in the world is Kim Gardiner disgraced St. Louis circuit attorney is MIA as auditor seeks answers She didn't left she left the coop She left the Lou She on the run Is she really? Oh, she's gone. Yeah, I'm disgrace state Lewis Circuit attorney Kim Gardiner is apparently missing an action as Missouri State Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick has made multiple attempts to locate her To ask questions about an ongoing audit of her former office Gardiner's office has been under investigation since 2021 When former Auditor Nicole Galloway was still in office Fitzpatrick stepped into the role in 2023 and subpoenaed a number of records from Gardiner's office But the office reportedly only delivered some of the requested documents. Fitzpatrick took Gardiner to court Uh in order to get the remaining information But instead of cooperating with the investigation she resigned from office in may of 2023 Uh, and in the month since Fitzpatrick has attempted to reach Gardiner either directly Or through her attorneys and has had no luck Quote this is a pattern of behavior with Kim Gardiner who hasn't shown a willingness to be transparent or accountable Fitzpatrick said and they news release on Monday quote Without questions she knows our audit is ongoing and that we want to speak with her about her time in office But she has made no effort to comply with our request or respond to our inquiries Even the tinnock governor of Missouri chimed in on this saying to tweeted out where in the world is Kim Gardiner dodging at Fitzpatrick Missouri apparently typical behavior for someone who refused to do her job um And uh, yes, I mean, you know She resigned and I think a large part of that is because of things that we've covered on the show that exposed a lot of this Um, she single-handedly fucked our entire city up dude single-handedly Yeah, and now we refuse for people that don't know St. Louis is one of the highest crime cities in the United States And the reason it's one of the highest crime cities in the United States is because this woman Kim Gardiner was our City prosecutor who was funded by George Soros who would not prosecute violent crime at all So the police would arrest these people they would go into jail They would be released and they wouldn't be charged and these violent criminals are out here killing people in their own Neighborhoods causing all these crimes burn and shit down shooting people hitting people with their cars Total fucking chaos, okay Like third world level chaos for sure and she Would not prosecute anything and the reason she wouldn't is because Soros Is funding those people and telling them what to do and we all know what the world economic forms uh slogan is is out of chaos comes order so their job in my opinion allegedly Is to destroy the cities by hiring prosecutors that won't prosecute crime, okay? And then they they they make it out to be racist when you call them out because usually these people or misogynistic usually People are women or they're black. Yep We're both yeah, or both. Yeah, I mean like Dude, it's fucked up. I remember when I went she deserves to be in prison, bro Like forever. Oh, that's being nice. Yeah, no, I know this is my being in the day like not I always think back Bro to that seven-year-old kid Xavier Uganda who was sitting in this house got killed by a drive by shooting The guy Turns himself in a week later and confesses to the crime. She lets him go. She said no, that's not enough evidence Yeah, you know what I'm saying? It's what's like I think about kids like that or I think about the thousands of other people That was happening dozens of times a day It was complete law. Bro the the day Alex and I would have took our save the date pictures downtown We were down in like heater plaza down there. There's other ones you did with the caddy. Yeah, those are sick Yeah, bro. How about a silly pull up? Yeah, fucking homeless dude fucking stabbed a fucking dude like If I remember that 50 feet from me, yeah, I'm saying and I remember following up that Yeah, it didn't get charged. Yeah, you know, I'm saying 24 hour hold and was released because prosecutors declined to press charges And so it's like it was completely law in this law lawlessness, right? And now this this fucking lady going she took a lot of trip She'll turn up We'll see man. She'll turn up. We'll see I think it's probably I'm sure she's innocent. Oh completely innocent Well, she's she's black. Well black people don't commit crimes Oh man, that was good. Um, yeah, man like Kim come on man. Wait, where yet? Come on out dress the people Um, cuz she ain't doing that. She's a fucking coward. You even voiced the people brother hitting her up. They're they're they're they're they're Yeah, I mean voice of the people bro. They seem to be pretty good people except for their they seem to be a lot of the brainwashed people that believe that Democrats are so for them. Yeah, like I read a lot of I follow that page. I like that page I hit like I kind of watch what's going on there. Good temperature. Yeah, and they're nice. They're good people They mean well, but like dude every single time you know something happens to black person It's racist and it's the fucking white man and it's democ or it's Republicans and guys that's just a true. It's not true It's not drinking the cool eight. Yeah, all that sugar got your fucked up Guys jumping on this kind of stuff to be said for full sugar cool eight. How many cups per picture?

She's gonna get run over dude Like I'm just saying karma's coming for a bro. All these people. Yeah, karma's coming for all these people They tried to pull a coup. They tried to pull a communist revolution people are waking to fuck up There's too many people that understand what's going on these people cannot win It doesn't matter if they cheat the election or what they cheat because everybody's awake So nobody's gonna comply and if it has to it probably will give violent. That's the truth so these people are done and They probably should run because the repercussions of the actions that they've taken are punishable by death That's the truth. They are treasonous actions and they're caught So if I was her I'd be in a non-extradition country doing whatever the fuck I could do pull a snowden Yeah, man All right, well guys, uh, but that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always That thumbs up a dumbest fuck and that's what we bring a headline to talk about it and again one of those two options That's address some culture Andy all right our thumbs up a dumbest fuck headline reads I snooped and found this ugly engagement ring in my boyfriend's bedside table How do I tell him I don't want it Let's dive into this man. God what the fuck is going on bro people are so entitled and so ungrateful Bro, it's fucked up, man So a girlfriend has shared her overwhelming disappointment after finding a Quonor quote ugly engagement ring in our boyfriend's bedside table Instead of being thrilled with the surprise find she was instead disgusted by the three stone diamond ring when she opened the box Eel Self-shame Friday here I come she wrote in a Facebook group alongside a photo of the ring Quote found this on the boyfriend's nightstand not a fan Please roast the ring and then tell me how to tactfully say no you need to get No, you need to go get something different.

Yeah real bitch Uh, another another comment sick Quote man, I'm neutral without more info. You should be allowed to like your own ring most of us wear for the rest of our lives a third Um, others took a more brutal approach with many accusing the girlfriend of having a bad attitude Uh, and even claiming she was bold for assuming the ring was for her at all And what have we got on this? Look dude Here's the thing We have such entitlement in certain areas of society right now where people are Are honestly just bad people It shouldn't matter what's kind of ring or what side bro.
