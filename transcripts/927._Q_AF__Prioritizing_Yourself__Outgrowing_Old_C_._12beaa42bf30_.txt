lined up got some writings let's drop a call okay yeah let's get our let's get Jesse on the line now now full transparency I don't know if this is like a guy Jesse or girl Jesse it's all right we can handle it it's Jesse let's give it Jesse a call up Jesse it's a guy hey Jesse what's going on bro how are you doing well I'm not doing too bad not doing too bad at all man where you call it from Georgia games gamesville yeah gamesville Georgia that's too close to Atlanta is it maybe about 45 to an hour somewhere on there okay that's not bad it's far enough to not get hit by a stray bullet or or yeah so what's happening Jesse how are you bro what's up Andy do well do well man yourself I'm doing great it's it's it's a great day to have a great day it is beautiful outside yeah so what can we help you with brother what's going on a lot man but most specifically are just speaking general terms how would you take care of yourself when everybody around you want the peace of you they're always asking for help help me to this help me that can you help me with this you know kids wife friends family so how could you keep yourself and check and straight to give the best for everybody else oh man I think a lot of people struggle with this dude but it's very simple and I learned this lesson I don't know it took me to us probably in my late 30s to really learn this lesson you know when you have responsibilities and for me yes I don't have kids but I've got family I've got businesses I've got people that depend on me and when you're someone that cares about those things it's very very hard to put yourself in front of those things and what I came to realize brother is that if I wasn't able to take care of myself and I wasn't in the best place I could be my ability to take care of the people around me suffer so I have this thing that I say pretty often and you got to be selfish to be self-liss and this is exactly what that means if you're not fit if you're not healthy if you're sick if you're poor if you're not in a place to be able to handle yourself you certainly can't handle everybody else around you so when we think about the natural way that people see other people when they start to take care of themselves they start to eat right they start to train they start to be dedicated to their goals a lot of people around those people will say oh you're starting to be selfish yeah but I'm being selfish so I can do all the shit you want me to do motherfucker so that is a common misunderstanding of the people around you and they really won't ever understand it but if you actually care you've got to understand it and do it if you value your sanity and your your own confidence and self-esteem and skill set you got to take care of yourself first bro because at the end of the day man and this is really gonna rub some people the wrong way but it's the fucking truth okay at the end of the day most people don't appreciate what you do for them they appreciate what you do for them in the moment that you do it when you when you know some time has gone by they don't appreciate it they don't think about it they don't give you the credit for it and you know it's it's a what have you done for me lately world and the problem with that is that when we are solution-minded and we are people that are empathetic and care and try to be active and help other people then of draining all the life force out of us dude to where we don't have the energy to pursue our own interests in our own development in our own skill set and that ends up leaving us with nothing that ends up leaving us with no you know emotional energy were drained were frustrated were angry and then also our own life our money our fitness our mental health our actual health we don't have any of it because we gave it up trying to help other people and so dude if you are someone and I'm not just talking to Jesse but if you are someone who is always being pulled on who is always being asked to help who has lots of responsibility and lots of responsibility might be just your kids man it's all different for everybody else but at the end of the day you have to understand that if you are not your best product you cannot help people effectively to the point of what you would be able to do and that was a perspective for me that took me almost 40 years to figure out dude but once I figured it out man I got everything that I ever wanted came into my life personally and then my ability to do good for other people increase exponentially so bro I understand that's a really hard thing especially when you care but you got to realize that if you don't put yourself first you're going to end up with nothing in the long run right does that make sense yeah that makes perfect sense and I'm assuming that's including learning how to say no right absolutely a big part of deal hey listen dude setting boundaries and saying no is a huge huge huge skill set if you lack the ability to say no and you're trying to become more successful financially you'll never be able to do it because people can sense that and the asks never stop okay um that's one thing you know but yeah you have to practice saying no and by the way no is a complete sentence you could just say no you don't have to give this big long justification and if someone says why you could say because I don't want to or because I said so or because I have to do this for myself and these are acceptable answers and we live in this society that's sort of like shames us for saying no or you know sometimes we're around friends and family that make us feel guilty for saying no and at the end of the day dude it's all bullshit and it's all stuff that'll keep you from becoming who you need who you want and need to become in order to be you know the best that you can be for yourself and everybody around you brother right right you struggle with that we're saying no yeah man absolutely because one of those things where it's like I was taught to get first before I before I ask or take yeah so saying no is not part of something that I grew up with you know yeah brother I do know I struggle with myself um you know one of my really good friends that it tells me this all the time um he's like bro you got to set better boundaries you got to set better boundaries you got to say fucking no fuck these people and uh you know he's right and and honestly I started listening to him a couple years ago when it came to that and it's made my life better it really has I still struggle with it and then the other thing is is the more successful you become dude you realize that you can help people tremendously in a in a way that is very impactful to them but maybe not as it doesn't hurt to like give like for example right now like if someone were to get in a hole for 500 bucks or a thousand bucks that that that's that's not a relevant amount of money for me and so I can very easily say here's a thousand bucks fix your problem but what happens when you do that is a couple things one you keep them from learning the lesson that they need to learn so that this doesn't happen again all right that's the first thing that you you are taking away their lessons in life that are important for them to learn and that was one of the most important uh I guess realizations that I have when it came to helping people and bro I still you know I'm very generous person but I don't help everybody it depends on the situation it depends on what happened and uh most of the time I say no because the truth of the matter is most of the time it's the consequence of their own poor decision making and they have to learn that lesson and then the other thing I learned is that when you save people and from their own karmic reaction that they've created you actually step in front of you know that that fist of karma and take that punch for them you know then you get that shit unloading on you and you know you're not the one that made the mistakes so we have to learn that you know other people have to be responsible for their own shit bro and when you're someone who is helpful and giving and someone who you know is just a kindhearted person dude people take advantage of it and it's it sucks so you got to be very intelligent and calculating about how you help because if you help the wrong person then they think that it's expected and then you've created a real problem where now they're going out and repeating mistakes over and over and over again and never learning the lesson we see this a lot with like people who are hooked on drugs like families who get someone who's like you know hooked on meth or or fucking crack or something and they'll keep they'll keep trying to help them and get them out of the hole and get them out of the hole and get them out of the hole and then what happens they become someone who's understands how to manipulate people and get what they want and they never work on solving the problems so you're a crunch now yeah for sure yeah and I was just I was just at dinner with some friends last night and we got on the topic and you know there's some they're very successful people and they were on the topic of of a person that they know who you know has needs but also has been fired from their job like seven times for showing up late and you know they they don't they don't do their part and you know that you just can't get yourself in that situation bro you've got to be smart you got to understand that not everybody has the same level of integrity that you have and that's a good thing to have don't lose it just be selective about where you put it out because when you do that you're giving a piece of you away you're giving energy from you away and the less energy that you have to work on you the you know the problem compounds about you not getting where you need to be and not being able to help anybody so that's a hard lesson dude saying no especially when you're someone that's a good hearted person bro right right that's not exclusive to you gotcha yeah yeah I mean I was I was I imagine a couple scenarios where you know saying no could have been a benefit and probably changed the course of my life as of right now but well yeah so what do you think that means in the future I got I gotta learn to say no that's right because you're already how old are you 31 yeah it's time to learn that bro it's time to learn that you know that's real man I think the biggest thing dude it just get comfortable saying no and not saying anything after it you know I'm saying like like I at first people are gonna take that as weird and it is weird at first but you got a condition yourself to say no and then you know later when you're more comfortable you can start providing a little bit more of a a window into why that reason is you know if needed but bro you don't need to explain yourself you don't need to you're a grown man you got responsibilities you need to put yourself first so that you can handle those responsibilities in the best way possible with the best product possible which is you and you have to be free to do that and that's gonna require you setting some boundaries and saying no yeah yeah yeah all right I appreciate that thank you very much you're welcome bro it takes practice dude it takes practice sometimes when you have to practice saying no you practice saying no to little things so that you get comfortable just saying it you know what I mean just look for opportunities when you're in your day-to-day life and acknowledge those little victories when you say no to things you actually don't want to do you know for me one of the things that that that I've always got caught up in is someone will ask me to do something months in advance and I'll say yes in the moment but but I really didn't want to do it and then I end up having to like cancel it or back out and I've just gotten more comfortable just kind of saying no I'm doing my thing and that's just taking a long time for me to get there and I gotta I gotta tell you dude I don't think it's really offended anybody I don't think it's I think people are comfortable I think at least I think this lack of communication is almost in our own heads you know um we fear what people are gonna say we we pain our our the worst possible reaction in our mind and then you know we kind of bitch out and you know when in reality had you just said no they would have probably been like they probably would have said well why not you'd be like hey because this and it be over you know what I mean yeah sick man believe me man I appreciate thank you yeah brother it's you bro all right Jesse I'll talk you later dude now yeah I appreciate you guys thank you for what you do thank you been to help with not just this but everything else in between thank you brother really appreciate that man you guys have a good one all right you too that I was thinking I think the most the hardest part of that process is just saying no the first time because then it's like you know you brought up like you know somebody that you're being a crutch to essentially but it's like the moment you stop helping them all then you're a piece of shit yeah you know I was saying then you got to deal with like that's the heart like but I feel like I mean I correct me from wrong I feel like you only got to do it like one maybe two times and then you're good yeah then you're good yeah dude it's it look man it's people got to know they can't step on your toes yeah and that's it and saying no in a very direct confident way and the kind of leaving it at that sort of sets that boundary for good oh yeah you know because like it's so it's so unexpected for people and they're they're not used to it to the point where like when you just say no and kind of leave it at that they almost think like whoa oh fuck are you mad at me yeah right you know no I'm not mad at you which is it's just no yeah and once you set that boundary you know people people start respecting it yeah 100 percent it doesn't take a long time to set that up no that's real man um it's almost like a perfect transition we got to write in the kind of let's expand on this a little bit more um guys any question number two deer and indeed Jay my name is Mark and I am 32 years old living in the northwest suburbs of Chicago Illinois I've been making significant changes in my life uh which uh it's impacted me for the better to save a long story I will just say I used to be a soy boy beta white knight self-describe okay um who blamed everyone for my shortcomings until 2020 happened and I essentially had my coming to Jesus moment um through listening to you in a few other podcasts I've managed to see that all the hills that I was willing to die on were basically BS uh so I changed up my weight training regimen as well um what I was eating who I was following on social media as I write this I've cleared up years of brain fog um I read a lot more than I watched TV on a maintain routine every day um even on the weekends the problem that I have uh the problem that I've been facing since I started making these changes is that I've been getting a lot of backlash because I'm not that guy anymore um I don't drink alcohol nor do I smoke cigarettes anymore cold turkey um I've even gotten to the point where I'm not materialistic as hell um nor do I grow out to eat I make all my food uh for the week at home um and being Indian I'm not big on eating Indian food anymore uh as it does not agree with my stomach uh so with all that being said my question is how do I how do I cut these people off uh and tell them that I'm doing this for my own personal benefit um I'm at the point where I really don't care what they have to say about me most of it is done behind closed doors anyway but I'm getting really tired of having to explain why I don't go to the club anymore um or why I don't want it go to this restaurant because it doesn't uh align with my new values or why I don't stay up to the wee hours of the morning uh because I want to get my 4 a.m. lifted always a pre-saturance I thank you for what you do PS I love the great energy by the way um the minute I cracked it open while driving I was pulled over by the police and I'm not saying that to be funny I'm being serious a lot of stuff there profile yeah sorry you gotta watch out for that great energy I don't eat Indian food no more because my stomach does not agree yeah that sounds like he's become full blown uh you know domestic tea oh yeah that's right that's right uh that's right hey all right first of all dude look congratulations on all the progress okay that's that's a big change uh uh you know going from being someone who's kind of like floating in the wind and bought into society's idea of being weak and sick and you know broken uh this way lesser version of yourself to pursue your ultimate potential and purpose for being in life by creating you and it being the best you that you could be is a massive change and a massive victory uh in regards to the people that you feel you have to explain you said you don't really care what they think well you fucking obviously dear you wouldn't be writing into the show all right a lot of people say oh I don't give a fuck but let me tell you something dude the people who say oh give zero fucks are the ones that give the most fucks okay so you have to understand that you owe them nothing you you don't owe them an excuse you don't owe them a reason you don't owe them an explanation for why it is you're trying to work out or trying to be healthier or trying to become what it is you're trying to become they are going to stay exactly where they are for the next 60 motherfucking years okay their best days have already happened your best days haven't even started unless you decide to stay in that circle and do what they do and you are at a point where it is time to move into what we call no man's land and no man's land is not a fun place to be in fact I think you're already there you're not going to eat you're making your food at home you're sort of isolating yourself and that is not the best way to do this okay you have to understand your old friend group your people who knew you from back in the day most of them are not going to come on the journey with you all right and then they're going to blame you and they're going to say you changed and you're not that guy well motherfucker I went and you could have came and you decided not to that is not my fucking fault all right and it's not yours either so you have to understand dude through life as we progress and continue down this path of personal development and personal improvement making more money getting more fit becoming the version of ourselves that we want to become in our lives we are going to move through different groups of friends through our life this idea of having a friend group from high school or college and staying super tight your whole life really only happens for people who stay in the same spot when they graduate college or high school or whatever the minute you start progressing they're not going to relate dude and nothing you say and nothing you explain and nothing you do the success you build will ever change that all right so you're going to move on from this friend group you're going to politely just stop answering the texts or be slow to answer the texts or not answer their calls stop giving them an explanation you don't need to give them one they'll fucking get it and continue down your path now as you continue down your path you're going to feel a little isolated like what you're explaining now but surely and slowly you're going to start developing a new friend group you're going to meet one person who is on the path that you're on and then you're going to meet a second and then you're going to meet a third and before you know it that old friend group that says shit like oh you changed and oh man you know you're not that guy anymore and you know you used to be fun uh don't forget who you are don't forget where you came from instead of people saying that they're going to be saying hey man how can I help you on this what do we do hey this will work for you hey that will work for you and now the conversation becomes cool because it's like you're having these amazing offensive conversations about how you're going to move forward and how you're going to do these things and how you can build together work together and then you're you're not going to have to defend yourself you're not going to have to expend energy trying to explain because they're going to get it all right and then what's going to happen is if you continue to level up some of these people out of that second group will go with you but some won't some will stay where they are they'll be happy at that level of development and that's fine this is not judgment this is about what you want for yourself and you're going to move on to the next group and you're going to go through the process again it's going to be you and you're not really going to relate to the second friend group anymore and then you're going to meet someone and then you're going to meet another person before you know you're going to have an even higher network that is even more aligned with what it is and dude the the value of the relationships that you have with people who are on the same path as you is much more fulfilling and much more valuable than trying to defend yourself against people who don't understand it all right so you go from anchors trying to pull you back to people who are doing everything they can they're picking up the phone they're opening up their black book they're calling people they're interviewing you they're trying to help you win which one of those situations would you rather be in all of us would rather be in the situation where we're surrounded by people who are helping us do what we want to do and that requires us leaving the things that we knew okay and if you don't do that the path will get so hard and those old friends they will call you at the right time when things aren't good and you're naturally wanting to quit anyway and they will convince you to fucking quit and then you'll go back and you'll end up being just like them and I see this happen I've seen this happen so many times that I couldn't even count I honestly couldn't this is why I believe most people lose they cannot break the bonds that they had with people that they either grew up with or quote feel loyal to we have this thing in society now where you know if you're not loyal to people from wave you're not real you're fake you're full of shit you're the bro say whatever the fuck you want okay you stay the same I fucking didn't if that makes me not real then fucking whatever it is that's what it is I don't care okay and you won't either because you'll be doing the things that you love you'll be contributing the things that you care about you'll be becoming who it is you want to be and you'll be creating what it is you want to create and none of those motherfuckers from back in the old day are doing any of that shit and by the way if they're cool you could still be friends of them you still might see them out once in a while you still might see them in a restaurant couple times a year you might grab a beer but like do this is not an all the time thing and people ruin their chances of success by being too loyal to the wrong people okay the person that you have to be loyal to the most is yourself it's yourself and you're not doing yourself any favors by being loyal to people who are gonna hold you back because they've guilted you into you know being real quote unquote so look man it's a process everybody goes through it you have to go through it if you want to move on from where you are and you're already doing this you've got three four five years under your belt it's time to move the fuck on okay so whatever you got to do you can tell them again but if I were you I just stop explaining it and people will eventually know they'll eventually say oh well that's what he does and they won't fuck with it so you know well the part that you said they could have came to yeah they could like you know what talks about that bro I think about my friends all the fucking time what you could be here too man and you know what I thought to you man is like the truth of the matter is is that if you really care for your for those people if you really care for those friends or whoever it is sometimes the only fucking chance that they'll ever have to get out of that is to see you fucking get out of it yes you know what I'm saying like you got to go yeah you got to go and and if you really care about them show them what the fuck it looks like show them what it takes yeah they could have came man bro listen do the hurts man I hurts because you care for those people bro no it doesn't hurt it is what it's reality hmm it's just real it's fun dude when you've been doing something long enough you start to just accept things for what they are yeah that's that is what the point of the show is it's just it's a realist mentality it just is what it is man and if you don't operate in the what is and you always operate in the what should be you can't win you'll always be fighting a struggle that you you can't win so you have to acknowledge things and bottom line them for what they are they're gonna stay there I'm not going to stay there it is what it is I have nothing against them if there is something against me I don't give a fuck and that's that yeah yeah man you dude you listen I don't know like I think you got to get to a point and this is part of the reason why like you know developing yourself with discipline and mental toughness and grit and fortitude and all these things because dude most people can't say no and can't have a conversation about boundaries or can't move on because they lack the confidence to do so they don't believe in themselves and so you have to build that belief in yourself you know through a program like live hard that's why it's a program that you that you do every single year because it keeps your confidence in yourself belief in your grit and your fortitude and your mental toughness sharpened so that these kind of things don't creep in and throw you off track the more confidence you have in yourself the easier it is to say no to everybody else because you know that you'll be fine on your own and a lot of people that lack confidence feel like they can't move down the path on their own because they don't believe in themselves so you know the more confidence you can develop the easier that process this whole process is going to be yeah that's real shit man I love it another call yeah yeah shall we this is Trevor that's good let's give Trevor a call this Trevor what's up man this is DJ what's going on DJ you tell me man what's going on with you call man just join this beautiful day trying to get some yard work done where you act Trevor I'm south of Saint Louis just about 70 miles how you doing man I'm doing good bro where in Leesburg yeah just north of steelville yeah all right all right cool man probizaria yep yep so what's happening bro how can we how can we help you well this is kind of surreal I didn't expect to get a get called but man I really appreciate you guys taking the time to call me and you know sort of what my question revolves around is you don't know what you don't know and you being an entrepreneur I'm more of an entrepreneur I work for a company that I'm working to make them a better company so I've been putting some leadership positions and I guess I feel like I'm doing really good becoming a leader but the question I'm going to have is what is sort of that lie or misconception that we tell ourselves when we're in that leadership position that delay us from making the leap from being a really good leader to be a great leader we tell ourselves we're great leaders before we're actually great leaders that that's what that's what keeps people from becoming a great leader so it's ego people believe that if they have a leadership title that they're automatically a leader when in reality that's not true at all in fact a lot of people don't understand that they might have the role of leader on their team but there might be someone else leading your team that technically is below you and this is where we run into situations like undermining and difficulty to build a team and build a culture but the reason that those things ultimately pop up is because we think we're better than we are and so to be a great leader you have to understand that you're not that great okay and that mean that that is the proper application of humility when it comes to becoming good at something I know what I'm good at but I also know that I could be much better at the things that I'm good at and that opens me up to learning that opens me up to hearing new perspectives or learning new lessons about whatever the skill set might be and in this case it's leadership so if you walk in and you think man I'm a good leader I the boss gave me the role of leader I'm the leader you mother fuckers better do what I say because I'm the leader you'll never be a great leader the way that you have awareness about wanting to be a great leader is how you become a great leader because you're already humble enough to even ask and say how can I be better how can I avoid mistakes how can I XXX these are things that people who suck at leadership never ask themselves they're not even aware of it bro so the fact that you're aware of it is a huge deal I think the second thing that is very important and very true I think people underestimate the leading by example piece I think they believe that they can lie or skate around it or pretend or somehow trick everybody around them into thinking that they're doing the things that they're supposed to be doing and that never works people much smarter than than people give them credit for they they're automatically also looking at their leadership with a very fine microscope okay so like when you combine the attitude of oh they're not going to see it with their ability to micro analyze every single move they're going to see that you're not leading by example so yeah bro so like dude most leaders don't do that and it's it's the simplest thing man it's monkey see monkey do they're going to hold the standard that you hold they're going to do the things that you do if you pick up the trash they're going to pick up the trash if you hold a standard of a clean truck they're going to have a clean truck the all these things come from what they observe and you know most people just don't do it dude they they hear you know the lombardi quote you know leading by example isn't the best way to lead it's the only way to lead and they think that's some like abstract bullshit and it's not it's the truth and then thirdly dude I think that leaders also underestimate what their job really is their job is not just to like stand at the front and say this is what we're doing dude when you're a great leader man you got to you got to work with people you got to you got to get right in with them and and you know figure out what drives them what's their goals what is it they care about what are the things that move them what skills do they need to learn like one of the ways that you can best build a great team is by teaching them skills that they didn't have and a lot of people aren't willing to do that but dude when we transfer as humans are knowledge from our brain into their brain there's literally nothing more valuable perception wise than we can give another person is our knowledge so a lot of people in leadership they will say things like well that's their job to to learn those skills yeah but if they learn it from you bro how much more are they gonna love working with you how much more effective are they gonna be how much more are they gonna want to go to battle with you and it's time to fucking you know batten hatches down and fucking go to war like the you have to do the work of not just leader but coach and teacher and mentor and and big brother sometimes you know and and that's a that's a thing that a lot of people just aren't willing to invest in their people with you know they they will say things like oh well they get paid yeah okay well you're gonna lose bro like it has to be more than that so but man we could go on and on but at the end of the day brother like I would say that's the top three things really I see people mess up you know and maybe the fourth thing would go in with the first thing which will be like you know people's egos thinking that if you're a leader people oh you shit that's not what it is man you owe them you're working for them yep you're leading them you're helping them the best leaders understand that your job is to facilitate the success of your team it's not to sit in the office with your desk up and act like you you've got a 20 foot dick bro like it's it's I fucking care about people I'm gonna help you win we're gonna win together we're gonna do the work together here's what we're trying to do this is how it benefits you this is how it benefits us as a team and let's go fucking do it and then you know you you got to build these guys into doing that so but bro I'll give you a lot of credit man because like most guys won't even ask they won't even ask they're too proud yeah I want to set my team up for the best success in their life and I think you hit on two things when you point two and point three or the things that I'm the most concerned about with myself I'm a guy that that learns just by going out and doing yeah and what I really struggle with I think right now is that line of going out and doing it with my team and also stepping back enough to allow them to struggle to learn on their own yeah and I guess maybe that's where I'm concerned is I learn really well by doing it if I fail I learn from that and I learned that better than someone telling me I guess what I'm concerned is is if I'm trying to take that same approach to offer to somebody else and am I missing out on an opportunity to teach them in a different way and I guess that's that's where I was really concerned about how my leadership skills are affected by what my previous experiences were man you know that's a really good question and I think there is a lot of ways everybody has their own like quote unquote leadership style but if we think about what our job is and you said it right away my you know I want to put my team in a position to win first of all that's another thing I didn't mention was with the intent like when you have a team and they can feel that you care about their success as a leader they can feel that intent and makes a much better team but as far as like the way to teach him I think a lot of people have different ways but but my way is the one that you described which is sit down explain it give them a couple swings of the bat you know they're going to miss the ball and uh and then fine tune it step back let them make their mistakes fine tune it and then they'll get it and and by letting them make a few mistakes and learn on their own you're allowing them to build confidence in their own skill set which will pay off dividends long term does that make sense yep so yeah it's really bro it's fucking frustrating because you're sitting there and you're like fuck dude like this is basic shit but it's not basic to them okay it's yeah and and and dude the the older we get and the more season we get and the more experience we get that part gets a lot harder because some of the things that make up the foundational principles of your skill set you've forgotten and it's and it's like speaking Chinese to them so we have to remember dude also as leaders like who were leading and what they've known and and they don't know what we know and I struggle with this for a long time as a leader I used to get really fucking pissed off when people couldn't do basic shit but then I started realizing if I just kept my cool and I sat down and say look why are we doing this why did you do it that way and they'll say well you know I thought this was the way and I said no we need to do it like this because this and this usually dude like 99% of the time they're like oh fuck I got it and we default I think a lot of times dude also we default into thinking that people are being lazy and they're not being lazy they just don't fucking know now sometimes they are being lazy but most of the time I found they don't know people want to win they want to contribute they want to be a part of a team they want to they want to do well winning is fun winning is fun for everybody and it's it's especially fun for people who've never won and and if you can lead if you can lead people into like learning a skill and winning as a team bro like that's a big that's a big skill set to teach people because most people never win so dude I'll be real with you I think you're setting a foundation to be a tremendous reader leader I think you're asking the right questions I think you're concerned about the right things and the fact that you have the awareness is going to mean that you're not going to struggle with that man that where people run into this learning new skills and becoming better is when they're not even aware they suck they're not even aware that they need to get better they're not even aware of they they just look they just look at it like this is my job and those people never do well they always struggle they always go from job to job to job job job job and I never understood it man because like we spend so much of our time in our work and with the people that we work with why the fuck will we not want to be the best at what we do you know and absolutely yeah like we're gonna be here anyway bro let's fucking win I was gonna win yeah that's what I'm saying and uh and and let's have fun doing it dude exactly I love what I do bro there's none I would not trade my fucking life for anybody's life on the planet zero chance I love the people I get to do this with I love what we do I'm so grateful that I get to do it I mean dude I get to come in here I get to work with all these amazing people who work fucking super hard who care about people who change people who then then you know we we change people's lives like dude when I when I think about what I get to do bro it's fucking amazing and if I were to look at it like oh this is just my job and I gonna show bro it was fucking suck like the the difference in perspective is so massive and if you just acknowledge like hey man I this is something we're gonna do if it's not here it's gonna be there if it's not there it's gonna be there because I got a fucking eat and if you just have the perspective of man you know what this is hard but it could be a lot harder you know uh and I really appreciate doing this like dude it makes it so much more fun it's so much easier to build a team and so like you know I got criticized on the internet uh some dude said something like well it doesn't look like you're winning to me you know you're at work seven days a week yeah motherfucker cuz I fucking love it I fucking love it yeah I love it it's you this person you can't understand that fun for me is not fun for you I don't have fun sitting on the fucking uh on the river bank drink of fucking beers bro that now once in a while I do but like that's not my main goal in life and dude I come here every day bro I get to see gazillion tags of my social media people changing their lives with 75 hard and live hard or the podcast or building a business or losing a hundred pounds here through our transformation contest like dude what the fuck is more fun than that like and then doing it with your friends like you you know one of the things that we talk about dude is being happy right and a lot of people can't figure out that happiness is like not this place that we arrive at it's an emotion that we create over and over and over again throughout the day that compounds and part of what that is is the people that you do it with and the and the thing that you do and so you know when you have a good purpose and you have good people and you have discipline working for you and you're grateful to do it bro it's impossible not to have fun and be happy it's impossible so yeah and I know that's a little off track bro but like it all intertwines together you know no I love it man absolutely yeah I mean that I stumbled into what I'm doing now and I love it I mean we always say we hired a retire at our company but I mean the way I feel about where I work and what I do is I'm I'm here until I die almost man I don't know what else I would do yeah I mean I love love this so much and I just want to be able to inspire other people to do that and that's why I want to be that great leader yeah I want to be able to instill that same pride with what they're doing for us you know as a company you know we're all winning but I want them to feel that same pride as well for sure dude and that's a noble thing and that's a great thing that all great leaders possess it's not just about them the greatest leaders in the world it's not about them that's like the misconception of great leaders like great leaders are almost to the point where they don't want the attention they don't want people to notice them they want people to notice the team and poor leaders are kind of like what we have running the government so the world right it's about ego and it's about recognition and it's about you know I'm the shit I'm the most powerful dude that's not that's not even real power dude real power is changing so many motherfuckers lies that they tell everybody all the good shit about you you know what I mean so yeah and dude I don't know about you but when I die I hope that you know people will at least say hey that guy you know he made my life a lot different my life would have been a lot different in a bad way had I not come across Andy for seller that's what the fuck I want and you can't you can't fake that you can't you can't have acid bro you got to be real you got to invest time in people you got to care about people and bro you already have these qualities man like I'm actually super excited to hear from you because a lot of people just they want to be great leaders but they lack the ability to care about people enough to be great leaders you know yeah I think some of the greatest things I get to see from my team right now is not just how well they're doing in work but I've hired some younger people that have had an opportunity to learn some skills and I've gotten to see their their personal life grow around them and that's been sort of the most rewarding I guess I would say outside of work is being able to see them to kind of transform their personal lives to be able to do some different things that they weren't doing before bro it's the greatest fucking thing ever like dude when I started in business you know I was I was broke dude so you know obviously when I'm young you know my goal was to take care of myself I had a lot of cool shit that I wanted to do in my life and you know I live a ridiculously cool life and have for a long time but my what I derive value out of and what I get excited about now is exactly what you just said when I see young people start work learn build skills build a career you know move through the chain you know get engaged get married have a kid by their first house by their second house like these nice car yeah those are the fuck that is the fucking best thing ever it's the best thing ever so I totally feel you on that bro Trevor I enjoy you calling in dude why don't you uh you know calling on a regular basis bro I like talking to people that got got a little bit of the idea going you know I'm saying it sounds like you're doing real good bro I appreciate that man absolutely I'd love to talk to you guys more I mean DJ Andy you guys really providing a great service man I mean I've been listening to the podcast now for a little over a year it's really changed a lot about how I approach things and how I think about things and I'm really you know really thankful for you guys doing this and putting the effort in man I mean free of charge I mean I share the show absolutely with family friends but man I just I really appreciate what you guys are doing here well bro we appreciate you too because the whole reason we do this is so that people like you will go out and do exactly what you're doing so it's really cool to hear this honestly dude like this makes my whole fucking day to be honest so I appreciate you bro thank you so much thank you guys appreciate the time all right see you Trevor yeah dude I love that I was gonna ask you I mean because it's very important like there has to be measurements right in life you have to be able to measure your goals whatever it is your weight loss right you gotta use your scale so as a leader what is the measurement of a good leader like what is that unit of measurement for a good leader I don't know I mean first of all winning I mean the fucking scoreboard are you fucking winning okay and different different teams have different cultures you know at the highest level of anything business sports whatever organizations the scoreboard is the fucking I mean it's no one you're expected to have all the other shit you know um as you get lower you know there can be more room for development and growth and it's kind of like when someone starts to work out with weights and they've never worked out before the amount of growth that they have right in the beginning is is just a lot okay um and then when they become a peak athlete they can train much harder and get diminishing returns and so when you're at the highest level you know the returns that you see maybe not be as great but they really help sharpen performance to put points on the board and I think that when you're you know when you're in the phase of leadership of development I believe that yes points on the board of the most important things still but another metric that must be considered is the growth of the individuals and the team in terms of development of skill sets that they they need to win yeah you know yeah well so I you know it just depends on where you are you know if you're coaching the fucking chiefs um you know there in someone you know drops five passes you know it's it's not the conversation isn't oh well you dropped seven last year it's get the fuck off the team you're not good enough okay but when you're in high school and you drop five passes the conversation is a little different you know what I'm saying yeah so well the stakes are different yeah and it just depends on where you are you know we you know we're operating at the highest level here now now we are at we have graduated at the point in our companies where it's you got to put okay but that doesn't mean that I don't that I stop trying to develop this is mean I stop trying to teach but before we were you know 10 like 10 years ago when we weren't here it was more so taken people and developing them they had tremendous amounts of growth um just depends on where you're at what the culture of the team is and what you're doing but I think the ultimate the ultimate measure of a great leader is always the fucking scoreboard okay it just is I love it dude so and that scoreboard could look different if you're a teacher that scoreboard would might be how many of the kids graduated at a certain percentage right how many went on to be successful how many went on to do this if you're the coach of a football team in high school how many of your players went on to college how many graduated it's it's I guess what I'm saying is is that it just depends yeah you know what I mean but whatever you're a school I will say this every fucking points on it I will say this great leaders in my opinion value the scoreboard and the development of their team and they look at what the scoreboard says what the growth of their team is and if they're really good leaders they they they look at that growth across all spectrums of that person's life they try to develop that into a high character high functioning high contributing human in society that doesn't mean they're gonna be perfect that doesn't mean that they're gonna have not gonna have flaws you know a lot of times when people hear certain leaders talk they think that that leader is you know presenting themselves as holier than thou when in reality there is no perfection there's always going to be weak points in people's lives and you know that's called being a human and a great leader will try to help people work through those things in my opinion 360 in their life you know saying hey hey bro look dude you've been here it's fucking it's you have three kids at home you've been here every day for two weeks till 10 o'clock and I know it's because you got three kids at home you might get your fucking ass home right you know I'm saying right so right it's there's a lot of that kind of stuff you know hey you good well I could tell you I could tell you're you know little off what's slipping what's going on you know like that's not in your character these are these are the kind of things and it can't be fake you have to actually care it can't be like lip service they could fuck a feel it oh yeah you know you know do you know when you're being sold absolutely so do that so you got to be genuine dude and I think most of the things in life like we talk about this a lot being a great salesperson being great at speaking being great at a leadership being great at running a company these all start with the proper intent because people could fucking feel it you know what I'm saying so yeah I mean it's the metric is it's different for everybody you know what I'm saying like like like coach wooden who's the most successful basketball coach the most successful coach of all time you know he he didn't just look at his victory as the points on the board I mean he started with like hey this is how we're gonna put our socks on this is how we're gonna put our shoes on this is how we're gonna run the drills and he would gauge success not off the scoreboard but off the fucking the effectiveness of the discipline during the practice which is why the points appeared on the scoreboard right same thing Nick Sabin does Nick Sabin talks about you know we're not gonna practice till we get it right we're gonna practice till we cannot get it wrong that's a complete different fucking standard that most people don't understand and when you are of the leader and when you are in a leadership position and you want to really build a great team you've got you've got to push them to the point where they're not gonna fuck it up it's become second nature it's breathing it's it's it's automatic you know it's tying your shoes you know what I mean absolutely dude that's some gas for Monday bro yeah yeah man all right so yeah we'll see them all right yes sir all right all right guys you know the deal don't be a hoe all right
