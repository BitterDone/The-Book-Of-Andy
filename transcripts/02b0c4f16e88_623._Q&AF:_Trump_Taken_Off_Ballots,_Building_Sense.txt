would you assume like I don't know a lot I mean it's a lot a lot a lot yeah now I've been saying in different pockets like yeah like unrelated pockets having their own fucking no it's it's not like tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of shit it's a shit ton of people pretty fucking cool it is cool to see yeah it's cool to see everybody like because dude like we need people to get better and I think people are realizing that it's more than just like I need to get and shape or loosen weight yeah they realize they need to get better new book launch today new book launch today yeah book launch yeah so we guys haven't checked that out yeah go to Andy for seller.com the book of mental toughness it's fucking awesome yeah it's uh it's gonna be a big year yeah it's gonna be cool I think I think this this can be a big year for a lot of people in a couple of different ways right but it can also be like dude I feel like this is gonna be 2020 but like the stakes are just so much higher yeah I also think that a lot of people and that's what makes it like look I've talked to a lot of people who were like man it's really hard to focus when all this stuff's going on in society and we feel like they're gonna you know ruin the country and do all this crazy shit and you can look at that one of two ways you can look at that as yeah like that's true or you can look at it and it's like yeah that's a reason for me to get my shit together right and that's what we need to do right I also feel like people are way more aware of what's actually going on now they're aware of the deception they're aware of the artificial division they're aware of the manipulation of language they're aware of cancel culture and the and the emotional manipulation that goes on around all this stuff and it feels like people are breaking out of the matrix so to speak yeah and uh you know the better that people get the more they focus on themselves their mind their body their soul their income their community their household the less power these people are gonna have no matter what they do yeah you know what I mean yeah yeah yeah it's awesome like even my sister my sister uh she's on 75th heart right now she's trying to that I think she's probably day 15 16 now yeah by now you know I'm saying but like she she's on it dude and like it's just really really cool to see man it's cool to see and I think for a lot of people like you know shit this can either be a really really amazing year for you yeah and you go a thousand fucking steps ahead or you're gonna be a thousand steps behind yeah I think that's an important thing for everybody to think about especially today you know a lot of people are thinking about what they're going to accomplish and what they're going to do and you have to understand that first of all we are in a competition okay the winner's circle so to speak like people like to talk about abundance and they like to talk about everybody gets to win but it's just not the truth you are in competition and in times like these especially in entrepreneurship but also yourself everybody else tends to get worse and if you can get better at why does the gap between you and everybody else okay and that we saw this in 2020 we saw a lot of people just give up you know quarantine 50 you know right we saw this it was a normal thing and a lot of people got better and a lot of people didn't I was one of those people that got way better and a lot of you guys worked too and I intend on doing that again because I know and we all know that they're gonna pull some majorly disruptive shit over the course of the next 12 months and this is the time to widen the gap between you and everybody else to where you know when these things settle down which they ultimately will good will prevail you want to be at the top of your game and you want to be running you don't want to be fit you know testing yourself off stretching and getting steamrolled yeah right yeah that's real shit man so that's great well this is Q&A guys remember these are your questions so so you got to send your questions in you can email them in to ask Andy at Andy for solar dot com or you can go on YouTube under the Q&A episodes right there in the comments section ask them in there and we'll pick some from there as well yeah so that being said let's get right into our questions and guys question number one Andy with Trump being taken off the ballots in Colorado I know it that got reversed but now in Maine I just wanted to know where your thoughts are on this what are the implications you think it will have on the country moving forward I think people recognize it at least from what I can tell even people who are not fans of Donald Trump recognize that this is not in line with the constitution it's not in line with how we're supposed to operate as a country and I think it's scaring people and I actually think it's scaring people onto the side of Donald Trump I think it's some of the greatest marketing that he could receive I don't think it'll stand you know the situation main that was made by a single person that was not made by there wasn't a court to say that was a single person their secretary of state basically and I believe that the people who are doing these things are doing them for their own clout and their own attention or their force to do well I don't I don't think that's what it is because I watch how this woman reacted to it and you could tell she thought she did something amazing and what I think is is a lot of these people live in these little you know let's be honest here okay the progressive left they don't tolerate any other kind of person you know the people in the middle and the people who are more conservative they will be friends with people and this is proven in studies they will be friends with people who have different political beliefs the progressive left are legitimate communist and they legitimately believe that if you have different beliefs than them that you are a moral piece of shit and fuck you and that is their attitude and that's why they're in this predicament in the first place because they have no capacity for diversity of thought and leaves them with like fucking seven people to be friends with yeah right so you have to understand every single human being that that woman talks to thinks like her it acts like her so in her friend group she's probably getting high fives and shit right but but what she doesn't understand is that there's 330 million other people out here that are like what the fuck are you doing right and they're starting to see the lengths that this modern Democrat party which is not Democrat at all it's it's communist Democrat is a completely different thing you know people who identify as Democrats which I think it's dangerous to identify as anything I think we should all just remove any attachments to labels that we have and say this is the person that we need right now this is the person that we need right now depending on what's going on and vote for that person I think we would have much more productive electoral process if we did that however when we when we consider what the Democrat party is currently it is not representative of what most Democrats actually believe and they're having a hard time with that because now they feel politically homeless now these people are feeling like fuck well I definitely am not ultra conservative you know but these people are legitimately attacking our systems and our court systems and are they're weaponizing and what's happening is those people are starting to realize that if they step out a line that they will be punished just the same as the people who disagree with them already and they know that's wrong and so what I actually think is happening because of this is it's pushing way more people away from Joe Biden and the Democrats and and into a different territory now whether they go vote for Trump or don't vote at all I don't know but it's certainly not working in their in their behalf and it's certainly doing a good job of waking everybody up to the the lengths these people will go to an interfere with an election which only lends more credibility to what they did in 2020 that everybody pretends like they didn't do you know Trump's winning in the five swing states that he lost Georgia Pennsylvania Michigan Wisconsin and Arizona and then all of a sudden overnight it's flipped there's a pipe burst machines broke this that the other and everybody's like oh well you know and then Joe Biden wins by 20,000 votes you know and those people are starting to recognize holy shit dude they really did cheat it was actually yes and now they're looking at it and they're saying look at the situation that's been created by that cheating where we have open borders we have insane amount of inflation we have things costing more than they've ever cost it we have our strategic oil reserves drained to the lowest possible level ever we have which by the way that's for military action just so you know like that makes us incapable of operating a military we have our weapons in you know Eastern Europe because they left them in Afghanistan and fucking sent the rest to Ukraine right like and then we have you know all these other things happening I mean we go on and on and on on but the reality is is it's opening people's eyes in my opinion anybody with a critical thinking brain who can put their biases aside and think critically people are waking up and so that's how I see it playing out and that's why I really haven't said too much about it and I'm not like I don't need to say anything more about it because everybody's seeing it they're saying it's so yeah right like and like dude you know so that's what I take on it and and you know it's it's unconstitutional and I don't think it'll stand and I think the Supreme Court will step in very soon and say hey quit fucking doing this shit but I think it's a bunch of one-off progressive dumbfucks who think they're going to be celebrated or advanced like dude you gotta understand these people these people are 100% committed to winning they're they're they're not playing by the same rules they don't care about the rules and they want anybody who disagrees with them to be punished or eliminated like these are dangerous people their Marxists their communists they're not American Democrats and there has to be a distinction had between those two groups if we ever want to have real unity because there's a big part of America who has common sense but also it doesn't want the the conservative rights boot on their neck with all their standards right because like when we look at like the the far right and the far left now I will take the far right every day over the far left why so something yeah but a lot of people don't want to live by those standards they don't want to be you know attacked for not going to church every Sunday and they don't want to be attacked for maybe not living the exact perfect traditional life you know what I'm saying they have more of a liberal mindset there are so most people in this country I believe in common sense are more socially liberal and visibly conservative and they are becoming more socially conservative because they're awakening to the damage that these ultra liberal social policies are creating in society so like for me for example and it's be real you know for the lap up until like 2020 I was I like didn't care about like I didn't think that any kind of social like I didn't like I was all like live and let live right let people do whatever they want but then what I've realized is now when we have that attitude let people do whatever they want there's certain people in society will do absurd shit morality goes out the window yes and they will do immoral things like they will these pedophiles now will dress up at and drag and go shake their dicks in front of little kids like dude I'm not with that right like there's all and there's this sympathetic attitude towards pedophilia now and that's a that's a globalist communist initiative this is why in these other countries in Europe who are ahead of us quote unquote unquote ahead of us socially I don't mean ahead of us in a better way right they're further down the road of communism we have these elected officials like that woman in Spain saying screaming at the entire government saying that children have the right to sleep with adults if they choose to if they can say yeah yeah and like dude that's fucking bullshit so like what I've come to realize is like people aren't responsible enough to make moral decisions just because you or I might be right so we have to have some sort of moral framework in society otherwise we end up with that yeah well that's where the laws come in place right like that's why we have those laws for when morality is absent that's what the laws are therefore they're still they're not being enforced yeah or they're not hard enough right and I I think there's I think there's a major corrections that are coming I think there's a big economic corrections coming I think that there's a big social culture correction that's coming and I think ultimately what these people are doing is showing themselves for who they are and they should be taken seriously and you should understand and go read about history and what Bolshevism is and what Marxism is and what these people have done once they've gotten empowered a people to disagree with them they are not live and let live they are kill everybody who doesn't agree with them because they can't make they cannot gain ground on the merit of their arguments that's why these people can't argue that's why when you go to college campuses and you try to have a discussion with some of these like crazy crazy progressive people they fucking scream or they yell or they throw a tantrum or they act like a child because dude they can't what they want does not actually compute you know so they have to act like a toddler and when these people gain power in large enough numbers they act like a toddler in a way of eliminating anybody who says anything that's outside their perspective and that's not what the world's about that's not what humanity's about that's not definitely not what America's about and it should be taken seriously and I think this year we're going to have a big pivotal year and it's either going to go the way of total the best that America has ever been or it will be the fall of America and it depends on the people listening to this show and other people like them realizing that we are in a critical point in time in American history and human history where their voices is needed their actions are needed their standards are needed and it's important that we all take a role in living what we believe America should be guys Andy question number two Andy what have you found is the best way to create a sense of urgency within a team or organization to encourage immediate action I mean transparency is probably the best way you know when when you need urgency out of an organization it's usually because the organization is under performing and what typically happens is the people who are running the organization don't want to create panic in the organization so they hide the fact that the organization is struggling and they try to create urgency in other ways and the reality is is you know if you're just transparent about where things are and what you're trying to accomplish usually the urgency the appropriate urgency will follow naturally because people want to be a part of something they care about their careers they care about doing well and that ultimately that dot ultimately connects but at the end of the day you know different kinds of leaders at different levels will use different ways to make people urgent and also different employees will respond differently to ways to make people make urgent some people will respond with the truth some people can respond because hey look we need to grow things need to get better and they will be a mature employee will hear that and understand what that means attack to your employee will always act with urgency but that's that's a rarity okay that's 10% of your team so transparency for some people works for some people it's hey if you do this I can get you this like there's a reward system in place and some people it's hey if you don't fucking do this bro you're fucking out right and and so it's a mixture of all those things and and a good leader knows what percentage of of what amounts to use to motivate the team properly to be urgent ultimately they're going to take their cues from you as the leader and if they're not urgent it's probably because you're not urgent and if you are urgent and you run a high level program like like let's just use college football right like Nick savings program which is a I'm a fan of the way he runs his program they are urgent every single day they are urgent every single practice they are urgent on every single play of every single practice on every single rep in the weight room it's urgent okay and and the pressure of a national championship is legitimately on these players every fucking workout of every every time they step into that facility and if you really want to win long term you should work to build that level of performance into your organization to where everybody knows that we're not fucking around you know what I'm saying and and dude what'll happen is you'll attract people who are built to handle that kind of pressure and they will perform in that kind of pressure and some people will come in they think you know hey I'd love to play for University of Alabama or hey I'd love to be a part of first form but once they get in there they don't fucking like it because it's hard as fuck and there's a lot expected you know what I'm saying so there's a lot of ways to create urgency but ultimately it comes down to you as the leader being urgent and building a culture of urgent action at all times yeah and that takes time and that takes practice and that takes you know development as a leader as well I mean it sounds like it needs a certain level of acuity to be able to even just sense that let me actually this when it comes to this urgency thing you kind of hit on it where it's like most people will find we talk about this when you talk about selective urgency right like most people catch themselves it's too fucking late yeah it's too late so can we talk a little like how do you rebound that when you as a leader realize shit it's too late like how do I get 10 people to get on the same page right now and this shit was unfortunately sometimes when it's too late it's too late and the loss is inevitable you know you can't wait till the game is 28 to 0 to start being serious about playing the game you're gonna lose okay you're gonna lose most of those games in fact the only games that ever come back from a win of that deficit or historic so the chances are you're going to lose and what you're gonna have to do is you're gonna have to take that L and you're gonna have to learn as to why you lost that game and you lost that game because you don't have a culture of urgency from the get go intensity urgency wanting to fucking win and wanting to win by a lot I believe is a necessity to high level winning I don't nobody comes in at a high level whether it be a football program or a company or an organization or anything and says you know we're gonna take it easy until it's time to go they're gonna hit every single play every single rep every single call every single interaction every single opportunity as if it's the only one and that's what great organizations have in common they don't waste reps they don't waste opportunities they don't waste practice plays they don't fucking coast and because they don't do that that culture never materializes and they're always on top of the game and and dude that that's hard for a leader to install into their system because it takes a lot of energy to always be at that level but that's what's required if you want to be great and and you know we have this culture in the world of softness and you know non competitive nature and everybody gets a chance to win and the reality is it's just not that way that's a false reality you never hear people who are winning big talk like that you never hear people who have won 10 national championships or 24 mr. Olympia titles or built multi billion dollar companies saying like I could wait till tomorrow no those motherfuckers are on it today and that's a level of urgency you don't ever see people who are high six seven figure earners you know coasting it's not it's not you cannot win at that level with that kind of attitude and because the internet has become this uh information center that just shoves the quick easy fast no stress no anxiety win and people's face as a possibility there's a lot of people out here that just do not understand the inputs required to actually win I would say that the average quote unquote want to be entrepreneur out there who wants to build something who wants to be successful who wants to become great I would say they underestimate the amount of work they have to put in by a thousand times not not ten times not a hundred times by a thousand like it's a thousand times harder and it takes a thousand times more effort than what those people actually think that it takes and uh and that comes from the internet and so there's a balance there right like you want someone who's starting off to be somewhat ignorant to how much it's going to take because if they knew how much it was actually going to take they probably wouldn't do it because it's too fucking hard okay um like if I knew what it was going to cost me that by the way today is 25 years in business for me fucking today you have 25 that's fucking crazy um yeah that's that's kind of worth it um 25 years in business today if you had caught me on day one and like let's say I could teleport back in time and I could say hey this is what your life's gonna look like but this is what the fuck it's gonna take but I don't know if I would have done it I don't know if I would have done it because it's too much it's been too fucking hard yeah and while I'm able to push through it and while I now I'm glad I did it it it was just fuck I have a decision it was exponentially harder than what I expected to be because I was ignorant to that I just kept going right and also I didn't have any options I didn't have any options to fall back on I didn't I don't have a college education I don't have uh rich family members that can support me I don't have a backup plan and so you know that ignorance combined with not having any options and now convincing myself I still don't have any options right like I come in here every day and I think everybody in here knows this with high levels of intensity and willingness to win and I I think if you ask most people in here they think I'm fucking insane because like I act like if I'm gonna if I don't fucking produce today I'll be digging ditches tomorrow yeah but that's a level of urgency that I've developed by not having any options this entire time and uh I think that's what why the companies I'm involved in all have that every single company I'm either running or invested in has that level of culture because dude I demand it it's fucking is what it is I'm a hard motherfucker to play for you you don't if you don't want to work and you don't want to work hard you don't want to get better and you don't want to take everything serious I'm the wrong fucking person to work for because you'll be you'll you'll go insane yeah and um you know so I think with the pre-internet culture I think help we would I would say that the pre-internet culture helped you out a lot too right because though you didn't have anybody on the internet telling you that it was gonna be easy I didn't know anything exactly you didn't see anything right so I just thought this was the way it was yes it was just the way it is and so I think we have to have a more responsible message from real entrepreneurs on the internet to tell people you know how hard it really is because dude we have people on the internet who have built real things who then turn around and tell people that it's actually pretty easy you know and the reason they tell them it's pretty easy is because they want to be viewed uh ego-tistically as someone who has superior skills or has this godlike ability to just operate as an entrepreneur and bruh I'm telling you those people don't exist they might say they they might say that because they're insecure and they want their ego pattern they want to be looked at like their geniuses but I'm telling you those motherfuckers paid the price just like everybody else they just don't want to tell you so you know we have to we have to find a good middle ground as entrepreneurs uh and people who are driven about understanding the reality of what it takes to build things but also remaining ignorant enough to where we don't demoralize ourselves with the amount of of uh hardship we know we're gonna come across yeah and the truth of the matter is is this is why a program like live hard and 75 hard are so important and why like my new book the book of mental toughness is such a quality tool for people to own because uh it it it realigns your mindset and prepares you to be a person who can endure this journey that's the thing okay like people are looking for the hack or the shorter way or the way around or the way to make it easy and none of that shit really exists but what does exist is your ability to harden your mindset and become a person who has the skills of discipline grit fortitude uh and perseverance and then confidence and self-esteem all these things that come with this type of program um that builds you into the person who has the capacity to handle the path you've chosen and that's where people should be spending their time if you build the weapon the war is easier right but if you go into the war without your weapon bill you're gonna get your fucking ass beat and eventually you'll learn some of it but the reality is most of those people end up getting killed they don't make it so we have to understand the game we're actually playing and we have to understand that it's always gonna be hard it's never gonna get easier but you will get better and it will be perceived as easier the better that you get and that's the value of building yourself first you see what i'm saying so we have to we have to look at these things the proper way and uh when we really think about what live hard builds in you is what it does is it builds the ability to execute regardless of the circumstances and if you can execute on a plan that you set out for yourself regardless of what happens you cannot be stopped there's nothing that can stop you if you can execute when when everything else is falling apart when it's harder than ever like this year is probably gonna be one of the hardest years for people if you could continue to execute while everybody else is panicking and freaking the fuck out you're you can't be stopped you'll continue to progress even if it's just a little bit while everybody else goes backwards and sometimes it's like that sometimes not going backwards as much as everybody else is the victory still a win yes and so we have to understand that that's the value in what we're doing and and i think what's cool is a lot of people are waking up to this they're starting to understand this is not about me looking good at the pool this is not about me having some muscles this is about me having a bulletproof mindset that allows me to execute on anything I decide to execute on at any time in my life regardless of what's going on and if i could do that then what the fuck can stop me from being coming what it is i want to become and the answer is nothing so i think it's important to like when you talk about how hard this journey is going to be right like just everybody's on the same page we're not talking about you know a small little mom and pop shop that you know i'm doing pretty decent ever we're talking about true greatness we're talking about high level fucking winning right i think i think it applies to both like bro even when you're running on one store operation the pain and and frustration is relative to what you know like there's a lot of people like when i was running just a one store operation or two store operation uh it was not it was it was incredibly difficult it was incredibly stressful you know uh you're you're running on you're you're running on hundreds of dollars not tens of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars a buffer you know like you're always within the the realm of going broke and um it's a it's a scary thing but here's the here's the other thing that people got to realize is that this fallacy of quick and easy is actually detrimental to your ability to really compete at a high level okay nobody talks about this but this is true all right all the skills that you're going to learn are going to come from the time when it's the hardest like if you're trying to buy a program or skip the journey or hack your way around the hard shit you're actually doing something that is going to handicap you long term because that's where all the lessons are learned and if you want to be competitive at a high level at a great level you can't hack your way around the the time when you learned all the lessons most of the lessons i learned were in the first 10 years of my business all right i was broke as fucking it was harder than shit but now i can compete at a much higher level with other people who also have those skills because that's where those skills were formed so if we were to jump from zero to ten million dollars take home in a year like most people think they want to do you can't keep that ten million dollars because you lack the skills that you would have developed to gain it you understand what i'm saying so like dude by wanting this quick easy fast position in life you're actually eliminating your ability to compete at a higher level because when you get to a higher level everybody's good and everybody's skilled and everybody knows all the shit that you would have missed so the idea of overnight success and quick success isn't even a real idea because it's temporary it's a temporary success all right you have to go through this hard journey you have to go through these hard times in order to get to a place where you could compete at the higher levels because the hard times is where the skills that you use to compete are formed so this is something that you can't know on day one right you can't practical application yeah you could only know this once you've been through it and so i'm speaking to all of you guys who are just starting or you're four or five years and you're not as far as where you want to beat mother fuck i'm a 58,380 from my first ten years in business not a year total i could have made more money working at fucking McDonald's okay so remember that you're probably doing better than i was doing so just keep that in mind you're alert right now you're in boot camp you're not even in business yet you're in boot camp you're in the boot camp where you're gonna get beat on every day and you're gonna pick up and learn how to do shit that you didn't know how to do before and eventually over the course of time you become like a Swiss army knife where you know a whole bunch of stuff and you have a lot of utility and you can do a lot of things and you know a lot of things and now you're starting to become an effective entrepreneur and you stop making stupid decisions you know and this is why i tell you guys the only truth the only two skills you actually need to have to win long term are one the ability to not quit okay perseverance grit fortitude okay discipline all these things that we talk about consistently and two the ability to be intelligent enough to not make the same mistake twice like if you could touch the stove one time and never touch it again that's all you need you don't need to be any smarter than that shit that's high yeah and if you touch it real quick if you touch it twice maybe you're gonna touch it twice yeah okay but if you touch it three times or four times you can't win can't do it long term you can't win making the same mistakes over and over again but if you have the ability to start on a path not quit no matter what and also learn every single time you touch that stove learn and what the lesson is you can win and i believe that i love it man guys Andy our third and final question question number three eighty hey Andy i'm currently building a business through the network marketing space uh one of my biggest challenges is sharing my business with higher ticket customers my bitch voice keeps saying quote those people are well off doing what they do um they don't need someone who makes less than them to give them a way to make more money why should they believe you so my question is what should my attitude be when talking to people more successful than myself about what i have to offer uh you should take as many reps as possible because you're gonna hear every objection in the book and most of them are probably true and eventually you're gonna come up if you're decent enough with some shit to say that actually works around that objection or you're going to learn from these people who are further down the path than you on how to help people just like them so this is a big mistake a lot of sales people make they don't like to sell like they do this in multiple ways like in this case they're talking about selling people who are more successful than them or have more resources than or more knowledgeable than them that's one way the sales people short circuit their ability to actually become effective in this case you should listen you should learn you should take as many of that's even if you get told to fuck off a million times because every single time you're gonna learn something new okay and eventually you're gonna put it together but there's also the other salesperson there's the other salesperson that will look at someone on the other end of the spectrum who's not making as much money as them who's not as successful as them and this happens a lot in retail okay people will see someone walk in and retail who fucking dresses like you know my dad okay who dresses like where's a Harley Davidson shirt and some fucking Jean shorts new balance yeah and some new balances and things they don't have any resources to spend on whatever it is so instead of actually showing them that going through the process and showing them the right products they'll try to curtail the product offering to what the employee or the salesperson thinks that that person can afford and when ends up happening is not only do you miss out on on sales but that person will eventually go somewhere else where they treat them like a normal human and bro I could tell you a million times where I've been in a retail setting and someone's walked in and they've looked like they don't have shit right they've pulled up in a shitty car they've pulled up in a it looking like you know like they came out of fucking goodwill okay and uh they pull out a fucking they put a stack of product on the on the counter $900 and fucking whip out cash and give it to you right that you can't judge people based upon what your perception is of their financial situation because the internet's a liar not everybody who's wealthy dresses like you know they were in a three-piece suit you know what I'm saying like that yeah I mean fuck bro I'm wearing a free clothes yeah right like I'm wearing a free clothes like I'm wearing free shorts that I got from here I mean they're not free to you to free to me right right right right and you know this is the first form of sweatshirt I word you know dude people with means tend to like not give a fuck so you can't judge them on like what they appear to be or you fuck yourself out of a lot of potential sales so you can error both sides of that equation and what this comes down to is the psychology of being a salesperson and that's this your job is to offer the best possible solutions to this to this potential customer regardless of the price they are there to solve a problem your job is to solve the problem in the best possible way and if they have objections they will let you know and you will find a solution that fits their budget that also still solves their problem but you start off as a default of showing the customer the best possible way to solve their problems and then if it's not in their budget they will let you know and then you start to make compromises to figure out how to solve their problem within their budget and you work you go from top and work backwards you don't start at the bottom and work upwards and that's a big mistake that a lot of sales people make and that's why I like when they call it upselling there should be no upselling because you should automatically show them the best solution from the start and then work yourself back into a situation where it fits their budget if required and that's what successful sales people do they do it with people who look like a billion dollars who pull up in a rose voice in three piece suit and here's a hint most people that drive rose voices dress like me they get the fuck out the car dress like me so the the whole fallacy of the internet is a little bit bullshit or a lot bullshit and you got to do that for the person who drives up an old pickup truck you know who looks like they you know couldn't afford anything you can't judge people off base of what they look or or based upon what you can afford that's another thing sales people do the fuck up they they they when they present like a lot of people can't sell because what they're selling is expensive to them there's no confidence in their action no they cannot sell because they can't afford the product themselves okay and so we have to stop selling based upon perception and start understanding what selling actually is which is helping solve a problem okay and if you're helping solve a problem then you should start with helping to solve the problem in the best absolute best possible way and then if it's not in the customer's budget you work back to a position of where it is by making small compromises and that's why you have good better and best product offerings and you have product offerings that are different price points but successful killer sales people they don't worry about how old they are they don't worry about how much money this guy has or how much money that guy has or if I think it's expensive or any of that shit they want a hundred percent focus on this I am here to solve this problem in the best possible way I'm going to show them how to solve this in the best possible way and then we're going to work from there and here's another reason why this is important because if you don't start with solving the problem in the best possible way and you start at the low okay and you like you like because you think this person can't afford the best possible solution so you start with the low there is a high likelihood that that person will either go online or go to a competitor where the competitor will then show them the better option to solve their problem and they will and and and because you judge them on some perception that you had they will actually perceive the competitor as more knowledgeable than you because the the competitor will show them how to solve the problem better than you when in reality the reason you didn't do that was because you judge them on what you thought they could afford so now we're in a situation of what is the word of mouth being said about you or your company or your business because you are selling people a lesser option based upon what you perceive they can afford and people are out there saying yeah don't go talk to that guy because you don't know what the fuck he's talking about right so there's all kinds of reasons to do this the way that I'm saying and quite honestly this is why you join our taste syndicate like the things I'm going through right here this is why you join that program so our taste syndicate dot com by my book today but I love it man yeah well guys Andy that was three yeah happy new year guys go kick some ass it's more important than ever that you do and I'll be right there with you let's fucking go yeah
