dumbass of the day today all right the entire the entire navy entire navy you bunch of dumb fucks yeah why are you got I like the navy dude you're in the navy aren't you no air force oh it's smarter than that I like the navy they got cool boats they got the Navy seals I don't like boats you know how I am a ship and ship though that's why I couldn't I got a bunch of friends are in there bro they land they land air aircraft on a fucking little bitty point boat that'd be pretty cool I mean it's dangerous I don't know they land other planes on little boats to the navy what oh they land planes in the tunnel put them ships right through the canals yeah that's right yeah you know I'm saying yeah man it is what it is but they they get the dumbass of the day so it's those cute outfits they were I don't get you on that with the JP's gonna call you up now but dude everybody the navy's like fuck really yeah we're just teasing guys get a sense of humor yeah that's what I'll just laugh it's okay to be gay yeah what it is now man but but we got to talk about it man so you know this navy commander he got relieved of duty and this was like a back and forth that happened because of this picture right here that has an image of the commander holding the rifle got shells flying problem is that I mean I mean I mean they probably does say a gun not a gun nut but somebody who savvy you know I'm saying come she's got to go to basic training of shit for navy like learn about weapons and shit it's all there I mean he's not even holding it right I mean he's a semen you know I'm saying yeah but the scope is clearly backwards now remember when this first came out I think the immediate defense was that it was AI generated and this was not a real picture and you know it was Photoshopped or some shit but it was real and they fired him for it now with the the state of our country okay they fired this guy and that's fine now for the morale of all the other semen on the crew you know I'm saying the image of the America if you had the the responsibility of replacing this man with someone else who would you probably put into that position don't even tell me who would you put into the position Andy Steven Segal a strong yeah you know I'm saying like you know it needs a needs a good image of someone what was that movie with Steven Segal um periscope down that's under siege yeah have you seen periscope down that that's a that's a damn good man who was on cloud van damn I don't know but Erica Laney acquies in there she jumped out of the cake that's my favorite part when I was like ten timey Lee Jones huh timey Lee Jones yeah that's right right timey Lee Jones little Andy just keeps wants to watch under siege now man we had VHS brought pause that bitch it had fucking lines across the ship but you could always see the boobies in there it was awesome well the known lie like you more fuckers didn't do that and you young dudes you just got free access we had to like fucking yeah to work forward and shit yeah had to rewind the VHS my hand you did I did that but they replaced this guy replaced this commander um and I want to read you this headline from this article bigots are raging because an LGBTQ plus woman has replaced a fired us navy warship commander I'm I'm doubting it's an actual woman well that's to been to to be discovered um to come out of the closet uh but the article reads bigots are yet again collectively losing their marbles because a queer woman has replaced a fired us navy warship commander who was dismissed for holding a rifle with a scope mounted backwards um this is captain Allison Christie that's a fucking dude now now now Andy they're talking about us in the headline we're the bigots yeah well so listen there has not been a 100% guaranteed okay or like you know without a doubt that this is a dude we don't know that I don't know that um yeah look at the picture oh I feel like the hairs attached to that come on man well so captain Christie she's from Seattle she graduated from the United States naval academy in 2000 with a bachelor of science and political science um now apparently she is a she and she's not a man how do you know it again this is all allegations but apparently she's just a lesbian okay well all right again I apologize but here's the I'm so sick of this shit man I'm sick of it that I guarantee that's not the best motherfucker for the job to run the fucking missile ship that's my point okay it's a fucking missile ship like a destroyer whatever with fucking nuclear fucking time of hawks and shit on it and we're putting someone in the position because of their fucking sexual orientation who they like to have sex with we are putting the hands of a multi-billion dollar fucking boat the safety of thousands of people because it's not just their boat it's the boats around them and the hands of someone because they like to taste vagina on their mouth that is the only reason why explain to me how that makes sense bro it doesn't it doesn't that's the problem and like not to mention you know this not like this ship is just you know chilling this is the ship that is going to be in Iran in Iran's waters if shit hits the fucking fan and that's what we have as leadership now not since she is the highest scoring fucking ship captain of all time and the next available best and knows how to do all the shit perfectly when no I have no problem with it but I highly doubt that's the case considering what's been going on for the last number of years this is fucking insane and it's designed intentionally to make us look incompetent and weak nobody celebrating this dude we're over it we are over this shit Americans are over this shit we are over people getting opportunities and being placed in responsible situations where other people's lives are at stake because of who they like to have sex with or what color their skin is or fucking anything other than they are the best for the job I'm so sick of it dude just saying that I think they missed a prime opportunity to put like real leaders have been there well I mean we don't know for sure I mean maybe she is the best but I seriously doubted considering what's been going on and this motherfucker shouldn't be doing it either so let's just we'll go on him too what the fuck bro you know he played Call of Duty like you don't you don't fuck you didn't look down the scope and figure out that it's fucking dark on the other end you got the fucking lens cap on okay you didn't you you're holding the rifle wrong like a redneck from Missouri that's four years old knows how to do that better than that guy so he doesn't deserve to be in charge of the ship either I agree agree so this is not I'm you know just we need a best yeah that's it I did like I tried to find the picture again I did like though the United States Marines they they kind of did like a push at the Navy because they posted they so this this picture was posted with a caption of like clearly clearly cited in or some shit like that so the Marines actually reposted it with their with their images of some bad ass fucking warriors with the scopes bro he's got that thing on his shoulder like it's a mother fucking rocket launcher you know like if you hand an AR to a person a woman who's never shot a gun ever in a life that's what they will do that's how she's gonna hold it well I mean isn't that what my lion no you've trained people is not what they do they put the fucking mother fucker up here on the shoulder like that's a grown man in charge of a fucking billion dollar ship unbelievable dude not confident and then a good look don't matter so the day goes to the United States Navy yeah it does bro sorry and all you fucking Siemens you should be pissed off about this hey it put in your life at risk I mean listen putting a lot at risk putting a lot of risk he's how do you know she can't do a better job I don't know maybe she can but I seriously fucking doubt it considering what's been going on in the world there's not a good there's not a good dude imagine if we were looking at I mean let's just break this down D.I. is the dumbest thing ever in the history of earth it wasn't even an American idea it was an idea that is put on us by the communists of the world okay the reason that D.I. was put into place was not to fucking create equal opportunity it was to demoralize the country and make it weaker because if we're putting the worst players on the field because of who they are or where they come from or who they like to have sex with we are going to lose everybody else in the world understands that reality China understands that Russia understands that everybody in the Middle East understands that every single fucking human everywhere else understands that we understand that here but people are so scared to speak up that they won't even say anything about it and like I said last show they already know what you think because they listen to everything you say they already know what you think because they have all your emails all your texts all your jokes all your memes everything you've ever sent they have it so they already know so what the fuck are you afraid of speak the fuck up this idea that anything other than the best should be positioned in positions of responsibility is literally insane and weakens our country and we have had so much so much time in this country where there's been no real conflict there's there's nothing to truly be afraid of most other countries have to like consider the fact that other countries could take them over here people have no concept of that they don't believe that another country could come in bro we're already invaded we got Venice waylands all over we got fucking third world criminals all over and you guys keep giving people the benefit of the doubt for this fucking shit we are not in a position to say oh yeah we you know because we feel bad for so and so and they didn't get a chance to get so many at bats in the game we're going to put little Johnny in there little Suzy so they can go up there and strike out and feel good you're putting the rest of us at risk and the people at the top the world economic forum the fucking sources of the world these people they understand that are done mother fuckers that have these bleeding hearts for opportunity who can't understand that equal opportunity is the way it's supposed to be not equity we're not supposed to all get the job we're supposed to have a fair chance at the job all right and we have shifted so far because of the comfort in this country to where this stuff doesn't even nobody blinks at this they don't even think about it you know what I mean it's literally insane dude well the truth is in like equal opportunity already exists it's already here it's yeah it's here you know the problem is is that they want the equal outcome that's right and that's not how it works yeah just now how it fucking works man guys jumping on this conversation now let us know down in the comments what you guys think tell them navy boys we said hey how would you feel about getting a job just because you were a certain thing well I mean that's the problem right like the people who are getting the jobs are perfectly fine with it they they imagine a person who I mean do they over yeah but do they believe they're the best I don't think okay because how do they paint it they painted it's it's fucking history being made the first trans this the first black this the first they're painting that is something heroic right like they're making fucking history I feel I feel worse for the fucking people they get passed over in those positions we're we're making history all right we're the only country in the history of the world that's ever existed that has allowed voluntarily weakness to creep in and third world enemies to invade our country with open arms and give them hugs and say while they want to fucking kill you and take your shit people are not they are not prepared for what's about to happen here and I called it a long time ago they're not prepared bro no and like all these all these uh you know we see that the the black guys down in the hood Chicago being like hey Venezuela's bro you motherfuckers ain't prepared either you're not these people live in third world conditions they fucking fight for their lives their whole fucking life this isn't you know you're in a gang beef with fucking dude down the street this these people know what the fuck they're doing they don't shoot like this motherfucker no no that when lights get cut off they know how to survive that they thrive in those conditions we aren't we as we as a country are not ready for what's already happened here and and and we continue to weaken it and demoralize it by doing things like this it's disgusting yeah well guys uh let's get to the cruise remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to andyfacela.com you guys can find all of that stuff linked there that being said let's jump into headline number one headline number one reads students more in classmates and teachers after Georgia school shooter Colt braze rampage so let's dive into this a little bit obviously this is some a national um an event that has happened um down in in in winter Georgia so let's dive in a little bit about this uh what has been uh known as of the time of this recording um so the mass shooter who killed two students and two teachers at apple latchy high school in winter Georgia on Wednesday morning has been named as colt gray nine victims were taken to hospital uh with gunshot wounds according to the Georgia bureau of investigation the shooting was reported at 1023 am and gray surrendered to police when he was apprehended gray is a 14 year old student who attended apple latchy high school authorities confirm um despite the fact gray is being charged as an adult the authorities in Georgia have not released a muck shot however a picture of gray has surfaced um thanks to the speed of the internet uh this is uh 14 year old colt gray now there's been some interesting developments with this story that has come out um police find evidence that teen gumman was obsessed with mass shootings um investigators found evidence that colt gray 14 was interested in mass shootings during a search of his room on Wednesday the new york times reported gray appeared to be particularly obsessed with the 2018 massacre at marjorie stoneman Douglas high school in parkland florida with uh which left 17 uh people dead um they also found that uh his uh colt gray had a discord account um that was linked to him uh also obsessed with sandy hook officers with the Jackson County Sheriff question Colt gray 14 and his father um calling gray after receiving a tip about his discord account from the FBI um we do know that there was an ar style weapon uh which was used in the shooting um at apple latchy high school that was recovered from some video footage from students leaving out of the building um there's a picture of it on the ground um now an interesting development his pay uh some family of colt gray has has been making some statements online on facebook specifically uh this headline reads apple latchy high school shooting suspect colt gray's furious family issues chilling threat after the 14 year old is charged as an adult uh the family of Georgia school shooter colt gray threatened to go quote full throttle after the 14 year old was charged as an adult for murder murdering four people on Wednesday gray's relatives leapt to his defense with an hours of him opening fire at apple latchy high school where he allegedly killed four people and injured nine others the teenagers aren't any paul hummus brown took the facebook during the aftermath bringing up the issues he quote dealt with and saying she will take care of my nephew and what he needs on this side um this is some of the posts now at the time of the recording i went to try to verify these in facebook has completely removed her account um which is interesting not able to find anything on her but these are allegedly um her post as she put out this one saying quote hey a charging my 14 year old nephew as an adult for murder y'all ready to see paul hummus blood and full throttle nah i wouldn't be either um whatever that means and she post this one also saying uh please someone get me in touch with the gbi i've tried calling i am not scared i will not back down i will not disrespect other parents and families that are dealing with this tragedy on the opposite end they did not deserve this i will not do anything but humbly support the families involved in this incident that and i'd ask to be participants with that said i will not leave my nephew standing alone when you've all dehappened i told my own children that only hurt people hurt people but did everything i could to fight for my nephew and my niece and my nephew and my other nephew y'all can go ahead and play the blame game all you want but the families affected by my nephew's actions deserve all the attention now i will take care of my nephew and what he needs on his side just check yourself before you speak about a child that never acts a deal with the bull shit he saw on a daily basis um to which another family member uh jenny blackwell paul hummus uh said one thousand percent he never asked for what he's been through i'm with you one what is that that's more than one thousand shit that one billion percent um p-prayers for everyone affected now with all of this going on there is one thing uh that that i am constantly seeing the common denominators that we constantly see with all of these shootings not just the weapon used they're always an ar style weapon um but the fact that a particular three letter agency is always somehow involved the fbi was alerted to cult gray over a year ago over a year ago shocking the fbi was made aware of the suspected apple at your high school shooter in 2023 during the course of investigating the source of online threats fox 10 phoenix reported that quote the fbi in a joint statement with the Jackson County Sheriff's office revealed gray was online forcements radar more than a year before Wednesday's school shooting um in the elanta journal constitution noted quote in may of 2023 the fbi's national threat operation center received several anonymous tips about online threats to commit a school shooting the tips led to then 13 year old cult gray who was interviewed by law enforcement and who did not making the threats grace father was interviewed as well uh and quote the father stated he had hunting guns in the house but the subject did not have unsupervised access to them gray was monitored after being interviewed but quote there was no probable calls for arrest or to take any additional law enforcement action on the local state or federal levels according to the fbi i am sick of seeing the fbi knowing about these people they knew about the evolved shooter they knew about um the Nashville shooter they knew about the buffalo shooter like they always knew about the Denver shooter they always knew about them yeah months in advance yeah but they're you know but let's raid you know grandma's house because she's a domestic terrorist for sure you know I'm saying to me yeah that makes sense to me man Andy what do you got on this uh well a lot first of all uh you can tell by this kids parents and aunts response uh or whatever they are that these are one of those parents that make excuses for their kids no matter what the fuck they do they don't hold them to any account or any standard they say oh well you know they can live their lives as their lives and you know these are the same kind of parents to say that shit about kids that are trying to transition when they're fucking 12 years old and you know who am I you're their fucking parent asshole okay like you're not their friend you're not this isn't hey let them do whatever they decide to do or what they want to do let's make excuses for them your kid just murdered four fucking people and you're on the internet defending them he didn't he didn't ask to go through what he been through fucking cares no it cares like dude I'm so sick of hearing these excuses for people to do fucked up shit oh he had trauma in the fucking who cares there's lots of motherfuckers I had trauma they can go shoot up the fucking school right okay there's all kinds of people that had a way worse than him that turned around and became upstanding positive contributing members of society that's a fact all right so I don't want to hear this shit anymore about these criminals who have trauma or their parents or fucking disadvantages I don't fucking care I don't care and you shouldn't either this this excuse making in victimhood for these people to do this terrible things that affect other people needs to stop okay criminals deserve criminal treatment people who hurt people deserve to be hurt back if we start hurting people back who do shit like this in a public forum this kind of shit will stop so that's what I have to say about that secondly this is a very easy solution to this problem we have 100,000 fucking ex-military veterans across the country why not create a position in every school where every fucking doorway that comes in from the outside is armed with someone who knows what they're doing okay why do instead of we send 75 billion dollars to Ukraine every two weeks or whatever the fuck it is why don't we take up money and create jobs and employ these people there's only one simple answer to that and it's that they don't want to solve the problem because the political ramifications for the problem existing are greater and more valuable to them than solving the problem every time they have one of these they immediately turn to the same shit band guns band guns band guns why do they want to band guns so bad they don't want to band guns because the school shootings otherwise they would just solve the school shootings with the way that I said easy fix the reason they want to band guns is the same reason that every government in the history of the world has ever disarmed their population and what happens when those populations get this arm usually some sort of mass murder or genocide or complete and total tyranny happens every single time okay and these Americans these idealistic Americans who are super fucking dumb think that this is about hunting or this is about wrote if you really understood what the second amendment was about we should have fully automatic we should have the ability to buy rocket launchers we should have the ability to have tanks and all the shit everything the the military has the population is meant to have to balance it out and people say well they didn't know that AR 15s were going to exist in 1776 yeah no shit they also didn't know Apache helicopters they didn't know drones they didn't know fucking tanks they didn't know rocket launchers okay but if they had they would have said people have a right to own those things to balance out the power that the government holds over them this is not about deer and kevlar vests this is not about hunting this is not about the crazy cousin who's a prepper for the end the last days this is about balancing the power and because the average American doesn't understand this concept these people get on TV and they lie about this shit trying to make it seem like we'll have this utopia of safety bro is it not illegal to shoot people no it's illegal to fucking for a 14 year old to have a AR 15 that's legal to have guns on fucking school property that's legal those are all illegal things they're already illegal the definition of a fucking criminal is that they break the mother fucking law okay so making a law that says you can't have guns is not going to fucking reduce any guns it's gonna make it so only the fucking bad people have guns okay I'm tired of this argument and the fact that this is happening and not being solved by the way that I've said it could be solved where it actually solves two problems at once it stops the shootings and it employs people that need jobs the fact that our government is not solving that or creating that the only logical answer in return is that they want it because it's an easy problem to solve and everybody fucking knows it so just understand this that the people that run this country are totally okay with your kids being shot if it happens to be your kids so that they can advance a political gender of tyranny that is the facts that's it man because you guys got to understand the government is not gonna just come in and like I give us your guns for no reason right they have there has to be some type of justification for that and so what does I think a common denominator that we all kind of share just as good just harder to Americans is that you know hey we protect kids and so the moment kids started in the tech that's gonna that might balance the skills of the justification they need to hey let's get our guns but the irony in that though bro that I have a problem with is that you know the left is these progressives they they only care about the kids when it's convened for them they're okay with the boarding them they're okay with masking them they're okay with over really vaccinating them they're okay okay with mutilating them they're okay with doing a bunch of other shit to them and it's when it's convenient for them and so that's how you got to see through the bullshit man we can't never give up our guns do do it not only that who wants to ban the guns what what party them cut okay it's the progressive Democrats that want to ban guns the most now during covid who was saying you don't deserve to be in society what are we gonna do with all these people that won't take the vaccine you're a fucking grandma killer you deserve to be in jail you you deserve to be in a camp who was saying that Democrats okay now those are the same people that want to take the guns so what the fuck do you think they're gonna do once the guns are gone they're doing that so they can have power over the people they hate and eliminate them just like every other communist fucking revolution's happening in the history of earth they disarm the population then they kill the resistance so there is zero fucking chance no matter how many tweets these fucking idiots make that anyone should give up their guns for any fucking reason ever just on july 4th actually should buy more guns just on july 4th is just another quick example july 4th 109 people were killed Chicago nine of which were kids you didn't hear no conversation you hear one fucking peep none none on a weekend on a week and one day nine kids well you know why what was the conversation on that well because it doesn't serve them doesn't don't fit the narratives not only that they like black on black crime yeah you know why because they get to go into the fucking black on the black communities every fucking two and four years and say hey guys I know it's really bad we'll fix it they want disorder they want black people in poverty they want black people killing themselves don't make any fucking mistake about it if you vote Democrat and you're black you're voting for people that want you to fucking suffer that's it man let's say guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments let us know and with that being said let's let's go crew some of these comments this first comment comes from at 436 booey and hey what is your favorite pre-workout flavor this is not an ad just want to know big time watcher of the show and I love it I am a cop and love your pre-workout to give myself the tools to arrest black I mean other criminals what's your favorite pre-workout it's a concoction yeah it's a suicide mix you have a concoction so here at first form headquarters in coction do you want me to say it is that we keep saying what concoction yeah I like coction is that what you want me to say every morning I do a first big drink of coction to make you happy all right so we call my pre-workout there you go there you go so anyway here at first form for the adults we have three supplements for everybody okay and they're out on this bar and after you're done working out a before you work out everybody gets to go use them so you know if you work here you got perks that's one of them so we go through a lot of product every day and so every day that what's out there is different flavors and so I don't know what flavor I like because I don't look at it I literally don't look at the flavor at all so but I have found out that if you mix any flavor of megawatt alcanatein and alpha surge it doesn't matter what flavor of each they all taste great so I do a suicide combination that's where you used to call it back in the day do you know that suicide like a suicide slurpy where you put like all the flavors in it no or you never did a suicide soda where you put all the sodas in it sounds no okay well that's what we called it and so I just do that every day and I put one scoop of megawatt one scoop of alcanatein one scoop of alphysurge and five grams of creatine you go to work and then that's what I do and it is fucking it is fucking awesome you will be pumped out of your mother fucking gold you will be concocted yeah there you go yeah you will have a hard concoction yeah where you yeah there you go booey yeah all right that's the that's the deal bro I'm telling you that's the secret bling yes all right our next guy do I do a hydration stick first thing in the morning though to get my salt and electrolytes in there like a a pre yeah so and then I do pre workout like two three hours later yeah so that's the pre before the concoction all right I like it it's a hard concoction our next comment comes from the American Mexican 1776 he says even a 10% tax is probably too high to give a government with no accountability as to what they are actually doing with our money but with that being said getting to a point where when you buy something you don't have to continue paying taxes on it or you lose it to this corrupt government would be a good start totally agree totally agree I have nothing to add that's a great point and I'm happy that our people are so perceptive that they understand that we have to go and step start right like I get this argument from some close friends they're like fucking Donald Trump's not gonna fix shit either okay well do you want to be full communist or do you want to move the right way because neither one of these mother fuckers gonna fix everything for us we we got to move the right way and then in 2028 we got to move a little bit more in the right way and hopefully we can a cup over a couple terms we can move the country in the right spot to where we get to a point where it's actually what it's supposed to be you know and what it has supposed to be so I appreciate that because sometimes people think that I believe that Donald Trump is like somehow gonna fix everything I don't believe that you know I believe Donald Trump is very intelligent I think he's the best option that we have right now and you guys who say he's not intelligent you're fucking idiot the guy you oh you got a million dollars from his dad bro you couldn't take a million dollars to turn into seven billion you fucking couldn't do it you can't even take can you take a hundred dollars to turn into seven thousand fucking you can't right okay so you don't have the skills to do it the guy's intelligent he's 78 years old he's had a whole life of experience to say that he's stupid because you don't like the way he talks just proves that you're stupid all right I think the guy's fucking hilarious by the way but the point is is Donald Trump's grown up in America that was one way the entire time and I don't know that Donald Trump sees where it needs to go past that so when he says make America great again I think he's trying to take it to the point where we were at the best economically you know socially culturally dominant society but I think there's beyond that that we can get I think we can be better than that and I don't know that you know I think right now he's thinking fuck we're all the way over here we got to get at least back to here and then you know past that it's up to everybody else to carry the torch to something that is ultimately the best version of what this country supposed to be so but yeah this is a great comment and I agree 100% my guys we appreciate you for being real ass fans thank you for liking and commenting make sure you guys hit the bell notification on the youtube to stay up to date with the latest episodes from relay effort that being said let's keep this cruise moving headline number two now this is an interesting headline headline headline reads commanders suspend VP for comments on

O'Keefe media group media group that's James O'Keefe who has been doing some awesome work yeah I mean awesome work but according to a social media video from the media group in teen had met the reporter on the dating app hinge is the hinge gay yes it is right well I don't know but clearly it was a man reporter it was a and they met on the dating app he's definitely gay he's concerned about anti gay he's concerned about racism but but yeah so he met there they met they had dinner twice at some local restaurants and according to James Keefe the CEO of the O'Keefe media group the interviews took place at a restaurant in Washington DC in June quote the language used in the video runs counter to our values at the commanders organization the team spokesperson said in the statement quote we have suspended the employee pending an investigation and will reserve further comment at this time now the clip itself that was uploaded is about a 10 minute 13 minute long clip I believe Tom but I got about two minutes over here let's check this out okay just so just walk me through again oh it's not gay you're just she's not gay it's a female reporter yeah I thought it was James O'Keefe I think he's gay though well I mean he went he's going he's out there with a girl gay people hang out with girls all the time rogue a's get more bitches than anything what that's true that's not fucking true that is not true Andy that is true that's not like every girl has a gay best friend true of us all right now girls I know they all fucking them no not to fuck them up they go do dinner and brunch and shit well that's fine that's my point yeah but they're on a dating at meet and gay dudes it's true whatever man maybe bisexual well look I'm just correcting my what I my assumption was okay here's the clip okay just so just walk me through again you're breakdown if you're just description of the total okay over 50% of our roster right is either white religious and god says fucking days meet ryle n team the vice president of content for the Washington commanders another big chunk is very low income african-american that comes from a community that is inherently very homophobic ryle n team goes on to say some of the NFL players are quote dumb as all hell would you say most people who work at the NFL with us gay subscribers on their boss would you say that they're just not very fine there's obviously a spectrum of what about like the plane there's some there's all the commanders VP of content ryle n team well come on that was creative editing he was gonna say dumb is all hell and there's some that are very smart you can tell they cut it off yeah no I've said that's something that is really I hate this creative editing that everybody's doing I fucking hate it like the gotcha karma yeah you do it doesn't matter if it's the right or the left I like it just discredits everything when I can tell they're doing that you know what I mean yeah like if you watch fucking CNN they do it if you watch Fox they do it if you watch fucking apparently James O'Keefe apparently he's doing it now and I like James O'Keefe but let's show the whole fucking message let's you know what I'm saying yeah like this is context yes who context is staying for NFL fans to our OMG American swiper stating they are quote high school educated alcoholics and mouth breathers most of the fans I would say are high school educated alcoholics they're like lower class people I hate to use that term I would just say mouth breathers I know it's way where is it you revealed that this job is to essentially operate quote state run media my job is to sell hope to the fans right I need them buying tickets when there's not much hope to sell I still got a dig deep to find it why do you think there's not much hope to sell right because we have like pipes leaking sewage on our fans in the middle of the game and I have to put out a social posting like it wasn't sewage water we promised that is state our OMG American swiper questioned vice president of content for the Washington commuters football team ryle entine and his knowledge and opinion of NFL commissioner Roger Videl calling him a $50 million dollar puppet what about Roger oh yeah he's a puppet a $50 million yeah so as of today the time of recording the commandos escalated their suspension into a full on firing good um of nteen um nteen also told undercover reporter that quote 50 over 50% of our roster is white religious and god says fuck the gays they're i don't think he says that no he doesn't i don't think he says i don't think he says that yeah they're interpretation um i don't buy any of that another big chunk is low income African Americans that come from a community that is inherently very homophobic now listen that that is true that is true that that is a very true statement what's what's the definition of homophobic people that that hate gays i don't think do you think that most black people hate gays they hate them no they don't and do they i like how you give that validation from the white guy but muck fuck a joe's blacker than you um but yeah so um but yeah he goes on to say even uh talking about uh well i'd be real dude like i'm just being honest like if the shit wasn't throwing in our face fucking 27 fucking hours out of 24 a day uh there would be less homophobia whatever the fuck you thinking it means 100% like i you know i i i think the term my point in asking the question was i think the term homophobic is totally fucking overblown right just because you don't want to fuck a gay guy doesn't make you homophobic right like just because you look at someone and you're like fuck that that fucking bitch is fat as fuck does not make you fat phobic you're observing a reality right like when you're out and like this is happening to me and fucking little gay dudes touch me and shit yeah wait wait wait i'm i asked grabbed whoa whoa yeah by fucking gay dude wait wait wait wait wait that's happened that's that's happened listen bro that's happening to me three or four times we were the gays fucking love me dude for real they fucking do and i've been fucking i've been touched by get like it dude listen listen bro you guys laugh all you want but their culture's different they can fucking touch they can rub they can do whatever they want on people and people don't like it and then when you don't like it you're homophobic that's the point i'm trying to make you know like i smack the dudes hand away but i brought fucking kill you oh where you fucking hate gay no i just don't i'm not gay it makes sense to be yeah i'm just fucking tired of it dude like stop shit dude you can't do that shit yeah hold on yeah we don't run around straight people and talk about how much pussy we like we don't fucking run around it like and we like groud you know what dude if your kids don't like pussy you're fucking straight afobic right you see i'm saying if i can't read about pussy to your kids you're a fucking big it like if you reverse the conversation it makes fucking no sense at all and like real talk dude most gay people i know don't do any of that shit it's just like every other fucking group in the world you got the group and then you got the outliers to do all the fucked up shit that make them all fucking look bad i got off for like a thousand bucks a fucking gay dude before bro i dude me and hosie were walking home from fucking with the bar that i used to work at their pushy bro this dude fucking pulls up we're walking across the fucking parking lot and this dude fucking pulls up in like a work truck dude i'm being dead serious listen i listen i'm serious i'm sorry quick fucking laughing i'm trying to tell a story so this fucking guy pulls up and he's like in fucking a work truck like he this guy looks like he's about to you know drink a fucking bush beer after being on the site and it's me and scat and he pulls up and we're like thinking he's gonna ask for directions and he goes hey how much for for me to suck y'all's dicks oh no yeah and he said that to us and i fucking looked at him like i was going to fucking crush him dude i'm like when i look over it's got scats like 20 bucks that's a true story except the last part dude dude the guy's supposed to saw our faces and thought he was gonna die because he fucking peeled out quick man it's got thought about it for a second though oh man that's hot he didn't really i'm just teasing i just always tell that same story especially when he's right there yeah man it's just interesting but that's not the only undercover i think the command is they did a great job um great job in firing this guy as they should i mean obviously this dude has an agenda right and that's a problem um but he's the bro i mean real talk man i mean let's be real uh it's always the same people saying all this shit saying that everybody's anti gay everybody's anti-Semitic everybody's racist everybody's this but you can't criticize that motherfucker all right can you say them by him yeah can't say anything about this guy yeah they're gonna get hit with an adl fucking bullshit the washer redskins or anti-Semitic blah blah blah blah blah no one cares fuck you stop pushing stupid shit on everybody you know but it's interesting though because you know mr. rail rio he's not the only person that's been on camera this is a very interesting clip that came out did you see this DOJ chief caught a meeting in undercover footage that Trump indictments are politically motivated so even people inside the own office of DOJ are it's now admitting that yeah it's complete fucking bullshit check this clip out real quick you know it's a pervert injustice you're stacking charges and rearranging things to make it a case of it why do you think it is it's like nonsense state lovelies are fucking wild black they're like idiots they don't care they're all black all um so yeah it's most probably gonna try to lock them up and there is gonna be it's gonna be all day long yeah and so that was Nikolas bias um who works for the DOJ now back in June i represented of Andy Biggs he made a timeline that was talking about this whole thing which we're gonna do a little bit more in the next headline um but about this um this entire thing with the case specifically um that he's talking about um which is what Nicholas was referring to was this timeline here um that started way back in 2022 okay way back in 2022 you had president Joe Biden made a controversial statement asserting quote we just have to demonstrate that he will not take power if he does run making sure that he under legitimate efforts of our constitution does not become the next president on November 7th of that same year uh Donald Trump hinted at a significant announcement he said i had a big announcement coming um then on November 15th that's in 2022 is when Trump announced his presidential candidate uh candidacy three days later Matthew co-angelo the third highest ranking official at the DOJ resigned from his position and then that uh that same day three days after Trump announced his presidency uh miss candidacy for president um attorney general maric garland appointed jack smith and uh that's when jack smith was appointed a special counsel to oversee the two separate investigations against Trump that same day Nathan Wade uh the figure uh from fulton county that's when he was assigned by fanny willis her lover um his lover um uh who spent eight hours with white house lawyers to go over all of this um and then you have on December 2nd Matthew co-angelo he made the decision to join alvin bragg's office um to help with the cases so this so so within a week's time after Donald trump announces that he's gonna run in 2024 the head of the DOJ resigns and goes to work for alvin bragg right you leave a federal position to go to a state level position that's correct then jack smith is appointed on the same day okay special counsel to oversee the separate events investigations against Donald trump and then on the same day Nathan Wade a figure uh associated with fulton county district attorney spanny willis prosecution of trump spent eight hours in meetings with the white house um at the white house okay so that's the cool thing so he's running so let's put our chess pieces where they're gonna go so we can prosecute him 100% on the same day New York I mean it was all set up um now bro that's treasonous shit these people should be hung for this really real I mean what it looks like to me is you have a commander in chief giving an order making a statement of what is going to happen and then the shit happening these people should be fucking hung for this now here's the interesting thing on this Nicholas bias guy who's all of them all of them yeah all of them but but look at this twist of bullshit um Nicholas bias uh so after that video has just been released as when viral um he makes a statement quote I was recently made aware of a video where I regretfully made some statements in a private and social setting that don't reflect my views about two local and state prosecutions I said these things in an effort to please and impress someone I just met who was secretly filming me I'm deeply sorry to the local and state law enforcement officials working on these matters who deserve more respect and I showed them I should have known better oh so he didn't mean he was just trying to get some pussy is what he's saying yeah I don't buy it uh no did you hear the way he was speaking he was 100% telling the truth what sounds more truthful what he said in that video or that statement he put out uh the video 1000% right 1000% yeah guys jump in on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said I bet you fucking hundred bucks bro the ADL fucking makes a case with the fucking redskins I I could see it coming guaranteed I see it coming you can't fucking say shit about anything dude fuck this shit dude I see it coming yeah it's only a matter of time and these motherfuckers all think they're fucking smarter than everybody too oh two fucking smart if you're so fucking smart and how you getting caught on video camera saying this dumb shit dumb ass guys any headline number three now you have that video from the DOJ right showing some truth there of what they all say and no um in private um but let's talk about it because there's an interesting push that's happening right now that that is now coming out um let's start in a revisit it's starting to sound a lot more like 2019 and 2020 and what we had to go through with that bullshit check this headline out from AP news a headline reading right wing influencers were duped to work for covert Russian influence operation United States says sure you work for Russia I work for Russia anybody that like all I'm saying is is where the fuck is our money bro I haven't gotten any good bro I haven't got any money from Russia I ain't got any money from our government I got no money from Trump I mean I'm here working for Trump for free my fucker and then all these motherfuckers getting these $100 million podcast deals with Spotify and fucking Amazon and shit you motherfuckers missing the boat dude yeah do more we're gonna be the biggest motherfuckin show in the history of the world for real because we're the only ones to tell the fucking truth we're the only ones we are the only show for the last four to half years five years that has legitimately said whatever needed to be said when it needed to be said all these other motherfuckers dance around it oh what do you think about this oh you really think that oh yeah no that's what it is so what's happening yeah so pay me bitches I think you need more free Mason signs I think that's what it is yeah maybe that's what it is I don't know but let's let's dive into this article man they have millions of followers online they have been major players in right wing political discourse since Donald Trump was president and they worked unknowingly for a company that was a front for a Russian influence operation US prosecutors say isn't this magical so an indictment filed Wednesday alleges a media company linked to six conservative influencers including well-known personalities 10 pool Dave Rubin Benny Johnson was secretly funded by Russian state media employees to turn out English language videos that work often consistent with the Kremlin's interest in amplifying US domestic divisions in order to weaken US opposition to Russian interest like its war in Ukraine in addition to marking the third straight presidential election in which US authorities have unveiled politically charged details about Russia's attempted interference in US politics and indictment indicates how Moscow may be attempting to capitalize on the skyrocketing popularity of right wing podcasters live streamers and other content creators who have found successful careers on social media in the years since Trump was in office now it's funny because you know the shit in 2016 didn't that come out to be a be false yeah the shit in 2020 that they try to run on the fucker I got bigger show on all these motherfuckers they ain't coming at me what what do they use over the rupils rupees rupils rupils I thought that was India whatever they got I want some of that come on Putin yeah bring it shit man we've been defending this motherfucker that's wrong matter fact just give me one of those cars you gave Kim Jong Un no shit like those are pretty sweet I take one of those yeah but now yeah so now they're going after podcasters now they're starting the the dig and starting to say that they are influencing elections because you know our government is definitely not influencing any elections right like you know the thousands of indictments that they put on their political opponent like that's not election interference right or the bill that's being passed make sure non-citizens don't vote in our elections at the democrats and our government is trying to stop like that's not election interference no shit right or the amazon voice shit that's going on right now did you see this yeah where Alexa will tell you why to vote for Kamala Harris but then say she can't talk about Donald Trump yeah check this clip out hey Alexa why should I vote for Donald Trump I cannot provide content that's the most political views hey Alexa why should I vote for Kamala Harris why vote for Kamala Harris because you believe in her policies and her vision for the country because you trust her experience and her leadership skills because you want to continue moving forward as a nation and make progress on issues that matter to you like health care education equality and justice hey Alexa why should I not vote for Donald Trump there are several reasons why we may not want to vote for Donald Trump some people are concerned about his policies such as his stance on immigration health care and the environment others are concerned about his behavior such as his comments about women and minorities and his treatment of opponents additionally some people are concerned about potential conflicts of interest due to his business empire hey Alexa why should I not vote for Kamala Harris I cannot provide content that insults and isn't it weird no it's not weird no it's it's fucking not now it's not weird at all it's not weird at all and by the way if you have an Alexa in your house you're a fucking idiot did I show out of there okay they fucking record everything you say like if you don't figure this out yet bro is Amazon a Russian company no that's an American oh oh okay anyway so Lindsey Graham he's gonna grill Amazon apparently send this letter out but again like that's not an election interference what about this ABC debate that's supposed to be coming up which now all of a sudden there's supposed to be this blackout with direct TV over some bullshit where more than 11 million people will not be able to watch the election through ABC that's an election interference at all right now what does Putin say all of this you see he just came out and endorsed Kamala yeah of course he did because he knows that she'll destroy the country she trolled the shadow ready I believe he actually wants Trump no he does because he wants world order to be restored I don't think he's anything what these motherfuckers say he is like everything they say at this point in time I believe that is the opposite is true yeah no one's been saying no he definitely trolled Kamala let's let's check the clip up we have the current president mr Biden is our favorite if I can recall if he can say that but now he has been taken out of the race but he recommended that all his allies support Mrs Harris that's what we're going to do we're going to support her that's first of all this is the first one and secondly she has such an expressive and the actions and she's doing well bro did you see the people in a crowd laughing like dude they're all laughing at us bro like dude they're laughing at us we have allowed these disgusting progressive do nothing contribute nothing be nothing create nothing drags on society to direct our country into this position of complete and total incompetence and weakness and that that's not them doing it that's us allowing them to do it okay and us allowing them to do it looks like you looking the other way every time one of these people does something or says something you not speaking up for your kids being indoctrinated in schools you not speaking up because you're afraid of what so and so is going to say you holding in and believing the silent majority is some sort of noble cause you believing that political correctness is polite you believing that everybody deserves a chance so we're going to put people in places of power based upon their gender or their orientation or their skin color you are the reason this is happening because you won't speak to fuck up and stop this from happening that is the bottom these people are not strong enough to do what they want to do they are not the stronger side this is a small group that's less than fucking 10% of the democrat voters that is so far left that they have intimidated and bullied and use the tech platforms like amazon and meta and fucking all the other ones to crap up that narrative and make everybody else intimidated by cyber bullying that's what these fucking people do if you voice your opinion you get traffic throttle or you get a thousand bot comments calling you a piece of shit or this or that or this bro i'm tired of this shit and you should be too and if we're going to fucking have this country passed november or january you better start working now you better start getting engaged now time is running out the the opportunity here is running out and if you don't get every mother fucker that you know on the same page is you and your little community to go vote you broke you're not you're not even a fucking you're not even a real citizen of this country in my opinion you know we have civic obligations and one of them is making sure that our country isn't taken over by a bunch of fat mentally ill dump trucks come in guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think we do have a little really exclusive here really we just got the mug shot from the from cold gray oh really yeah you want to see it sure okay so now this is what they immediately portray it right your book photo from from when he's right this is the mug shot uh cold gray yeah got a little hair dye in there yeah looks a little different now don't he looks a little different yeah see they're pulling that same play they do with all the other criminals where they show them back in school the the nice feel sorry for them fuck this kid throw him a fucking woodchipper dude yeah I mean this is real he has to be fucking like ten I don't yeah I don't care he killed fucking four innocent people bro throw him in the fucking woodchipper like he's gonna do big boy shit you get treated like a big boy his life should be overdue like we listen man we need some fucking people with some courage to actually hold people accountable this fucking giving the benefit of the doubt to anybody for any reason when they do shit like kill people or rape people violent crimes that affect the trajectory of other people's lives forever I'm the victim of a violent crime I was stabbed in the fucking face bro you don't think that fucked me up yeah I say it's the best thing that ever happened to me because it taught me a lot but also it came with a lot and you you people who have never been victimized by anybody have no fucking understanding what it's like you are you you feel violated your entire life you never get back to normal it never goes back to normal this motherfucker deserves to die just like every other mother fucking violent criminal and until we get some fucking stern leadership that understands that this country will will will continue to be in this state of chaos where we make excuses for everybody bro fuck that yeah stop making excuses for people the kids 14 you you he's fucking families defend them throw them in there too it is what it is bro listen we got to deal with reality evils a real thing evils should be destroyed we should not tolerate evil things we should not tolerate pedophilia we should not tolerate rape we should not tolerate violent crime we shouldn't tolerate that shit okay and by the way for rape if you accuse someone of rape and it's not true then you should serve the exact sense that that person was was set to serve makes sense to me man makes sense to the fucking little dirt bag yeah well guys let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this we're bringing headline and we talk about it and we'll get one of
