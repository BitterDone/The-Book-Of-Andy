What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realist comment section on the shows and we'll pick some from there as well. Now I'm not going to do the whole intro because I usually do that on Mondays so if you want to know what we do here go on Monday show. I am going to say though that we would appreciate you to pay the fee. The fee is very simple it means share the show. We don't run ads on the show. I'm not going to talk for 30 minutes about shit that I don't use. I don't want to answer to any of these other companies about what I say. You know we keep it real here so I just don't want to deal with that. So in exchange for that I ask very simply that you help us spread the word okay we're constantly battling censorship and shadow bands and all the good stuff they do these days and for us to get the word out it's going to take your help. So what I ask very simply is that if the show makes you laugh it makes you think it gives you a new perspective it helps you bring me one person man bring me one person pay the fee okay make a post tell somebody have a conversation help us grow the show and get it out there if everybody just brought one person we would double the size of the show and we would do that rapidly so help us get the message out don't be a hell show all right hey what's up man how's it going good yeah yeah what's up with you all right we had a good leg bay yeah yeah I see you're you've decided to start training again yeah my legs were shaking like prom night yeah well that's what happens when you stop working out for fucking four months what it wouldn't for once mm-hmm it's like two two and a half I was like it was like two and a half three was like I'd be a nice about four I think it was like six yeah well I wouldn't know fucking six months the fuck it wasn't it was like three it was November no six seven months ago it's a long fucking time ago bro that's what happens when you stop training you fucking get weeks yeah yeah it was a good workout though so what are you working on what are you trying to do I even have listen ribs and dick yeah you said it on Q nays yeah you said it every one rib ribs and dick man the goal yeah no I'm I mean we had talked about this yesterday I'm gonna get down I think the goal should be like two forty and then just come back up a little bit to like two sixty I think that's a great goal for you yeah that's doable man and that's doable it's what you should do yeah yeah well well we're getting to it man leg day just yeah that wasn't good leg day my legs are pretty sore and then the fucking ankle line I did the incline uh fucking treadmill man yeah that's all you that took me out yeah yeah was you three four minutes on there five yeah no I mean that like it was just a cool down but it fucking sucks you really only did five minutes yeah no bro you do 20 minutes after your workout 20 at least 20 for a cool down bro I'm fucking rip bro and I get that but but 20 for a cool down yes all right for you that's how to probe it shut the fuck up a diet no no shut up it should be 60 minutes yeah maybe 70 even yeah all right yeah I got 64 you I'm not sure what that means but it means fucking something dangerous yeah it's terrifying it sounds like something it sounds like some jail shit like you're a touches wiener or something yeah maybe yeah all right well let's make some people better today all right let's do it that's what we're all about here yeah let's let's get into a guys any question number one made very very simple question here what is the right way in the wrong way to look at success good and bad definitions your outlooks and why do so many people not succeed what what what are people missing when they when you think about success overall success just life success look but there's there's two schools of thought right um first of all say this success for everybody looks differently okay some people they they don't care as much about money and and you know and I think that's a mistake because it severely handicaps them on their enjoyment of life but some people pretend I'll say this pretend like they don't care about money until they fucking need it right and then they're calling people like me and they care a lot yeah they care a whole lot and um you know they say things like oh I don't give a shit about money I just want to live my life I just want to enjoy my life I just want to blah blah blah blah blah blah you're full of shit and I tell you why because you enjoy your life a lot more if you had some money all right so we have this like two schools of thought right we have the school of thought that I'm gonna float through life I'm gonna I'm gonna you know my I'm gonna define my own success and usually not always usually that is some sort of excuse as to why they aren't doing anything it's justification for them to get out of the hard things um that would have been required to build what their original dream was and so what most people do is they have a dream when they're young and as they get older and older and older they get through high school college uh and then just older in life their dream gets beaten out of them by everybody around him right everybody's telling them that they're not realistic everybody's telling them that they're immoral for wanting more everybody's telling them it's a waste of time because they're gonna fail and so what ends up happening is they give up on what their original dream was and then they replace it with some sort of shit that resembles what they currently have and then they start talking about how that's what they actually want and so it's a justification for the lack of results for the lack of actions that they're not willing to take and that's what most people do okay that's just honest like it's a hard pit of swallow it's real talk dude most most people are just fucking weak and they fucking quit and then they pretend their whole life they're more virtuous than everybody else because they have some quote unquote humble definition of success all right so that's one person that's that's the majority of people then there's this group of people who looks at it and says you know I really do want a simple life I really do want a simple life I want to I want to work I want to make enough money to be okay and then you know after that I kind of want to enjoy my life and it's genuine okay and and that's what success looks like for them and that's okay and there's a big difference between the first group and the second group because the first group they're lying the second group it's true okay and then there's like a third group and the third group are people who are highly ambitious they have big goals they want to level up they want to become more they want to create more they want to build things and those people are highly ambitious and they're usually keeping score by about the not only the money they make but the money they make is a big part of the scorecard what they create the benefits they create and and that's kind of the third category so to say what defines success for the individual is hard to define because everybody's different mm-hmm but being authentic with your true desires and then chasing them with all of your potential and all of your skills set and all of your effort is what's most important and so what I actually define success is the pursuit of the fulfillment of your ultimate potential and the reason that I say it's the pursuit of the fulfillment of your ultimate potential is because you can't ever actually reach your full potential because where you are today as you go down the path and learn new skills the potential is going to expand which means eventually you're going to run out of time right you're going to gain new skills your potential expands you fulfill more of your potential because you have the new skills but and then you acquire more skills on top of that the potential expands again so there is no actual fulfillment of your true potential so it's just a pursuit which lends to the saying you know success is a journey not a destination and so that's what that actually means so when I look at success and how I judge success is am I utilizing all my potential am I pouring that into the mission that I'm on am I trying to be the best that I can be at the thing that I want to be and if I am and I'm giving that my all every single day in a real way not in a bullshit way I consider that to be a successful individual so you know it's not just about money it's not just about material shit and for some people it's not about any of that shit and they can still be successful but the truth of the matter is if we're being real most people fall into that first category which is why most people can't get anywhere and why most people are so unhappy okay they tell you that's what they want but why if that's what they want why are they so miserable why why are they so frustrated why are they so depressed why are they so angry why are they so bitter why do they hate other people success so much the reason that they hate other people success so much is because that was their original dream that they got beat out of them that caused them to accept the reality and now lie to everybody including themselves that this is what I actually wanted the whole time it's a way to save face so if you were the second group of person and that was your genuine definition of success why would you be judge men or hate on anybody else's success you see what I'm saying right right what exists no you would the the the first person is lying to themselves in the second are actually creating the reality but ultimately guys this comes down to deciding what life you want and then giving everything that you have to it going down the path and as you go down the path you make mistakes now as you make mistakes if you don't have a 30 IQ you're able to learn lessons those lessons are tools and their skills and they help you move forward and as you move forward with those new skills your potential gets bigger and that means you have longer to go but you're still in a much better spot as you go down the path so you know you're never going to actually get there because eventually you're going to fucking die right like dude you have a guy who's 75 years old and lived 75 years of life and has 75 years worth of skills I mean he's going to live 10 more years 20 more years max he's going to eventually run out of time right but he's the most equipped for success because he knows the most shit so this is why it's also important to you know not just ignore old people like they're crazy dude they know way more than you yeah just don't let them run the country yeah that's exactly right let me actually this because I feel like there's also that there's a connection there you know you talk about this you know we don't really know when our time is going to expire yeah would you say that that is your fear that also creates the urgency of that pursuit of your full potential yeah I think well and there's actually I read a study about this there's actually a commonality among very highly successful people and almost all of them had a near death experience at one point in their life which caused them to understand that they are mortal and that they're not they're going to run out of time and so when you have when you have something happened to you like when I got stabbed or when I thought I had a brain tumor for two weeks there was misdiagnosed and I thought I was going to fucking die you begin to understand things differently and see things differently and it's not enough to see your friend die or your mom die or dad die to like that fire it's got to be you and when you have that experience where you legit almost die you realize that shit can be over like that which creates a massive sense of urgency I was very fortunate to have that stabbing incident happened to me when I was 23 years old and it changed my life because I realized holy shit dude like I could run out of time tomorrow I didn't do shit so now I now I run as fast as I can every single day so that at least you know hopefully something matters down the road and maybe it won't but but I think it will while I'm here and I'm going to feel like it does when I die so that's in that one matters yeah you know what I'm saying so I think that sense of urgency is common amongst people who have had an experience that has reminded them of their own mortality and that's why they run so hard and I think that's a very real thing and I don't think that people who haven't had that I don't I'm not I don't think they run as hard I just don't think they do you know well I think I think the evidence shows because if they did there'd probably be the world will look a little bit different yeah yeah I think most people they they fucking think they have all the time in the world they think they're never gonna die and then one day they wake up and they're 65 70 years old they're like fuck dude I didn't do anything and then they got to live the rest of your life being bitter about what they didn't do I can't really imagine anything worse than that dude yeah that's real shit man I love it guys Andy question number two Andy my son is five years old and plays in Brex soccer league we teach our sons to play hard and be dedicated when you sign up for a sport currently my five year old is dominating the soccer field after the first three games I actually think if we can move them up an age bracket but they said they can't play they can at this point today and the second half my son already had 15 goals and they were winning 15 to zero the coach made my son start back by the goal and then let them cross midfield before he was allowed to play any defense we tell our son to pass and find teammates but minimal kids understand the game like he does now the second half a trainer of a player on the other team came over to myself my wife my seven year old along with my sons grandparents and stopped the game to bitch at us he said our son has had enough goals and not to let him score again when I told him we already tell him to pass and said he must be a better parent and then he said he must be a better parent because his kids listen to him tells me my son shouldn't be allowed to play in this league and needs to be on the travel team then says his son would score 30 goals a game I told my son to get another 15 the guy then challenges me to a one-on-one game I'd rather put the gloves and throw down but I keep my composure which prior to 75 hard might not I might not have had the discipline in the scenario do you like do we step on the gas here yes like what do we eat you a fucking lesson yeah a hundred percent kill those motherfuckers score 75 fucking goals a game and then run around take a shirt off being asshole now I wouldn't say that to anybody else I'm being serious now under normal circumstances I wouldn't do that but this is just what I think when someone acts like a fucking cocksucker you fucking jam it down their throat okay so that guy's being an asshole that guy's talking shit that guy's pissed off and the other parents are pissed off because they don't go out and spend time with their kids they stick them on a video game they fucking stick them on an iPad and then they expect them to go out and be competitive against kids where their parents play with them all right you I'm guarantee you you're outpraxin with your kid I guarantee you're you're you're teaching them the real shit otherwise he's not scoring 15 goals in the game that's fucking awesome yeah this just happened to sell this happened to this happened to me and sell his kids all the time because we were fucking dominant on it on an athletes too so like we when we were kids kids bro we'd score seven eight goals parents get fucking pissed off you know I'm fucking for sell oh yeah they would go fuck a try and start a fight with my dad but you know what they didn't see was that my dad was out in the yard with us every fucking day playing baseball playing soccer playing we played roller hockey but that translated into ice hockey right no like we were practicing all the time he was taking us on runs bro six mile runs when we were fucking six to seven years old I still in my whole life aim run six miles again you know what I'm saying like that's the shit my dad deal with us so of course we're better than everybody else and if you got kids that suck at sports maybe you should fucking practice with them instead of complaining to the other parents about how it's not fair that's right it's not fair and that motherfucker should go out and score 35 goals a game and teach all the other kids that they better get their fucking asses to work excuse my profanity on this but I don't give a shit yeah it's real shit in that now I mean well that pisses me off yeah well because there's real consequences there's no virtue to holding back like bro there's no virtue to taking it easy on someone you're actually hurting them by taking it easy you are hurting those other kids by telling your son to take it easy because they need to witness what the result is when you put the time and effort into practicing to be great those other kids that are getting run all over they should be having the parents should be having conversations with them be like yeah little Stevie scored 15 goals you know why because he praxis while you're on the fucking computer dude if you want to score 15 goals then you got to practice too and then go practice with them a lot of you parents shouldn't even have fucking kids in sports because you don't spend any time with them whatsoever you fucking don't even care about your own mother fucking kids real talk we see it all the time bro I had this situation fucking we went to Sal's game and this fucking fat mother fucker pulled off his shirt at the game and started threatening Sal and I'm like bro I'm like this dude I'm like Sal fucking murder you dude yeah like like you're a fat drunk middle age who's your man like the fuck out of here and go pracks with your fucking kid maybe if you ran around the soccer field with your kid you wouldn't be such a fat fuck just being real dude I hate that shit yeah like when we see these kids get fucking these coaches get fired because they score you know that they win the basketball game a hundred points to fucking four like bro practice hold a like the real world doesn't care the real world does not care what's fair it doesn't care what's easy all it cares about is what the result is and it doesn't matter how much people cry about it or how much they complain about it or what they think is right or wrong morally at the end of the day the real world will and always has for the last 10,000 fucking years valued results okay that's what the fuck it's done whatever the results are is what you get compensated on and if you don't teach your kids that bro you're doing them a disservice you buy into all this politically correct nonsense about kids getting celebrated for showing up and everything needs to be fair bro your handicap and your kid for life bro they're gonna lose so yeah score 15 more goals run around rubbing in their fucking faces and fucking be good and happy about how much work you did bro I'm all about that a hundred percent you think I fucking hold back against my competition you think I hold I sit here and think fuck dude you know what we're so far ahead everybody else I might as well slow down so you can catch up yeah you know that's not the way it works you gotta score no more that is not the way it works bro you have to keep putting points on the board day in and day out day in and day out day in and day out and yeah there is scenarios where you know we get to a point where you know you pull your starters from the team and shit right but now when they come bitch at you like that I could tell you that put them on fuck it right that's right yeah right that's right bro at the end of the day I'd shove it down there throughout so fucking hard they fucking choke yeah well so so but there but there is a difference here right because I feel like a lot of people would you know scream and complain well that's bad sportsmanship it's bad it's not bad sportsmanship that's different no bad sportsmanship is crying and pounding about the other team kicking your ass that's bad sports yes yeah you're the goal of the game is to put points on the board that is the goal until no go no higher your goal is to stop that right now just because you're an epic stopping them does not mean that the goal of the game changes that's real shit I know that's real shit man and bro if you we guys motherfucking parents out there we start teaching your kids the real shit about competition maybe we wouldn't have a land of the United States of Pussies you know what I'm saying bro there's no fair no shit bro welcome the reality it's not fucking fair I love it I fucking love it I don't think I can't stand it's fucked up now what I would add though is just make sure after your son does score those 30 fucking goals that when they do the handshake line he goes up and shakes everybody's hand can you move it yeah keeps your fucking moving that's after the celebration yeah yeah yeah and then and then you teach him to tell the other kids all of the shitty guys so they can get better yeah you know what I'm saying you know when they fall down because he broke their ankles because he's got some good juke's he can pick him up after he scores the goal you know I'm saying yeah we'll dirt on that shit all right there yeah we got to teach our kids to win bro we got to teach our kids to dominate 100 to fucking zero bro should be the score you should be offended that they even showed up to play that's how good you should be that's what I think yeah yeah fuck I'm offended when somebody thinks they're gonna compete with me bro like I'm offended you even think that take a personal I do yeah I do it is what it is I fucking love it like I I could celebrate my friends wins I can learn from my friends wins I can respect them but if you're gonna step to my line bro you're gonna learn fucking lesson that's the truth yeah I'm offended that they even showed up that's my mentality I love it man I love it that's every fucking winners mentality by the way go read Tim grow is not just yeah I see yeah and then you need yeah I fucking think you're gonna compete better go home you're still fucking snowcow in the way home right right be a lot easier than fucking competing against me that's what you should be teaching your kid bro you know I teach him a little con in my get Greg or swag after he scores his goals just to piss off the parents throw getting them a little custom fuck you Jersey I get my do the pinstripe I get my jersey you said what the fuck you gonna do my and my dad will beat your a yeah bro my dad back in the day dude we play soccer if we scored a goal or we heard another kid he bought us a fucking toy bro that's crazy that's great I know he go jail now he goes yeah dude I swear he did that that's how bullshit that's crazy we would go and he would buy us like a GI Joe for like five bucks right so like if we I mean he taught us how to win yeah well that because winning isn't incentivized yeah you get something when you win yeah he didn't say go out like beat the other kids up but you just said like if you run over a kid like his big thing was just run him over yeah run him over yeah like when they get in your way just keep running that's great which we did salad I were like little fat kids we ran him the fuck over bro so many parents trying to fight my dad that's fucking awesome yeah I love what it is bro you know I think we turned out the way we're supposed to turn out you know what I'm saying like too bad why don't you teach your kids the rules of reality not the rules of idealism no competition is real you have to be good you have to have skills you have to put in practice and if someone beats you it means you're not good enough if you sell a product and no one buys it it means your product sucks teach them the real shit of competition anything less than that will handicap them for their entire lives you teach them to be nice you teach them to have you know feel sorry for putting points on the board bro they're gonna they're gonna get their asses beaten life and it's gonna be your fault they should be happy about scoring goals I that kid I buy in 15 GI Joe's bro whatever to fuck their into now yeah I fucking love it man yeah I love it well guys Andy I third and find a question question number three this is a good one Andy uh so I've been listening to you I'm far more than a year did 75 hard two times in the last eight months I am so fucking happy and proud of myself and I have regained confidence in myself and gained even more than I thought I had uh that's all fucking great here's the issue with my newfound confidence I feel I can walk through a brick wall bro and I've had a few close people people I trust and value tell me that I've become quote unquote two cocky how do I know if I'm actually being quote unquote cocky or is this just my newfound confidence what's the difference here I mean anybody appears cocky that puts up results and then is happy about it people aren't used to that because most people don't produce any results so they they're used to saying well I don't produce any results because I'm humble so when you actually produce results no matter what you say about it no matter how nice you are no matter how kind you are no matter how quiet you are about it they're gonna say you're fucking cocky dude there's other wrong would be in cocky either as long as you back it up there's another wrong with that like there's another wrong with that it adds some spice to your life it's good to have some swagger it's fun it's fun to walk around like you got a 30 foot dick like that's fun shit but you make sure you have it yeah that's right but that is only because you're producing results and so it's okay to feel cocky as long as you can still be humble in the process and people like well you can't do that bullshit it's confidence in game time and humble and preparation okay when I walk out on the field dude I know what I've put in I know the work I've done I'm gonna walk out there with some swagger I'm gonna put some points on the board you ain't gonna fucking touch me okay and if you do I'm gonna run you to fuck over all right humble is studying the film preparing learning about your opponent practicing the skills doing the drills and doing all that shit with the proper intent intensity and the intent so like you can be cocky in execution and humble and preparation but most people's minds are too simple to understand that so all they see is you know kind of McGregor walking out with a swag right the fucking hate that guy because he's cocky well the reason he's cocky is because he works his ass off behind closed doors and he knows what he's bringing in a table and there's nothing wrong with that that just rubs people who don't do shit the wrong way but remember that's who they watch those are the people they enjoy watching who do people love to watch oh they love to watch people they don't like because they're cocky because that's something they've never had they wish they had that they wish they could walk in a room with a with a strut with a three-piece suit looking like a fucking pit knowing that you're gonna walk out in the fucking ring and beat some dudes ass and you're gonna walk back to your yacht they wish they could have that but they lack the courage they lack the work ethic they lack the understanding of what it means to be that kind of a person so you can't expect a mediocre mind to understand a mind that is wired for greatness it will never happen so how do you know if you're cocky your cocky if you don't think you have anything to learn your cocky if you if you think you're great and you're not putting in the work your cocky if you're think you're getting good and it's because you're just good it's not the work that you put in right that's too cocky but as long as you're putting in the work as long as you're putting up the results as long as you're doing your thing bro people are gonna interpret a cocky so you might as well enjoy it anyway you know what I'm saying no this was so let me actually this though so how long how long can you be cocky on the win one day like what's the rule 24 hours yeah celebrate for 24 hours get back to work that's my rule that's champion rule bro you ever see Nick Saban do an interview Bill Bale check to an interview after they once national championship or Super Bowl you know what they're talking about it ready what's next coach they're talking about next year yeah they're talking about waking up tomorrow and getting to work on next year that's what champions do that's why they're fucking champions because they celebrate very very short time losers will win one time you know they get the MVP of the high school football game they're talking about it 20 years later you know I'm saying they that's what losers do so 24 hour rule on celebrating 24 hour rule on talking shit 24 hour rule um to to feel good about your win and then it's back to work so that you can keep being cocky right right yeah I'm gonna and if you're winning every fucking day then you're celebrating every fucking day bro listen I like I like people that are cocky I like people with swag everybody likes people with swag because it makes you feel like you could have some swag the only people that don't like it are people that are totally weak totally they they're the first group of people that I described on question one they're the people who have given up on their dreams they turn their nose up anybody who's doing shit more than them they say shit like it must be nice uh you know I'm sure I'm sure that's the great way to live they say all kinds of dumb shit and it's because they fucking quit on themselves dude that's the reality you can't expect those people to ever understand you and your friends and your family they're the worst ones they're the ones that have known your whole life they're they're gonna hate on you the most because they see you changing they see you break it out of the mold and they're like oh well you're different now no shit that's the point the point is for me to get different the point is for me to not be like you that's why I'm doing this because when I look at you and I look at the way you live and I look at the way you guys are miserable I don't want that for myself I want to be better I want to put in more work I want to be great at what I do I want to be fit I want to make money I want to do all this shit and you don't so thanks for motivating me okay so like your friends and family are the first ones that are gonna hate when you first step out that's the reality it just hurts more because they're closer yeah yeah you're not used to it yeah you know I'm saying you think that those people are gonna celebrate you they're gonna have your back they're gonna they're gonna push you down the path but that's rarely the case bro with people that you know your whole life because they always see you as that old version of you you know they don't see you as that new version of you you know how many people in my life see me as the version of me that existed five to ten fifteen years ago that I'm not even close to that anymore see what I'm saying so your identity in those people's eyes is very small and limited just like their identity is and when you start breaking that identity and you start moving forward and you start progressing and you get better and you get in shape and you start making some money and you start having some success they hated because they realized fuck they could have done the same but they were too lazy they didn't have the belief in themselves they didn't want to do the work they were too afraid and they got to live with those decisions for their whole life and they're bitter at themselves they're mad at themselves for giving up on their original dream to accept their reality and lie about it as if it is their dream and you're actually going out and doing something so you can expect that you're gonna get more of it but you're gonna get it the worst from your family and friends so I wouldn't as long as you're doing the work and as long as you're putting up results and as long as you realize that you always have a lot to get better on and a lot to improve and you're willing to do that work and you don't think that you're great just because you're you it's okay to feel good about yourself you know when you look at how people's ego affects them in a negative way you know imagine a bell curve all right and on the left side of the bell curve where you're at the low point you know you don't know what the fuck you're doing you don't know what to do you don't know the skills you don't the moves you don't know the work ethic you don't know shit so you know that you don't know shit so you're willing to start to take action okay I don't know what to do I don't know I tell me what to do and I'll do it right so they do this they start doing the things they take the actions they take the habits of successful people and they start to move up the bell curve and they start to improve and they improve and keep improving and keep improving and keep improving and then for most people what happens is they get to a point where they forget about all this work that they put in and they start believing that the success they are seeing is just because they're special it's like reading your own news clippings I'm great because I'm great and that's how you can always identify the people who are about to fall in their fucking face when they start talking about how they're the best ever or they're the best or they're better than everybody else blah blah blah blah blah blah they're about to eat shit all right because what happens is they start to believe that it's them instead of remembering that it's actually the actions that they've been taking and they are living in the results of those actions and then what happens is they stop doing the actions because they don't think they have to because they think they're just great and then they fall down the fucking bell curve real fast the other side okay and then they start back to a point where they're like fuck I don't know what just happened I just lost everything I lost all my friends I lost all my money I lost all and then they're like fuck I don't know what to do and then eventually they come to the conclusion of while start doing what I did before so they start taking the actions before and they start to see results and then they get to a point where they're doing real good again and they will either have learned the lesson the first time or they'll repeat what they did the first time so they'll either say to themselves hey I got here last time and I quit doing the work and I lost everything and they'll keep doing the work which allows them to continue to escalate up the curve without peaking right but if they get to the top again and they start saying oh I'm great and they stop doing the shit they're gonna lose again and so most people live their lives in a in a in a in this wave of success and failure success and failure and the reason they live their lives in that wave is because they can't ever figure out that it's their own ego getting in their way of their humility understanding that they have much more to learn and many more skills to go and all you got to do to really remember this is just compare yourself to the best in the world ever like are you winning compared to Bezos are you winning compared to Elon are you winning compared to feel night that's the questions I ask me that's what I ask myself like when I start feeling like I'm doing good I look at fucking Bezos so I'm like yeah I'm doing shit no I am doing shit and then I get back to work this is why I use the language I use day one right a long way to go when people say oh congratulations on all the success I'm like fuck bro shut the fuck up I haven't even started you know what I mean like I hate that shit it's poisonous to progress hearing you know congratulations and believing you're successful like dude when people start calling themselves great and calling themselves successful you know they're on the fucking down bro it's only a matter of time because they're losing the ability to understand that they they really aren't anything they're a spec of dust in the grand scheme there are millions of people who have done more than you who have come from worse than you so for you to think that your great is an inaccurate representation of self see what I'm saying yeah so yeah so you just have to be careful for that remember the life that you're currently living is the result of the actions that the old you has been taking for a long time if the new you doesn't continue to take those actions you won't be living in that state for very much longer see what I'm saying yeah yeah I fucking love it man yeah I love it well guys Andy that was three yep guys go pay the fee
