man what's going on man nothing what's up you are a little matchy matchy with the hats man oh yeah that's cool oh yeah yeah that's what's up anything it made you pick that one in particular well I mean it was your phone call this morning oh yeah yeah hey we got dress alike I did call you yeah yeah you put the special underwear on to yeah yeah yeah all right cool let's see I'll show you later what's going on man nothing just doing the thing man yeah yeah it's going on the world I've been busy yeah a lot you know let's just give it to it slavery uh end it day officially okay a while ago that's good yeah we fought I fought with you some people fought I fought against you you know yeah it's like a thing but we got the NFL draft going on the night first day what's wrong with you all right column capernick yeah it's crazy though because you know sports has has been very politicized and like I've been turned off by it yeah I think you know but there are some cool things that are happening I guess like there's there's some some cool young bucks that are coming up and I guess what do you who who is your favorite I guess NFL player of all time who you of all time I guess your era like your micall stock Michael that was the line was I'm no he played running back for the for the bucket ears big dude the fucking fuck yeah that was a big boy oh yeah yeah bro you go Google micall stop and watch his highlight reels yeah he had the fucking roll cage on his back yeah neck roll that was the shit back in the day bro if you didn't have a neck roll you were a bitch yeah yeah bro his straight dude just a different different kind of dude it was it was different back then I mean football was just different back then for sure yeah it was like way more physical uh you know well I know those guys are fucked up now though man yeah the TBI's and shit you know it's like I mean I get the argument of like making the sport safer but it's just like yeah it's still football yeah yeah bro I I my call style was awesome you know he played for Purdue uh went to the Tampa Bay bucks he trained for football by pushing his Jeep down the football field and shit like it's crazy yeah he's just a different kind of like the fuck no no no well dude and also like it was just different what it was a different era of football like now the athletes are so fast and they're so big and everybody's a tremendous athlete like back then it was different like you know you didn't have lineman running fucking four eights and four sevens and shit you know what I mean like you just didn't have that and it's just different dude it's just different game everybody's too fast like guys that are big and physical in the backfield like it's it doesn't work the same way it used to I also feel too like back then like I feel like it was just regular Joe's playing football you know I'm saying like just I mean like yeah they were still great like bro it was just it was just different kinds of training dude like when I was in high school you know and your athletes played all the sports right like you played all three sports at least sometimes four because you played a club sport now a lot of these kids that only play yeah they played that one sport bro and they practiced that one position and they're just better I mean if you put more reps in they're you're gonna be better yeah that's a good point yeah it's like the the era of the bow jackson kind of one way for sure yeah that is crazy to think about but yeah I mean there's some cool things in a fell drafts going tonight Tennessee Titans is up first I did see this cool story though I thought this was kind of cool I said there's a lot of really inspiring young bugs that are coming up and yeah trying to do the thing I feel like too it's also interesting like you know like for a lot of young kids like what do you want to be they either want to be a fucking be the president or they're saying they're going to be in the NFL or something like that be a fucking football player and it's cool because like there's this story one of the NFL draft prospects he worked in the Amazon warehouse while trying to land a college scholarship now he could make millions shavon rebel he's probably gonna go first round solid kid out of East Carolina universities one of the top ranked players at his position he's a cornerback this guy right here and yeah he worked like a summer job over the summer working at Amazon warehouses just to you know help pay for fucking school and stuff and I'm getting a scholarship and and I was probably gonna be going pro so I thought that was cool like I said I mean people have been turned it off from from it it seems like it's it's you know they're trying to like come off of that you're saying that political the political shit yeah just over pull look dude I mean look all you gotta do is go to the money okay who's who who is contributing to a lot of the money that the NFL uses it's the biggest banks in the world and to qualify for the money that these people use they have to have certain cultural standards implemented into their system like DI like ESG like political and what's interesting is you know there's no DI for white people in that NFL no you know saying like like no one even argues it nobody wants it but I don't want that shit I just want to watch a bunch of fucking hot dogs running around full of fucking feel you know slow-ass motherfuckers you know I don't want to see that I want to see people run fast to hit the shit out of each other and fucking play hard like look bro we want to see fucking steroids and baseball we want to see home runs go 700 motherfucking feet I want to see dudes get their fucking heads ripped off and football and MMA I want to see guys get knocked the fuck out like these are realities of sport it's the best of it yes that's how it's what I want to see yeah well there's like some good prospects oh man I don't know I might watch that story that story that you're saying though about this guy having to do this extra stuff that stuff's more common than not oh yeah those stories just don't get told you know any me another piece of it too like I mean the dudes I think Robert Griffin the third rg3 what do they call him you know like he was on a forget whose podcast he was on the other that's our clip but he was like because the other piece of it is like they don't financially prepare you for getting all of the big money and stuff like that oh yeah like I was saying like he got his contract to signing bonus was like 14 million dollars right when he got drafted and he said you know when the check hit the count and when they're fucking you know look and he said he got like six million mm-hmm or something like that and so he calls fucking agent like yo with fuck like you know somebody's still my money like no bro that's taxes you know you know I'm saying it's like and that's a whole another piece so it's like you know they struggle before they even get in but then once they're in nobody teaches them they don't tell them anything and not only that dude what they don't tell them which is the most important part is that the when you're 20 years old and you go from you know being like everybody else to getting millions and millions of dollars you don't have a perspective of what it's like to work for regular money and you also don't have the perspective to understand that that money is going to stop yep so where a lot of these guys getting trouble is you know they have bad people around them they have they're not taught how to handle the vultures they're not taught how to handle the women they're not taught how to you know understand that you can't just spend all your cash flow when you're going into you know you start getting you know a million bucks a fucking week because you're a superstar when that ends and you're you're buying all this shit it's over you know like very few people have effectively pivoted from which really this is the really this is the really fucking hard part for me to fucking really grasp is like how few of these people actually and I'm talking about all athletes yeah how few of them take the money that they make while they're playing and turn it into like forever cash flow and asset you know equitable asset like it's like bro a few of them bro and it's so easy because they have so much money coming in like all you would have to do is set up some basic shit to have some fucking income that is greater than 99.99% of people's income for life you know just some some some moderate investment strategies you know what it means some basic business strategies I mean but you know it's you know nobody teaches them that and nobody teaches them that because the minute you teach them all that shit they stop being an open bank for everybody around them you know what they realized who the shit I don't so I don't need to go risk my life my body to go fucking you know I'm saying like battle every fuck like I don't need to do that to be what I now they lose their fucking gladiators you know I'm saying it's like it's a whole different thing it looked dude it's it's frustrating how little all the pro sports actually give a fuck about the athletes you know what I mean yeah like we shouldn't have men making 20 million dollars a year for 10 years fucking broke right after that we shouldn't have that financially and physically yeah we shouldn't have that well I mean look physically it is what the fuck it is yeah it is what it is like you know what you're fucking trading it's not up for it yeah there's an argument there no it is the argument like that's like you like like dude here's the thing I'm tired of I'm tired of society saying like knowing what they sign up for then having to deal with the consequences of what they sign up for then acting like it's not fucking fair like mother fucker you knew what the fuck you were signing up for you put that helmet on yeah yeah you knew that you could get concussions you know what CTE is you you understand there's risks everybody dies so like it is what it is like dude don't I don't want to hear the fun complaints bro like I really don't if you don't want them quit you know those talks about that a lot though is what's the bodybuilder's name uh Ronnie Colby mm-hmm he talks about that a lot you know he's like I mean he destroyed his fucking body but like that was the risk he fucking he knew what he's fucking doing yeah it's part of the game because he's a grown man yeah bro Ronnie's cool as fuck and by the way you know he understood like dude you know he didn't have to train the way that he trained he trained balls to the wall every fucking day like you know 700 800 pound squat days and crazy shit dick of his yeah but like you don't have to train that way as a bodybuilder but you did no fucking no in fact it's probably detrimental in a lot of ways but the truth of the matter is dude a lot of guys that lift love that shit like they like do when I was young that's why I got fucking injured so bad that's why my shoulder had to be reconstructed because I love lifting weights and I love lifting heavy weights it's a fucking challenge I like it I would I still do it as much as I can like look man what a shit I could have yeah you know I'm saying you know what the fuck you signed up for I don't want to fucking hear bitchin yeah you know I really don't like let's oh um so I'm so oppressed I played pro football for 10 years and I made 80 million dollars and now I got what what are you talking about you fucking knew what you were doing and and dude you're it's just I just don't like this victim shitment in society like there are consequences to choices okay if you don't want to play professional football because you know it's might fuck you up then you shouldn't play it and you should utilize your mind and your abilities and your talents to do other things but don't you know don't act like you didn't know yeah right you know saying that's real like that's real I'm just not trying to hear that shit bro that's real guys that's what you think about this topic is uh join this conversation and by the way I don't want anybody get hurt yeah but it's fucking football you know saying yeah yeah that's real yeah man all right well let's do some more crazy man I got more for you we got we got more to cover guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy forsella.com you guys can find them all linked there for you uh let's get to our first set first set of headlines let's go to the White House there's some new construction plans at the White House this is interested Trump unfurls plan for double 100 foot flag poles during White House long walk uh so president Donald Trump on Wednesday revealed plans to install two beautiful 100 foot flag poles on the White House lawns that will fly in American flag Trump told reporters about the plans after he was spotted touring the north lawn of the White House with Dale Haney head White House grounds keeper here's his clip check this out uh putting up a beautiful almost a hundred foot tall American flag on this side and another one on the other side two flags top of the line and they've needed flag balls for 200 years there was something I'd often said you know they don't have a flag ball per se so we're putting one right where you saw us and we're putting another one on the other side on top of the mounds it's gonna be a two beautiful president president president president Trump on China so he's paying for yeah so I mean that's good to see right like I mean it's better than the project so I mean that's cool my only question is where are they gonna put these Rayleigh flags like I don't have to make moves so I that's probably why there's two of them I I would like to know mr. Trump president Trump where are the gallows going to be yeah right right right that's what I'd like to park the wood shipper yes yeah yes where where are the gallows I'm gonna put a hundred foot flag flagpole in my house yeah yeah I mean you got the the center the center place right there the driveway yeah yeah let me fucking sick let me sick um but yeah I mean Trump you know that's cool flag poles are cool that's cool America I'm with it um other interesting things happen and though um out of the White House uh there was a truth that came out so there's been some interesting developments with Russia not sure if you saw this um Trump writes Vladimir stop after Russia launches deadliest strikes on keve since last summer so president Donald Trump said he is not happy after Russia launched his deadliest wave of attacks on keve in nine months telling president Vladimir Putin to stop as he attempts to push Ukraine to agree on a contentious ceasefire proposal Moscow since 70 missiles a hundred and 45 drones towards Ukraine mainly targeting keve uh in an attack that leader Vladimir Zelensky said was aimed at pressuring the United States so this was the truth that Trump uh posted out uh saying quote I'm not happy with the Russian strikes on keve not necessary and very bad timing Vladimir stop 5,000 soldiers a week are dying let's get the peace deal done so so far there's been 12 people that have been reported uh reportedly killed with 90 more injured um in this but yeah even just on this I'm also tired of like people like just trying to like oh it's so bad like bro Ukraine is literally taking these fucking unmanned drones with fucking grenades attached to them and dropping them on the people you know what I'm saying it's what's like you know I think they're they're really close to getting this done and I think I think I think Putin's trying to kill fucking Zelensky with like a last second you know push well it's interesting because like the thing is like you know there's the story but then you gotta always look I don't even think Zelensky's in in Ukraine no I think he's been there a whole time I think he's in Miami he's not there yeah for our agency they would have killed him already yeah oh I mean like for his own people would have killed him for sure for sure I mean dude do you remember all those like those fucking videos and stuff coming out that like like he was on a green screen you know what I'm saying so I mean it's possible it's possible I don't know um but you know you so you got this attack the Russia just did but you gotta go back a few days sometimes even hours before to see like I mean there had to be something that provoked it right like this dude just launches 70 fucking missiles over and all these drones and what it was um was Zelensky saying that Ukraine would not accept the United States recognizing Crimea as Russia um and that's where it all began um and shortly after that uh stance that was Zelensky took boom came the the missiles so I mean it's interesting but more development on that I do want to get to the story of the day um in this first set of headlines for you though that I thought was interesting um Tulsi Gabbert Tulsi Gabbert joins the show Tulsi Gabbert exposes three deep state criminals who have infiltrated America's intelligence network have you seen this yeah I did I didn't dig into it too much um but I didn't see the headline so I mean this this is interesting I mean we talk about accountability this is not enough or um I think what people are expecting but it's good signs I guess we could say Tulsi Gabbert has referred two intelligence officials to the Department of Justice for allegedly leaking classified information with a third referral on its way the unidentified officials allegedly leaked the classified intelligence to the Washington Post and the New York times an officer of the director national intelligence official toe fox news digital quote politicization of our intelligence and leaking classified information puts our nation security at risk and must in Gabbert who serves as the director of national intelligence said uh as news of the pending charges broke quote those who leaked classified information will be found and held accountable to the fullest extent of the law she vowed Gabbert went on to claim that the deep state criminals leaked classified information for partisan political purposes to undermine president Trump's agenda I look forward to working with the Department of Justice and the FBI to investigate terminate and prosecute these criminals um so that that that's interesting um apparently some of the information that was being shared was around the Israel Iran situation um but these guys or or these people these intelligence officials were growing straight to new sources and pushing this stuff out now it's not a new thing um it's been going on for years it goes on for years yeah um and it's not just in the intelligence industry um it's also in our defense industry that's what we've been seeing with the Pete whole peak head sex stuff going on the signal chats and all of that stuff going on um and now they got one of their guys is too um because these people are they're they're they're emboldened bro right and they just can't help that like they're the guys they're they're the dude they're you know and they can't help it you put a you put a decently looking chicken front of them a couple of drinks they're gonna fucking church like the birds because yeah because they think they're the shit they're the guy yeah that's right they're the guy and that's what we're seeing um and they can't help themselves um this headline comes out breaking the Department of Defense Branch Chief Calls President Trump illegitimate illegitimate vows to resist him attacks hexeth as unfit to lead so this was another undercover um sting from the O'Keefe Media Group let's check all over to this clip out we'll link it on the website of course to check this out legitimate he's clearly a moral right here we go we'll go resist everything you dance James O'Keefe here in Arlington, Virginia in front of the Pentagon the branch chief inside the Pentagon saying on hidden camera he's gonna resist against Trump and hexeth now since president Trump was elected and assigned Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense the DOD has faced a number of leaks in the past few months from employees inside the Pentagon there's some type of deep state forces they want to make sure you don't stay there they've come after me from day one just like they've come after president Trump I mean I've gotten a fraction of what president Trump got in that first term the secretary defense Pete Hegseth has been going on media interviews expressing that there are people within the Pentagon who want to resist the president and hurt his policies I know exactly yeah and apparently this is uh one of the guys doing it so Nicola Terza uh this was his LinkedIn he then took it offline um and deleted this many of his social media but then James O'Keefe tweeted and follow up uh saying that uh Laura Lumer reporting Pete Hegseth has seen today's video of branch chief and that the DOD officials are handling the situation so what what do we got for this man what do what do you got on this what should take he deserves to go jail is that thing that's light no that's from I mean yeah like at a bare minimum yeah that's a lot first of all I know Tulsi okay and I don't know Hegseth personally but I know a number of his friends pretty well yeah they are both real people they're not these fucking robot people okay um and the fact that they're people are attacking them does not surprise me because they're not in the club you know what I mean so that's always a good a good litmus test for sure yeah I mean when you're getting attacked there's a reason they're getting attacked and it's not because they're going along with the bullshit and like that guy said oh Trump's immoral for going against the norms no the norms are the fucking problem here okay and somebody who works in the government who says they're going to openly defy and resist the president calling him illegitimate that person belongs in fucking jail okay at a minimum that's no like the reason it depends on what he's done yeah you know saying yeah saying that you know would definitely raise some some eyebrows about it to look into what he's actually done you know what I mean for sure for sure I mean but that's the thing it's like I mean you put two and two together all of these leaks like I mean like I think I think people don't look deep enough when they say like deep state like what do we mean when we say deep state like people think since it's these like no name no face people that are just you know pulling these strings when like in reality it's it's a lot of people like this dude yeah you know I'm saying like it's like it's not just a DOD it's not D&I this isn't every federal agency you have these people set up and so it's like you know I know we criticize a lot on Trump not moving fast enough or not but it's like you know this is why though but this is why that should happen that's right and like dude it's it's it's look dude Trump's first term he made huge mistakes all right he allowed people like this to maintain their position which made it very hard for him to do anything productive the way that he actually wanted to do it so the story goes okay because it seems now he's doing the same thing again all right and it doesn't take 90 days when you've had eight years to figure out who's doing what and who's on the team and who's part of the other team and who's corrupt and who's sandbagging the progress and and and violating their oath to the American people it's you you can't tell me after eight years of being you don't know yeah right like like you mean like we have 450 people in this building so if I spent four years here then four years dealing with the ship that some of these people let's say I went and got fired right and I deal with the the these they're still long when you're still attacking me for four years and then I come back four years later for my eight nine ten eleven twelfth year you can't tell me that I don't already know who's doing what I already know I know who's on the team I know who's off the team I know who's gotta go and I know who's gotta stay and that is you know I don't know that's what I think I don't I don't I think they already know who's who yeah no Brian it doesn't take eight years to know that that's right you know I'm saying I don't know why so so then the question is why have it these people been handled why are they still allowed to exist well I think that's the other that's the other piece of it too man it's like because like you know we try to like follow leather the law we try like these people like that's the other piece like they've put so many protections in of like oh well you know we can't just fire federal employees they have rights they have all of these things and it's like it's all these checks and balances and it's like it leaves no other option than just full blown fucking lay the hammer down that that orange hammer they talk he has lay it down look man these people are already talking they're already saying stuff on Twitter and and and you know publicly you know all this stuff they're doing is just gonna open the door for us to do whatever we want just hang in there like yeah that's why you have to eliminate the communist element in this country 100% dude these people think you know like they didn't do enough the last four years like locking us all the fuck down you know arresting people that you know political prisoners uh make him hate each other yeah like we go on and on and on and on but yeah man it's uh I don't know I saw a tweet today the a couple reports saying that arrests were imminent mm-hmm we'll see yeah well I've been saying those so I've been saying those two yeah we'll see we show I feel like we're gonna get some fucking some half ass bullshit to try and appease us instead of the actual cleaning out of this corruption which is what he was elected to do you know Donald Trump you were elected to fucking arrest people you were elected to stop the corruption in this country you were elected to stop the border uh flow and and deport people and you're doing that very slowly to the point where if you continue the race or I'm sorry if you continue the pace that you're up to right now we're still gonna have to deal with most of these people when you're done there's just a lot of things that were promised that just don't seem to be happening and a lot of people who are you know pro Trump to the point where they just support everything they're they're acting like everything's going great but like dude when we look at the actual data is it yeah I mean you guys tell us well what do you guys think well I mean I'm just saying like I mean no it's a fair it's a very fair question yeah like is it is it going great are we doing all we can yeah you know because dude if you're not going to eliminate this this communist element inside of our government who's going to stand in the way of our own progress by their own admission if you're not going to eliminate that now so what are you going to do wait until the fourth year to eliminate it or third year to eliminate when when the country doesn't have the opportunity to see what it could become without these things like a big problem that we have in this country dude is that people who have not a very good understanding of how things actually work they have to see things get better right they have to like a lot of people are not sold on a lot of Donald Trump's ideas but I know that if you executed those ideas because I've run many companies I can I can understand and see forward that the result will be very beneficial to the country the problem is he's sandbagging the shit okay so I think people who voted for Trump need to put him under the fucking spotlight and hold his feet to the fire to do the things that he said he was going to do and knock it in there and play fucking friendly or more importantly don't allow people to remain in office that guy should be in fucking jail or or fucking like dude that's fuck this guy and fuck everybody like that no 100% man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments let us know that being said let's go check out some of these comments we got crews the comments yeah we got some interesting ones out this first one comes from viper 86 52 0 always love when they bring wrestling knowledge out I'm pretty sure I've seen Randy

what's what's the finisher the biscuit cutter oh that's how you don't want to know about it you don't want to know about it might as well be the can opener yeah yeah I don't want to know about that either yeah now that's some that's a bad move right there yeah yeah I'm saying all right yeah well let us know tag team names you need them in the comments let us know this next next one comes from Connor Scott 89 61 don't be a hoe get yay on the show yeah go tell them yeah go tell them go tell yay yeah a lot of people would like the the gay conversation we did get one today today yeah they did they like the gay conversation well what do we get well we got one that that I guess gave us some clarification on some things oh really actually have three things one clarification okay let's be clarified this is yeah yeah the dactyl 451 okay a couple things that's not yay Kanye was cloned years ago a ton of these celebrities and politicians are clones I says number two Trump's a puppet for fucksakes none of this shit he says is gonna happen because he's a puppet like they all are they brought in tens of millions of illegal so they can use them for cheap labor there is no mass deportation and then number three we are in fact at the end of times and yes nobody should fear what happens at the end however don't you dare think God will protect us no matter what anything can happen including massive city-sized blackouts everyone needs to be prepared and you need to tell people to prepare well I have told people to prepare for five fucking years asshole what the fuck you think I do on you okay it's all I fucking do prepare yeah trying to prepare I've been trying to tell you guys what's up forever but clearly I didn't fucking know what's going on so you know maybe we should listen to your show yeah about what's actually going on what's your show called bro I bet things giving things are fun with this guy no he's this is the guy that gives people like us a bad name you know this is the guy that this is the guy that our families think we are yeah I've forgotten the clone level I'll be real I have it yeah I mean let's break this down okay all right number one it's possible okay it's possible clone I mean look all right I'm it is possible they clone dogs bro they can clone people you know I'm saying it's possible it's possible that we're all living in a legit computer program we don't know it huh I'm a clone yeah we don't know we don't know so it's possible I'm not even gonna say anything bad about that it's it's possible number two also possible and the longer the heat weights to make arrests and do shit and all these things the more possible that becomes in my eyes so I actually agree with those two points that they're possible number three it's also possible that this is the end times but what I don't what I don't agree with is you telling me I need to tell people to prepare if you knew the amount of time and energy and effort that we put into this fucking show it would blow your mother fucking mind and it takes about five seconds for you to drop or to write a fucking comment it's a whole completely other different thing to pay millions of dollars a year to produce your own show okay come in here and fucking talk about this stupid ass shit for the sake everybody else I mean so let's be fucking real dude I tell people to prepare more than fucking anybody and and and let's let's also fucking add something to that I'm ahead of everybody I've been ahead of everybody everybody that's talking about the shit now I was talking about a year ago or two years ago or three years ago I fucking told everybody what the fuck was going on y'all fucking listen to the fucking mainstream people you don't ever go in people's comments whenever they start talking shit be like yeah for seller and DJ we're talking about this shit two fucking years ago so if you would like me to get out in front of everybody else that is going to be the job of the audience which of we have a plethora of people that can do so okay we're doing tens of millions of fucking audio downloads a month all right we're doing pretty decent on YouTube now okay there's no reason that the show shouldn't be out in front of everybody else so if you would like someone to lead and tell people what the fuck is actually going on without having to worry about if they're paid for or not you should probably fucking go tell all these mother fuckers that hey you guys are fucking just copying his shit and calling the fuck out prepare the so I'm just being real with you guys I have no problem saying this in front of the fucking and entire earth okay I'm not bought and paid for I say whatever the fuck I want to say and what I observe and that's the kind of leadership that we need I'm willing to lead but for that to happen you have to push someone out there but you instead continue to follow these fucking knuckleheads who are bought and paid for by not big media but now media media who are told they can't say and can't do and they have an agenda and they're they're hawking fucking bullshit it's all a grift and you fuckers you know it is what it is I tell you to share the show and you know yeah some of you do but some of you don't so if you want some real fucking leadership share the motherfucking show that's it that's it man so I have no I can promise you and this goes in the entrepreneur world too all these motherfucking entrepreneur gurus have been saying you know all this shit go back and listen to msco project bro you'll be able to tell exactly where they all got it and I'm talking about every single motherfucking one of them all they do is take my shit and reframe it and fucking put it out in a new slide deck or fucking some of them don't even reframe it they just steal it yeah and they're gonna look stupid as fuck when I come back on Instagram with all my old receipts of the shit I'm saying and I put it right next to their motherfucking videos of them saying the same shit so they think they're getting away with it but little do they know I've been planning on this remember I plan on things I think ahead and when I stepped away from doing entrepreneurial content five fucking years ago there was a plan for that and y'all just walked right into it so just gonna be real they don't know what's coming bro that's right they don't know what's coming dude so it's gonna be a lot of embarrassing shit for people because they're literally taking which by the way that's the point in me doing it the point in me doing it and so it spreads but don't you dare act like you fucking came up with this shit motherfucker I was the first person on the fucking internet saying any of this fucking shit okay and I'm the first person on the internet saying this other shit outside of maybe Alex Jones who's who's 20 years ahead okay so that's just the facts and fucking I got receipts all of them guys we do appreciate you those who do fucking share think yes that's why I asked people to share bro that's it got to share man got to share the show um yeah man we appreciate you with that being said let's get back to our cruising we got our second set of headlines let's go to the supreme court this is interesting we got a supreme court they're hearing a bunch of things out and with this what they're having to hear out right now is it's absurd let's dive into it scotus appears poised to side with Maryland parents over opt-outs for LGBTQ plus books so they're having to fight this in the supreme court right now for parents to have the the ability to not have their kids indoctrinated with with almost sapien stuff let's dive into it uh supreme court uh appeared on Tuesday to lean in favor of a group of religious parents who sued a Maryland school board over its refusal to allow their k five children to opt out of lgbtq plus curriculum in 2022 month gumbry county board of education announced new quote-unquote inclusivity books for k five students and took away parental notice and opt-outs for story books that discuss topics like gender transitions pride parades and preferred pronouns some of the reading materials include uh the pride puppy uncle bobby's wedding and born ready the true story of a boy named panellope these are these are some of the books here and um yeah it's interesting so in the petition parents ultimately access the supreme court to answer do public school burden do public schools burden parents uh religious exercise when they compel elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against the parents religious convictions and without notice or opportunity to opt out um quote the school board does not dispute that under its theory it could compel instruction using pornography and parents would have no rights argued Eric Baxter the Beckett fund for religious liberty attorney representing the parents quote the first amendment demands more parents not school boards should have the final say on such religious matters um now to still show contagie brown jackson this lady um supreme court justice contagie uh brown jackson um you don't have to send your your kid to that school that's what she had to say so this was the same justice that when she was getting confirmed she couldn't define what the woman was that's right right the same lady um yeah and she saying if you don't want your kids to learn about you know almost sapiens and stuff send them to a different school because you know she was able to send their school her kids to private schools all their lives and she had that choice you know every parent has that I didn't know that oppressed people could do that right well how does an oppressed person send their kids to private school they're the tart yeah it's hard that's a hard one um but let's listen to what this this lady had to say the parent can choose to put their kid elsewhere you don't have to send your kid to public school I'm struggling to see how it burdens a parent's religious exercise if the school teaches something that the parent disagrees with you have a choice you can hone school them no it's not that they disagree with it you're using our funds to teach something that is not a normal behavior okay you have created fake data you have created by and by the way it's just very cloudy at best to pretend as if this is normal shit this is not normal shit okay this is not scientifically backed in fact there's a lot of people out there and there's a lot of data out there also that you can look up that will argue that homosexuality is a fucking mental disorder or the result of abuse okay so and I'm not saying look dude my personal views is I don't give a shit I don't if you're an adult and you want to be a homosexual or whatever you are I don't care man I don't fucking care but at the end of the day it's not a religious thing it's a fucking it's a fucking appropriate thing like what's appropriate I don't think it's appropriate for young children to be lurk when I was a kid we weren't learning about sex when we were fucking three years old or four years old or five years old no and by the way it takes it takes away the development of certain parts of the personality through the the inhibition of allowing people to figure things out and experience one of the best ways that you learn as a child is by touching the motherfucking stove right but if you're told like if you're told what to believe in the way things are that is grooming at that age so oh well your parents groom you yeah yeah you know what I guess they do they groom you with your beliefs and this and that and all the other things that's why there's a lot of kids that are totally fucked up but what they don't need is to be groomed to fucking school and everybody else is fucking tax dollars okay and if someone wants to be homosexual or or like I'm not here to argue the data or science I'm saying there's a lot of different viewpoints and you know outside of religion there's probably a lot of people that just think it's wrong and they don't think that the tax dollars should be going to it I don't personally care like I think homosexuals gay lesbian I don't have a problem with it like do it or the fuck you want bro I don't think the government should step in and say shit about it I think they should have all the rights that single people I don't stay out of the fucking people's business but like that's what they're not doing they're not staying out of people's business they're forcing a cultural ideology on the children intentionally that leans to the progressive left for their benefit for you know Katanji's benefit right people like that and so like dude although you could send your school school kids to other school or you could just I don't know not teach them to suck dicks when they're fucking five years old I think that's a reasonable shit well that's the piece that bothers me too bro it's like it's like it's like it's not not everybody has that fucking you know ability to send their kids to schools if they want to send them to like that's just not a reality for Americans like and we could dive into that like sure like we're financially oppressed and we have all these issues but like it's not the current reality you can't just uproot yourself or you know they're having a struggle to fucking pay bills that who's gonna homeschool them you know I'm saying like you can't call that a fucking choice listen she knows that this lady's a fucking full blown comments yes look what's even worse with this dude though so so there are one of the other justices just is gorsuch um it was going back and forth with uh the attorney for the uh school board who's arguing this is no different than the fucking argument for the vaccine you have a choice yeah right you you could just quit your job yeah just not work you get out you have a choice you could just not participate in society that's what she's saying just in different way same thing that's the mentality of communist people like bro listen I think we need a full revolution I think we need a moral revolution like and what I mean by that is I think like I think we we put a checklist together right and like you know uh do you think that you know books sexual books heterosexual books homosexual books homosexual books should be read to fucking kids I think people who who's will agree and say yes I think that their legacy and their gene pool should be be terminated at that point look I it's a more revolution well I you know I don't care well do you think she's gonna ever change her views no of course she's not she is not of course aligned with americans views no of course not she's aligned with all these fucking pink hair blue hair fucking ridiculous crazy fuckers on the street and that's not representative of most of society she has no business on the court no that's that's the other thing like it's not that many we know it's it wouldn't be a lot of people it wouldn't be like you know six million or anything like that I mean you know like five but I can be that many you know I don't know dude I know this the fact that these people believe that they can teach your kids without appearance consent about gender ideology and homosexuality and sexual activity of any sort is insane it's insane okay the fact that there's laws out here that will actually in certain places of the country that will actually put parents in fucking jail if they don't allow their kids to transition or if they misgender their kids or any of this other that's insane that's insane shit that's why okay then you cannot tell me that the community that those people represent and I know California is a different place I understand that but you can't tell me that people are okay with that I don't believe it no I don't believe it yeah I don't believe it no no well like even my most progressive friends okay and I do have some progressive friends all right even my most progressive friends they don't believe they're buying into communist ideology but they are but they don't believe it because they don't understand the connection so they just say hey you know these what's wrong with what's wrong with accepting these people what we fucking just saw it for the last fucking four years that's what's wrong okay and activity like this just creates more animosity towards LGBT community okay so this here's about online y'all are not going to force this shit on us it's not going to happen because if the courts start ruling this way all that's going to happen is fucking dads and and and then are not they're tired of the shit are going to find these people and fucking deal with them in in real life that's what's going to happen mom's mom's little too I know bro I'm just telling you the courts are the last defense for these people and they need to be very careful about how hard they're pushing on the regular American like bro you guys all started with oh I just want to be left alone and I want to get married you got that and and you know you had the the people who opposed that were saying well this is going to lead to that and this is going to lead to that and guess what they were right okay so now we have legitimate normalization of pedophilia happening all across the world all right by these countries that are tied into the global globalist agenda in Europe they argue for people who are under the age of fucking eight years old to have sexual consent with adults in Spain they did that we got that we played the video over on the show okay if you continue to push on parents like this and you continue to say that parents don't have the rights and you continue to take their tax dollars and and and use them against them it's only a matter of time before there's violence and these people who are doing it like this lady or anybody else who think they're above the fucking bro they they've forgotten that they have names and addresses and it's not going to fucking be long before you know men who do not want their kids indoctrinated by crazy fucking communists are going to realize that the only way to save their children is to fucking remove these people from society this is what's happened this has happened every fucking time that communists have gotten in control of anything it's like doing this and if we want to look if we want to look into one of the causes of what happened in world war two i'm not saying the main cause but if you want to look into one of them one of them was this okay it was the vi-mar republic it was the reaction to the vi-mar republic by normal citizens okay they don't want their kids fucked with they they went the what the vi-mar republic went even way further than this you had mom and daughter prostitution you had child prostitution in Berlin you had all this crazy shit happening this immoral shit and eventually what started happening was citizens started attacking these people in the streets okay like pulling them straight out of their fucking businesses and hanging them in the street that that every time communism is taken over and this progressive immorality has started to infect society this is what has happened okay so this is going to happen here too these people believe that they are above the law or they are protected by some invisible force field bro there's no invisible force field to protect these people there's fucking 350 million motherfucking americans half of which more than half of which because they've lied about the data okay three quarters of which fucking hate this shit and like bro these people are so high in mighty and so ignorant and so aloof that they don't even realize the danger they're stepping into by fucking with people's kids it's so crazy too because i want to show you this clip so this is the attorney arguing in favor of this shit right trying to protect the school board personally i think he needs to have this fucking hard drive check yeah that's is that his page that's that's his picture up there so like the supreme court here is a not videotape there's audio recorded right is that him in the no no no no no no but this so this is the book you guys got to watch this on youtube this is the book one of the books in question called pride puppy right and so he's about to go you about to hear an exchange between him and justice gorsuch over this this particular book and the content of it and listen to just listen to this shit so pride puppy was the book that was used for the pre-cindergarten curriculum that's no that's the one where they're supposed to look for the leather and things and bondage things like that it's not bondage it's a woman in a leather sex worker right no no i don't i i gosh i i read it drag drag drag drag the leather that they're pointing to is a woman in a leather jacket and one of the words is drag queen and they're supposed to look for those it is an option at the end yeah okay first of all do you hear his fucking voice right that motherfucker definitely needs his fucking hard drive chair for four sure looks like you like some bagels too it's just observation it you know what it looks like to me it looks like the product of fucking removing testosterone from the fucking male you remove testosterone for males for 25 years and this is what the fuck you end up with did gay frogs dude real shit it's real no that's all real shit real you have estrogenic fat patterns on men okay fat hips fat legs like like a bigger woman would have you have fucking titties on men the cancels you have you have like look dude a fat what's a fat guy look like with test high testosterone he looks like he's got a belly he's fucking still looks like a dude but he's kind of like just fat right yeah like you and me when we're fat yeah not being real yeah okay I'm not picking on you when when I was 300 fucking plus pounds I mean I've had I was fat but I didn't have big fat ass and hips and shit that comes from high estrogen levels and people's fucking and men okay so it's fat distribution it's estrogenic fat pattern we see all that that's what we see go to fucking Walmart right now and look at men who are between the ages of 20 uh between 30 and 40 that are overweight and look where they're carrying their fucking fat okay we've removed testosterone from fucking men the average male right now that's 20 years old compared to the average male that was 20 years old in the year 2000 the average male is 20 year olds now has the the testosterone of a 60 year old man in the year 2000 that's going to affect how you think it's gonna affect how your body reacts it's gonna affect your emotions and it's going to affect your sexual being right so like look I'm tired of it I think we also have a problem with that I dude everybody's tired of it you know I like look imagine her smiling in your like this is the kind of person you never talk to someone who's like delivering some like like some sort of like bad news to you but they smile when they're doing it they like DJ now I know you understand that we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and teach your kids how to read these sexual books you know and they fucking that's what she does all these fucking people do this they all do it they're they're they're elitist they think they can say whatever the fuck they want they think they have they think dude this is it's communism shit they think they have control over your children it might even be satanic shit honestly yeah like that's where it's starting across the line about evil it's evil is fucked dude I just can't imagine a man or a woman having kids and allowing this shit I fucking I can't relate to somebody like that no not at all man guys jump in on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think of that being said let's get to our final headline let's talk about some good Americans so it's probably good I don't have kids you know I'm saying yeah dude it makes me angry it makes me angry for people with kids yeah you know like I

the most damage is the national media has completely ignored this amazing contribution from the Amish these people deserve praise for their help let's check this out we work mostly in chimney rocks I'm down in that cave these volunteers are members of the great needs trust an Amish community in Pennsylvania offering not just their skilled hands in their time but their compassion as well we wanted to help the people that had the disaster yeah our heart just felt drawn to come help since the storm more than 2000 volunteers have stepped in to help rebuild and donations have poured in kindness from strangers helping their neighbors all of the building material that's going into rebuilding these stores has been donated up to this point and it's just been a tremendous recovery story

we have thumbs up for dumbest fuck this is what we bring a headline in we talk about it it'll get one of those two options that being said our thumbs up this is a good one my thumbs up for dumbest fuck headline reads man trex 53 miles in bird costume to raise awareness about endangered species okay um his name is Matt traveling I mean 46 walk the distance dressed as his favorite bird the Eurasian curlou which is an endangered in the United Kingdom the DIY costume was three yards long and made I was made out of split bamboo muslin and poly stirring the farming and protected landscapes officer walked with his friends and family around the knitterdale way route in the Yorkshire Dales and support for conservation projects so Matt said the curlou is my favorite bird and I've been satin as their numbers have reduced massively around the UK quote they have such a beautiful song it pulls at your hearts it was great to hear at whilst walking the awareness raising adventure so this is a picture of Matt here and the bird costume it's actually pretty cool but Matt Mat hopes his walk inspires people to get involved with local conservation and engage in nature responsibly he said quote it would be great if people were able to contact with nature by being careful when engaging and enjoying if we were to lose the curlou we would lose a rich part of our wildlife and British culture um yeah so that that was Matt now apparently there is an invasive species called the South American Curlou that uh that has been coming into Britain by a few different ways they these these these these these invasive species have been coming in by boats and buses I don't think out of a Middle Eastern version of that Middle Eastern curvy is a not jerlou and an African curlou right yep that have been coming in and swarms and droves I mean how about raising awareness for that got protect the British culture man you have those those South American curlou's they're done they're moving they're done moving this is the picture of the actual bird yeah it looks like a British okay well it does look like a British bird it looks like it would have some fucking bullshit condescending accent that bird fucking thinks it's smarter than you yeah for sure because he talks with an accent why is it that all British people think that they're smart because they have a fucking accent what is that just because you have an accent bro doesn't mean you're smart you know and they all try to talk like like real quiet and like Sean Connery-ish I mean I get it you're using what works for you but it doesn't equate to intelligence well not all British people have that accent yeah that's right well did you see the fucking uh did you see the comment that was made over there by uh the I guess the prime minister or whatever he's called and he said we thank the we thank Christians for their contribution to our country bro what are you talking about that fucking is the Christian country you know I'm saying like people went crazy over but not crazy enough to fix problem yeah but I actually like London a lot in England a lot I think it's a great oh it's fucking cool never been expensive it's a great time to go it's cool yeah well and you never see it like I saw it when I went it was actually like London it was actually cool yeah there was English people there um now no not as much yeah but uh you know that's what happens when you take away people's guns true uh I don't know man hmm are you for effort yeah I you know it does look like I'd be real I don't care I don't care your walk for 53 miles didn't make me care about that bird I think they should have a better strategy yeah like why don't you why don't you you should get in the red bull contest we're like they fucking fly no dude why don't you like open a sanctuary for those birds and let people come and see them and like you know like bro I never really like ducks until I had some yeah now I fucking love ducks yeah I'm sure you know like dude I was gonna go duck hunting with uh Bradley Gilbert and all the guys and then I got some ducks and I'm like they're like very intelligent little animals so now I can't do it I don't know apparently there's still like 60,000 of these curloughs there left you're Asian curlue getting taken away by the all the other curloughs coming you know you had to probably eat them you remember when those Haitians were killing the ducks yeah bro they're eating the ducks yeah they're eating the cats that kill that that song bro that's a good song yeah man all right man with guys Andy that's all right guys be careful out there not everybody's as smart as they sound don't be a hoe
