moments for you all right cool that's not so easy and Andy guys question number one Andy words can't explain how much I really appreciate all that you do I've gained so much perspective from listening to you and I've been putting in the work through your show I have come to realize that I am a libertarian I'm a former liberal personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion my only hang up is I truly feel that if enough people came to that same conclusion we really wouldn't need the government at all or at least how it's pictured currently now I know your stance is a little different you believe that we should have some level of government so can you explain that or further break down what the government should and would look like and their role in our lives after our cultural revolution well first of all that's an amazing statement and question I appreciate that very much you know when we first started talking about these things in 2019 after a number of years running in an entrepreneurship only podcast I got a lot of pushback from you guys that were quote unquote liberal right like you guys were a little surprised that I lean right instead of leaning to the garbage that you all believed in right and now you're starting to wake up that like hey this is this is actually more than what we thought it was right it's not just live and let live there's an agenda play that's literally taking things from us and destroying our culture destroying our next generation and I'm happy to see people waking up to that I am also pretty libertarian and I do believe that there needs to be some sort of structure government you know my biggest gripe with the libertarians in general is that their actual policies and the things they claim that they want are actually unrealistic in real life and the reason I know they're unrealistic in real life is because I've spent my whole life actually managing human beings and building things and so a lot of these people who are the big voices in the libertarian party they have these great theories but I can identify very simply from my experience that those theories will not work and so this theory that we need no government it's a great theory right it's a great theory yeah it's a great theory and I agree with it like if everybody did live to a higher standard and everybody handled their own shit yeah ideally we wouldn't need that right but to get to that point we're talking about many generations of literal teaching and upbringing and sharing of value systems to get there right you have a lot of people right now who don't care about their own children you have a lot of people that don't care about anything but themselves we have a lot of people that don't care about being excellent at all they care about what they can take from everybody so that has to have that takes time to remove from society through cultural standard you know application so when we think about like what it would actually look like I actually believe that you know the government exists to protect our rights and to protect our sovereignty as citizens and also physically protect us from outside forces right other aggressive countries help us in natural disasters step in when we need them but have very little control over our day-to-day life and the very little control I'm talking about is not you know no government it's it's leave us alone let us give you well little of our money for tax like 10% okay and we all pay it the guy who makes 20 grand a year pays it the guy who makes 200 grand a year pays it the guy who makes 20 million a year pays it the company that makes a billion a year they pay it everybody pays it if everybody paid their 10% it would solve a major problem going on in this country because right now the biggest corporations despite what they try to make you believe don't really pay any tax and that's not my companies that's the big the biggest ones okay we're talking yeah yeah you guys they train you to hate people like me and say that the problem is created by entrepreneurs and people like me when in reality it's the companies that are acquiring companies like my companies that are actually not paying their share okay so when we talk about everybody paying that that resolves a big issue where right now the tax burden is saddled mainly on the middle-class people who have the least amount of room to actually carry that that tax burden all right so we're we're oppressed financially as a country and it's not because these guys are just tyrants it's because they understand something that we're not able to understand which is this if we are constantly worried and constantly in a state of stress about how we're going to survive and how we're going to pay our bills and how we're going to grow what we're trying to grow and they make it just hard enough right if they make and they have it perfect bro they have it right in that perfect zone where it's like almost impossible to win but you can still win if you give everything in your life to it and that's not how it should be how it should be is we should be able to run our businesses have a family have a life pay way less tax have far less stress and the reason they do this is for a couple reasons one they want us to be financially stressed because if we become too financially powerful we threaten their power matrix all right and two if we're constantly stressed about our own personal finance situation then it's hard for us to follow what they're doing to fuck us all over all right so that's what we're dealing with here so we think of like what government should have as a role I think the government I think that we should all pay 10% tax I think that the government should I think these people should not be allowed to lobby in any way shape or form I don't think they should be able to trade inside or trade with any companies at all I think any law that they pass should also apply to them and members of Congress equally as it does its citizens these are all things that are not happening we should have term limits we should have situations where you know basically we return the country to a place where it's run by the citizens of this country not a group of people who are exempt from all the rules and all the laws if they had to follow the rules and the laws up there in Washington D.C. the way that we had to they wouldn't pass some of this shit right but but they're immune to it so they don't care it's they see see our biggest mistake is we're not seeing it for what it is it's us the people versus them the tyrants and they are very clear on that they know it's them versus us like in their little backdoor meetings they understand we're the peasants and they're them all right so we're failing to get to the point of understanding of who we are in this equation which is causing a lot of problems but you know to wrap this up dude you know look if we had a smaller government the main thing they're made responsibilities would be to you know take the 10% tax that we have not steal it not allow it to be funneled out into political donations to actually spend it on America first solving the problems here in this country term limits equal laws that they pass protect us from China protect us from aggressors and basically mind their own fucking business that's what it should be so that's how I see the government as as a realistic solution right say abolish the government no government okay so we're gonna we're gonna run it like the wild-wild west are you comfortable carrying a gun everywhere you go because I do I carry a gun every day I've carried a gun every single day since 2003 when I was stabbed in the face okay I'm very comfortable carrying a gun a lot of you guys aren't and I can tell by the way that you react when you see me carrying a gun you know like yeah so like are you guys ready for this wild-wild west are you capable of defending yourself I am if that's what you want I'm cool with that but I don't think most people are cool with that most people want some sort of structure some sort of protection some sort of peace of mind so that they can live their life and they can prosper and move down the path you know that we've all been sold which is that you know the American dream well I think that's that's one thing that I think libertarians forget like the government you know the only well what how I look at it as you know those rules in place the restrictions of you will or the stripping of freedoms like that's not for the law-abiding citizens that is like there's going to be a percentage of the population that won't get with the program always and so you know there has to be some type of something in place for those people yeah 100% I want to actually question on this tax thing is it safe to say you know when you talk about the tax structure and how it's put up and how it's made the middle class how it how it's just enough right is it safe to say that like it's it's to the point where you know if you are a person that's willing to do unethical things and you're allowed to go up that ladder and everything's possible you join that group but the good-hearted people who still hold those more values they get fucking squished and eventually down push down the ladder completely is that like is that a safe assessment because most I don't think most people really truly get how that looks like I don't think most people know how to balance their own checkbook or their own personal finances they don't teach that school for a reason the reason they don't teach you practical household finance management in high school is because they want your finances to be a fucking mess because their debt our debt is their asset what what we owe they make alright and so when we talk about like all these things that they continue to do right like when things get bad like these stimulus programs right understand there all that is is them putting us in more debt it's alone it's giving them more power and more control over us and if we were truly a free country and we truly had competent leadership the stimulus what should actually be the stimulus is a massive tax cut to 10% for make everybody pay it no exemptions and then also there should be a debt wiping of people's personal debt and make these banks take the stimulus on their chin for once in a while okay like what would it we have this collapsing financial system right and we have all these people making hundreds of billions trillions of dollars off of the plight of the American person and the solution is let's send them an extra seven hundred dollars or let's send them an extra two grand when COVID hits how about this how about your wipe a hundred thousand dollars of personal debt and business debt off the table for every single citizen in this country and then we kind of re-level the playing field that's an actual solution but when you say that you know nobody wants to do that because they're all on the take they're all plugged into it okay if they're gonna why would they give us stimulus if it's putting us in more debt and causing inflation when in reality if we really wanted to solve the problem we would just wipe the debt off their books and then lower taxes see that's what a business owner understands that a fucking hypothetical libertarian mouthpiece on the internet doesn't that's how it should be done it's just fucked up because of people and I like libertarians bro like they're my people but like some of you guys you can't get taken seriously because there's no practical application for the systems that are required to do what it is you're trying to do you're not gonna take it to this extreme level that's unpalatable to people like people don't think like man I want to walk down the street with my AR like for real like some of you guys do they don't think that they want to be safe bro they want to they want to go to the park they want to be left alone they don't want to get drive-by shootings they want criminals and fucking jail they want pedophiles in the woodchipper bro like that's what people want and that's what we should give them yeah that's real shit man our guys Andy question number two mr. forcella oh this is the new with mr. forcella I'm somebody that naturally feeds off of other people's energy if I go to a gym where everybody's getting after it and there's a lot of intensity I feel an extra push to work hard and have a kick-ass day on the contrary if I find myself in a negative situation where people don't have positive attitudes where there isn't the kind of vibe that I'm looking for I find myself subconsciously feeding off of that as well I find myself being more negative until it wears off as I adopt the idea that whatever the circumstances are what I need to get done is going to get done how do you keep your energy protected when maybe you aren't talking to somebody with great ambitions and keep a bad 10 minutes or so from turning into a bad day oh man well there's a lot to this first off I understand that because my biggest pet peeve in my entire life and the thing that makes me the most miserable as a human being is being around people who are complacent who lack urgency who don't want to win I cannot fucking stand it it drives me insane okay like it makes me insane I get physically fucking angry about it real talk okay I cannot be around it I'm a fucking high-level human being if you're not if you're not a high-level human being if you're not in the game if you're not fucking I what we're doing this and we're gonna go as hard as we fucking can and you're not playing to win the motherfucking Super Bowl I can't operate with you like I can't even be around you so I understand that a couple things one you need to identify that you're living in a reactive state all right you're you're choosing to allow people to have power over you instead of being the person who supplies the power to everybody else and this is what the difference is between someone who has one of these charismatic magnetic ultra-likeable personalities and pretty much everybody else a lot of you guys ask about charisma and confidence and all these things that people appear to have but what you're really observing is someone that actually being the source of energy as opposed to being the receiver of energy so right now you're the receiver of energy you are someone who is going to change according to what the environment is and you need to work to become someone who changes the environment when you walk into the room we've all heard this many times right how many times do we hear you say about somebody bro you know when that dude walks in the room you know when that lady walks in the room she's fucking here okay if you want to have that presence and you want to be that kind of person you have to be the kind of person that changes the energy and that means that you can no longer allow people to affect you when they have negative energy and you have to continue being you and that takes discipline that takes practical thought especially in the beginning and eventually it just becomes who you are and how you operate all right so there's that but the main thing here is this you should always work to be around people who are aligned with what you're trying to do in the ambitions that you have you should I talked about this in the Nanyagram just a few days ago you have to cut out anything else this is a hard journey what you're doing is hard most people aren't doing it in fact 99% of people are not on the same path as you if you're listening to this show right now there's a good chance that you're on the hardest path possible for your life and that means that 99% 99 out of 100 9 out of 10 people that you interact with on a daily basis are not going to get it they are not going to understand they are not going to approve they're gonna be uncomfortable they're gonna feel strange because they're surrounded by someone like you that is alien to them they can't figure out why they're not like that and they see you going out and doing all of these things working to create the best possible version of you to build something special and they inherently understand that they aren't and they know what that's going to produce so yes they're going to hate you a little bit yes they're going to talk shit yes they're going to try to convince you to be like them and you know what you have to do you have to ignore it all and you have to keep moving and you have to remember that those people are those people for a fucking reason and you're you for a reason okay so think about it like that anything that doesn't contribute anything that doesn't push you forward anything that you feel like you're having to carry that doesn't belong you have to cut it out because guys here's what people miss the journey is so hard and so competitive and there's so many people out here trying to do what it is that you do that if you don't cut that weight you legitimately cannot compete at the highest level because everybody else at the higher level is fucking great too okay so are you gonna go play a Super Bowl game with your mom on your back or your dad can you go play a football game right now against the best football players in the world with your mom on your back saying hey I don't believe in your football dreams you can't do it it's impossible and that counts for emotional energy too so like do we have to thin the herd we can't allow access like that there's a reason why high-performing people don't have lots and lots and lots of people around them okay you guys think it's because and this is what the losers always say they saying well you know they just got too big they forgot where they came no I know exactly where I came from and I'm trying to get the fuck away from it okay that's the reason like it's not this this people like to throw this shade on people who are trying to like just free themselves to be effective at what they do as if it's some sort of you know morally wrong thing to do well I don't know is it morally wrong because I don't know I've created quite a few fucking careers in my day you know I'm saying none of those people that were fucking telling me to get realistic and get a real job and calm down and you know be more like them and take it easy how many jobs did they create oh that's right fucking none okay so like you cannot compete at the highest level or at even a high level carrying all this shit that comes from your old life it's impossible bro no drama no gossip no fucking losers no low ambition no non-urgent people you know we have this movement and the world about not everything's urgent yeah you're right if you're not gonna win not everything's urgent but if you're gonna win it's gonna take urgency it's gonna take urgent action that's reality you can't afford to be selectively urgent when you're trying to win at the highest level yeah well one thing we've talked about two before it's like you you described it as like this energy bank like a battery sale like there's only so much of it you have so if you're gonna waste even 10% 20% on right dealing with negative bullshit it's how can you win you can okay so so let's talk about this this is an important point people like to call driven people arrogant all right well how arrogant are you that you believe that you could compete at the highest level with all this other bullshit on their back all this drama all this gossip all these non-believers all these hangerons from the old days all this negativity that your social life provides right the girls the fucking bullshit all the bullshit how do you think you're going to compete against someone like me who has cut all of that shit out now you want to talk about arrogance so you're that good so you're that good so you're so good that you could carry all of this shit and you can go out and and play the game and you could beat someone like me not me there's there's millions of me okay with carrying all that it's impossible can't do it all right and if you think you can it shows your arrogance can't do it okay so answer the question is all of those things yeah I love it yeah I'm talking about it guys Andy are third and final question Andy question number three Andy curious what do you think about I have a key employee that left without warning she wouldn't take more money to stay just said she needed to change she left for six months and now she wants to come back a part of me wants to give her grace and she was you know she was important to our team the other part says she didn't believe in the dream and left us hanging in a way and we're doing great without her what you take on this I wouldn't hire back no higher back no there's too much of a risk to be a cultural impact in a negative way you know it's it I've hired people back who have left but it was always under the circumstances there was good circumstances when they left right it wasn't there was no burn bridge no not at all and by the way when people leave I hope they win I hope they kick ass I want them to do well because what better testament to what they learned while they were here then for them to go out and do well right so like we want these people to win but in certain circumstances when culture has been negatively affected under the circumstances of how someone left it's probably not a good idea to bring them back now there is a flip side for that there is a flip side for that the flip side is sometimes people leave they go out and they realize oh shit I really fucked up and in those situations sometimes it does work out I have a number of people here who have left and come back who are some of my best absolute best people but I have learned that that works out far less in that direction than it does the other direction where people come back they they get comfortable right away and they go back to their old habits right I don't know it's it's a toss up dude I mean there's there's nuance to everything there's exceptions to everything but you know generally it's it's just not a good idea to bring someone back like that how much how much responsibility do you think a business owner should take in trying to figure out like why this person left like you it seems like to me was just trying to throw money at the at the problem it's like you know like how much look I think there's situations where you can learn a lot there's situations where people just want to leave and they want to go do something different and that's okay then there's situations where they don't believe I don't know that this sounds like she doesn't believe it sounds like maybe she was going through something else maybe she just wanted to do something else maybe she wanted to try something else I'm not against that either it's just highly risky to bring someone back it sends a wrong message when they leave right and if you're doing well without the person it doesn't really make sense you don't want to fuck up something that's already working so what is that with the young kids man like this whole like let me go find my life and well it's the internet you know the internet culture right now for young people is highly misaligned with reality right they your 20s and your 30s are your chance to build something with your life they are not the chance for you to go live your life and we have these people out here saying go live your life when you're in 20s and 30s cool all right that's fine but you can't be mad when you're 40 and you have to work at fucking Wendy's certain fucking fries because you didn't do anything for 20 fucking years all right and the problem is is that we have a lot of people who believe that somehow their life is going to just materialize later on into something that works with them wasting all this time and that's not that's not how it works it does not work that way okay if you want success and that's what this message is for this message is not for the new age hippie culture of I'm going to be a nomad and roam the world and that's not what I'm my message is not for those people like you shouldn't listen to me if that's what you want to do but I'm just telling you if that's what you want to do there's going to come a time where that price is paid and so the way it works is this is very simple you can pray pay the price now or you can pay the price later and the price now is going to look like hard work missing opportunities to hang out with your friends maybe missing a few of these experiences and by the way you can have amazing experiences is still be working really hard towards your goals I know that's a novel thought but you could still do that okay and then if you don't pay that price now the price you're going to pay later is working at Wendy's or working as a server or doing something your whole life that you hate doing because you have to do it to pay your rent and that that is absolute reality and a lot of these younger kids nowadays do not understand that because they see all of these gurus and all of these people online talking all this shit about how much their money they're making and you know these fake people stayed in the front of rented cars and you know renting private jets for photo shoots and like just fucking fake shit that is misleading an entire generation of people into literal lifetime slavery and so that's why I get so passionate about it because I know what it takes I know what's required and when these people come on there every day and they tell you you don't need to do this you know you just need to do this and you'll fund you make all this money and broke it's bullshit it's just bullshit it's total bullshit love it and it's ruining people's entire lives you dude this is something nobody talks about all right do you know what the percentage of people is that get to be 40 years old and regret their last 20 years because they didn't actually fucking invest in themselves it's it's most people it's not it's not it's not like 80% it's like 90 fucking 8% okay most people get to an age where they're like fuck I should have been doing this and now I'm too fucking old and by the way you're not too old if that's you there's plenty of time there's plenty of time but that regret hits people at their late 30s early 40s and it fucking smashes people most people never recover most people just accept it they become an alcoholic or a drunk or just a a fucking plea of a human being and they kind of give up on their lives and they live a little miserable tiny sad existence because they bought into all the shit right like they bought into the messaging of you know live your life enjoy your life you're only gonna live once you know why you work so hard take a break you know you don't need to do they bought it at some point in time and it ends up costing them it's so we're because like 20 years doesn't sound like a long time like people say it's not a long time but like that is a long time like that's a lot of time if you're using it for the right shit like you don't even need to put 20 years in anymore you know that's just we're talking I'm talking about me bro like I like this is I'm beyond most people's goals for their own success in life right like that's just real shit most people do not have the ambition to build a Nike level company like that's what I'm working on that's my project most people just want to make some money and and have a cool life and that's cool you could do that with fucking a couple years three or four years now like you know it's not 20 years so don't let that scare you my point is is that when your friends say hey let's go to the fucking lake this weekend every weekend or they go out and drink four nights a week and you just keep saying oh dude I'll pick it up tomorrow I pick it up tomorrow I pick it up tomorrow or I only live once or you know any of this other shit you're slowly but surely selling yourself into slavery later on in life and that is very real shit and a lot of young people don't like that right like like I see my videos going around the internet and people are like oh yeah this guy seems real angry and this is what hustle culture is about no bro I go home to my fucking ridiculous house like legitimately one of the nicest houses in the fucking world okay I have a great fucking life and you guys are gonna see it because I'm gonna start dropping content and maybe you'll start to understand that I'm not just some fucking like grind person like I have a great time like it's fun like this is an amazing thing like and I and by the way I've done all of you a disservice by not sharing that part of my life and Alex Ramose and Leyla her mosey pointed this out to me here at Summer Smash we were sitting in the locker room and Leyla said bro the problem that I always had because she was listener of the MS CEO the problem that I always had with MS CEO was I felt like I had to always be on and because of that I would I would end up getting burnt out and so they convinced me to literally show this other aspect of my life so like you guys will see it's fun as fuck like there's a whole bunch of shit that's super fun that you're not considering right it's not like I'm just sacrificing myself to do this you know what I'm saying and a lot of these young kids because they hear this shit over and over and over again they hear one of two messages they hear hustle and only exists for the hustle or they hear living a van and travel the world and live your life because none of it matters anyway and bro if you could zoom from this person who's living in the van right now 10 years ahead or 15 years ahead you're gonna end up finding one of the most miserable people in the world because they're having to they're having to do things to survive that they do not want to do like wealth and success and a foundation for your life is built when you're young regardless of what anybody says so it's a it's a big problem with culture bro and you know it's challenging because you know a lot of these kids they weren't raised like I was raised you know when I was raised dude like my dad gave me a fucking toy for scoring goals and soccer games you know what I'm saying like like if I scored a goal we went to Target and I got like a toy right like if if I fucking smash another kid or made an awesome play we went to I got rewarded okay yeah like dude like I was rewarded to win a lot of these kids grew up in the exact opposite environment these kids that are 20 to 25 years old right now they grew up in this fucking real friendly you know participation trophy era which is not reflective of reality and now they're out here in the world getting their fucking ass beat because they think that if they just show up that eventually you know the money and the success and all the shit is going to be there and that's not how it works being a good person being a person of character that's a great thing but if you don't have the skills and execution to move the needle bro you're not going anywhere and that's reality and young people need to understand this this is a real competition and real fucking life there is scarcity in terms of who gets to fucking enjoy the riches in the spoils there's only one super bowl champion every year and you know if you take that one super bowl champion what there's you know a couple thousand people in the organization right like there's only a few winners winning is scarce it's not guaranteed and it's not guaranteed for just showing up so you guys who are young like really listen to what I'm saying because the reason that you're struggling is because you were fed bad information that isn't in line with reality this is natural order bro the best people win the people who produce results win the people who execute and get better and better and better win and everybody else does not win that is fucking reality and that's most people that is most people and I don't give a shit what the spiritual guides on the internet tell you bro what have they built what have they won what have they accomplished you can only buy into the philosophy that you want for yourself and this is why it's important for you guys to not listen to people who do not have the life that you are actually trying to create like it looks real good on the internet to wear a whole bunch of beads bro and run around my shirt off and fucking you know do all this adventure shit right like that looks real good until you look at the problems that those people have until you look at the struggles those people have until you look at the the lack of options that they actually have it's a big fucking deal dude and a lot of kids are buying into it bro and it's very very very bad and this is why we talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion those of you out here with kids those of you out here who are you know in your 30s you have a responsibility to step into the power of reality and to go win so that other people can recognize it because they've been clearly trying to remove this from society and we have to ask ourselves why are they trying to remove competition from society why are they trying to remove ambition and winning and success from society it's not because they it's not because they don't like it they like it for them they just don't like it for us they know it's correct they know that if you win enough and if we the people win enough we threaten their power base this is about control dude this is about control these ideological subversions that have happened over the last 20 years these are not an accident this is intentional this is they've tricked a whole generation of kids to believe that you get to win in life by showing the fuck up why did they do that well they did that so that because they know those people will lose they know those people will become indebted and they know those people will eventually become their slaves and that's why they do it and people are still sleeping on this so you can you listen to me or you can't but I'm gonna follow my advice and I'm gonna continue to go down that path because it's awesome and by the way subscribe to YouTube and you can see how awesome it is all right guys that was three man all right go pay the fee
