There's a book on there called the book on mental toughness and it will explain this programming detail plus a whole bunch of other things in terms of mental toughness and why we need it and how to use it and how to develop it and how to make it work for us in our lives We have this thing on the show we call the fee the fee is not monetary. I'm not going to ask you to buy anything Unless it's first form products. You should buy first form products very good products. But outside of that We ask very simply you're going to notice that we do not run ads on the show I'm not going to bend over for a advertiser money and Filter what I can and can't say which I'm pretty sure you guys notice compared to everybody else's show So So we have this little deal that we make with the audience and it's very simple If you give value out of the show we ask that you pay the fee that means if you like it If it makes you laugh it makes you think if it gives you a new perspective if it gives you some tactical information or how to be better If you think it's a perspective we're sharing we get traffic throttle and shadow band at every corner for obvious reasons So we don't get the message out there unless you share it so That's what we mean we say pay the fee and we have this little thing we like to say here and it goes like this Don't be a hoe show the show all right.

Yeah special Rooney because we got one of my favorite Guests that we've ever had and also a good friend of mine Not Matt Graham. What's up, buddy? What's going on? How are you? Very good very good is very cold here though. Yeah, yeah, I'm not used to that. I'm a Florida man Yeah, you are a Florida man. I'm Florida man. That's right, but you know Happy to be back happy to be back in the studio with you guys. So let's let's talk about some shit There's a lot of shit to talk about is there there is a Few things that came out there's a quiet a bit man listen guys like in real real shit This is gonna be one of those episodes where you're really gonna want to make sure you pay attention All right and stay with us and Let's get into it. But before we get to our main headlines I thought this was worth bringing up and worth seeing. I'm not I'm sure I know you've seen him I don't know if you've seen this Hell I means watch the fake Ramaswami destroys Poe reporter after she asked him to condemn white supremacy So during an event at which Steve King endorsed the fake Ramaswami reporter from the Washington post asked The Republican presidential candidate Who is not white whether he would publicly denounce white supremacy? Want Ramaswami refused to fall into her trap and instead delivered a master class in dealing with dishonest members of the media who desperately try Embat politicians into quote-unquote gotcha moment. So here's a video and let's talk about it You can say that you can done white supremacy. I'm not I'm not gonna recite some catechism for you I'm against vicious racial discrimination in this country So I'm not pledging allegiance to your new religion of modern wokeism which absolutely fits the test I'm not gonna bend the needy or religion. I'm sorry. I'm not asking you to bend the need of mine And I'm not gonna bend the needy years But do I condemn vicious racial discrimination? Yes, I do am I gonna play your silly game of gotcha No, I'm not and frankly this is why people have lost trust and I know you're gonna go print the headline tomorrow I already know this we already know how your game works The Kramaswami refuses to condemn white supremacy because you asked a stupid question The reality is I condemn vicious racial discrimination in this country But the kind of vicious and systematic racial discrimination we see today Is discrimination on the base of race in a very different direction You want to know what the best way is to end the discrimination on the base of race Stop discriminating on the basis of race do that and we're gonna move this country forward And I don't care whether you're black or white or brown or anything in between That's how we're gonna unite this country You people have been responsible for dividing this country to a breaking point Creating a projection of national division. I meet people from the south side of Chicago to meetings like this one of every shade of melanin Multiple romantic woman doesn't make a difference who are hungry for reviving unity in this country And you with your catechism that you try to get this politicians to whatever fake headline You're gonna print on the base of this conversation tomorrow That's what's dividing this country for a break to a breaking point shame on you Look people in the eye and tell them what you actually failed to tell them for the last five years Own the accountability for your own failures as the media That's how we rebuild trust in this country and until then I don't have a lot of patience to play the games Oh Sounds familiar. Yeah, I couldn't have said it any better myself. Yeah, no, I could have But Like dude, it's like real shit, man because like they try so but do you can do you denounce it but do you denounce it? Andy do you denounce it but do black lives matter but do they? I Just like that's all they always look like this so no one thinks for sure. They're always white Definitely to say that shit first of all let's talk about the white supremacy going on in the country You mean like how white people how white people up until like literally like three months ago when they revoked Um affirmative action at spring court level could literally be denied jobs because of their race even if they're more qualified You mean that white supremacy? What white supremacy we talking about are we talking about how it's not cool to be white and if you say white you get called YT on the internet and it's openly okay to discriminate against white people and say anything you want against white people But the minute white people say anything back against the other side they're so they're white supremacists and racist How are we talking about the white supremacy or white people can't even point out basic facts like the crime rate amongst black males in this country We're talking about that white what are we talking about what white supremacy we're talking about I think what you're referring to is anti-racism But yeah, yeah like um, it's the language game man. It's like a but like I said we got it is the good news man People are over. He's a hundred percent right bro. These people are just working every way that they possibly can To create a look These people are stupid Okay, we have to like legit let's take a step back and let's not get sucked into the outrage because it'd be very easy for me to go on it 45-minute rant about how this white supremacy is the biggest fucking lie in the whole entire country Okay, and it has been my whole life I haven't been able to say you know, hey, why why is it okay for them to have black entertainment television But if we had white entertainment television people will freak to fuck out and by the way Why people don't want white entertainment television like we there's double standards in society around race And there has been my entire life and there's things you can and you can't say as a white person And if you're not white you could say whatever to fuck you want nobody says shit All right, that's not white supremacy. That's actually the opposite of white supremacy That means that white people are the ones that are actually being censored and discriminated against based on their race But let's let's toss that aside because if you have an IQ over 80 which everybody in this fucking group does You know that that's obvious shit So how fucking stupid do you have to be like what at level of IQ do you have to have to legit judge people based around How tan they get when the sun comes out You know, say fucking mode. Yeah, like it's absurd shit Well, I mean people have to realize you like you make a great point not getting emotionally involved in it But like There is a serious like there is a dangerous thing about this narrative that they're trying to pop up into like a legitimate conflict in this country that they want to happen of course we can't allow that to have of cool listen Why do you think that they want black people and white people to fight like this? Because if we're fighting like this then we don't notice all the shit they're doing This is one of their only cards and it's not working anymore. No, it's not working anymore Like these people are trying to press this out and it doesn't work nobody's buying it Dude most black people are sick of it You know what I'm saying? Like we got a lot of people Yeah, but a large majority of that stuff Like what the people that are buying it are in front are unfortunately the most Mobilized people like there are the least intelligent But they're also the most willing to do something about me And so what you have is a bunch of people who don't buy it who think it's bullshit who are willing to say things on the internet But they're not actually willing to do anything in real life to make sure that we Don't have this perpetuating in the future, you know, so well, I think that's an example of real life Like in the front of the cameras in front of the world. We want to come back out But but it's it's gonna be it's gonna take a lot more than him. Yeah, I agree It's gonna take a lot more than one guy saying that, you know Well, bro, you know as well as I do that white people have been have been shamed and gilted and conditioned and not even be able to talk about race at all Oh, absolutely like it's not even a loud conversation until Recently when people like me have just gotten fed up and say fuck it. Yeah, we talk about it anyway For sure. I've seen many videos on the internet of like Somebody going around interviewing with one of those little microphones in the street asking an Indian person a black person a Mexican person Are you proud to be Mexican or you proud to be Indian or proud sure? Yeah, of course and then they get to a white person They're like, oh no, no, I'm not proud to be right, you know, it's just because they haven't tied their whole identity to their color No, we don't care more than that. It's way more than that. It's way more than that white people in this country grow up being told that There's something wrong with being white since they're little bitty kids and that started when I was a kid and I'm 44 You know, it's way worse now. You're only allowed to shit on white people. Yes, that's the only conversation that you're allowed to have You're not allowed to say any of the cool things that white people have done in history. Yeah, just the horrible things Yeah, like build the entire western civilization of thousand percent Let's create the greatest architecture all through Europe in the history of modern humanity can't say that Because if you say that, though, you know what they'll say back. Well, actually that was black people Or actually that was women or actually that was minorities from somewhere else. It was trans people. Yes, exactly No, every single statement that is made is meant to remove any sort of credit or relevancy or Contribution of the white race in humanity and that's just not true But it's also not true that everybody else was worthless like there's a like dude You if you go to China the Chinese people have built amazing things if you go to the Middle East Middle Eastern people have done amazing things wait You're saying Humans do cool things. Yeah, yeah, no, it's it's an absurd statement. It's actually racist Yeah, I'm offended. Yeah Humans all over the world every race gender whatever They have all done cool things and they've also done horrible things throughout history Yes, you can point to any race any gender any sexual orientation whatever There's been some cool people have done some really cool things and others who have done some really horrible things Yeah, and and good people and bad people of any race like this is basic This is basic common sense and we as Americans have to stop identifying our Pride based upon what we were born You know as a white guy I was never allowed. It's just like you pointed out. I was never allowed to say yeah, I'm proud to be white But the truth is I'm not I really don't give a fuck like I don't care about being white What they'll say to you is that the reason that you don't feel the pride is because you haven't been marginalized and you haven't been You know condemned or shamed for being a certain race But that's actually the opposite of the truth the truth is that was the case. It's okay because it's coming back Hahaha Well, listen dude Listen, I understand we had a hot news some on the show and he said that he's like well everything's for you guys No, it's not we can't even state simple facts without being called racist or getting people to cancel us and the truth of the matter is is that our identity as Americans should be built In what we are as a person not what we were bull like how weak are you to build your entire identity around something that you were born with. Weak. You know what I'm saying? Very weak. Yeah, but I'm just saying, like if that's all you have and that's what your sense of identity and pride comes from is what race you happen to be or what your heritage is, you haven't, you failed as a human being. They have nothing going on. Correct. So like people that are above loser level all understand this. Like people who are successful people they don't care about race. They don't talk. They don't think about these things and they think like what have I built? What have I done? What have I contributed? What have I accomplished? What have I created with my family? What kind of life am I living? And they build their identity around those things. But the media and the propaganda that we have especially here in the United States that is in line with globalist culture that comes from the head of the snake at the World Economic Forum. They put down racial division intentionally so that people won't even think about accomplishing any like there's a mo... there's depth to this. It's not just fight, fight, fight so we can steal and pillage and take everything and have no repercussions. It's also that if we convince you that your identity and the greatest thing about you is what you were born with, then what incentive do you have to create anything good? You see what I'm saying? So it's a weapon, dude, that we're not fully comprehending as a society. But if you simply want to understand what the solution to the problem to all of these things are, it is unity. And Vivek does know that. And I've spoken to him. I speak to him frequently. He's telling the truth and the reason that you don't have a... anybody in the government coming out and saying unity is because when unity happens, they lose their power. And so like, dude, we have to get smarter than what these people are. And I think people are getting smarter. But getting smarter requires uncomfortable conversations about factual data. Well, so this is my question, right? Because obviously I listen to the show and you talk about unity a lot. What does that in your mind actually look like? Right? Because we could all sit in the same room and agree on everything, right? But what does that mean? To me, it means us building our identity based... Now, this show is global, but I'm going to talk about America. When I look at the American flag, I believe in the American flag the way that it was intended to be believed in. Which is, that is a flag that represents all of us here in America, no matter what culture or what race you come from before, that come to this land that has rich and resources and opportunities. And we work together to create an American culture, which is a big problem that is a different conversation. But a big problem with the migrant crisis right now. Those people are bringing a different culture to America, not coming here to be part of American culture. And so when I think of American culture, I think of one of the greatest cultures that's ever existed in the history of humanity, because it's not one race, because it has diversity, because people can come here and they can be black or they can be white or they can be Asian and they can still be American. And that's something that people don't understand, did not exist anywhere until America existed. Right. But they have to subject themselves to a certain set of values. Yes. Like not touching little kids. I think we're also going to speak the truth, bro. Like you got like you have to exercise your rights. I have to. The truth is when there is somebody where they're told mine or like physically in your face, right? And they are spewing bullshit. And you know, it's bullshit. Call them out. Yes. On the bullshit. You cannot. So that when you were talking earlier, I was thinking this, you know, the the problem and how this has gotten out of hand is because for the last 10 years, smart people have been like, this person's an idiot. Nobody believes that. Let him say whatever they're going to say, who fucking cares, they're a loser anyway. And we've all deferred and deflected that shit and ignored it too long. And it's become a thing now. And you know, I think like, can you believe that? Well, I mean, shit, what do you expect? I guess so tired of hearing that, bro. What do you? I guess so tired of hearing from conservative influencers. He believed this is happening. Yes, bro. You've been saying the same thing for four years. Now you've run like 70 different runs of t shirts and made a whole bunch of money. How about you start organizing your, your little tribe and some solutions? So this is, so this is why I asked the question, right? Because I think unity, when people think of unity, I think people imagine just like everybody like agreeing that this is all crazy and whatnot. It's like, okay, well, that's cool. We can all agree. And I think, I think all the people that we would want to unify with, apart from the progressive left, all the people that we would want to unify with, we're all kind of already on the same page. Like, like, if, if most, if you're not woken up to what's going on in the world by now, then you're probably not going to be, you're done. Right. You're probably not going to figure it out. And so it sounds like we have the people. We have the numbers. Okay, what do we do? Well, I can't give away the plan. Well, I'm not saying to give it but that's just a rhetorical question. Right. It's just, we have to listen. We, first thing we have to do is what we talk about here on the show all the time. And what you talk about in your content all the time, which is amazing. If you're not following that, you should follow him. He's not Matt Graham. I think everywhere. Okay. Some of the best content on the internet. You and I talk about the same things. The, the solution to this problem outside of what it's going to take this year in terms of some other things. And I'm not talking about violence, just to clarify. But the real solution long term is personal responsibility to live the values that you believe represent what America should be and look like. And if we don't as individuals accept the responsibility that we have as a citizen of this country to live at the highest standard possible and exercise our rights at the maximum capacity that we can, these things like rights and freedoms, these things don't exist unless we exercise them. So where we start to get America back on track is by living what we believe a real American should be every single day, not just on our Instagram, not just in our content, but in our life. And so that does include things like when people are doing some crazy shit, you got to say something. When people are saying crazy shit, we got to say something. These people have been given a pass for far too long because we don't want to get annoyed or frustrated with dealing with them. Or we don't want to hurt their feelings. Well, they have no problem hurting your feelings. In fact, they have no problem doing a whole lot more than that. And if we want to look back at the history of where this comes from, it's rooted in Marxism and Marxist over the history of time have been the most brutal vicious violent killing machine in the history of humanity. So if you think that they're going to stop and just because you leave alone, you're completely wrong. Eventually, they're going to come and take everything from you. They're going to take your property from you. They're going to take your life from you. And this is reality. This is what the alternative is. The choices are stand up, being American, exercise your rights as an American, live the example that you can or defer that example of America to be built by people who are of a complete different mindset. And if we're being completely honest, these are the losers of the world. These are the non creators. These are the unfortunately unattractive people. These are the nerds. These are the these are the unattractive people. These are the the people who cannot get control of their own discipline in their own lives or create anything. And they hate you because you're able to. And if you let them because you're being polite and croat on you any further, they will end up killing you. And that's what's happened in history. So it's we this is the time we can either stand up and live it or we can be conquered by people who literally couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag. And all they have done is call you names. Yep. I think if if you're listening to this and you are observing the craziness in the world and you acknowledge that it's crazy, that's not enough. And if you tell all your friends that it's crazy, that's not enough. And if you like you have to actually be the antithesis of what these people want you to be. They want you to be scared. They want you to be demoralized. They want you to be connected like they like and they want you to be plugged in. They want you to watch their news and be afraid of what they say and eat and eat their I mean you say it all the time. I'm basically I'm basically. No, it's the same keep going. No, the same thing dude. Right. It's the same. They want to sick. They want to stack. They want us mega consuming. They're like, this is a this is not just a couple. Look, what this is is this is the very richest, most elite, powerful people in the world manipulating the unfortunate class to believe that they are going to somehow live in some wealth utopia. And they are going to have all the things that the people that they are jealous of and that they hate have if they support this crazy shit. And so like we have to understand there is no limit to what they're willing to take from us. The limit will be when we draw the line in the sand. We say no, which I have no problem doing. I actually fucking enjoy it. Like one of my greatest parts of my day is every day coming in here talking shit to these fucking posties. I can't I fucking can't love it anymore. Because dude, no matter what you say about me, no matter what you say about me on the internet, you can love me, you can hate me, you can talk shit, whatever. I'm not a bitch. And that's on record. And if every American had that attitude, like fuck you, that I like to refer to it as the kid rock attitude. Okay. Because like when I think of kid rock, I think of like fuck you, right? Like everybody had that American attitude of like fuck off, bro. They wouldn't even be here. Right. But we make the mistake of trying to negotiate with these people and reason with these people do not want to reason with you. They do not want to negotiate with you. You have what they want that and it's shit they can never have because they're not willing to stand up and actually take responsibility for themselves. And this is going to go on. This is what the migration crisis is about. This is class warfare. This is about the have-nots versus the haves. And they are trying to flood the country to make the point to make the population so overwhelmingly unfortunate class and have nots that they want to kill the elite ruling class. And if you want to and by the way, that's not the actual elite ruling class. That's their perceived rule. It's the guy with the BMW in the nice house down the street from you. Like that's who they want people to see the problem as well. They're the only threat because they demonstrate enough ambition enough ambition and enough taking action that if they were to take that skill of taking action and point it in their direction, then they would be a problem. Bro, one of the cool things is if you really flip this on its side and like look at it, is that there's still people out here building amazing lives. There's still people, the America dream is on life support. And there's still people out here winning at mass scale, which is a testament to how amazing this country actually is. This country is so amazing that for the last 20 years, these people have done every single thing that they fucking can to villainize winning, create victim culture, demonize people who have ambition and want to go out and achieve things. And people are still dominating. Like there's still people out here that are just crushing. And while it may not be you, you should take that as an indicator that the opportunity is there regardless of the noise. And imagine what that opportunity to look like if we didn't have all these issues. Right. Dude, exactly. It's the it's the it's the cost of entry. The cost of entry to having a better life requires a hundred times the work than it would in a country where you know, things aren't hyperinflated in it. And single family, a single income home can own a home and have money left over like, you know, the way it was 50, 60 years ago. Well, it could be so much easier and better to have the American dream. But people people just the system is so confusing to most people. You know, remember, most people don't know how to balance a bank account. They don't know how to do basic budgeting. They don't know how to like say, okay, I'm spending this much money. And I make this much. They don't know how to do that intentionally. You know, they're intentionally propagated with consumerism, which by the way, I'm an extreme capitalist. But at the same time, there's responsible ways to consume in your life. And these people don't even understand those basic skills of life. So how can you expect them to understand, you know, the intricacies of our system and the way it works? They can't. Can't do it. Right. So we're dealing with low intelligence people who have been bred to believe their intelligent because they survived an indoctrinated education system whose whole goal is to make little worker robots that are ignorant to the way things actually work. So they can continue to manipulate the system and the people of this country over and over and over again for as long as it takes the dumbest people think they're the smartest and the smartest people don't think they're that smart. That's correct. That's correct. It's a Dunning Krueger effect. Yeah. Well, guys, let's keep this cruise moving. Yeah, we got some good headlines. I like Matt when he comes on the show because he makes me smarter. DJ, you don't do that, bro. That's racist. I'll do better. That's racist. I will do better. Eddie. I'll do better. Um, guys, remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, headlines, videos, articles, links, go to 80 for seller.com and guys can find them. Link there. I was that big set. Let's you know, maybe funny or either. Well, I mean, I'm working on myself here. Yeah. I'm saying, I'm trying to, you know, I got it. So I'm going to personally, New Year's New Year's New Me, per your personal way. Success. What do you think? I'd be selfless. Selfish to be selfless. That's true. That is true. I'm so, I'm still trying to, you're in that selfish face. I'm trying. I got it. I'm trying, man. I got it. But, uh, of course, we got to talk about it. We got to headline number one, guys. Let's just admire these graphics. Let's get that. Let's take a couple of seconds. Yeah. I heard a guy named Steve did that. Yeah, Steve did do that. Steve's amazing. That field looks familiar. Moving on. The fuck out of here. We got Epstein. Man, let's talk about it. Epstein list comes out. Uh, this headline reads first. We got a little shameless plug. All right. Daily, Daily Mail has been doing a great job on these articles. Ready? They've been doing a really, really good job on them. Now, those are the Europe guys. Well, you're peeing guys, man. Yeah. Over there in the UK, getting their bangers and mash. Banger's of my ass. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A little waltz. Ba-o-o-waltz. Yeah. That's pretty good. That was, the second part was good. The first part was just a little ba-o-o-waltz. Yeah. They've been doing a great job. Let's say, I got to be real. Like, I know you guys over there in England, you guys made up the language, but you suck at school. You get back to the basics, brother. Isn't it? Yeah. I can do a pretty good British accent, though. What? Yeah. Okay. No, not really. Yeah. I'll read the whole, I will do the entire CTR in a British accent. That is actually pretty, that's pretty solid. That's all right. Well, you got Ba-o-o. No. All right. I'll read my fault. I'll stay in my lane. I know my strengths. Yeah. All right. That's right. Inmitation of language is not my strength. I mean, everything to come Black accent. Everything that comes out of our mouth sounds like some Mexican shit. Like, I do Chinese, it's Mexican. It's fucking Spanish. Yeah. Oh, you can speak Spanish a little bit, right? A little bit. Yeah. Yeah. That's a little fun fact about the Andy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Pocito. Yo, does this Pocito? DJ's P.P. DJ says he wants to fact check on that. Yeah. You fact check that. There works. I know that. Let's get into these headlines. I mean, Epstein shit. We got to talk about it. The A-list stars, politicians and leading figures named in the Jeffrey Epstein files. Prince Andrew Bill Clinton, Naomi Campbell, Leonardo DiCaprio, a more or a long famous faces and bombshell 1000 page document. Now, there's a couple of disclaimers we got to put out. We'll put them out. I'm just so we're all on the same page. A couple of interesting things happened. So yesterday around 6 p.m. Central time, when they tried to upload this, I guess, to the main website, court listener, the website crash. There was a lot of weird things going around. But at the end of the day, I would say that, you know, out of the 170 plus names or so, you know, a lot of them were actually kind of recused almost, right? Like they were kind of like, excused from the bullshit, right? But there are some that we should focus in on. We should definitely mean. I mean, how like, are you talking about how the left keeps saying that Donald Trump's on the list and every single headline and he's on the list where the woman is confirming that he was not part of the fuckery. Correct. Yeah. 100%. Are you meeting like how there's AI photographs this morning being put out about Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein with these girls on them? Yeah, like that one right there. That's exactly the one I was thinking about. So this is this is the shit that people, this is the shit these people are doing. So instead of saying, holy shit, people that we believe on our side are down there doing all this shit and then manipulating all these things, they're making AI photos of this man so that they can say he was in on it. I saw a clip yesterday or an article headline yesterday from, I forgot which one of these disgusting trash news sites it was. They were like, Trump, Trump supporters in a meltdown because Epstein lists, no, actually anybody who's been following it knows that the Trump connection to Epstein was he was trying to fuck underage girls in Trump's club and Trump kicked him out of the fucking club. And that's how a lot of this shit started to come to light. So you know what's fascinating to me. This is the difference between the right and the left is that if Donald Trump was involved, they'd stop supporting him. Yeah, for sure, but very quickly, but the left will not. Well, they're trying to paint the opposite picture right now, bro. That's one of the lines they're saying. So what they're saying is they're showing like this photo and a couple headlines are going around saying that, you know, Trump was on the list when in reality, if you read the fucking transcripts, it says, did you ever see Donald? Yes, Donald Trump's name was in the transcript. In the content, are you gonna have to have the context? All of this. Okay, just go. I don't have to tell the story. Let DJ do his job. Yeah, so let's talk about some of the names that are on here. Prince Andrew, this headline reads the final nail in the coffin for Prince Andrew, bombshell Epstein file, underage orgy revelations will torpedo any hope scandal hit Duke of York has a returning to royal duty says experts. So part of this release, the release of US court documents accusing Prince Andrew of taking part in quote, underage orgy end quote on Jeffrey Epstein's Caribbean Island and groping the quote unquote boobs of it in the ledge sex slave ends any hope he has a returning to royal duties experts told Daily Mail online to date pause one second. I saw a interpretation of that situation from a liberal news source that said, yes, he prints Andrew grabbed the boobs of an underage girl, but it was a joke. How are these people? That's what I'm saying. They're literally justifying how are they to map. They have to. This is the difference between like, like people who have moral objectivity, whether like this is right, this is wrong. And we don't budge on this, regardless of who who who it is, who it is. Whereas the progressive liberals think that morality is just subjective where it's like, ah, well, you know, it's, it's moral is just up to the person, you know, it's just right. You know, it depends on the context and the subject in the situation. No, there's no situation where participating in an underage orgy is okay. No, grabbing grabbing the boobs of an underage female as it, but it's a joke because it's okay. According to that. I'm trying to find the article. It is. No, it doesn't. It doesn't. And, but of course, you know, I mean, still like, you know, he had his titles and stuff removed by Queen Victoria back in 2019. You know, but they've declined to comment as this, this article has come to light. No, but we knew that. Um, David Copperfield apparently was performing magic tricks for Epstein victims. Hold on. CNN. Documents contain excerpts of depositions taken of Maxwell and Virginia, Gufre, there is also a deposition from Joanna Sogeberg, who in the document described Prince Andrew touching her breast in a joking manner. This is on CNN. And these are also the same people that will me to you. Listen, listen, listen, listen, showberg's story has been public, but this is the first time her deposition has been unsealed. Now listen to this next line. This is on CNN. Okay. She works sometimes for Epstein has said that he pressure her to go beyond her comfort level at times in giving sexualized massages. Like how like this is how they're trying to justify or soften the truth of what's going on. This is fucking CNN. This is where most of these dumbasses get their fucking information. Yeah. That's that man. That's that. Um, yeah, David Copperfield apparently he was performing magic tricks. Hey, you know what? It was only at times. It was like sometimes. These are the same people that if you make a comment at the water cooler, they'll try to send you to jail. Yeah. Yeah. They don't call HR for saying boobs in the office. Yeah. Yeah. But this is okay. This is the hypocrisy of their whole entire world view. Like, is it followed apart? No, bro, these people are low IQ dumb fucks. It's time to start calling them what the fuck they are. Like if you are still with this, if you are now, I'm not going to generalize liberal people because by definition, I am a liberal person. Okay. I like weed. I'm I'm what I knew it. Yeah. Look, I'm a fucking liberal from 20 years ago, bro. Yeah. I'm just common sense. But the point is, is that if you I'm not going to say Democrat, this is not Democrats. Most Democrats are fucking appalled by this show with us now. They should be fully. Like, that's the point. You should be fully with us on the other side now at this point, at least for this point in time. And then after this, we clean up all these predators who have infiltrated your world view. We can go back to this. Okay. It's a pride at Tego. It's it's disgusting. They've gone so far down the rabbit hole and they've probably severed so many relationships that saying you're wrong and trying to redeem yourself is is not as worth it as just doubling down and saying, yep, I believe this nonsense. Well, like Bill Clinton, you know, we thought, you we thought the the presidential office was bad. This guy likes him younger, likes me younger. And that's not my words. Um, the Clinton got brought up in there. Um, you know, thing, uh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no guys, we're actually getting some uh, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. Let me, let me say this real quick. So, uh, she was deposed. Ms. Shorjberg was deposed and asked if Epstein had ever talked about the former president. Um, she said, quote, he said one time that Clinton likes them young, referring to girls. Um, and we're getting some breaking news right now, actually. Breaking news, have a breaking news. It was a long read Colorado Supreme Court votes to remove Bill Clinton from Epstein client. Oh, is the Colorado Supreme Court on his payroll? Yeah, every fuck. No. Um, but no, like, but a lot of the people have been named. No, you get, you know, those are the guys that removed Trump from the ballot. Yeah, no, I know. Yeah. Um, Tom Prisker, he's in there. High hotels. Yeah. That's the brother of the Illinois governor. Mm-hmm. And there's also a connection because his the Illinois governor who's allowing these migrants to take police positions and buy arms at the gun store and also did the safety act, which removed a bunch of crimes from being priorities, you know, rape, things like that. This is included in there. And then her cousin just happens, his cousin just happens to be also on the board behind that clouding gay shit. Oh, the cousin of the governor, not brother. I'm sorry. Yeah, we'll get to that though in a minute. Um, yeah, he's on there. Um, but like we said, there's somebody that was, you know, that is also on there, but was cleared. D T Trump, man. Big Donnie. Big Don Don. Don Juan. Yeah. Now, I think that's the important thing to Don not the one. Yeah. Not yeah. Yeah. I see what you did there. Yeah. Um, yeah, Jeffrey Epstein, victim Joe Hannah, showwork, the knives, massaging Donald Trump and reveals how predator finance here boasted of being able to call former president before trip to his casino. Poor papers claim. I don't know if you have this in the in the transcripts, but I read them. Did you read them? So massaging. That was the code word. Yeah. It was like, so in the transcripts, they kept asking this, these people, and this is only two women. By the way, it's the biggest problem. Yes. Like you got all of this information. There are hundreds of these women. All of this information is coming from two women. Right. So we should understand that first of all, and second of all, in the transcripts, the attorney was like trying to lead the, the deposition a certain way. And Gufre stops them and says, hey, it's very important for you to understand a couple things. I'm paraphrasing. One, Jeffrey Epstein and Galein Maxwell both gave the orders to massage. And two, you need to understand that when we say massage, we mean sex. So that, so when you guys hear them talking about massages, yeah, it was just missing. If you read the deposition, they, what they're actually saying is Epstein told them, or Galein told them to go give them a massage, which meant, and she clarified later, whatever he wanted, whatever they wanted sexually, and then to report back on the sexual acts to Epstein and Galein. So this is a point. If you want to go, go read the transcripts and you'll see what I'm saying, but I'm paraphrasing the context. Exactly. That's exactly. And here's the important thing because like, I mean, almost more serious, no, I don't know, we've covered this in the past. Andy, you and I both know people directly who have knowledge of this situation. And we were told exactly what this was from the get go. And we've talked about it on CTI, right? Well, this is something that I was also revealed during these documents as the the massage connection and how this was used as a blackmailing operation. Epstein list reignites suspicion, suspicion of the Pito financier was working for massage and blackmailing the elite with help of useful idiot Prince Andrew after meeting his Rayleigh Prime Minister, Eid, Baroque, at least 36 times. Okay. Israel's former Prime Minister, Eid, Baroque, was identified in the bombshell dossiers Wednesday night. He served as Prime Minister from 1991 to 2001 after serving in the idea for 35 years, rising to chief of general staff. Baroque met with Epstein some 36 times and was pictured entering his Manhattan townhouse with the scarf around his face in 2016. Here's the picture. Okay. That's the picture. All right. The same day that a lot of young women were seen coming in and out of the residents that same day. Now, there's been a bunch of former Israeli spies that have come out openly and talked blatantly about how yes, this was one giant honey pot entrapment operation, gaining valuable compromise, which is blackmail. Let's say compromising material. Okay. All right. To blackmail political and business elites. Here's a video of one of those former spies saying this himself. Well, Eid, Baroque was at some point head up military intelligence in Israel. And he apparently was very friendly with Epstein. And yeah, you probably would have known about that. The problem, Mary, with your accusations and allegations are that you're not providing any evidence that Israel was part of running Jeffrey Epstein. Well, again, again, Maxwell was working for Israel. The Epstein was working for Maxwell at the time. And he was introduced to Maxwell's daughter. And they were introduced to Israeli intelligence. Yeah. And he's referring so so so Galein Maxwell who acted as Epstein's madame is also closely in the in the alleged honey trap operation. Her father Robert Maxwell, a British newspaper magnate is alleged to have been a massage agent and may have provided the link between Epstein and Jerusalem's intelligence agency. Like Epstein's alleged hanging while awaiting trial Maxwell. This is Robert Maxwell. Okay. His death on his yacht, the Lady Galein off the coast of Spain in 1991 has attracted suspicions of assassinations. So there's that. Now with all of this stuff going on, what is the left's response? It's not just, you know, oh, well, you know, here's a I picture of Trump. No, no, that was something deeper. I don't know if you guys have seen it. This headline comes out. Trump got 7.8 million from 24 governments while he was president, China tops lists with five and a half million dollars at its hotels while Saudi Arabia and Qatar also forked for stays at property Democrat report claims. This is their response. This is their response. And apparently, let me just read the article a little bit after a years long investigation by House Democrats have has concluded that Donald Trump raked in 7.8 million dollars as president from countries, including China and Saudi Arabia, despite the fury over the Constitution's emoluments clause during his tenure. The funds came through Trump organization, real estate holdings, even at a time when Trump stepped back from management of his financial empire, which is now the subject of the civil fraud trial in New York. Okay. And it's everywhere. This is New York Times. Trump received millions for former government as president, report fines, House Democrats released evidence that he took in 7.8 million. But here's the good part. Engaging in the kind of conduct the GOP is grasping to pin on President Biden. This is their response. No, that's not the same contact. It's not the same. What they're saying is that Chinese diplomats and agents of other governments stayed at his hotels. Okay. So when he was not even managing. Correct. Because he was president. And they didn't do so for free. They paid us paying customers and pay more. This man's, this would be like if I was president and the Chinese military who I didn't like was buying first form supplements and having them ship to them. Exactly. Not paying more for those supplements. Not paying less for those. Just buying them off my website. You're not sending them to them for free. Well, that wouldn't be the exact same thing because based on the quality of first forms products, that would give them a tactical advantage militarily. I can see that's a fair argument. Yeah. You're extra pointed out. Now they're all going to be yoked. That would be treasonous. It would be Jack and Juicy as fuck. That's a fact. And definitely much more attractive. So it's not the same thing at all. Correct. It's not the same. But what they're trying to pin on Biden is what they've been trying to hide which was information on the Hunter Biden laptop and from other sources that show that this man is operating a pay for play situation with the bank companies. Yes. Real businesses. Not real fucking physical businesses. Correct. It's a different thing entirely. That's the response. And all yeah, the Trump allies fixed it on Jeffrey Epstein documents. It's by few revelations. Yeah, that was no big deal. But Trump got millions from China. Like that's their response. Yeah. For right now. I don't know what's to come and what's going to be, you know, what the next gut punches. But I think it's just interesting that after a year's long investigation that nobody knew about somehow their report just comes out the same day as one of the biggest news stories of this year so far. That's a massive coincidence if you asked me. Well, with all of this, I think it's important to point out a few different things. One, this is two women out of hundreds of women. Okay. Two, this is how they control everything. You guys wonder how they control everything. This is how they control everything. Like I've explained many times, a lot of people don't know what a honey pot is. This is, this would be me and us three sitting at Las Vegas Airport and a casino in Vegas. And some dude walking up, it looks like Jeffrey Epstein. Hey, guys, what's up, man? You want to go to my island? Like, I got my own play. We get on it right now. When we go to this dude's island, we get there to give us drinks. You want to massage? Yeah, exactly. And these girls who are 16 but look like they're 26 are all around us. They film it all and then you have whatever time you think you're having. And then by the way, when you leave, they say, oh, yeah, by the way, that girl was fucking 16. Oh, and on top of it, you're going to do everything we want. You're going to make every move we want. You're going to say everything we want. You're going to run your business the way we want. And if you don't, we're going to publish all this footage that we have of you. This footage exists. Okay. And then on top of it, we have many, many, many people who would know these things, saying that this was a massage CIA collaboration to control the narrative, which is how they control how they why are all the Hollywood movies making woke movie, woke a gender shit? Why do they all say the same things? Why do the actors say the same things? Why when COVID was going on, did all the actors say the exact same thing verbatim as if they got an email to say this because they did. All right. So we have to understand like when you look at like the the matrix, so to speak, this is how they've leveraged control over the matrix. That's something that people need to understand. But most importantly, in my opinion, what people need to understand is that you should be asking other questions around this Epstein situation. You should be asking who are the other names. You should be asking what did these people really do? You should be saying where is the footage of this? You should be saying why did they do this? You should be saying and by the way, what the fuck else have you been keeping from us? And we as American people should be asking those questions, not just who are the rest of the names because we want to be happy little puppy dog because they gave us some treats. You know, I see people celebrating this information, but in reality, this is just confirmation that all of these other things have been going on. So what else are they keeping from us? What else are they lying to us about? Those are the things Americans should be asking. Those are the things that they should be demanding because the reality is if we are ever going to have trust in our government or belief in this country ever again, there is going to have to be a full disclosure of information and accountability for the people that committed these crimes. We have drifted into a place where we are literally talking about the president of the United States Bill Clinton with underage girls. We are talking about a list a mile long of a list Hollywood influencers, the richest, most powerful people in the world, media magnets, social media creators. Go down the list, bro, anchors, actors, people of influence, people at their head of banks, etc, etc, etc, etc. that are all guilty, apparently, possibly depending on what the truth actually is of being pedophiles. That's where we are as a country. We said this a lot of us have been saying this for a long time. There's been people that have been talking about this for 20 plus years. Now it finally comes out and people instead of saying holy shit, these conspiracy theorists were actually right. What else are they right about? They're saying, well, sometimes he made them do sexual stuff. It was joking. It was actually a joke when he grabbed her boob. You see what I'm saying? Like this is what we're dealing with. Like we are dealing with disgusting, corrupt criminality that is beyond the comprehension of a morally decent human being. And they're going to want, this is a test. What's going on here is a test. They are floating out a few selected names to see what we're going to do. Because they know if we don't do anything about this, then it doesn't matter what they do. And it doesn't matter if they steal the next election. It doesn't matter if they flip the game table over. It doesn't matter if they decide to eliminate Trump somehow. Like, bro, I wouldn't be surprised that if these people don't start, like if we, the people don't start standing up in mass in unity, it would be, it's a very reasonable expectation in my mind that they could legit just drone strike Marlago and be like, yeah, we drone strike them for the good of the country. What are you going to do about it? What are you going to do? I mean, I don't know if you guys caught Biden's new political ad. We got that. Oh, okay. Cool. Well, we'll talk about that. But my point is, this is a test. And your performative outrage on the internet is not enough. It's not enough. That's real shit. And if you want to know that if this situation is true, look at the movements of the world and the way things that have been going. And then like, let's just assume that it's true. Well, then the whole Israel situation makes a lot of sense, right? The US backing Israel for no particular reason them. Nikki Haley shilling for Israel. Bro, they have the whole government of the United States on a fucking blackmail list. By the bone. Yes. The reason these politicians suck on Israel's nuts so bad is not just because they're Jewish or have dual citizenship. It's because the entire Israeli government has fucking infiltrated the United States system and has blackmail dirt on every single one of these motherfuckers. Guys, tell us what you guys think. Let us know down in the comments. Tell us what you guys think on this conversation. We need full disclosure. People need to call for full disclosure. This is not enough. This is not okay. It is not okay for anybody. I don't care if they're the president. I don't care if they're your neighbor to fucking fuck little kids and fuck with little kids. And that's that's being normalized across the globe. That's what normalize it. Dude, no, yeah, if nothing happens for sure. So 100% dude, you've had politicians like we cover that politician in Spain who was freaking out screaming at the top for lungs saying that children had a right just like you have a right to sleep with whoever they want, regardless of what the age is. They've been trying to normalize pedophilia for the last number of years. And they've they've made it so it's like actually a conversation. There's actual terms about this. Like there's a correct term. Minor attracted people. No, these people are fucking pedophiles, bro. And there's no difference between now or 20 years ago when we were to put these motherfuckers in a wood shipper. That is real shit. Okay. And we we are dealing. This has been happening. This is their system. This is how they've operated. And now we are in a situation where it's coming out, which is why they've tried so hard to normalize it because they they're all guilty of it. All of these elite whack job fuckers. Dude, if you go back in history to the Roman times and beyond that, these people were pedophiles at the top of the game, bro. That it's cultural. Yes. And these people are they still are and they're doing it in our face now. And we're not doing shit. Yeah, guys, jump down in the comments. So that's what you guys think. Let us know what you guys think on this topic. But we gotta keep this cruise moving. Let's keep this cruise moving straight to the comments. Cruise comment. This week's comes from cutting an Idaho. They say who's down here scrolling for Elaine's comment. We're coming. They talk about. I don't know all this one. I got it. Yeah, no. Elaine, we couldn't find you. Listen, we hope you, you know, Elaine Lee. Elaine Lee. One, two, three, four headline number two. And they're coming too. Better better. Put your seatbelt on. Don't leave that seat so far back. That's a lot of number two reads Harvard president Claudine Gay resigns amid deepening plagiarism scandal. Ooh. Sounds like racism me. She about to lose her job. Yeah. Uh, yeah. So Harvard president Claudine Gay, she resigned on Tuesday following anti-symmetism scandals at the Ivy League University. A distrasterous congressional testimony and scores of plagiarism allegations being on earth in recent months. Her six month tenure marks the shortest tenure in Harvard's history. So she was the first black president to be hired at Harvard and the first black president to get forgiven fired. Make your fucking history over here. I like it. I'm just saying. So Gay's resignation just six months and two days into her presidency makes her tenure to Harvard the shortest in Harvard's history. According to a letter released by the Harvard Corporation provost and chief academic officer Alan M. Garber will take over as interim president. Gay informed the Harvard community of her resignation in the email that says it has been quote frightening to be subject it to personal attacks and threats fueled by racial animus. This is just a couple of scripts from Weakass resignation letter. You know, but what's all this in from we covered a lot of this on CTI before. It was about this plagiarism thing. Like honestly, freedom of speech. I don't really care about, you know, the comments she made of the testimony. That's not the problem. The problem is is that her entire academic career has been plagiarized. And this is supposed to be the person in one of the most prestigious institutions in this country leading the charge being the first. And she's fucking cheating. Great example, I think. If you guys want to check out the full all of the comparisons Christopher Rufo, he has a whole website. You guys can check it out. I'm sure we'll link it for you. If you guys want to find all of the actual cases. But all in all, there's over 40 cases of alleged plagiarism with some new ones that just came out this past Monday. But yeah, so what does she do? In good old fashion. Pulls out the black heart. Yeah, pulls it out. Yeah. And, you know, so Harvard did do an investigation, but you know, they tried to keep that under the cover, under the rug. I'm even saying that quote, it must not be published. So, and then that Pritzker guy, we were talking about, yes, cousins on the board of this Harvard, Harvard whole, whole deal. But yeah, and like, and again, you have the mainstream media and the left trying to protect her. This AP, AP news article of the headline reads plagiarism charges downed Harvard's president. A conservative attack helped to fan the outrage. Right? And just the intro, I mean, it makes me sick. But it says, American higher education has long viewed plagiarism as a cardinal sin accusations of academic dishonesty have ruined the careers of faculty and undergraduates alike. The latest target is Harvard president Claudine Gay, who resigned Tuesday. In her case, the outrage came not from her academic peers, but her political foes led by conservatives who put her career under intense scrutiny. So now it's only true depending on who it comes from, like who it comes from and who it doesn't come from can make it less true. It doesn't make sense. But yeah, so reviews by Harvard found mold. This is this is AP news assessment reviews by Harvard found multiple shortcomings in Gay's academic citations, including several instances of duplicative language. The university concluded the errors, quote, we're not considered intentional or reckless and didn't rise to misconduct, but the allegations continued with Newans as recently as Monday. Now here's one example I wanted to pull up. This is one example. Okay, and this is as recent as 2017. Okay, this is not like, but this goes all the way back to 1999. Okay. So what Gay wrote was I also, I mean, you guys can fucking see it. I also construct a county level measured that captures the financial incentives developers have to build a rehab rehabilitate affordable housing in the most impoverished places. And then this was pulled straight from what free men and Owens wrote in there article. Hold on. We as it was she wrote was what DJ said and then what they wrote was an instrument for low income housing development. We construct a county level measure that captured the incentive developers have to build or rehabilitate affordable housing in certain tracks. It's the same exact thing. No, like she didn't even try to cite it from the appropriate fucking authors. Well, that's that's not the way people do things anymore. I mean, it's like everybody makes their own 75 hard shit. And it doesn't know. But that article, the good news is that article did get a fact checked on on X. Yeah. With the context, the readers added context session saying plagiarism is a breach of rules for Harvard University. They link the source to that. Harvard's own policies. Okay. Clothing Gay was ultimately forced to resign for a series of breaches of this policy. Plagiarism where application of the rules around plagiarism, therefore cannot be considered a weapon. And yeah, she's she's crying. But here's a crazy thing. So she resigns from president. She's still about to keep a million dollar salary. They're still going to hire on as a professor or adjunct professor. She'll still get paid. She will still get paid. Yeah. So disgrace to Harvard president. Clothing Gay who resign on Tuesday. We'll stay stay on at the Ivy League University's faculty as a professor with a salary of at least $900,000 a year. Yeah. It doesn't make sense. But it made me think, you know, this situation, this is not like a new situation, right? Because this stuff happens all the time. You guys remember Marilyn Mosby, right? The attorney in the Freddie gay case, right? She's, you know, prosecuted all the officers in that Freddie gay case. Did a fictitious investigation to the death of Freddie gay lied on these officers. All the officers got off and acquitted because of her. She was nominated as time magazine lady. I mean, they did all the extra stuff. And then when it came out that she lied about it is she cried racism, right? Or even locally, Kim Gardner. It's the same story. I do fucked up shit. But because I'm black, I'm fine. It's bullshit. We got on this, guys. This is standard operating procedure for anybody in a position of power who has been put in power because of DEI and affirmative action standards. This is what happens. You're not good enough to have the fucking job. You got the job because of the color of your skin. And now when you don't get the job because you're not qualified because you lied about every motherfucking thing that you ever did, you blame white people, right? Tracism. White people, the only reason you got the job. It's real shit. The only racism occurring is the fucking other races that didn't get the job because you happen to be black. Like, bro, I'm so sick of seeing this shit. But we got to have, that's the thing though, we got to be able to have these conversations. Like this is what we talk about. We talk about you cannot criticize. Dude, listen, for the last 10 years, this is a common thing. You cannot criticize these people in any way, shape, or form. Otherwise, it's racism. This is what I was talking about during the intro. How can we fucking get any work done, create any real progress, real progress, not your fucking progress, talking about actually improving things, actually being the best, actually having a society that's based on meritocracy and who the best qualified candidate is. This shit is what creates racism. This is what creates it. This is what gets people resentful because certain races get preference and immunity from any sort of criticism whatsoever. Okay. And yes, they use these people, these people in positions of power will always defer responsibility and blame racism as the cause. It's it's hap. This has been going on for 20 years. This is nothing new. Listen, bitch, you fucking fake your whole career. Anybody can become the president of Harvard if they are good enough faker. You know, like, like, dude, what I can see you write all this shit. I didn't write it and fucking all these things, like say all these things I didn't do and dude, it's disgusting. But to me too, I think it also points to, I mean, this is another conversation we've had on the show all the time. It's like, okay, so like, I mean, and look at Harvard's response. This is supposed to be a prestigious Ivy League school, right? This just furthers the narrative, like colleges, these universities and colleges, they're not doing, they're not teaching you anything. They're not, they're not giving you any real valuable skills. They're making you pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for a very nice, fancy piece of paper. And they push you out into the real world where you've built no real expectations. You have no real standards. You have no real understanding of how the world actually fucking works. You know, because you never did anything your entire life. That's exactly what I was going to say. It means nothing. The Harvard degree or any Ivy League school degree, the reason it's valuable is because of the perception of value. You know, it's the credibility of the university. Look who went here. Right. They don't, Harvard doesn't realize how badly they are ruining their credibility and therefore devaluing their diplomas. And now, less people are going to go to your school. That's going to ruin your income as an institution. They don't care. They got a $50 billion in now, man, bro. They don't give a shit. They don't require, they don't work on cash flow. Here's what here's the fucking problem with this. The real Ivy League situation is not about education at all. It's a fucking rich kids club that they're trying to get into. The reason people send their kids to fucking Harvard and Yale and Cornell is not because of the quality of the education. It's because all the other rich kids go there and they all get to know each other. And then they all jerk each other off the rest of their lives doing business together and fucking colluding against the common person in every way, shape or form. That's the truth of Ivy League education. All different levels. Yeah, it's not about preparing anybody for fucking anything. It's about cultural alignment and relationship building of the haves to collude against the have nots. And that's what the fuck this is. These people are fucking assholes. That's what they are. They're elite, rich, blue blood, fucking assholes. And because they feel the white guilt and the guilt of, you know, oh, well, they've created all this D.I. shit. And now they're in a situation where they have to prop up people who are minorities into a situation of power to look virtuous to everybody else because it's politically appropriate. These people don't give a fuck about the grades they get. They don't care about knowledge. They care about looking a certain way to certain people. So that those people will work with them and give them fucking money. That's what the fuck this is about. It's always been about that. And dude, you're correct. The smartest people in the world are actually the dumbest people in the world because they assume they know everything. People who go like, do you guys know anybody? I know a lot of people who went to Harvard and I know a lot of Gina went to Harvard. She's smart as fuck. Who? Gina, who's on show? Yeah, but she'll be the first person to say that what I'm saying is true. Yeah. Yeah. And bro, but I can tell you this, nine out of 10 people I know that went to an Ivy League school or fucking assholes. They're fucking cocky fucks. And they don't know shit about shit, but they think they know everything. That's the reality. And if you went there and that's you, I'm sorry about it, bro. You're not a genius because you got a piece of paper. You went and followed directions of a bunch of other assholes, which got you awarded this little gold star that you fucking hang your dick on and think that you're better than everybody about. So fuck you. That's how I think. I'd rather hang out with fucking plumbers. Those are my kind of people. You know, true. It's a real shit. I mean, like I said, it's very. I fucking hate these people, bro. That's the thing, man. It's like it's very easy to get like, you know, sucked into that emotional manipulation that they want you guys to get into. You just have to understand like listen, this is the she does woman is not representative. Hold on of this country. Hold on. She's a piece of shit. Hold on. How the fuck is it racism? If you lied about your entire academic career and your credentials and then you get called out for it and now it's a conservative attack or it's racial, you know, whatever she's an animus. Yeah, but bro, this is bullshit. Okay. And any fucking black person that says, yeah, this is racing. You're full shit too. Yeah. Now, the only thing I will say on this play is and I think we actually covered it. We did, we did cover it. Here's the thing. And like, I mean, I'm not saying that this is okay, right? But wrong is still fucking wrong. But this is also the game that they play when it comes to this black. Oh, yeah, we'll let you be the prey. Like you don't think Harvard knew 20 fucking years ago that this woman was plagiarized as stuff. You don't think they knew they knew they just hope they never come out. Yeah, it's not even just that. They knew like, okay, yeah, go ahead and make sure you push for these different agendas and narratives and, you know, DEI initiatives. Yeah, make sure you can say you to play the narrative. Let's look at this. We're fucking. Look at this lady's fucking face. Yeah, they're okay. Hold on. Look at her fucking face. Look at her fucking face. Smug. They're all smug as fuck, bro. You know why they're so smug because they know that they can do and say fucking anything and not be held accountable. They do not give a fuck. And this is not just because they're black. If you go watch Bill Clinton's interview where the interviewer asked him about his associate with Epstein and he fucking grins and smiles. And dude, these people are out of fucking control, dude. They are not checked with reality. They are not subject to the laws that you and I are all subject to or the rules or any of the fucking cultural standards. They get to live in their own world. They get to do whatever they want and they dare you to fucking say or do anything about it. That's where we are. And this is why it goes back to personal excellence because, you know, if they're daring us, then, you know, we have to be the types of people that could do something about it. And if we're not, then they're just going to keep getting away with it and we're going to sit here talking on Instagram about how annoyed we are by it. And that's going to be the extent of it. Yeah. Just going to get worse. I agree with you. And I made my some of my fucking decade trip to the grocery store and it ain't looking good. No, tell you that. I saw a bunch of people who look fat as shit that fucking would not be capable of holding anybody accountable. What's the level? And their kids are going to be even worse. Yes. Even worse because it's a lifetime of it. And I mean, I've gone into restaurants. I don't know how many times in seeing kids with their iPads and their headphones, you know, not interacting with anybody just in their little world because they're trying their parents are trying to get them to shut up so that they can go watch their Netflix or whatever they want to do. It's just a perpetual cycle of just mediocrity and consumerism. And if it the buck stops with us, like if it doesn't stop with us, then it's just going to be a slave generation after slave generation until. Listen, you know what drives, you know what drives cultural change? Cool. What's cool? What's cool? People want to do what's cool? They want to be cool. For the longest time, the last 20 years, they've tried to make all this shit cool. It's cool to be a feminist. It's cool to fucking, you know, me too. It's cool to be with, you know, the propping up of one race of the country and the slandering of another no matter what. It's cool to be anti-capitalism. It's cool to hate on the rich people. It's cool to hate people that want to achieve. They made this cool. Okay. And now the result is what we're seeing in society. We have people, we have the most mediocre, most disgusting, unhealthy society that I believe we've probably ever had in this country. And probably it's ever exist in the world. Like I doubt people in the history of earth have ever been as fat and as fucking lazy and as useless as as a large percentage of the humans on this planet right now. Yeah. Okay. Well, for history, it's impossible. Yeah, because you actually had the fucking work to survive. Right. We were just having this conversation in the locker room talking about the concept of cool because there were two reasons why people weren't pieces of shit back in the day. One, you couldn't be because you die. Yeah. And then two, you had the like the reason that people would sacrifice for others and be selfless and all this other thing, things is because of religion. You know, the fear of God would force you to do things that you otherwise would. Nobody's afraid of God anymore. Right. Nobody's afraid of God anymore. So the only way to convince people to like when we're talking about like branding and trying to get people to do the right thing for the right reasons, right? Because we talk about personal development, right? But getting money for the sake of getting money isn't cool. Getting things for the sake of getting things isn't cool. Getting the biggest muscles for the sake of getting the biggest muscles isn't that cool. Well, it is cool to people now. But to me, to me and you who are trying to save the fucking world, it's not that cool. Right. It wasn't accomplished. Right. You got the right thing for the road. Those are byproducts of the mission. Right. Exactly. You got the right thing for the wrong reason. So we were having this conversation in the locker room. How do we get people to do the right thing for the right reason? And the answer is make it cool. Because they don't have to anymore. And they don't have the fear in God making them do the right thing. So how do we do it? We have to make it cool. This is why this is why when people say pornography is a weapon and it goes over people's heads. Like it goes over people's head. Listen, dude, men have gone to war. They have built civilizations and burned them down over naked women. Real talk. It's the most motivating fucking factor to a testosterone-filled man is the approval and the appreciation and the the admiration of women that you just seem 300. Yeah. Remember when he kicks him into the pit? What's the first thing he does before he kicks him? He asks his wife. He turns to his wife and looks and God's. Yeah. Bro, listen. This is why pornography is a part of the is a part of the fucking problem in a real way. Like it's real talk. And if you go back and listen to me talk about, and by the way, I didn't give a fuck about this for most of my life. Most of my life, I was like, bro, who fucking cares? It doesn't fucking matter. Like you watch some porn. Who cares? Love, love, love. Yeah. When you really understand what the fuck they're doing with the chemicals in the water and the chemicals in the food and the removal of testosterone from men and then the over availability of being able to see any kind of woman you want naked literally in 10 seconds. It's a scarcity to that. Yeah. It's a Google of naked women on the internet, bro. And now it's past. It's gone past that. And as you could see naked women that you know for five dollars. Okay. So we all, we all see here a lot of us who are, because I am, I'm a live and let live person. I'm a person that's like, dude, you know, whatever dude, if that's them, let them do them. The problem with that is, is that we're not realizing what that's doing to men in terms of suppressing their greatness in terms of suppressing their ability to be driven and create and build and conquer and do all the things that men are built to fucking do in the world. And that's all intentionally being weeded out of us for the purpose of control. And that's not conspiracy theory. That's an actual conspiracy. It's common sense, right? Like what do what have men historically done? Reproduced and fight. So what do they do? They put you in front of a video game where you fight and become the greatest character that you can become, which is what you're actually supposed to do in real life, by the way. And then they give you porn, which is taking your sexual drives and drives to reproduce and perpetuate the species. And then you'd write into a sock. And it just, it takes the inherent things that are within men, who by the way are the only real threat to tyranny and redirecting that in a direction that is empty. These motherfuckers in 1774, 1775, the 1776 couldn't pick up their phone and look at naked girls. You know what I'm saying? They could, they listened, dude. We live in a very, and then you throw on top of that. Okay, let's throw on top of that as something else that didn't exist then. It hasn't existed ever, which is the self-glorification of social media. All right. Now instead of living for a cause or a culture or a code, people live for themselves, right? They live for likes. They live for shares. They live for attention. And they spend most of their time figuring out how to promote themselves to get more of it. All right. When you're so focused on yourself, how can you be focused on any cause? How can you be focused on anything that's actually important? You see what I'm saying? So like we have all of these things that, you know, people get confused whenever I say this is a weapon or that's a weapon like cancel cultures or weapon. Political correctness as an ideology is a weapon. The silent majority, that's a weaponized concept and specifically introduced by the people who are not on the side of Donald Trump. Okay. These are all weapons. Porn as a fucking part of the weapon. The removal of testosterone, that's another part of the weapon. Social media and self-glorification is part of a weapon. Video games, video games, cheap entertainment. That's part of the weapon. The removal of God and the family unit intentionally is part of the weapon. And like, dude, we have to understand this. Like we have to come to an understanding as Americans right now. That's the and as people of the world of what we are actually, what is actually happening to us? It is not an accident. This is not just a bunch of random shit that Andy is tying together as some sort of conspiracy. No, this is actual intentional removal of threats from the people who are pressing and crushing you on a daily. This is why you can't afford your anything. This is why you can't get ahead. This is why you pay so much tax and you can't do shit about it. This is why because you're participating in the fucking matrix, bro, and you're unaware of it. You know, people like, why are you so hard on these people? Because, bro, they're not listening or thinking at all. They're a complete, bro, you know that part in the matrix where the dude goes back into the matrix because he's like, fuck, it's too hard outside. Right? Like, most of these people that aren't saying, shit, you're doing shit or that guy. I have those moments sometimes. 100% dude. Like, it, it sounds, it, it, because I used to live that way. You understand what I'm saying though? I'm saying is people are choosing ignorance on purpose because that's easier. 100%. Yes. 100%. Like, I, I've lived on both sides of it. I've been the, I have been the plugged in matrix guy in every way, shape and form. And, you know, we all were, we grew it, we were born into it. Right. And so now that, now that I'm outside of it and we're, we're doing what we're doing, trying to make things actually better. Like, there are times where, you know, I sit there and I'm like, fuck, it was a lot easier when I was just playing video games. Well, they, you know what they say about ignorance. It's bliss, right? It's right. Right. But it's not easier. It's not easier because your entire, everything around you burns. You know, it feels easier because you're doing whatever you want to do and you're, you know, distracting yourself with all these different things. But in reality, your life is burning. It's very easy to sit there and play video games. But when you take your headset off, your life still sucks, you know, as soon as the dopamine stuff goes away, your life still sucks. Yeah. All your relationship sucks. You don't have any money in your bank account. You're completely out of shape. Is it actually bliss? It's not. No, it's not. Let's go shit. My guys, tell us what you guys think jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments. Let me just say this too, because you deserve this. I appreciate that as a, because one of the things that's much younger than me, how old are you? 27 and you're how old? 28. It makes me have hope hearing that from people like you. That's where I'm like, fuck yeah, bro. And I know there's, we've talked about some of the other, other young influencers that are out here that we both respect. I'm going to make a better, I'm going to do a better job of including some of these younger people to share this platform with this next year. It's one of my main goals. You know, like I'm not, I'm done with the fucking entrepreneur crowd. Like if you're an entrepreneur, quote unquote, an entrepreneur, you fuck the fuck you're not coming on. I'm just being real. Okay, you're not coming on. If you're a young man who's living it, who's culturally trying to fix the other young man, open invite, bro. They put me, come in my DMs, tell me who the fuck you are, but you better have a real following. You better be doing shit. Yeah. I mean, it goes back to right thing for the wrong reason versus right thing for the right reason. I have a following. Other guys have following. Yeah, but we're doing it for two entirely different reasons. Correct. Some people are personal development people. I am a culture person. Yes, you are, this is a reason we connect because there's an actual mission at hand. Yep. That's real shit, man. Well, I just appreciate you, man. Thank you. So you know, you TVJ. Oh, yeah. I appreciate you. Yeah. See you later. All right. Headline number three. Let's bring this cruise to a close. Headline number three. This is just more, I guess we can almost do this as like a final thoughts on just the whole show. I wanted to just say this because I've been seeing this uptick and trends, right? It's 2024, guys. I'm starting to feel like that big red button. I mean, maybe this might just be the start of it, but this ratio divide they are trying so hard. I don't think it's going to work this time. I don't think so either. I got I got some stuff to say that. There's a reason it's worked in the past, bro. It's because most white people are fucking scared of that to say anything. I think that's different now. Well, there's a couple of reasons. I think and I also think I also think that the majority of black Americans are realizing what's going on and they're not with it either. That's the thing. And it's like we're feeling the pains of our decisions. Right. I think that's a really, really big wake. But there is so much BS that they are pushing right now. It's 2014. We got election season coming up. They did the exact same play in 2020, right? It's important that we are aware of the attempts and we we call them out again, speak the truth when we see the bullshit. Now, what hold on? Before you move on, yeah, it is also important to notice how fucking handsome we both look in this slide. I like I'm just saying, now we look like we should get back to this shit. This is what the fuck I'm talking about. Fucking turning internet off. Let's all get some cool ass clothes. Let's go around cutting the heads off of fucking tyrants and putting them on sticks and having a good fucking time. The powder wakes were now though. What I do. No, I'm happy with the no weeks. Yeah. Yeah. I'm starting to like my gray a little bit. I think of the week to stick to see like this shit over here. Like this. I'm starting to like this. We'll solve in pepper. Yeah, I'm starting to like this. Like that's a good look. I mean, we look like a couple of bad motherfuckers are about to fucking cut the heads off of you motherfuckers. Very domestic. Yeah. Very domestic. Right. These tyrants like I want you know, I'm saying like I can feel it. They fear a man that wears that dude. Well, I can't say anything. But that's what head on through is about. That is a great outfit man. That is just hard as fuck. Like you would not fuck with two guys wearing that shit. I like my chain. Hold on, bro. If two dudes walked in a bar dress like that. Hold on. Hold on, bro. Everybody would laugh at first until they realized they weren't fucking around. And then everybody would be like fuck these. They'll give a fuck. They're gonna start coming over. Take a pictures. You're getting drinks. Yeah. Mine drink. That's right. We're gonna you know what? That sounds like a nice experiment. Let's see how people treat certain people that are dressed. A certain way. Oh, kind of like social experts. Let's do it. Yeah. I think your outfit is nicer than mine now. Well, I think mine is just the chain. But see, you got no, it's the tie to it. But see, I like the chest here. We could switch. I mean, I wear your. They both look good. That's what I'm talking about. The same size. I just like to I like how you're like I like the taco meat. I kind of like the on button look too. Yeah. That's definitely more pimped. Just saying. And number three reads. That's a couple of them. Let's just go through these just showing the images of what we got. Black Americans would feel the sting of Republican budget cut proposals. This is one. Just an example. Well, I like to have them in feel in the staying for 60 fucking years that have been voting Democrat. No, I mean, that's a fact. Um, we're like this, this fucking. I think he's like the new. We really want to say about him. Oh, this guy. Yeah. Fuck this fuck. Oh, I can't. What I really want to say. We have to cut the cameras for that one. Yeah, it just goes to commercial break. But uh, Mr. Ebrum X kindie. That's not even in a motherfucker's name. Henry Rogers. Yes. Henry Rogers. Okay. Accuses racist mob of being behind Claudine Gays. Resignate. No. Why do they all pick these names, bro? Why do all the activists? What you have these fucking crazy ass names? Well, no, fuck you're not Malcolm X. Why you ask me? Hold on. Cause these are your people, bro. They're not fucking people. This is your. I don't know Henry. Yes. First of all, Henry grew up. Let me tell you a little bit. That's the most racist thing I ever said in the show. That those are your people. Yeah. Yeah. But no, but I'm graduating. He's not, bro, because guess what? Here's the thing. These people don't come from where I come from. This fucking probably good for a glass. Two pair of household. They're probably white pants. You know, they're still married. They love each other deeply, right? And not only that, he went to one of the best high schools in the country, bro, went to one of the best colleges in the country. It's performative theater. This is my fucking little struggle. It's performative theater. It's why that dude from Kentucky or Tennessee, that senator, the state senator, the, the dream guy. Yes. Who they all, it's like dude, they, they believe they're in the real civil rights movement. They don't understand. This has already happened, bro. We've already had the civil rights movement. And when they've convinced all these young people and dude, you know how they convinced them this? They stopped desegregation programs. When I was in high school, they had desegregation, which what, which meant they brought in kids from the city and from the county and they put them in the schools together, which was awesome. Because, bro, I like real talk. I had never seen a black person in my whole life until I went to fucking school. So like, how am I supposed to know and like operate or be friends with or learn the culture and these culture about? Yes. How, how do you know if you never see it? So then they ended intentionally. My senior year of high school, they stopped that shit here in St. Louis intentionally. I don't know if they're doing it again or not. They should. But they stopped that. And dude, a whole generation of kids grew up without ever learning how to interact with people that were different than them. You know, and so now you have all these, these dudes who think they're fucking Malcolm X out here, bro. You were all black school. Yeah. Man being oppressed by who though. The white man, they didn't go to that school. Like it doesn't make sense. Bro, I know it doesn't make sense. And like, and I guess so we got these headlines, but I want to say, I'm so sick of race shit, dude. Race, race shit is low IQ level shit. Like dude, if you really think about race when you're talking to someone or meeting someone, like, this is why they call all the jokes that we make on each other racist. And so they try to make all the comedy and all the human bonding and relationships that we have fucking offensive so that we can't even bond with each other, bro. We can't even like, like dude, take one of these fucking 20 something white kids that never was in school. And like interview them on the street, like about that. Nope. Oh, they would shut down in front of me. Like, it's the same thing you were saying about white people being like, oh, you're proud to be white. Oh, yeah. Now of course not. Do you love fried chicken? Yeah. Like they shut down. Yeah. Well, I'm just saying, dude, like race is stupid. We do, we do legit. But they're trying to bring it down. We talk about it a lot on the show, but we talk about it because we're identifying the problem. But in real life, dude, this shit is stupid. It doesn't fucking matter, bro. I don't give a fuck if, you know, like, bro, when I say it and I make fun of each other, I make it. We're making fun of his idiot shit. I hate to tell you, but nothing to do with him. Yeah, but like what I'm saying is, bro, this is when we talk about weapons, this is part of the weapon. Part of the weapon is don't let people bond. Don't let people joke around. Don't let people be friendly. Otherwise, it's racism. You see what I'm saying? This is why, dude, this is why Dave Chappelle is so good for the world and comedians are so good for the world because, dude, they say the shit everybody thinks that's why they laugh their fucking ass off. They're 100%. But like I said, they're out to go into this big push and we just can't fall for it. You mentioned a few times Biden's new campaign video. Have you seen it yet? Nope. It's sickening. It's it's it's it's it's sick. Yeah, so this was the tweet. The tweet reads, all of us are being asked right now. What will we do to maintain our democracy? And remember, the answer is they'll do anything, right? Watch this commercial and then think about what they are truly willing to do to stop Donald Trump from being president. No, the video is insane. They are just when you watch this, dude, they are justifying the level of fuckery that they are about to bestow on this country. They always tell you first. Yeah. This is the exclusive video right here on really after it's clip. I've made the preservation of American democracy the central issue of my presidency. I believe in free and fair elections and the right to vote fairly and have your vote counted. There's something dangerous happening in America. There's an extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs of our democracy. All of us are being asked right now. What will we do to maintain our democracy? History's watching. The world is watching. The most important are children and grandchildren who hold us responsible. The vice president and I have supported Voting Rights next day one of this administration. And I ask every American that joined me in this cause. America still a place of possibilities where the power resides with we the people. That's our soul. We are the United States of America. There is nothing beyond our capacity. We act together. I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message. There's a movement growing in this country of people who do not share our beliefs. When he says democracy he means communism. That's what people don't understand. If you go read Salolinsky's Rules for Radicals which is a book that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and all of these pieces of shit fucking love it will talk about how they use deceptive language to convince people of things that aren't actually true. Democracy means communism and these people's language. Yes democracy does not mean what you think it means. It means mob rule. It means communism does not mean taxation without representation. It does not mean the basic fundamental realities that this country was founded upon. These people are fucking tyrants. They are the exact people that are constitution warned us about. These these people are the exact people of that. You know here is the good news. One little final piece of context here to counter all of this nonsense that said I read the Democrat Party is done in Chicago and that's effect black Chicago and vowed to flip Chicago red for 2024 election over migrant crisis. Want to meet Trump. Here's the video. Within the last couple of weeks or months we've been hearing a lot from the black residents of Chicago and specifically that of Mark Carter who has been very instrumental and speaking out against the migrants going into Chicago and taking up all the resources right. Find that guy. We're going to be away from the black community. Now recently I did a video about him and others saying that they want to have a conversation with Trump. They invited the Republicans to go and speak with them. Now this video I'm about to show you it was actually three black gentlemen on there but Mark Carter I'm going to show you his segment where you know he and the other men were at a homeless encampment. They were talking about the issues that black Chicagoans are facing of course homelessness and all of that and they're basically saying we are paying to be homeless because a lot of people pay taxes right and so you're paying taxes but the money is not going to help you it's actually going to help other people or helping other people that are going into Chicago. It is said that by the end of this year not more it's going to be about $300 million allocated to our help in the migrants in Chicago alone right. And so Mark said this check it out. American citizens. American children who are already struggling academically you're going to bring in a new group of children a new group of people take those resources away from Americans to accommodate this new group of people that is going to make the children are going to fall further behind. Unemployment is going through the roof poverty, crime this is going to impact our communities across this city to the point to where violence, murder, robbery is going to spike. Not just with Americans but also with these people are coming here. 3000 illegal immigrants are living in the factory almost what what a half of block long and this is going to transcend into public housing. They keep saying that there will be no public housing for illegal immigrants. That's not true. So we pay to be homeless basically now as the United States citizens. We're going to flip Chicago red. The Democratic Party is done in Chicago and that's a fact. By summer you think it's a lot of them coming in you watch the uprising. Here's another clip just follow up this was him being interviewed by the warbroom this what he had to say. Hey we said we sent it a direct message and we asked Trump to come to Chicago come here and walk these streets with us and we'll put thousands behind him as he walked the streets and that's a fact that's the promise. Fantastic. We're going to pitch that to him. What we got guys. I think it's great to see you know if you were to say that three years ago you'd be called a racist. You know when I said that they were going to import all these migrants to replace the black voters I was called fucking white supremacists fucking by everybody. Okay this is great to see. I love to have that guy on the show and talk to him about what he's doing. Yeah I'm going to reach out to him. Yeah. That's when we talk about earlier in the show when I asked Andy you know what does unity look like. It's not more than just agreeing on things. It's doing what this guy's doing. Yeah it's actually going out in the world and informing these people and letting them know. Yeah. Because not spewing your rhetoric on on the internet does not accomplish anything because we've become accustomed to seeing it. Oh another day in America. But when you do what this guy is doing and go out and actually physically try to make a difference it will it will make a difference. So men like this are what they fear the most. The guys that are willing to walk away from their computers and their phones and actually go out in the world and make something happen and put themselves at risk because you know they're watching this guy now. Oh yeah. It was no doubt. He's speaking out on all the right issues. Yeah. Yeah I mean Pluto's this guy. I mean with so much going on I think the the best thing about all of this is that we are starting to get a real genuine tip of your check on where America is standing. This is where Americans are standing. Where are all the people that are for Biden's message? I've never seen it. Where are those people? Where are the people at his rallies? Where are the people that's correct? I'm just pointing something out. Where are the people rallying for Joe Biden? Where are the people showing up to see him speak? Where like every time you see Joe Biden going through anywhere it's literally Trump supporters heckling him. Okay. They're trying to manufacture a quote unquote following and they're still doing it and they're going to get worse about it on social media but nobody's buying it anymore. Like there's no real following for these people and dude they're going to fucking do whatever they got to do to fucking maintain power because they understand what accountability looks like for them and that's what people should be worried about in 2024. If this guy gets reelected if he's even if it even gets to that point but this is this is a if you have questions about the last election you know I can understand how you could have questions about it but if this guy gets reelected there's no question anymore. Yeah. There's no way this guy is popular enough to get any number of votes that's going to get him. No they're going to cheat bro. They're going to cheat in front of your face and if they don't cheat in front of your face what they'll do is they'll probably kill Trump and then let one of these other people in. One of their approved people. Niki Haley. Yeah right exactly that's who they're all positioning behind. Guys jump in on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think. Dude people got a really rally behind and put away this this shit like all the shit that we've been indoctrinated with and conditioned to and told and propagated to that the other side is out there. Look dude there's only one side that I can see and I don't I don't see the only people I see still with this shit are legit delusional people. Can it be? Or people and we don't even know that they're real because I don't know anybody in real life bro I've talked to my Democrat friends all of them I've talked to people who are legitimately progressive and who like would not talk anything going on in the world with me because of our our differences were so far apart and they all agree Joe Biden is fucking trash and then they understand that he's corrupt and they understand that he's causing all these problems intentionally. So if all of those people understand that why are we not getting together why are we not working together because it's always followed by a but your guys worse. Yeah well it's it's it's not true right it's not and dude these these these images that they try to paint of you know mobs and and racist and KKK and all this shit they tell you that's all bullshit that's bullshit we could take images from Black Lives Matter and make a commercial the other way and it would look way worse it would look way worse you know what I'm saying like dude this and I'm sure Trump's gonna fucking do that. Now he's gonna handle that. Yeah I mean the problem is bro is that we have people like you said who are they're so into their own position that they refuse to admit that they've been fooled or been manipulated or been lied to when all of us have been fooled manipulated lied to there's just a certain percentage of population that's unwilling to face it and until they decide to face it there's going to be very little opportunity for us to come together because dude we have to come together and this is a this is a this is a legit American and human problem across the world that has to be resolved through unity and and discussion and understanding that those people that they whoever they tell you the enemy is is not your enemy it's it's them that's the enemy the people who are telling you who the enemy is is the enemy that's the enemy and we have to all come to understand that that's reality bro the the enemy is not white people it's not black people it's not Democrats it's not Republicans it's not this or that or whatever it's not gay straight like it is literally the people we the people verse a very fucking rich very powerful very corrupt mechanism that apparently likes to fuck kids okay who are preaching to us moral points of discussion and telling us who we are and the quality of people that we have a Hillary Clinton calling people deplorables how long is Hillary Clinton known that Bill Clinton liked them young i thought here's a hint a long time that's right and and and she has the audacity to stand in front of the United States America's people and call the rest of us to plurables guys jump it on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think but that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is where we bring our headline up it'll get one of those two options and so what that being said are thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reach mom's video of her husband and a two two at daughter's dance recital hits all the right notes yes let's dive into it so Fox News article reading when it was quote unquote strongly suggested to Tony Papal that he wear a two two to accompany his three year old daughter and her very first dance recital he was hesitant quote at first i didn't want to i'm already a big guy and didn't want to bring more attention to myself Tony Papal of Glenwood Illinois told Fox News Digital quote i also didn't want my daughter to be confused as to why i was wearing one but at the encouragement of his wife his daughter's dance instructor and ultimately his daughter willow Tony Papal went along with the plant here's video yeah that is a big dude well yeah i mean he's a big dude he's six five yeah he's uh they got to do here somewhere yeah i don't think anybody's gonna say shit bro you're picking up from going to say shit right any some more yeah you never know fuck with some moments come on man yeah that's so that was cool that's fucking cry I think it's awesome like look dude this is to this is acceptable cross-dressing tell you actually you wanted to put that brother to do it yeah it looks good on you man no i don't think i thought you did a good job i mean i like you just draw the line let's draw the line there you know he kept the change just for my motherfuckers i'm so hard i still got it yeah i do this if you actually think yeah so what we got over this guys i mean what the who the fuck's gonna say anything this guy does whatever the fuck he wants bro this dude takes your fucking french fries and you don't do shit you have some more to me there's nothing more masculine than making a fool of yourself for your family yeah i i think it's cool to you bro yeah like real talk like i mean that video was cool and and i think like look how happy that little girl is show me remember that for the rest of our life so he was living on the internet that was cool man well guys Andy mat that's all i got yeah guys uh mat thanks for coming to show man absolutely great to see you guys all uh you guys see mat on a mondays q&a q&a f as well so um don't be a hell show the show never sleep in on the floor now my jury box froze fuck up oh fuck up stole counted millions in a cold bad bitch booty swole got a own bank row can't fold does a no here shot case closed closed
