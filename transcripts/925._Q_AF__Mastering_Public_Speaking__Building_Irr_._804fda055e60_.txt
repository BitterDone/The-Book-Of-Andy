Yeah. Okay. I literally wait. What the fuck are we doing? They hear all of this actually. Oh dude. Let's go. Now let's get our first call there man. Let's get Kennedy on the line. Kennedy. Kennedy. Let's give Kennedy a call. Hello. Hello Kennedy. Hi how are you? I'm good. How are you? This is DJ. What's going on? Nothing much. Just working. How are things going in St. Louis? Yeah they're good. They're hot. It's hot in Oklahoma you're too. How bad? So what's our Kennedy? How can we help you? Well I mean first I know you guys hear this all the time but I just wanted to thank you for all that you do through this podcast. The lessons and the wisdom that you guys have shared has just completely changed me professionally and personally. So just thank you for that. So what I was just wanting some advice on I work for an incredible organization and I've recently been invited to attend meetings with our executives and leadership and during or one-on-one meetings with executives I feel like I perform well. I know how to collaborate and how to give ideas and help the organization grow but during like large group meetings with the entire team I feel that I'm the quietest one I freeze under pressure and I don't know if it's the fear of saying something wrong or just the pressure getting to me. So just any advice that you could give to maybe help maybe push through the uncomfortableness of these large group meetings. For sure I think this is something that a lot of people struggle with. I think a lot of people really end up in a place they don't want to be in life because they lack the simple courage to speak up and say things when appropriate and I can tell you for I'll give you two perspectives one for me. I was never comfortable in front of a group of people that is not something that was natural for me. I remember the first meeting I gave that was like an official meeting and I stood in front of like I don't know 10-12 people and I mean I was scared to death dude I was scared to death. I had a one sheet outline I had never really given a meeting. My hand was shaking I was nervous I was sweating I did I drank a beer before before the meeting to try and calm down like that was my dad's advice my dad's like drink a beer you feel better so I got a beer and I drank that didn't work and I was terrified and I read the I read the meeting you know and it like dude imagine what you guys think of me personally now being able to deliver a message versus the complete polar opposite and that's where I started at and I say that because it's important for everybody to understand that even the people that you look up to you think are highly skilled at certain things they didn't just come out of the wound that way they weren't born that way and I don't have a problem admitting that I was not very smart I didn't know how to speak I was scared I was timid I was afraid to to really do anything and the only reason that I ever did anything is because I had to do it and it put me in a position you know with business where I was forced to take action even when I didn't want to there wasn't an option for me not to do it and if I didn't have that pressure I wouldn't be the person that I am today so just to start and this is for you Kennedy and for everybody else listening this is a skill that you have to develop and that's what we have to look at it is a lot of people look at these things and they say well I'm not very vocal and I'm not an I'm an I'm an introvert and I'm not extroverted and this and this and this look dude the world doesn't give a shit if you're an introvert what it cares about is do you contribute and the world's not just going to take it easy on anyone because they have a little bit of fear of saying the thing and people are going to say oh well you know he's an introvert or she's an introvert and give you points for that no one no one cares and so what happens is people think because they identify themselves as an introvert that gets them off the hook from actually having to speak or say or do or be assertive and if you don't do those things if you're not assertive you never get recognized and you'll never move forward and that is the ultimate conclusion that we have to come to for those of us who are not comfortable naturally speaking our minds or being in front of people and the way that we conquer that is we put ourselves intentionally in positions where we get reps at that and I was very fortunate through building multiple companies to have opportunities to give meetings and sit in meetings hundreds thousands of times which then made me very comfortable um I had the opportunity to speak in front of our company which is now you know 500 people thousands of times which got me reps at speaking and so now I'm comfortable and it's just like anything else we have to take our skill sets that we are weak in and we have to make them strong through repetition and practice and so with all of that being said the first thing that we have to do is look for opportunities to assert ourselves so when you're in a meeting and you're in this situation and you have all this pressure and you're freaking out and you're saying oh you know I don't I don't want to say this because I might be wrong or I don't want to say this because I I don't want to sound stupid or this or that or this dude that should become your trigger to speak okay because what damage can you really do all right if you're someone who is an intelligent person and you're sitting there and you're coming up with ideas and answers that you know you can contribute to the mission and you're talking yourself into being quiet what that usually means is that you're a highly intellectual person because you're overthinking what's actually going on all right and you have to remember that whatever comes out of your mouth is probably going to be pretty good because the dumb mother fuckers they're not hesitating you know what I'm saying they're raising their hand and just spouting shit out you on the other hand are thinking very calculated you're listening most of the time and speaking when it's appropriate and that should give you confidence because you have the awareness of when I should speak and when I shouldn't speak that when you feel you should speak you should okay you know that you have something to contribute you should do that all right now that's the that's the carrot that's the positive part you can always work this skill in you can always become better you can always learn the skill and you should everybody should but here's the the stick all right this is the part that hurts if you don't do it if you don't speak up if you sit there and freeze up you will never move forward because you are not displaying your value to the team and not only will you never move forward eventually when they start looking at who's replaceable and who's not they're going to look at the people who are quiet even if the people who are quiet are highly skilled and really good if nobody knows they're highly skilled and nobody knows they're really good and they don't speak up for themselves they're going to get cut from the okay even for lesser skilled people that speak up because the perception is people who are willing to contribute are smarter than the people who are staying quiet the perception from a manager or a leader or an executive is usually not always usually and when I say usually I mean in the upper 90 percent the perception of the quiet person is going to be that they bring less value that is what you have to understand and that's reality it might not be true but perception is reality in life and business and so you have to really really really really start to force yourself to contribute if you want people to recognize the value and a lot of people have the problem with this because they see themselves as humble and they see themselves as I'm bragging if I if I talk about the things I do good or say the things I do good look guys if you don't touch your own mother fucking horn nobody's going to tutor for you the world will pass you up the world will ignore you and you'll die with all this shit on the inside I could have done this I could have done this I should have said this I should have said that when in reality dude you got nothing to lose by saying it so it's it's a very mental it's a mental mind fuck that we all have to work through and it's also a lack of skill that we all have to work through and this is not exclusive to Kennedy this is something that almost everybody has and for you guys who sit in meetings and sit in you know your entrepreneurs right you're trying to contribute you have to ask yourself how much are you really contributing if you're holding your ideas in inside you how how valuable are you because employees tend to have this mentality and this is very very very wrong they have this mentality because they know what they know they know they have all these ideas and they have all these things and they've got all these things they think should be done but they never say it and then when they end up getting passed over they get bitter because they feel like well I know more than that guy and I'm better than that guy and I blah blah blah than that guy yeah but nobody fucking knows it dude because you won't open your mother fucking mouth okay so the reality is unless you open your mouth unless you have the courage to speak up unless you contribute you will be seen true or not as someone who is less valuable so I would encourage you to use that nervous feeling of I'm not sure if I should say something as a trigger to say something and once you do this five six seven times you're going to realize hey man this is this is this is great this is this is working out people are receptive to what I'm saying and even if they aren't you're on record for saying what you said and if things don't go right you can always say yeah well that's why I suggested that six months ago I'll tell you a real-world example for me I have very few meetings that I attend anymore I'm chairman of the board of first form I'm chairman of the other I don't have an active role as CEO anymore any of my companies so chairman is what I do I I sit in on big picture meetings there's one meeting that I sit in operationally that is a regular meeting and that is a Wednesday you guys will see me post it I'll post a picture we'll sitting at the big long table this is I am first form that is our creative department okay that is just our creative I sit in that meeting and we talk about all the things offense I call it offense okay all the things we're going to do for getting people in the top of funnel for the brand the marketing the the experiences the activations we just go through all of those things I started that one year ago in august where I was sitting with these guys in that year there has been two or three people in that meeting who when I started the meeting I didn't know if they really belonged here I thought what does this person actually do why is this person here what do they do and I kind of went in with a negative attitude of like all right we got some people here that probably aren't going to be here a year from now because they don't contribute and a few of those people I'm happy to say I was completely fucking wrong about because I sat in the meeting and I encouraged everybody to speak up and then these specific people I'm talking about started speaking up and to the point now we're a few of them I'm like fuck those are the motherfuckers those are the people holding it together those are the people that are actually making shit happen and had they stayed quiet which they had before I'd never seen them contribute I'd never seen them talk my perception was actually the exact opposite of what they were actually doing and all I had to do was get them to talk okay and now I have two or three new assets in the company that I trust I believe in who I think highly of that a year ago I was like why is this person really here and this is where we have to understand that we have to take it upon ourselves to speak up because dude like I was saying a minute ago when people start to get passed over over and over and over again and they know on the inside I have this skill I have that skill I have this skill I'm better than that guy well you're not you're not better than that person because you're missing just like a business bro you can have the best business in the world the fucking best business if nobody knows it you're not gonna have any customers I mean you're gonna go out of business so if you look at yourself as the product and you look at yourself as a business inside of an organization and the value is what your value is personally then you gotta do the fucking marketing and the marketing is speaking up being active contributing saying things pitching ideas putting points on the board obviously is the most important part but people gotta know about you dude and as much as we want to be humble and meek and say we're introverts and this and that nobody can do that for us but us and this is a big big big fucking problem with a lot of people because a lot of people act like this because they're good people man it's not because it's not because they're bad people they don't want to rock the boat they don't want to look stupid that we all have these insecurities but when it ends up happening man is they get passed over and passed over and passed over and passed over and then they get to be 50 years old and they're like fuck nobody ever believed in me no motherfucker you didn't believe in you because you didn't have the courage to stand a fuck up and say what you could do okay so long story short you gotta get over it you gotta force yourself somehow to contribute and you gotta trust yourself that you do have something valuable to say and that's where that urge comes from to speak and you can't stifle that society stifles us over and over and over again from the time we were little children they tell us you could be anything you want you could be an astronaut you could be president you could be a billionaire you could change the world but then by the time we get into high school you say that shit they're sticking in a fucking locker okay and our teachers are telling us to shut the fuck up and pay attention and that's silly and that's not real and you need to grow up and all of these social pressures contribute to us staying quiet when in reality dude for us to succeed we have to use our voice we have to be proud of who we are we have to talk highly of ourselves because that's what gets fucking paid bro if you look at the biggest names in the world that make the most money they're not the quietest okay kind of with Greggers when the highest paid fighters ever he's got the biggest fucking mouth ever who's one of the second most popular fun Muhammad Ali big fucking mouth uh you know we we look around at at the richest guys in the world they always got shit to say okay like this is part of it and this whole idea of I'm humble I'm meek I'm just an introvert that is societies and doctored nation doing its job on us because it the people who design these social movements to keep us quiet and quote unquote humble know that by keeping us quiet and quote unquote humble and small that none of the good ideas that we have or none of the solutions or none of the cures are none of the things that we will build become create will actually happen which makes us easier to control so my point in all of this is this if you don't speak up you're gonna fucking lose and that's that are you there absolutely right no you're absolutely right I'm just taking it all in dude if you don't do it you're gonna lose you gotta do it you gotta do it you gotta do it when I really don't want to lose and I don't want our organization to lose so thank you yeah and it just need the courage and like you said we get far self passes for being introverts and the world doesn't give you a pass that's correct and that's so good dude I've sat down with so many people in my years of running companies and I say why don't you speak up and they're like well that's just really not my style what am I paying you for dude I'm paying for your brain I'm paying for your thoughts I'm paying for your ideas I'm paying for your action real value isn't just doing the job real value is doing the job and then figuring out how to improve doing the job autonomously and that takes that takes thought that takes courage that's this is why I said I talk about this a lot privately but publicly I've said this a few times I think the biggest reason most people don't succeed in life is because they lack courage and people take that like as like they don't have the courage to start a business that's not what I mean bro they don't have a courage to talk to that person that they want to ask out they don't have the courage to to go after and say I have these big goals they don't have the courage to speak up in their meetings because they're afraid they're going to get laughed at and because they don't have the courage to do any of these things they end up living a life that they fucking hate and we saw this during you know the last the last few years where you know people didn't have the courage to stand up and say hey I don't agree with this or hey you know we shouldn't be filling playgrounds with sand you know like shit like that and like dude it was very obvious to me during the pandemic why people lose because they didn't even have the courage to say this is bullshit and unfortunately you know courage is one of the components of success so you have to do it you have to do it you just got to fight bro you got to do it it's impossible to win without it I love it you're absolutely right so thank you guys so much for taking the time to talk about this I'm definitely going to lean on courage more and whenever I feel that I shouldn't speak up is when I'm going to there you go thank you so so much you're welcome just use it as a trigger man the first time you start hearing that voice in your head like I got something to say and then that other voice comes in it says no no no you're gonna look stupid fuck that voice do it anyway because like dude that is what's going to end up making your life the way you want it love it yeah love it well thanks can you go get it done awesome thanks guys thank you yeah do you steal bro it's massive I wanted to I wanted to actually a piece on this how important is it to have the confidence on the actual subject matter when it comes to well when you know the subject very well it is a lot easier to to be confident about it you know the more you know the subject matter the less nervous you have to be you know one of the things that that I learned through public speaking because I know business and entrepreneurship so well and have lived it actually as my whole life 24 hours a day for so long like I can literally go out now unprepared and deliver really whatever they want like I can you see me do this oh yeah I will go to an event if I'm speaking and I will ask the person 20 minutes 30 minutes before the event five minutes before like hey what do you want what do you mean what do you want I'm like what do you want like what do you want me to say and they like think I'm joking yeah right right like they're like what do you mean I'm like what do you want like but the reason I can do that is because of two things one I know the content okay I'm very confident in the content and I'm so confident in the content that I have no problem no matter who it was it could be anyone on this planet could stand up in the front row and raise their hand and say I don't agree with you and I could back up my point and say well here's what I'm saying this is where it is and have an intelligent conversation with the smartest person on the planet about business period I know I can okay but two and this is another important part I have the right intent okay I know I'm there to help people I know I'm there to make people better so with those two things the knowledge of the depth of knowledge and the subject category and the proper intent it's almost impossible to fuck it up and and if you're in a meeting and you know what the fuck's going on and you have the intent like she said to make the organization better then you should have no fear speaking up at all yeah yeah I love that dude I love it man let's give another question go man question number two hi Andy Andy we sell a premium EDC everyday carry backpack built for professionals who move between urban environments and outdoor terrain um has a lot of really awesome features we've sold a few thousand units through organic traffic social content and word of mouth customers who get it love it um we've got solid reviews great retention and even some repeat buyers but we're hitting a plateau people like it but they don't need it our e-com data is telling us that people come to our website they browse they add it to the cart but they don't buy it our conversion rate is decent but flat I think we've built a solid product but not a killer offer so I'm stepping back and asking what would make this offer undeniable to the right buyer do we need a built-in power bank should we include a lifetime damage replacement warranty are we undercharging for what we've built or failed to communicate the price to its value so the question is what combination of messaging value stacking etc would make this product go from interesting to must-have without discounting our brand or pushing gimmicks well first of all that's very general information to ask specific answer for I would have to know the exact percentages of all of those things to answer that question but here's what I will say you've basically got a few different elements in play here one you got the product is the product good yes or no okay two you got the price is the price fair yes or no and three do you have the right people that you're marketing to and four is the message that you're marketing to them the correct message and these are the these are the basic elements of what we need to consider that's the that's the checklist basically yeah okay the product's got to be good yeah the price has to be right we have to be targeting the right people and we have to be targeting them with the right offer and so one of those four things is likely off now you want to preserve the brand perception of premium which means you cannot lower the price to adjust to sell more because if you lower the price there is a price value correlation that will be violated and people will see your product as lesser quality so that is off the table which means you have to figure out a way to add value on top of that or you're going to have to adjust your messaging uh and your in your audience okay so I don't know your messaging I don't know your audience I don't know what you're offering on top of it but without knowing any of those things um it seems very very clear like dude actually it's not clear because I don't know when you say it's selling okay I don't know what that means when you say people are coming to the site I don't know what percentage that is I would have to know those things to know what the fucking problem is but and to answer the question in general these are the elements that we have to look at and adjust and very very quickly most people will discount their product to a point of the perception being cheap when they're trying to maintain quality and they think they can do it with sales and discounts you know they think well look you know I can make the product price $400 that's not the price that people perceive it to okay they're gonna perceive it as what they paid for it so if you make the price $400 for this amazing premium bag and you're always discounting it to fucking $100 they're gonna see it as a $100 bag the bag is $100 correct yeah and this is a big problem that a lot of companies make but uh short answer to the information that's available you've got to look at those four elements you have to decide what is the right combination of those things that's going to maintain the perception that you want to create over the course of you know the brand life cycle I imagine that you're probably going to want to line extend into other things later you're going to want to take this bag you're going to make another bag and then maybe you're going to make uh you know uh an EDC over the shoulder carry bag maybe you're going to make a you know a difficult like some things to go in the bag yes so you can't get impatient when it comes to maintaining the brand's integrity in terms of the value of what the perception is of the brand you understand yeah for sure so so I would say without looking at anything else what you probably have is you probably have a problem with your audience and the message that you're delivering to your audience and what I would probably say without knowing is that you're selling to an audience that is more general not premium as versus an audience that would look for premium goods and I think if you adjust the that you're probably going to do much better yeah I think I think that that's an interesting point and and I think I mean it wouldn't I feel like this would be a common problem for a lot of entrepreneurs is like that that are selling goods or offering services is like what is fair in price you know what I'm saying like like how do you how do you make that determination on okay I'm offering this bottle of water what's the difference between this being a Fiji bottle that's fucking you know five dollars versus the branding and marketing yeah oh and product quality and quality yeah but I mean like you have to be pretty honest with all the process though right what do you mean like honest about how good is that fucking water to be able to offer it that high yeah I mean if you sell a premium fucking price product and it's not premium the word of mouth gonna kill your company okay you can't trick people you're not gonna fucking trick people by putting out a a low quality bag at a premium price premium customers are gonna be the ones that know a premium is and they're gonna get fucking pissed and they're gonna go all over the internet and they're gonna say don't ever buy from this company that's actually the old play that they ran for 50 60 years when there was no social media and there was no internet we had a ton of companies that would make shitty ass products charge premium price for it but there was no avenue for negative word of mouth to come back so they could get away with it and they made trillions of fucking dollars collectively and this is why the the older people have this messaging of well if that guy's rich he's got to be a scam artist or he fucked people over or he did this and that because due for a long time that's how business was there was no recourse all right nowadays it's completely opposite if you make a premium product and you sell it for a fair price people are gonna talk about it if you make an inferior product and you sell it for a premium price people are gonna be pissed and they're gonna talk about it and what you have to understand is they're gonna talk no matter what so what story do you want them to tell and so the story should be dude I you have to order from them it's not even it's not even a little bit question they make the best product they got the best service they they give the most value they're always there for me these people care like everything you could possibly do you have to do because this is the most competitive game in the world and when you're marketing or I'm sorry when you're competing for the story told about your product you've got to cross your your teas and dot your eyes perfectly because that's what you that's what you're competing against you're competing in business against the story that's told about every other brand that you compete against that's it and so your job is to make the best fucking story so that when people talk that person who runs into the you know your competitor who also has you know a bag they say bro listen to what these guys did they fucking look at this bag look how awesome starts with the product look how awesome it's like bro not only that they did this not only that they did that not only that they followed up here not only that they did this in this in this and then other guys like yeah I should not shop up with them I just got this bag yeah right so it's not it's not just as simple as you know what is the offer all the time it's it's collectively what am I trying to do with the company and then do I understand the value of a customer over the course of life not just in a statistical LTV term but in a story term okay look dude like I'm in the fitness industry okay for the most part every company that I'm in almost every company I'm in deals and consumer goods that people consume okay in fitness sometimes people work out sometimes they don't okay nobody really I mean I do and the people here do and a few of our customers do but people tend to go through phases I work out really hard then I kind of go off and when they go off they're not typically buying this or that of what we buy but that doesn't mean they're not a customer because they're going to be a customer again so we have to get the story to last longer than actual what you would define as the LTV statistically and this is kind of the point that we were talking about with Tim Grover was on about how sometimes the real story has less to do with data metrics and more to do with emotion you see what I'm saying and perception and so when you're selling a product you can't get impatient about where you're placing it but you have to do everything I'm not a big I will know I don't discount products I don't fucking discount products I don't I don't sell shit cheaper that's everybody's way to go and it's a race to the bottom you end up cutting your margin out you end up retraining your customers to see your product value less I had this conversation with a buddy of mine who had a big company at one time and ended up fucking killing it because he couldn't understand this concept all right when you sell things for a discount because you need to bring in sales and that's your like quote unquote secret weapon it only works short term all right the first time it works really well you're like fuck with all the money I made the second time it might work really well the third time it works a little bit less by the 20th time the customers are waiting for the shit to go on sale which means the company that you designed to operate on X profit is now operating on X on 50% of X profit let's say it's it's a bug offer okay so now your entire framework of your company does not math at all and you and most people don't realize that they're like why is the books not matching we're selling this in this bro your margin is cutting half because you got impatient to bring in the top line dollars the top line dollars don't even really mean that much you see what I'm saying so there's a lot of things that that go into this and a lot of it comes from experience now tell you how I learned this lesson in 2006 we ran and we do we were in a very similar spot is what this question is we had a seven pound protein a seven pounder okay now it's mostly five pounders but there was a seven pound that's a shit to the protein yeah yeah yeah and it was cheap protein so this is very cheap low quality and there's a customer for that right like there's a customer which I've never understood that I've never understood why if you're trying to get the best results why you would buy the cheapest shit it's not all the same but regardless there's a market for it so we were I was you know I don't know anything at that time I'm just kind of learning and I'm like here's what we should do it caught our cost on it was like 28 bucks okay and I'm like Chris got this great idea we're fucking loss lead the seven pound protein which loss lead means basically sell it for cost so you get people in right and we'll loss lead the seven pound protein dude and we get all these customers so we started running these radio ads and we called the me head special I swear to guys what we call it okay we called the me head special 2999 for seven pounds of protein bro the first day those errors those ads aired we sold we sold the fuck out we got more we sold the fuck out and I'm like yeah we're fucking rich like dude for for the next three months nobody came in the store because they stock their pantries they stocked up on this fucking product they didn't need to come in and not only did they stock up and didn't come back for three months I didn't make any fucking money on the first deal it almost put us out of business it almost put us out of business and that's why I like when I when I when I see people doing buy one get ones on consume the items that are on a monthly cycle I'm like bro don't fucking do that you know but what do I know you know what I'm saying I mean how much of that too is like just people not like not understanding that like the customer is a pretty smart and like they know what they want like they're okay with premium paying on on the product of course you gotta decide where the fuck you're gonna be yeah I mean dude some of the most valuable brands in the world are brand are are the most luxurious brands and real talk like if you made the best here's the the thing about building a high-end product not necessarily in consumables but in other areas because in consumables there's only so much high-end you can get right like there's you go to the you go to the stake store there's a fucking I don't know how much stakes are now but yeah right what is what what is a strip stake 20 bucks okay then you get the 40 bucks stake then there's the the $300 stake at that's wagyu and then after that it's bullshit yeah right everybody's like it's bullshit okay so there's a limit there yes so so you have to decide where you want to be do you want to be in the in the good do you want to be in the better or do you want to be in the best and the thing about being in the best is that there's not as many customers but there's so much margin in it because the percent it's the perception in the branding and the marketing most of the time so if you made a fucking amazing amazing product in this bag that you know let's say it fucking is made of space age lunar indestructible material and by the way a great story goes a long way okay um space age lunar interwoven kevlar NASA certified space shit don't certify yes like dude and you and you go and sell that to the the right people are gonna think that's the shit okay um and then there's gonna be people at the low end and they're gonna say uh it's bullshit right but what do you do you you build a story around it you get it in the people that that would understand and see if they think it's the highest quality you work with those people you leverage their audiences and you take it from there but the point of the whole fucking matter is is that I personally think that selling the cheapest is not a good place to be because there's the there's way more people at the bottom of the pyramid of selling the cheapest product and it becomes a race to the bottom people your customers can never be loyal when they are work when they're going for when you're the cheapest product they're not going to be loyal because they're gonna care about are you a dollar more are you a dollar less I mean I learned this lesson in retail this is what retail business was such such a good business um back in I don't know it's probably fucking 2002 or three uh I had a retail customer come in and we were selling a product called myleplex light and I remember I remember this exact conversation because it was it was at the time it was the minute I learned what I'm trying to explain now the first three or four years in business people would come in and I wouldn't negotiate with them they'd say oh well so and so has a cheaper and I'd say well oh I'm match that I'll do that and dude I couldn't make any money because the customer's fucking started figuring it out and they would come in and they would just name a price or show it and I'd be like oh I'll do it you know I'm saying no any better so I had a lady come in one time and she was like she's like why much was your price on this myleplex light I said it's $2,999 and she goes well they got it down the street for $2,990 no yeah no no hold on she's dead serious looks at me in the fucking face they got it down the street for $2,999 and I'm looking at her she's looking at me I'm not saying anything because my response was just like what you just thought on the inside I'm like there's zero fucking chance that this lady is pressing me for nine fucking cents yeah and she's like can you match it and I was so irritated I said no no I'm not matching and she's like I thought you guys match prices I say it's $0,9 she goes well you said you I said well that ended yeah right what did that when you got stopped doing that right now she got her cars roll away she didn't buy I didn't care yeah fuck you you're not gonna put me out of business because you're fucking greedy for $0,9 and that's where I learned my lesson bro I don't want to fuck with the people I don't want to fuck with price shoppers I want to fuck with people who understand quality I want to sell products that are quality I want to feel good about quality I've always felt okay with people saying your products are too expensive but I'm not okay with saying the products not as good and that's where I personally live I like premium shit there's nothing about my life that says I don't like premium shit I like premium cars I like premium house I like premium watches I like premium people I like fucking premium everything that's where I live in every business that I'm in you somebody else might live better in a different business but that's where I like to play and when you play in that in that place of building the best product people recognize quality and it's an easier time to have those customer relationships yeah you can say it's ain't worth it it's a long answer no that's real it's a long answer the answer the actual question that they asked I would have to know the data points because when they say oh we're doing okay or it's this or it's flat you know flat doesn't necessarily mean it's bad what it means is that maybe you're not acquiring customers at the rate that you need to acquire you say oh I need to adjust the offer well maybe you're targeting the wrong audience maybe you're targeting the right audience in your your fucking ad copies terrible there's so many variables in that that's possible to answer but I think I gave you a lot enough value to help you figure it we have to start somewhere for sure 100 percent man I love it I love it let's get a call in we got a we got Nick hot and ready for the call okay let's give Nick a call oh Nick what's up this is DJ hey what's going on oh man you tell me man how you doing I'm doing good I'm doing good Matt can't dimmer Colorado so it's good day all right what's up Nick how you doing bro hey Andy good how are you doing I'm doing great man beautiful and then we're like 300 days of sunshine I know it is yeah we're we're the other sunshine state I guess yeah you're the better one the better way yeah that's true that's true all right so what's up bro how can we help you yeah man so first just wanted to thank you guys for the content that you do put out I I started as like two years ago I did 75 hard and just started listening to your podcasts when I was working out and just kind of helping me get through certain certain parts of 75 hard and then listen to never since and then and then like other things like my daughters three she's obsessed with odys and Charlie so just awesome all that you guys throw out there thank you bro that's great yeah so it's good stuff and and just speaking of your content and to my question so I just finished your book Andy mental toughness and at the end you talked about success zombies and it hit me like a ton of bricks that I'm a success zombie so it's really easy to like listen to podcasts and read books and get that hit a dopamine but was just wondering like how do you snap out of just that learning cycle or spiral and get into doing and take an action so like building that muscle to pull the trigger you know let me ask you this what are you what are you doing right now I mean I'm in sales so I sell health care software okay and what's your what do you want to do what you're you obviously feel like you're not doing something you should be doing what is it that you want to do that you're not doing oh that's a good question that's the first problem there bro you got to you got to identify what it is you want to do yeah you know because dude yeah I mean go ahead good no you go ahead yeah I mean in reading all these books and even the more I've been thinking about it there's like a tug to do something on my own and like inside of me but I just and comfortable where I'm at today so in reading these books it's like oh that sounds awesome but to take that that next step or that leap is scary so I'm almost like living vicariously through self-help books is what it feels like sometimes I mean that's a big problem a lot of people do that and that's why I call that's why I have a name for it man you know these are the same people that go to every conference they join all the masterminds they listen to all the podcasts then they start debating on who said what more accurately you know who's the best mentor like dude this is not that is not what this is about like this is about action and I got to be real with you man and I know I'm not trying to discourage you but if you don't have enough want and drive and hunger to go and make yourself go then maybe you shouldn't go maybe you shouldn't because the truth of the matter is the journey is so fucking hard and you have to want it so fucking bad that if you're even questioning it I personally believe that people are gonna get run over so you know you know that I would probably say a lot more harshly if I wasn't talking directly to you but the truth of the matter is go for it go for it well look I mean dude I said it whenever I had grover on you know if you got to be motivated you ain't got it if you have to be pushed you don't have it if you've got to fucking be told you know that it's time to go you might not have it man and I hate to fucking say that but if you do have it and it's something that you do want you're gonna have to want it more than fucking anything because that's the level of the game all right there's nobody in the NFL that kind of wants to play football there's nobody in major league baseball that kind of wants to play baseball there's nobody at the fucking top level of business that kind of wants to be wealthy and do business these people dedicate their entire fucking lives every living breathing moment of their existence to these goals and this is a big problem with the perception of the internet the internet makes it seem like we can just casually want things or sort of want to be successful or kind of want to be an entrepreneur and dude I'm telling you you can't you have to be bought in the game is hard it's not fucking intermural softball it's the world series game seven every single mother fucking day so my answer to you is is you need to really think about what it is that you want not two years from now but 10 years from now and then 20 years from now you're a young man I can hear it in your voice you have plenty of time to figure out what it is you want to do and go make it happen but that doesn't mean you have to that doesn't even mean you should because there's a lot of people and this doesn't even this isn't even a bad thing this isn't even a bad thing there's just a lot of people that are more comfortable and happier living a normal life and dude you got to be real honest with yourself about what you want because I see a lot of people jump into entrepreneurship not really understanding the game that they're jumping into and bro it fucks their shit up because now they don't have time for their kids and now they don't have time for their family and their wife doesn't understand because it's this drastic change and all of the shit all because we have these fucking assholes on the internet that want to sell you a course or a mastermind or some sort of book telling you how fucking easy it is it's not easy it is not easy I and I say this matter faculty I'm not saying I'm not saying this as an asshole I am a smart person I have a quarter century plus of experience of business bro it every single day it's hard for me every single month fucking that and so it's turned okay go ahead good yeah so my point to you brother is like you just have to think about what it is you want and whatever it is you want you have to go all in on it you got to make a decision you got to commit to it and you got to say this is what the fuck I'm doing because if you give yourself an out if you give yourself a I can do this instead or I can fall back on this or I could do this you don't you won't have it man it'll get too hard so you know yeah dude even you saying that I did 75 hard and if you go in the app I don't know if you can see on the back in but I've started it and stopped probably 20 times since doing it the first time and realizing is not that easy and I keep giving myself excuses well you and I realize that why don't you do this why don't you do it again and finish it do it again and finish it do it exactly right and finish it and during that time make it a part of your routine to every single day think about where you want to be and then when you finish it you make a decision about what direction you're going to go because that if you finish it and you do it the right way you're going to be a different fucking human okay and you will have developed a new belief and a new understanding in yourself that you actually can do anything you want to do the power of the live hard program is this it teaches people very simply how to act productively when they don't feel like it or when it's the last thing they want to do and if you have that power brother to act in a productive forward way no matter how you're feeling your chances of being successful at anything increase to nearly a hundred percent because nothing can fucking throw you off track so my advice to you bro is to do the program do it exactly right during the program think about what it is you really want study up read everything check GPT to death whatever you got to do become a student of the entrepreneurship world and then on day 75 make a decision about what it is you want to do and that's that's because that day 75 is when you're going to understand the power that you have and what your potential is and your decision making will be different at that point than it is right now bro and I want to say this you can do anything you want I have no doubts that you can do it I I know people people give me shit they're like I fucking tune in and Andy's yelling at me and saying he's better than no motherfucker I'm not saying that I'm better than you I'm saying that you're better than you and you people don't like here in that shit but the reason I know that is because I am no different than anybody else I'm no different than you I'm no different than any of these people listening it's hardest fuck for me I have to work extremely hard to be productive like the dude on the comment the other day DJ was like oh for cell it thinks he's the hardest dude in the world no actually the reason I work so fucking hardest because I know I'm a bitch and I got a fucking get the bitch out of me okay it's the truth that's the fucking truth and even you even you saying that like what scares me is when you give that not one year not two year but 10 year time horizon yeah and I'm doing the same thing I'm doing today bro that's like my biggest fear brother that should be your fear so now that's my regret that should be your fear how old are you 36 bro it's your time it's your time okay yeah you can do anything you want dude I'm not saying that from some fluffy ass way all right I believe anybody can but they got to become the person who can do it and that's the first step if you can develop the discipline the grit the mental toughness the fortitude to make decisions that serve your goals when it's the last thing you want to do there's nothing you can't do you can't be beat you can't be beat a hurricane won't stop you a snowstorm won't stop you the economy won't stop you people nobody can stop you like it's just because you become unbeatable so you know that's my advice bro and and don't take this as I'm discouraging you take this as I'm just telling you the truth because the last thing I want is to be one of these people that glorifies the journey of entrepreneurship to people who it's just not for and then having them be in a worst position than when they started and that's not what I'm about bro there's plenty of people that are very happy living a very normal life and to be completely fucking honest with you dude a lot of times I really admire those people I'm just not one of them and so like you know a lot of people will think oh you know because he's done well financially he thinks he's better than people no it's just the result of the actions I've taken I trust me the amount of mental strain and the amount of weight that someone like me has to fucking carry is very heavy and sometimes I look at other people who don't have that journey and I'm like man that'd be nice but like I'm not like that we got to be true to who we are what we are it you know my buddy Zoltan who's been you probably heard the episode when Zoltan was on the show from five finger net punch we were sitting at the house for six hours after the show and I was telling him I'm like bro I'm having a hard fucking time like I don't fit in anywhere I don't fucking get along with people I'm you know I'm always looking for a fucking fight even when there's not a fight I create one and he's like bro the world needs warriors too man he's like you ever think that there's nothing wrong with you and you're just here to do those things and I'm like fuck that makes sense that a lot and bro it gave me a lot of peace because and that's that's another thing the internet does is it takes people who are wired a certain way and makes them think they're broke because they're different than everybody else when being different than everybody else is a thing that makes you stand out and it's the juice it's the sauce it's the thing that makes you special so don't let the internet convince you either way like you have to be honest with yourself am I an entrepreneur is this what I want do I want to commit this do I want to pay the price and I will tell you the outcome is fucking amazing there's a lot of great things about it and people people who say money can't buy you happiness they never fucking had any that's the truth you never hear a fucking rich person say that shit all right but you do have different problems and the problems are big however if I listen to the internet for me it would take me back to being like everybody else and then everybody here that I employ and all these think they would all suffer so we have to be very careful to not fall into the the fucking slices of acceptability of our lives that the internet provides dude you can be a complete hedge podge mix match whatever you want you can live in all these different worlds bro like sometimes I'm an entrepreneur sometimes I'm a fucking hippie sometimes I'm a wicklifter sometimes I'm a race car driver sometimes you know sometimes whatever I want like dude there's no fucking there's no mold that you have to fit into and I think people spend so much time trying to fit into these molds that they're not fucking themselves up so so on that's good like another yeah just another like the life stage I'm in with a three year old daughter too of like is the thing I need to because you mentioned your book a couple times too is like the thing I need to go a hundred percent on is that my daughter right now yeah yeah yeah and not leaving her behind yeah well what what what she gonna say about her dad yeah yeah what is what am I teaching her now whether it's going back to success zombie or a dad that's a doer right yeah dude you got to figure it out bro look you need you need to work on your you need to work on yourself for a minute get yourself get your discipline developed get your grit develop get your get your get yourself in the best possible high level condition that you can and then make a decision because then you know what you're working with and what you're capable of a lot of times when people are in this undisciplined's a perishable skill we all go through times in our lives where we have high discipline low discipline highlight that's why people who say well why do you gotta do 75 hard more than once I don't know why you got to shower more than once same fucking thing bro okay so we have to look at discipline as a as a fucking thing that goes up and down and if we make decisions when we're fat and unhealthy and not disciplined of course we're not going to believe in ourselves because our product sucks but when we take our shit seriously we believe in ourselves we are confident we're understanding what it is that we can do we believe in ourselves we fucking have grit and fortitude we just pushed through some of the hardest shit make a decision then because that's the person you're supposed to be and that decision will lead you to your highest potential outcome we are not here to fuck around man you I'm going to tell you this I believe that if you stay where you are you're gonna regret it I'm just telling you that as you're fucking big bro all right yeah so do do it I'm telling bro that's true yeah go do go do the thing get yourself in that highest mental place force yourself through the program bro do not fucking quit make it happen if you got to be out there three in a fucking morning doing your shit do it then make the decision because you're gonna know who you are you're gonna know what your cape love you're gonna be very honest with yourself about what your cape love and the decision that you make will be the right one all right bro that's no vimber fourth Nick yeah number fourth we'll check back in with you yeah you better call back was that seven seven better days 75 days all right I was wondering if that was going to be part of the call yeah I'm saying you got two hours a two hours ahead you got you still got time today look bro 36 36 is still time but it ain't that much time luckily I haven't had a drink today so I can still do it there you go there you go it's big man all right well I'm gonna check in on you right number fourth I'm checking in okay all right go get it bro all right thank you do I appreciate you like what you guys do like wise brother thank you that's it all right these are good spot there you is like he at least he's asking himself the question early enough you know most people don't ask till they're too old most people don't even realize because they spend so much time fucking planning Thursday Friday Saturday booze faster party faster vacation or time off but they don't ever stop to think like fuck do what rode my going down I give Nick a lot of credit because it sounds like he's gonna be very honest with himself about what he wants and that's something that we lack in today's current social media environment they see guys like me who are out there driving nice cars living an awesome life you know and I'm actually one of the few people who actually built something real doing it but they think that like I got to have that because everybody on the internet's in this weird competition do most of those people are lying yeah the internet ain't the competition no most of those people are lying the competition is who do we want to become and what's going to make us fulfilled and how are we going to be happy and what are we what kind of life do we want to live along the way I love the life that I've lived along the way it was very difficult very hard but I like challenges I'm wired for fucking fights I'm a competitor okay now I'm surrounded by all these other people who are also hungry you were also competitors I love my life that I've created I wouldn't trade it for fucking anything but I think a lot of people in my life would fucking hate it just like I would hate being like them and that's not me saying they're a loser like a lot of guys get on there like oh you're a fucking loser oh you're telling me that this guy's a loser because he wants to be a good dad and he wants to provide but you know like like dude these things listen it's about what the fuck you want and it's about the example that you set and that doesn't mean you have to make a billion dollars it does mean you have to be financially successful at some level but it doesn't mean you have to go be an entrepreneur or you got to do the dude what do you really fucking want because there's going to come a day where you're going to have to reckon with that and if you're not on track with that you're going to feel bad it's going to be real bad so I just don't like how all these dudes on the internet make it seem like this oh you're going to get all this freedom and what the fuck are you talking about that's how I know you're lying that's how I know you didn't do it so you know and they don't say the shit you know why they don't say it like that because they can't sell it how you're going to sell something like this hey motherfucker this is the hardest shit ever it's going to almost kill you a hundred times it's going to cause you to want to blow your brains out you're going to lose family you're going to lose friends you're going to be fucking laughed at you're going to get made fun of you're going to be called an idiot you're going to be mocked you're like you got to solve your problems everybody else's problems and dude it's just relentless and not everybody's built for that not 97 yeah not 97 sign up it's not yet it's just not it's just not for everybody man yeah man that's real man that's real that doesn't mean there's something wrong with them though yeah what the one thing I can't stand is these motherfuckers are like oh a fucking guy you're fucking loser how how can you call someone a loser who's doing okay who has a family who loves their kids who's taking care of shit who's handling who's setting a good example they're taking care there's lots of ways to win bro you don't have to be an entrepreneur and that's one of the problems I have with the fucking internet especially with all these liars that lie about being an entrepreneur okay like that I think to take away from what I'm getting what I'm what I'm getting is just know what you want and be honest about what if you want if that's all you want that's cool if that's really what you want correct and a lot of people here's what they do and this is what you also want to stay away from they'll start off in life with these huge goals I want to be this I want to create this I want to do this thing and then they start trying to do it and it's really fucking hard and then they get to a point where like they're it's just like too much and they quit and what happens is they start telling themselves this other story to justify their quitting that they tell everybody else they say well you know what I I change and I don't really like material things and I don't like business and it's not all about money and this is it never was so why are you saying it now well you're saying it now because you're pretending like you always intended to have this life you're living now when in reality you defaulted and failed on what you really wanted and that's the most dangerous thing that people do because then they spend their entire lives being secretly bitter and happy because they were dishonest with themselves when in reality had they just kept going they would have been where they wanted to go yeah you know hell yeah man but dude that's a midweek pick me up yeah yep yep now I'm gonna go to another call yeah man well guys Andy that's all I got all right guys we will see you tomorrow with CTI don't be a hell show the shot
