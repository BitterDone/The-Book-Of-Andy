What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realest say goodbye to the lives, the thickness and delusions of my society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys today. We have Andy and DJ crews the motherfucking internet. That's what's CTI stands for. It stands for crews, the internet is where we put topics of the day up on the screen. We talk about what's going on. We speculate on what's true and what's not true because we don't know. We're going to give our opinions because this is America and opinions matter, especially ours. They do. And then we're going to talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on in the world. Guys, I'm not going to do the rest of the intro because I want to get right into it. I'm excited about today's show. But I will remind you that we do have a fee for the show. You're going to notice that I don't run ads on the show. I don't take money from people to talk about things that I don't use. It's not what I'm about. And I don't want to listen to anybody bitch about what I have to say or not say. I will say this though. If you have a good product that's awesome and you're not going to bitch about what I say, hit me up and pay me a lot of money. Fair deal. All right. But anyway, we have this fee. It means share the show. If it makes stink, if it makes you laugh, it gives you a new perspective. Please share the show, guys. We need your help to share the show. I'm going to ask you guys very specifically. Please at least bring me one person per episode that you enjoy. Just one. Just one person. Okay. We get censored. We get throttled. We get traffic banned. I need your help to grow the show. All right. So please tell whoever you can and get them over here on the team. All right. In the No. Ho zone. So don't be a hoe show the show. What's up? It's first form that they said you got to turn the nope. Is that good? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Yep. How's that sponsor? Yeah. Yeah. That's different. That's different. I don't run ads on the show. But if I did, I mean, it would certainly be for first forms greatest energy drink in the history of earth, especially as great for such a great flavor. Man, this is a really good flavor. Yeah. No, I will admit. Most of our flavors are pretty good, but we got a couple ones that I just don't think there's just one. Yeah. It's that cherry line. That shit is nasty. And listen, like, I mean, it's, there's a place where y'all motherfuckers drink that something wrong with you. There are people with a bite of fuck. Yeah. We so do we sell a ton of it. I don't understand. The fucking famous we Democrats. Yeah. Man. But I am, I'm going to say, man, you know, the orange, the traffic lightening, screaming freedom and the and the grape or my favorite. I mean, listen, screaming freedom is good. It's it's it's like a good solid fourth spot for me. I think. Yeah. And the citrus is underrated, dude. I think it's a it's a it's a hidden killer. The citrus is underrated, bro. If this if people get my all waiting in this room, dude, saying, listen, man, you would have that's probably why people don't drink it. Well, they don't want to have to replace the drywall every day. You know, yeah. I mean, the domestic violence charges there. Yeah. I mean, it's just not, but you drink a grape and it all goes away. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what's happening, man? You know, we got two CTIs in a row. We're back to back, man. Yeah. I think, you know, we're going to start leaning into these CTIs a little more. And you know, when we drop MFC, oh, that's where the personal development is going to live for the most part. I think we'll still do the Monday Q&A's, but I think the rest of the time we're going to rock out CTI. Yeah, man. They're a good time. They're a good time. Yeah. You know, watching that soon here now. Yeah. I think just a few weeks away. It's coming. Yeah. If you're not registered in my email list, you need to register because that's where we're going to give you all the details. I'm not even going to talk about it publicly, probably. Yeah. Yeah. Make sure you guys hit up on the other. I've actually been really excited about those episodes. Yeah. They're good. I mean, man, guys, we listen to you. We listen to your feedback. And we have a lot of really positive feedback about the, let me ask you something. Oh, really? Yeah. And so you were the star. No, they actually said the complete opposite. Actually, there was what they say. Well, listen, there were some allegations. I got cruise the comments in here. What did you call your cousin to be on cruise the comments? No, I mean, ask me something. They said that I was code switching basically. Oh, I was going to say that during the show, but I didn't want to embarrass you. Well, I mean, listen, whatever it takes. You know what I'm saying? Listen to the situation dig takes. Know your environment. Read the room. That's right. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. You know, I get it. I just explain it to me, man. I'm just saying. Yeah, wait till you see me code switch. Oh, shit. It is what it is. But it's been overwhelming positive feedback. People like the now for the people that don't know what code switching is. Let's explain that. Yeah. So code code switch is when you're around a certain group of people, you may speak, walk, talk, look, a certain way. And when you're around another group of people, you're acting a completely different way. And like, but here's the thing. Everybody I feel like code switch is at some point. I get some point, right? You go to work. Do you go talk to your boss? How you talk to your friends? I probably didn't help that you were wearing like a fucking golf house. I probably didn't help. I look like a very you look like you just walked off the fucking masters or some very present father. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I mean, but like shit, man, what does a black person supposed to look like? Misc, low-spezist. Misc, what? Misc and Dima. The guy that interfere. Misc? Yeah. That was his name. He's rapper. Oh he is. Shocking. No he's cool. What? Shocking. No he's actually cool. He's got decent more following and stuff too man. We we connect it. So so you got a celebrity. Yeah. That's pretty awesome. From there. I mean stop. We're you trying to bait me into into code switching right now. No. I'm just saying it's cool to meet celebrities at the mall. Get their opinions on the goings on. Yeah man. Hey it's cool. But a lot of people have been at they want to see the other and they've been asking. They've been asking. They want to see the other interviews. So I figured let's just get into it. I got something. Oh my dot put this together. Shout out to my dot. Free my boy. Mid hat. Let's check it out. He even made this little cool graphic. Oh yeah. Yeah. So guys let me ask you something. Let's check this out. This is the full the other three interviews we did that day. I thought they were actually pretty decent. Let's check them out. What's up guys. I'm DJ today. We're at the St. Louis gallery of mall. Let me ask you something. So bite and just dropped out. Yes. Of the race. What's your thoughts on that? I'm glad he dropped out. You're glad okay. I feel like I feel like he's too old. Okay. Well it's a little too late. I think it's the right move. I wish he would have done it a year or two years ago. Yeah. I agree with you. Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe. Joe by he old. He too old. He too old. So Kamala has stepped up to take the nomination. Right. So she's going she's she's running on the Democrats off of president. What's your thoughts on that? First black woman. What's your thoughts? Can she win? I think she can win because like I said I'm not a Trump fan. Why is that? It's not for us. What do you mean by that? I've heard I'm not a big political person. I've heard that he's going to do a lot of cutbacks as far as the state and federal funding as far as my business. Not a secretary. I can understand. It's going to take me financially. Sure. So I'm looking at that aspect of how the country is going to be ranked. So my business is very essential. Yeah. I completely understand the word. Yeah. So they need we need a child here. I'm looking for someone that's going to represent me in an asset of my personal finance. I've always been a fan of Kamala. Well she I mean to not to cut you off. She doesn't she doesn't make she doesn't come across as real powerful. It doesn't have a powerful presence. Sure. Which I think hurt her against somebody like Trump who just makes crap up left and right. Yeah. But I I I I've when she initially ran for president. I was a supporter. I thought she was pretty good. Yeah. I agree. I love Kamala. Is she really not going to go out with things going on in the country? I don't I don't think so. Yeah. I don't need her. Yeah. We'll see that. I don't want to just vote for her. Oh she's a female. Oh she's in she's in a sorority. Like my door both my doors are in that sorority. So they like oh you she vote vote for her. Like what is she going to do for us? Right. Not just because you have female not because you did so that. But what are you going to do for the country? That's real. I'm not really I'm not really up on what she's doing and what she's done. But I don't see anything that she's done. I mean she's done a lot of really really awesome things. What's what's one of your like favorite policies or anything that she's like subozard? Probably probably that her approach on women's issues on on getting back some control their bodies. Yeah. Yeah. I like that one too. My favorite was like the way she did when she was Attorney General in California. Oh I think she was outstanding isn't she. She's held a prosecute. Yeah. Got a lot like you know arrested a lot of people got a lot of people on those you know getting the drugs off the streets and things like that. Yeah. She certainly is is one of the more qualified people to be running right now. From who? First black woman running for President. What's your thoughts? Now I understand that she is a black woman and I support my black people fully. But when you look at what we stand on as America you I mean we that's the biggest house in America you know what I'm saying? So that's saying like the man's role is completely changing and I just I mean I think we all can agree too like I mean just men and women were different you know I'm saying it so women can lead typically more with emotions men can lead for sure. So like I mean we talk about you know putting her in charge of the whole country exactly. Nuclear codes war you know how many I get cussed out of my house all the time you know I'm saying because I can imagine what there's going to be like you know I'm saying now that there's a lot of rumors that you're afraid of right they can come out with a lot of stuff right now trying to bring up her past and say that she's kind of like for lack of a better work kind of slept her way up to the top. What's your thoughts on that? Absolutely not she's she far too qualified. When Kamala was a senator a lot of people don't remember she was still a senator. She signed into bill do you remember the bill that she signed about trying to bring or give cloning rights for the traceritops? What was your thoughts on that? I don't think she did that. No it was it was a sponsor bill. Yeah she was like a five million dollar bill. I have no idea about that. I don't know. To me that was one of her favorites. Let me actually find a question. Do you do you really think that the United States at this time we're ready for a female president? Long overdue. Okay. You know my mind you look across the world and most of the major democracies in the world have had quality effective women as their leaders. Margaret Thatcher. The woman in Germany I can't remember name right now but yeah. Yeah so great don't remember her name. Yeah. Germany has become a fucking shit hole. That little dude he was even nervous. Yeah his girlfriend was like right right in front of us. She's black woman. Yeah she was well he was scared. You can see the fear in his face. Watching the whole time. Yeah. No. I could cussed out of my asshole. Bro he looks at you like are you crazy? No it's cool though man. It was all right. One too bad. So we'll see how that goes. We gotta get you out there with those man. Oh yeah. Let's go cruise the hood. Let's do. We won't be going to go to Hampton. I'll take you to South Hampton. Hampton. South Hampton. You're a man. Tech it. Yeah man. Well guys let us know what you guys thought about that segment man. Would that being said let's get into some of our headlines. We got quite a bit here today. As always if you guys want to see any of these articles, these pictures, links, videos go to Andy for seller.com and you guys can find all of that information linked there for you. So with that being said headline number one. Let's get into it guys. Headline number one reads. Secret service head Kimberly Cheetle resigns after shocking failures led to Trump assassination attempt. Shocking. Yeah. We're really shocking that she resigned. I don't know what kind of is. She seemed pretty defiant. I thought she was gonna. I mean yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She did. There was no signs that she was gonna drop out. I mean she seemed very defiant. Very much so above the law. You know if you're running the secret service and you start to get an ego about it, I mean I could see where you would think you're above all kinds of repercussions because she probably has been for a long time. You know she's probably been untouchable. She's probably done all kinds of weird shit and nobody's ever messed with her. Yeah well I'm like and here's my thing to you man. To like all of these congressman and representatives. That's not a win. Right? Like no there was talks about you know we talked about yesterday. It was talks about you know perjury charges. It's talks about competing her personal phone. That stuff can't stop. Yeah. Just because this lady drops the fuck out. Right? No. No. I agree. No. She belongs in prison. Yeah. So you know so that so that happens. So she she put a put a resignation letter in. She sent a letter out to her to her agency and staff who's saying quote I have and always will put the needs of this agency first in light of recent events. It is with a heavy heart that I have made the difficult decision to step down as your director to the road. No letter which was obtained by the post. Now there's still more information coming out of these hearings. You got the FBI and play DHS is in play. A lot of which there's representatives from those agencies that are defying the subpoenas of the Congress. So that's interesting. But one thing I really I thought was very very interesting. I wanted to point this out is that this this article comes out from by Bart Kimberly Cheetle says no radio communications were recorded on Trump shooting day. How convenient not only convenient I'm almost I'm almost fairly certain that's illegal because let's dive into this little bit and I get to why I believe this was illegal. Okay, but in an obvious effort to protect and peach department of Homeland Security DHS director Alex Zandrow or Alejandro Maierquez. Secret service director Kimberly Cheetle pretended to testify Monday before the House oversight committee about the shooting of former president Donald Trump. Her obvious assignment was a stone wall hide behind ongoing investigations and simply refuse to answer questions she hadn't the answers to. One question that was answered is a total bombshell during our testimony Cheetle admitted that sometimes radio communications between secret service details are recorded. But quote we do not have radio communications from the day of the assassination attempt. Here's the video in the transcript where we learned of yet another jaw dropping failure and an event filled with jaw dropping failures. Now again I want to because they keep using this you know old jaw dropping. It's not a failure. It's the same narrative that they build around Joe Biden of incompetence and being seen now. This is bullshit. Okay, it's not a failure. It was intentional. Joe Biden is not incompetent. It was intentional. Everything he's done has been highly intentional. Everything. If you believe that Joe Biden is being run by all the people around him, which is what you guys are saying now what this a lot of people are saying. You know, oh, well, you know, everybody around him is making decisions anyway. He's seen now. Well, then you can't say that he's incompetent then like you can't say, oh, the people around him are making the decisions and then in the same sentence say, well, he's incompetent. See now, which one is it? It's intentional. And every single step of the way since 2020 has been intentional, including the assassination attempt against Donald Trump, that's my opinion. Couldn't convince me otherwise. No. And the more and more they come out, we have to be able to learn to recognize the conditioning that they're putting on us. When they continue to say incompetence, uh, senile, jaw dropping failure, they're painting a preemptive picture in our head psychologically so that we don't think outside that message. Okay. In the city. So not implicit. Yes. They they they are implying that to get you to believe in it more so than you would question any other alternatives. And if if it were actually the way that they're saying it was, it would be obvious to everybody and they would have done something about it, right? Like if the if the country was trying to do the right thing by the people, it would have been obvious a long time ago that this person is not making the right decisions. He's actually making decisions against the people. And when they continue to come out and try to paint this as incompetence or senility, we should be questioning why they're doing that. And then if that's the truth, then why are they letting them stay in? Why? So this you're telling me now this guy's too seen out of run again, but he gets to remain president. Right. Right. It's complete bullshit, man. But let's let's check this video one quick from the media. Look, dude, it's what I said yesterday. These people are all fucking working together or they're all total pussies. And they won't say the truth because they're afraid they're going to get fired or they're afraid they're going to bro, we're going to lose the motherfucking country unless some of you people come out and blow the motherfucking whistles. Period. Some of you people in the administration, some of you people in the secret service, some of you people in the media, if you give a fuck about America, you need to be coming out and telling people the truth. This is beyond okay. All right. Like we're going to lose the country if people don't. That's the truth. Yeah. Yeah. Let's check this video real quick from from from Kim Chital about the radio communications. Let's see what she has to say. Does the secret service routinely record communications between and amongst detail? Radio communications? Any communication? Email communications are captured as well as text messages. And then depending on the detail, radio communications are recorded. Does the secret service have recorded communications from the July 13th event? We do not have radio communications from that day. Now here's why I believe this is not actually let's include one more thing. You know the last time that they had issues producing radio communications and text messages and documents and you know for some reason they just didn't have it. You take a while, guess. Not 11. No. My more recent than that. January 6th. Oh yeah. That's right. Yeah. When they had that you know device replacement program and all the vital key information and key communication was deleted. Well, I mean what's different from this than the footage from the subway shooter a few years ago. Missed the cameras don't work or the supermarket shooter. The cameras don't work or the you've all day shooter. The cameras are out. Why is it always these technological failures and the cameras never catch these things but they'll catch someone littering. Right. They'll catch some regular guy like Daniel Penny sticking up for someone on the subway and then getting arrested for it. They'll catch that but they won't catch any of this crazy shit that happens that you know affects pivotal moments. Yeah. Exactly. And this is why I say this is illegal. People don't understand. It's radio communications, both local state, federal law enforcement. It's all regulated by the FCC. Okay. Which is why you can hear police 911 calls and the dispatcher speaking to the police officer. It's all recorded. It's it's it's federally mandated. The FEC is a federal organization and whether you're a local law enforcement, it doesn't matter. All of that communication is recorded. That's imperative. They use that stuff not only for trainings, they use it for transparency when these type of things or trials or whatever. It's bullshit. Yeah. And so you're telling me magically for this detail, this one detail, there's other details going on. There was no other issues with any of the other details, both for Joe Biden or Kamala or Jeal or you know, but just this detail on this day when there's a assassination chip, there's no radio communications, did you guys can provide? Well, of course not because they don't want to get caught for what they done. You know, and last thing on this, I think that I saw was interesting. You got Joe Biden. You know, he's been missing an action and we got a little bit more on there a little bit later. But I did find this interesting that he decided to release a statement praising director Cheeto for her for her career and service. This is the official statement from President Joe Biden on United States Secret Service director Kim Cheeto had his own little press briefing on the website. The statement reads quote, Jill and I are grateful to director Kim Cheeto for her decades of public service. She has selflessly dedicated and risk her life to protect our nation throughout her career in the United States Secret Service. We especially thank her for answering the call to lead the secret service during our administration. We are grateful for her service to our family. As a leader, it takes honor, courage and incredible integrity to take full responsibility for an organization, tasked with one of the most challenging jobs in public service. The independent review to get to the bottom of what happened on July 13th continues and I look forward to assessing its conclusions. And we all know what happened that day can never happen again. As we move forward, I wish Kim all the best and I will plan to appoint a new director soon. How much you want to bet that within three months, she suicide. Oh, yeah, she lives herself. Guarantee. Guarantee. No, she doesn't do it herself. I'm using quotations. I always take a hill. She is suicide. Yeah, right. Guarantee. Right. I might even be sooner than that. And it'll be those loose. I know. And it'll be worked up as she couldn't handle the disgrace from the, you know, mounting pressure. Right. Exactly. Yeah, for sure. Okay, Hillary. Yeah, man. Well, you're going to see all these. Listen, I promise you dude, it's just like those cops that got the Hillary laptop where there was 12 cops and fucking 10 of them were dead now, right? It's going to be the same kind of thing. These, the people who were involved in this are going to get killed. And like, dude, that's, that's why I like if you've been involved in this, you should come out and say something because dude, they're going to kill you anyway. Yeah. Speak now for the whole. You're peace. They're going to see people start, you know, trickle it out. You know, oh, by the way, this woman died. She was famous for her failure at the this, right? Like that's going to start happening. And who knows if these people actually, I mean, bro, they might just ship them off somewhere and you know, send them up there with clouds. Let them chill out there with him for a while. No, but she's gone. They're, these people are going to start dropping. Yeah. I guarantee it. Yeah, man. Guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments. What you guys think? With that being said, let's go cruise some of these, man. People were hot today, right? This first comment comes from Ed Silvio, underscore, Rosie says, is Andy only allowed a certain number of F bombs per episode at an hour and 10 minutes in? They started getting cut out for me. Yes. That's correct. I am only allowed a certain amount by YouTube. You know, after YouTube told us specifically and offered us money to come on their platform and launch their podcast on their platform, we were promised no censorship. We were promised free traffic flow, which has been 100% not true. Okay. And if you want evidence of that, go look at the views on CTI and then look at the views on Q and A F. And then on audio, CTI outperforms Q and A F almost two to one. So, um, backs, they, they lied to me. And yes, they have a number of F bombs that they do not allow to, uh, to go in to go in. Yeah. So if I do more than so many F bombs in a certain amount of time, um, they cut the traffic or they put, uh, what do they call it? Uh, age verification or they'll just remove that episode dumb shit. Yeah. So, yes, that's why summer bleeped in some art. Yeah. Good eyes there, Silvio. Yeah. I've been trying to intentionally bring down my cursing because it's, it's dawned on me that I'm a grown man now. And I have, I have like younger kids that listen to me now, who are 16, 17, 18, 19, and, uh, I'm trying to do better. So, hey, you're better every day, man. Yeah. I'm proud of you. It's very difficult. I'm not saying I'm doing better. I'm saying I'm trying to do better. Right. Uh, there's real man. Next one, uh, this one comes from at TJ Coole. I'll help you out, DJ synonyms for interesting, amusing, compelling, curious, delightful, fascinating, impressive, intriguing, lovely, refreshing, striking, thought provoking, unusual. Do I say interesting a lot? Yeah. Yeah. Well, you always say nothing. That's interesting. Well, it is. It's fun. I've never really bothered me. All right. That's stop provoking. I'll try some of these. Okay. I'll try some of these. That's lovely. That's delightful, fascinating. Yeah. It's impressive. Yeah, refreshing. Pull your pants back up. All right. That's unusual. All right. This next one comes from Ed Sal. No, Saul. It's all Saul. Yeah. S a U L. That's all right. It's all. No, it's all. S a U L. It's all Salas S a L. So Saul. Saul. Saul. Like S O L. How would you say S O L? So like pine Saul? Yeah, pine. Okay. Pine Saul. Yeah. Saul. Saul. Ruez 94 67 says DJ spoke different out in the streets. Yep. That's called code switching. You should try sometime. My get you a job. You know what I'm saying? It might get you a job. I'm saying, man. Oh, man. That's good. Hey, it is what it is. Hey, I, I, I'm at that. Appreciate that, my nigga. Yeah. Yeah. This last one, this last one comes from that Randy Yuri 4772 says, yo, he said I want to torture that bitch. Yeah. Who's with me on that? Tell me in the comments, bro, we need some real punishment. I mean, we need some people to pay the price so people stop fucking around. Bro, this is our country. This is not their country. This is our shit. Not their shit. They don't have a right to lie to us. They don't have a right to do all this shit that we are supposed to know what's going on. The CIA and classified information. That's all new shit. This is our mother fucking country. It's not theirs. So the people that fuck with it need to be dealt with appropriately. That's my opinion. So water board all fucking day. I build a special waterboarding room at the fucking White House. Yes. Yes. I have a water board park. There we go right next to the wood chip. Yeah. And then after the waterboarding, we would have draw and quarter room, right? And we would have perch around horses hooked up to each arm and leg. And we would pull them apart and pieces. And then we would video it and put it on pay per view. And then we would take all the video to be the highest grossing pay per view ever. Everybody would watch it. Everybody will watch it. Mr. Beast. Listen, that's right. I will crush Mr. Beast. Okay. And we'll fucking take the money and we'll give it to the victims of the people who do the bad shit. That's a great idea. I mean, people will stop fucking around immediately. The only problem with the show would only be one season because everybody else would be like, fuck that. Yeah. Yeah. And when's the next one? We have too much empathy and too much fucking tolerance in this country way too much. Okay. When it comes to now, I talk to the shit that shouldn't be tolerated. Violent shit. Right. And conspiracy criminal shit done by people who make our life harder for their life to be better. That is not what the fuck this country is about. So yes, I stand by my statement and water torturing would just be the appetizer. Fuck it. Oh, like me. Waterboard 28. I love it. Oh, I love it. I love it. And put your we'll have you standing like on a surfboard. Yeah. I love it. I love it. Guys, we appreciate all of you guys for being real ass fans. Keep liking. Keep commenting. Make sure you guys are subscribed. Hit that bell notification. So you stay up to date with the latest episodes on the tube. I was that being said. So think of you fucking bravehearted. Three of these mother fuckers on life. You just need one of hold on. You take Fauci. Okay. Who's the biggest criminal who's killed more people than anyone alive. Okay. And cause more economic damage than anyone alive. And did so because he's sick and he's part of a cabal and he's part of a fucking criminal enterprise that want to depopulate the country and take all of our resources so that we'll own nothing and be happy. And now who will own it then? Oh, they'll own everything, right? Sounds like a great idea. You take this little fuck and you put them on a table like Braveheart. Okay. And you tie them to the ropes and you stretch them the fuck out, bro. Like in front of everybody on TV for like three hours for a little time. Stretch, stretch, stretch. Then you lay them on the table and you got the guy on fucking TV, dude. This shit would end immediately. It would end immediately. There'd be one season of the of the big show. Yeah. And then it would be retired forever. And we wouldn't have to do it because people would mind their manners. Yeah. I mean, listen, that's how it used to be. Bro, I know people think that's crazy, but it is how it used to be. And that's how order was fought. Order has to be maintained for a civilized society, which means that criminals have to be afraid to break the law. They are not afraid to break the law. And not only are street criminals not afraid, the most dangerous criminals in the world, which are these fucking top level elite quote, unquote elite turds. They are not afraid at all. They have no fear at all. And the fear has to be reinstilling them. And that will come from the people. And eventually you guys laugh at me. Eventually, whether it's me or someone else, that will happen. And order will be restored. No. Amen. Amen. Guys, let's keep this cruise moving. Headline number two. Let's talk about Camila. Camila. Camila Harris. So they are starting the process of that the repeat candidates. Now, I don't buy into the shit. I know you don't buy into the shit. I think it's important for the people not to buy into the shit because even if they do name somebody, that's not going to be the person. I don't think by this. Yeah, I still don't think so either. I don't think so, man. I think this is all just conjecture. And I think this is all just them trying to, you know, like, you know, get people's attention over here. While they continue to do some fucked up shit in the vaccines, right? But you know, so you got that stuff happening in the vaccines, the back behind the scenes. Oh, yeah. Dude, I think I think we're in a situation for real where, like I said yesterday, I think they're hyping everybody up. And then everybody's going to realize that she's fucking dumb as shit. And they're going to keep dropped. They're going to be down. Yeah. And then they're going to bring in Obama. And she and then they're going to bring her way up. And they're going to count on that 60 days lasting as her up. Right? Yeah, for sure, bro. And I think, I think so, man, people listen. If people would vote for Michelle Obama, they have to be the dumbest motherfucker on the planet. The dump. We've already looked at the United States since 2008. It has it gotten way way way worse. And the source of most of those problems is Barack Obama. It started in 2008. It went to 2012. Then, uh, or 2016, then we got a fucking break from it for four years with no war, economic recovery, kicking ass, fucking all kinds of great shit. And it would have been better had they not fucked it up. Then they bring Biden in and Biden's part of the Obama camp and he destroys the country. So if you want more of what Biden's been getting, then yes, vote for Michelle Obama and she'll fucking ruin the country. And that woman who was telling you, you know, I care about my business as she seemed like a very sweet lady. That's super nice. But she was, she's misinformed. Yeah. Okay. Because Trump's policies are much better for the entrepreneur. And not only that, they're more beneficial to the black people. They are. That's the truth. And, um, you know, we could go on and on and on. But the point is, is that like, dude, she's used to not, like, when do we get in this position where people spouses were qualified to run for president? It's insane. It's fucking insane, dude. It's insane. It's insane. There should be a rule that if you are president, no immediate member of your family or spouse can ever run for president. No, I mean, because it prevents the family dynasty. We do not have dynasties here. And listen, for those out there, like, whoa, listen, I personally, I don't want another Trump in them. I don't either. You know, I'm just being fucking real. I don't need it. Like, yes, you came in, you did your shit. Cool. I don't want to think it's a son. I don't know where about your grandson. I don't either. Like, we don't do dynasties in here. That's not what this country's for. It's not what it's fucking built for. That's one of the reforms I would make. Yeah. Like, no, get the fuck out. Yeah. You know, I'm saying like, no, you did your shit. You know, I'm saying, but I have a prediction about the DNC, man. I think this is how it's going to work. You know, they, she has like a short list of like 10 people right now. And all, it's all your typical fucks. And I think they're all, they all believe that they have a decent chance of being on that ticket. But I think it's going to happen is that at the DNC, you know, they go around to each state and their delegates and they, oh, you know, the state of, you know, California will send, you know, our 27, you know, however many delegates and we're going to, you know, nominate. And it won't be any of these 10 fucks. They'll just start nominating Michelle. I agree. It's just going to go around the fuck room and everybody's going to roll. Most of these Democrats think that fucking Kamala's already the candidate. Right? Listen, they've already they've already nominate. They're so ignorant to the fucking process that we're talking about here. First of all, they don't realize, and this is not all Democrats. There's a lot of smart Democrats who are, they're, they're, they're really moderates is what they are and they call themselves Democrats. But these people don't understand that she's not the candidate. They have to go to the convention. The delegates have to vote and they might vote her to be the candidate. But they can very well, very easily say, no, we're this person, Shalom, I'm not, they've already broke so many rules. So it's like, it's not like it would be breaking any other rules. And remember, where is it? It's in Chicago, shatown, home of, yeah. Mr. and Mr. think of like them nominating her at the fucking convention, bro. And she just comes out, I'm like, oh, yeah. I had no idea. It's time for hope and change. We're ruining the country even more. Brody, it's sentenced for this country. Bro, I think, but I think that's honestly like, when you look at what's the best play. If I was like, it'd be that. No doubt, man. So you have that happening, right? Now, there was some weird stuff. Like I said, you know, Biden's still been missing an action. I do have something on that. You know, but did you see that fucking that that that call? Yeah. Into the office. Right. And like, I mean, people have been attacking that left and right. There's been talks that it was a I generated. You know, Kamala had a 40 in slip. You know, and like, listen, like, I think, you know, looking at it, it's like, it is very convincing. Right? Let's watch some of these. It does sound like a pre-record call. Yeah, it really does. And like, even Kamala's, like, her response, we know you're still on the work call. Exactly. Yeah. Like, it just seemed very scripted. Yeah. Right. And like, a script that they didn't practice more than once is what it seemed like to me. But let's let's check a few of these clips out. I know yesterday's news is surprising. And she doesn't hear, but it was the right thing to do. It's I know it's hard because you poured your heart and soul into me. They help us win this thing. Help me get this nomination. Help me win the nomination. And then go on to win the win the presidency. But you know, you're an amazing team. But we've got a great, great, I think we made the right decision. There's another one. Jolene, if I didn't have COVID, I'd be sitting there with you, standing there with you. I'm so proud of what you've all done. And I'm just so glad that I've been keeping me out of people's hair for the next two, four days. But I'm going to be on the road. And I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to just just kept me away a little bit. But you know, I want people to remember that what we have done has been incredible. And we get so much more we're going to get done. Yeah, so that's interesting. Now, now the interesting exchange is between when when Camino comes up and talks to Biden. It is so good to hear our president's voice. Joe, I know you're still on the call. And we've been talking every day. Stop that. You probably you guys play that again. So everybody can hear what she says. It is so good to hear our president's voice. Joe, I know you're still on the call. Stop. She almost says you're still on the recording. Okay, you can hear her say it. Very, very clear. She catches herself. Yeah. It is so good to hear our president's voice. Joe, I know you're still on the call. And we've been talking every day. You probably you guys heard it from Doug's voice. We love Joe and Jill. We really do. They truly are like family to us. That's a lot. And we do everybody. You can see on her face. It's brutal. I know you're still there. You not going anywhere, Joe. I'm watching you. I'm watching you. I love you. I love you. Now that's the first time we've heard. That's so fake. That's so, bro, it's she's completely lying. You could see it on her face. Yeah. Now I don't believe that was him. But here's the thing. There is a video that just came out at the time of this recording. And it shows allegedly Joe Biden exiting a vehicle and then getting on to Air Force One. And this is in Delaware. I guess he was leaving Rojo both. He uses the big voice areas, which they have not used in the last two years. Also, it was also the little Air Force One. It wasn't the president. Yeah. Let's check this out. Does she want him out there on the campaign trail? Or does she want to do this herself? I think back to the 2000 campaign, we'll build Clinton wanted to campaign for Al Gore. And Al Gore said, thank you, but no thanks. Here it comes. President, how are you feeling? How are you feeling? How are you feeling? How are you feeling since you dropped out of the racer? How are you feeling? Can Harris be dropped? Did Harris be dropped, Mr. President? Oh, yeah. It is a small one. Well, they gave it the old college try. They tried to get him over under the wing to say a few things, but he wouldn't answer any of their questions. Yeah. So, you know, take that for what you will. I don't know. One thing that I really wanted to bring up and address is because they're trying to stoke the flames of color again. It's very, very obvious. That's their only move. Dude, I get so sick by this shit. Well, but I want to show this because this is one of Andy's favorite people, Joy Reed from MSNBC. Did you see this video she did where she talks about Americans of color. They're going to look real crazy and weird if they don't vote for Kamala Harris in November. Why? Yeah, it's weird. Why would someone who has dark pigment in their skin look weird for voting for someone that had a different pigment in their skin? I mean, is that what we're talking about? That's exactly what we're talking about. That's exactly what we're talking about. Yeah, it's fucking racist. It is racist. It's racist. And it doesn't surprise me because she's probably the worst fucking racist on TV. This lady, she's a piece of shit. Dude, and she doesn't look well right now. Like she looks, she looks unwell. But let's watch this clip. Bro, of course she is. Bro, you know how sick you're going to be being that hateful towards people? Like, what do you think she says about white people when she's by herself and her friends? Like, she fucking hates white people. I don't think she has friends. Bro, if there was a white person on TV that talked like her about black persons, like dude, think about, think about that. Like, like a lot of people say, oh, there's no double standard. All right. If you had a white dude on TV that said the same shit that she says about black people, that she says about white people, what would it respond to? No. Every motherfucker knows what would happen. There'd be fucking calls for him to resign. His house would get burnt down. There'd be fucking, bro, she's a piece of shit. And this kind of race-baiting bullshit needs to stop in this country. We need to stop giving these people attention. She doesn't represent reality. People don't behave like her in the real world. It never happens. Ever. No. No, it doesn't, man. Who does it? Let's check this clip out, though, man. Hey, fam. Okay, I just got to say it. I just got to say it. No, you don't. Given the just stratospheric such as the versions of Vice President Kamala Harris into the presidential campaign, and she has now secured enough delegates to become the nominee, allegedly. You don't look real crazy being on the other side of that line, particularly as a person of color. But really as anyone who claims to have any connection to the culture, you're going to look real weird and real lonely on that side. The door needs to close behind Amber. And she look crazy over there. But shut the door behind her. You really are going to look crazy being on that side, given the cultural phenomenon of Vice President Kamala Devi Harris. She's about to make history. She's about to become the first woman president. She brings together the African American community, the AAPI community, younger people. She is a whole meme. And I'm going to explain to you all the quote, the co-conentry is a whole West Indian thing. She brings together all of the aspects of the culture. HBCUs, she's a Howard graduate. The Divine Nine, she's an A.K.A. She is a woman of color extraordinaire. She would be the first like person from HBCU, like regular real world to be President of the United States. In addition to being the first woman president, in addition to being the first black woman president, in addition to being the first AAPI president, she's bringing it all. And very importantly, she will be the first woman president after the fall of Roe v Wade. A woman who brings women back to power after having our power stripped from us by six far right wingers on the Supreme Court, including one woman who turned on us. They be? This is a cultural moment. Don't be on the wrong side of history. Don't find yourself on that lonely side because you don't look real crazy over there with Kid Rock. Don't go on that side because you won't be in the cool club. Don't stand for what you think and what you believe in your own mind and your own heart. Otherwise, we're going to ostracize you. Otherwise, you're weird. What are we talking to like fucking high schoolers? We talking to kindergarteners? What are we talking about? Don't go over there. You're going to look funny and people are going to laugh at you. And on top of it, that's about the most racist shit I've ever heard of my life. Okay, think if I got on here and I said, I'm only voting for Trump because he's white. I'm voting for Trump because he's because he's a white man. That's why. What if I said that? What if I fucking said that? Okay, but she could get on here and say, I'm voting for her because she's the first woman and the first black woman and the first this and the first that. Aren't we done with the first? Who fucking gives a shit? This is America, bro. Who's the best? Who's the greatest? Who can do the job? And I'm not sure that we have our best and our greatest available, but we certainly will pick the best available option. Okay, this is nonsense. It's fucking stupid. Okay, I'm so tired of this identity-powered shit. She will be the first this and the first that and the first this. How did that fucking woman, first woman of the director of the secret service go? How'd that go? How did how's it go for all these firsts in all these other areas that are totally incompetent to do their fucking jobs? Not good. Okay, yeah, no shit. How about the best? The best. I mean, I don't know what you guys, but don't you want the best person running? Don't you want the best candidate running? Don't you want the best country possible? Don't you, there's a country not important enough for you to realize that we need the best person running it and not just someone who is the first something because we want to celebrate it. Like it's absurd thinking. Bro, and this is not a time we should be trying to experiment with fucking anything. Our country isn't a fucking shit hole right now. Let's not do any type of experiment here. One, and then two, even if Kamala did become the first, I guarantee you she will be the last. I guarantee you. Yeah, I guarantee you too. We won't have a fucking country. I know. We won't have one. Yeah, we won't have one. Take it to jokes then. No shit, the last black person. Yeah. That's like me, bro. That's not going to be good for the history books. I'm just saying she will destroy this country. Dude, it's insane, man. And I think it's important to both because the thing is like say they're trying to stoke these fires that have already been put out. I believe the majority of this woman shouldn't this one. Listen, you should boycott every single company that advertises on MSNBC where this woman is or wherever she is. She MSNBC? I don't know MSNBC. Okay. Every single company that advertises on MSNBC should be 100% boycotted. Just like they did the Bud Light. 100%. This sort of racial talk is what is killing this country. It's what makes this country hard to live in for everyday people. It raises racial tensions. It makes people nervous. It keeps people from connecting in real life. These people are dangerous people and they have been given a fucking microphone and presented with a quote unquote opportunity because they're divisive. Because that's what they want. They want black people and white people to not get along. And that's the purpose of her character in this whole movie. She is the person, along with many other people who are put in front of the country to keep black and white people from figuring out that we are on the same team and that if we unite, their days are fucking over. Bro, that's to me too. It's like that's the same lady who in the same breath who also have this conversation about unity. It's the same point. Listen to that, go listen to that clip again. Do you feel more like more willing to be unified after listening to that? Hell no. Bro, you have to be a low IQ loser, loser dumb mother fucker to vote for someone because they're pigment in their skin or their genitalia. Dude, holy shit. It's stupid. Like it's no wonder you can't have any success in life because you're a fucking idiot. You don't know how to logically fucking make decisions that are good for you. Right? Oh, well, I'm just going to pick that one because they look the same as me. First of all, she's not black. She's fucking Indian. I'm black and I heard her kids aren't black. They're Jewish. Her husband's Jewish. Okay? She's not fucking black and she don't give two fucks about black people other than what they can do for her with their vote to get her in power. And you get her in power and they'll keep destroying your fucking communities the same way they've been doing for 60 fucking years. That's a fact, man. That's a fact. Now, on another piece of this, because again, they're trying to stoke these fires. They want more division. They want people to just, you know, because I believe people are unified right now. I believe they are. Huh? I believe people are unifying. Oh, yeah. I mean, dude, dude, I think I will follow up what I'm saying with. I mean, I think the percentage of people that are resonating with that kind of talk track, it's less. Hold on. It's a fraction of what it was four years ago. Yeah. Yeah, 100%. But that doesn't stop them from trying. And that's all they've got. That's all they've got, bro. And I want to bring this next little piece into this because I think it's important to address. I know by now a lot of people have seen the video, the body cam footage that was released of the deputy sheriff in Springfield, Illinois that had that shooting where he killed this black lady. That's right. Yeah. It's been all over the end and people have seen it. And just based off the body cam alone and learning some pieces of the back, the cop is absolutely in the wrong. What do you mean in the wrong? The guy is, that's murder. Fuck yeah. The guy fuck dude, this is the point. It doesn't matter if the cop is black or white. It doesn't matter if the victim's black or white. That motherfucker was pissed off and he got challenged by this lady who happened to be black and he was white. And then, I don't think you shot her because he was because she was, no, but he got fuck, he let his ego get involved. That's what it was. These cops deal with so much shit and they get so tired of dealing with bullshit that they have that sometimes they break. And dude, this motherfucker broke and what he did was wrong and he deserves to go to fucking prison. 100%. Okay. Like dude, this woman, if you ever seen the video, it was, it's disturbing. You can't hear what she really says, but she has a pot of boiling water on her stove or whatever. They have her in the living room. She walks over and I think she says something to the effect of, I should throw this on your face or something like that. And the cop goes, you better not, I'll shoot you in the fucking face. And then like she started moving the pot around. I don't think she was going to throw it on him at all. He pulls out his gun. She goes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. He shoots her in the fucking head. Kills her, no doubt. And again, like, I've got to, it's not a black, white thing. It's a shitty human being thing. And yes, this is what you get when you chase all the good cops out of the system. When you defund the police and you say all the stupid ass shit, this is what you end up with. You end up with motherfuckers that shouldn't be cops being cops. Yep. That's what I mean, dude, manpower issues, overworked under, I mean, there's a bunch of stuff. I'm not, I, one thing I really want to point out, man, and this is just alludes to the fact that they, you know, they will, I'm not saying that this was a deep state set up. And that's not what I'm saying. What the, the, the history shows us what they do with these events is that any event that comes by that they can try to use to stoke those fires, they absolutely will. Yeah. Joe Biden, again, we haven't heard from them. I don't think so either. But, but Joe Biden who has been broken silence in days, you know, he wants to say something about this. Very, very important. Today's date is the 23rd of July. Okay. It's the 24th of July when you guys will be listening to this. This event happened three weeks ago. Plus six. Yeah. Three weeks ago. Yeah. There was no, what, what was the, what was the, the statement from Biden three weeks ago? Where was the, the cries from, what was it three weeks ago? What was it? Right? Well, fucking, here's the headline. I just read it for you guys on the audio. It broke and Joe Biden breaks his silence with call for justice for black mom, Sonja Masi, after she was killed by white cop who shot her in the face. Isn't it interesting how any of the headlines that involve any black criminals never say black in the description? They just say, man, 25 year old man, right? But if a white guy does it, 25 year old white guy, right? And now if this happens, they have no problem, including the right, right? If you read between the lines, you can see what they're trying to do to everybody. They're trying to get everybody stirred up. And by the way, Joe, are you heartbroken over all the people who lost their businesses and COVID? Are you heartbroken over all the people that had to watch their fucking relatives die on Zoom? Are you heartbroken about all the people who took the vaccine that got sick and are now dealing with all kinds of medical issues? Are you heartbroken about the kids who were kept out of school and are now fucking struggling to even catch up two years behind their education? Are you heartbroken about any of those things? Are you heartbroken about putting our country in the most vulnerable position that's ever been in? Are you heartbroken about all the migrants that have come over here and raped and killed all these young women? Like I told you they were going to do two or three fucking years ago? Are you heartbroken by any of that? Or is it just this? So you could stir the fucking race shit. It's 100% this. Yeah. 100%. And justice. You guys already been arrested. He was charged with first degree murder. What do you want? What do you mean by justice? More fucking riots? That's exactly what the fuck he means. That's exactly what they want. It's exactly what they want. And listen, like I mean, we have to let this, you know, we have to let this play out. I believe, you know, this guy should go to jail. I believe he will go to jail. I don't really see him getting off. You know, it is Illinois. He's going to get his. I think he's going to get, and like that's just the he deserves it. He deserves it. But like he's got it like getting to prison. They're going to be the problem for him. He's going to have to survive in there. You know what I'm saying? Because like listen, dude, listen, I watched it, bro. And like, like normally like when a cop shoots a criminal, where they're being stupid as fuck, I'm like, yeah, well, that's what you get. Like the video that that was going around a few weeks ago, where they pulled over the car and they told the kid to put his hands on the fucking. I mean, he reaches for a fucker. He had a fucking AK in between his legs and he's got his hands on the dash and he pulled his hands off three or four times. And the cop goes, you put your hands off there again. I'm going to fucking shoot you and his got his buddy goes, bro, put your hands on the dash. And he put his hands on the dash, pull his hands off and went for the gun and the cop killed him. Sorry about it, homie. You deserved it. Like bro, normally I'm like, good. No, but this was the disguise. No, that was gross. It was fucked up. Yeah. So, so you got that I just, my read on that was he, my read on that was not, I'm going to kill a black person. No, my read on that was, I don't think it was racial at all. My read on that was, I'm not put up with your shit. Yeah. You know, but again, I mean, that's the environment that we put us up. Nope, bro, that's what cops do. They put up with shit. If you don't, if you can't put up with shit, don't be a cop. You know, but there's that last little piece on head on to apparently there's going to be a national address from Biden tonight this evening at APM Eastern time. He put out another tweet. You know, for somebody that hated tweets and hated people tweeting and hated, you know, me out, he sure does fucking tweet a lot. But he put out this tweet saying quote, tomorrow evening at APM speaking of today, Paul's Oh, that's tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow. Yeah. So, he's going to be delivering a speech tomorrow. When this episode is released at APM Eastern standard time. Yeah. So tonight when you're listening tonight, when you guys are listening, what's happening? Yeah. I was saying, but yeah, I just read it. Okay. All right. What? They put out this tweet tomorrow evening that that's today when you guys are listening. I will address the nation from the Oval Office on what lies. I'm going to tell ahead and how I will finish the job for the American people. That's how I read that. Oh, yeah. But the crazy thing is, man, like he gets absolutely obliterated. This account, all of his accounts, all of their accounts actually are getting obliterated from all of us here. Bro, they get destroyed. Yeah. The story because they don't have all the bots to use no more. You know, and it's just they get destroyed, man. I like this one specifically. It's from a parody account. Joe Biden press release parody. I'm actually dead. So, yeah, man, I don't know, man. We'll see. I mean, look, do you see holes? You know, that guy is at the cop. You fucked up, bro. Bad. Real bad. And not only do you fuck up, bro, you fucked up for everybody. Like that's now what the fuck we need right now. No. No, it's not. No, it's not. Yeah, guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let's know what you guys think with that being said, let's get to our third and final headline headline number three. Headline number three reads, Elon Musk says he vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after he was tricked into allowing his son to transition. Did you see this interview? Did you see the clip from this man? Throw this shit breaks my heart. Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of Tesla and SpaceX told Dr. Jordan B. Peterson on Monday that he was quote unquote tricked into allowing one of his sons to undergo gender procedures saying his child was quote unquote killed by the woke mind virus. So Musk sat down with Peterson for an interview that covered a range of topics and was streamed live on daily wire plus and Twitter during one segment. Peterson and Musk discussed children being targeted by doctors with gender procedures, with both men agreeing that the practice is evil. Musk called gender affirming care the left description of the procedures, a terrible euphemism. Here's the clip. It happened to one of my older boys where I was essentially tricked into signing documents for one of my older boys, Xavier. This is before I had really any understanding what was going on and we had COVID going on. So there was a lot of confusion. And I always told Xavier might commit suicide if he did. That was a lie right from the outset. Incredibly evil. And I agree with you that people that have been promoting this should go to prison. So I was straight into doing this. And it wasn't explained to me that puberty blockers are actually just sterilization drugs. So anyway. And so I lost my son essentially. So they call it dead naming for a reason. Yeah, I am. All right. And it's called dead naming. It's because your son is dead. So my son's ever is dead killed by the woke wine virus. I'm sorry to hear that. I can't imagine what that would be like. Yeah. So. Yeah, and there's lots of people in that situation now. It's not pretty. And lots of demolished kids. Yes. Yeah, well, that's a good, that's a good reason to be the final straw. All right. So let's talk about to destroy the my the woke wine virus after that. And we're making some progress. Join the club. Yeah. That's some deep shit, man. That's deep. Now for reference, you know, his older boys is yes, six kids. His oldest boys is who he's referring to. Here's a picture of before when they were young. And it's the one here on the right. This is Xavier. And then this is Xavier now. Obviously a lot older. It looks like he had the top surgery or whatever they call it. He has 12 kids. Six of the claims. Oh. I don't know. I mean, listen, he is South Africa, America. Yeah, I'm saying. Put that out there. You know, but this is it is a woke mind virus. It is a real thing that I think that does affect somebody. You know, and I've been seeing a lot of people try to like, you know, bash him. Like, how did you not know you're supposed to be the super smart guy? And I have a very unique perspective on this because it's like, you know, for those that don't have kids, man, it's like, and when you have kids, you will literally do fucking anything for anything, right? And I'm not talking about those parents that intentionally pushed this shit on their kids. It's not not talking about those parents. So those parents are fucking sick. But you do like build this just like whatever I need to do for my kids. And when you, when you're being told by doctors, people that you're supposed to be trusting, right? That, hey, your child will probably commit suicide if you don't do this or you don't that's not true. And it's not true. It's not true. Right? But again, like, there is a, there is a higher chance for them committing suicide post transition than there is pre that we know now. But I'm saying it's like back then though, it's like, you know, there should have been a reasonable expectation of trust with these fucking doctors, right? That they, you know, they have the degrees. I have all these fancy letters. It's no different than, you know, the shit that people bought into during COVID, you know, someone you have these doctors telling them not to take, you know, don't take Ivermectin, right? Like, these are doctors saying, you got a horse silly. Right. You know what I'm saying? So like, there's a, there's a part of me, man, that like really feels for fucking me, not having to go through this. And I guess now we know the truths of all of these stuff, like, because that was one of the biggest things, the time variable of this shit, nobody, we just, enough time hasn't passed yet to really know what the outcomes of all of this stuff is. You know, and like, let the left tell it, man, we're just attacking gender, firm and care. But you know, it's a good thing. And there's more states are now finally stepping up to protect these fucking kids from having to go through this. Well, I agree with them, dude. So anybody who's ever promoted this professionally should go to prison. It's wrong. It's completely fucking fucked up. And people are ruining their lives, bro. Look, dude, real talk. These people look like fucking freaks the rest of their life. Go on Reddit and live and read the D transition or threats. They're so sad, bro. These people wake up that study you just put up about showing that kids grow. This is the post, New York Post. We were public, we were pushed to transition as teens. Now we're vindicated by studies showing kids grow out of it. It's a fucking phase. It's a cultural phenomenon. It's goth. Except with goth, you can wash your makeup off and get some new fucking clothes. Okay, how many people dressed weird as a kid or went through some weird fucking phase? Y'all did. Okay. And it just so happens for these kids, it's cutting off your dick. And getting some titties and becoming the other side of the gender like spectrum. It's absurd shit that can't be reversed. And these kids who have gotten pushed into this, that is a criminal, that is a criminal act. These people deserve to go to prison. All of them. All of them. Every doctor, every single fucking person who's ever done one of these surgeries should go to jail. Fucking for a long time. It's sick of him, man. And dude, by the way, I'm going to say this too. You know, I like you on. I really do, but I don't, I don't, I'm sorry, I don't buy into that reasoning. Your job is to protect your fucking children. Your job is to say no when you think the answer is no. Your job is not to, you know, pander or cater to a kid. You don't even let kids get tattoos until they're fucking 18. So here I let them take permanently altering drugs or have different surgeries or like what the fuck guys? This is, they can't drink a beer till they're 21. But they can decide that they're a woman when they're fucking three or four. These parents with these little children, they say, oh, my children, my son is gay. When it comes, it's like the nursery is decorating gay propaganda, right? This fucking child abuse dude, that's grooming, that's child abuse, that is people who have kids that shouldn't have kids. And the men of this country are failing to be that leaders of their household. And as much as I feel bad for what he's saying, like bro, your job is to say no and put your mother fucking foot down. And I refuse to believe that there's any grown man in this country outside of the men who are mentally ill enough to cut off their own fucking penises that would say that's okay for my son. For real. Yeah. Well, I don't think, I think I'm not 100% sure about it. I don't believe he had the, I still see a bolt. I don't think he had the bottom surgery. But what he was referring to is the puberty blockers, he probably started taking some messaging. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? But like, yeah man, do you know how much do you, do people don't even understand this? Do you know how fucked up it makes a man taking estrogen as an additional chemical in their body? It makes a mentally fucking insane. Okay. Do you know how fucked up it makes women when they take testosterone, right? They go fucking crazy eventually. It's not nature. It's not supposed to be. This is some sick Frankenstein, Dr. Frankenstein, crazy bullshit that started in and fucking YMR Republic in 30s, Germany. Okay. This is where it comes from. Yeah. People make the mistake of saying, oh, it was the Nazis that did that. No, it wasn't the Nazis that did that. The Nazis were a result of that. Okay. So that's why they call Trump and all these people that don't like this shit, Nazis. All right. Because they don't want their fucking children to be pushed into making life altering decisions when they're not capable of making those kinds of decisions. All right. Now, if you're an adult and you're 21 or older and you say, I want to become the other thing and I want to live my life as the other. I don't give a shit. Nobody should. You're an adult. You can make your own decisions. I would highly recommend you think of the long term consequences. We're like two more years. Because life is long and phase is coming. Right? I don't know, dude. I don't have a problem with people who are adults living their life any way they want. I don't care. But what I do care about is kids having their lives ruined because adults push this shit on them or refuse to stand up for them. And you could see the pain and evil on dude that he wishes. He's feeling it. I know, dude. And it sucks. I like you a lot. But I think the point should be made that you fathers out there need to fucking be fathers. You know what I mean? We have lots of kids out here who are being failed by their parents because their parents put their kids on fucking YouTube and devices and they don't. They're not active parents and they see all this shit and they see their friends doing it and they're like, oh, well, maybe that's me too. And dude, if you talk to the kids in high school, bro, they'll tell you the kids who do this in high school. It was more popular two, three years ago than it is now. Why is that? Why is that? And then also the kids that do it in high school, if you talk to the other kids, they're like, yeah, dude, these are kids that got no attention or were bullied and then they transitioned in school because those people are celebrated. So now they're getting all this attention. These kids are just kids, bro. They're just kids, man. Like they're growing up in this hostile environment. Think how hostile the environment is now of bullying and all of these things that all of us had to deal with. Except we didn't have social media when I was in school. Like, yeah, you got picked on but like, it stopped when you went home. Now it never stops, right? And so dude, social media shouldn't be a thing for fucking kids under the age of 18. Shouldn't be legal. It's so mentally destructive. It's so confusing. And then we have this group of evil fucks that are coming. This is a communist thing, dude. Okay. People don't understand that. This happened in the 30s Germany. It was done by communist. Okay. And the whole point of this whole entire thing is that if we can get a human being to accept that a woman is a man and a man is a woman, then what can we not get them to accept? That is the most basic fundamental understanding. A three year old kid understands man and woman, dad and mom, right? But if we can get the human race to admit that a man could be a woman and a woman could be a man, there's absolutely nothing that we can't convince them of. And that is the communist ideology behind gender transitions. Dude, it has nothing to do with mental health, has nothing to do with the bullying, has nothing to do with caring for anybody. That's right. It's a complete subversion, man. Yep. Yeah. Guys, jump in on this comment. If you go and read the Talmud, okay, it has it in there. All the genders. You go read it. Go read for yourself. It's in the Talmud. Guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. With that being said, man, let's get to our final statement, guys, we have Thumbs Up or Dumbest Fuck This, where we're going to have a line in and we talk about it. It'll get one of those two options. Andy, have you ever thought about breaking like a world record? Have you ever broken the road records? I broke the world record for the best looking motherfucker on a podcast. That's right. That's looking on real AF. Yeah, that's right. I got you. Yeah. But so a world record has been broken by a Nigerian man. And let's check this out. Hold on. We don't get to guess what world record was. Oh, please. You're not going to get it. But go ahead. Well, didn't it involve a first form grape energy drink? No. No. No, I should have. Oh, how do you do it running? Right? Well, the most fuckers over there are fast. They are. They are fast endurance. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. OK, let's see. What is it? Nigerian man twerks for three hours and 30 minutes to break world record. That's that's all. Three hours and 30 minutes. I got the clip. All of it three hours and 30 minutes. Was it on YouTube or something? All three hours. So a Nigerian man shook his backside for three hours and 30 minutes to break the Guinness World Record for the longest duration twerking. Baba Hadi, Israel, I've been. I've I've a I've a banjo who took on challenge to raise awareness about depression and the importance of mental health received word from Guinness World Records that his January dancing marathon had officially earned him the title. Here's a clip. Why are you? Yeah, it's real. It's real. I'm not gay. You are. Yeah. Quote, we are beyond three old to announce that a record breaking achievement has been officially recognized by Guinness World Records at a banjo wrote on his TikTok account where he posted a video showing the acceptance email from the record keeping organization. Here is the official official record. He said, quote, we're incredibly proud to have set a new standard in twerking and we couldn't have done it without your energy, enthusiasm and support. He wrote, I had to double check man. I had to fact check it. We got to get this world records and sure should enough. Baba, he day at a banjo. Yeah. Bro, we used to like. Celebrate electricity. I invented the bicycle. We invented cars, airplanes. Now we have devolved into twerking. And what even that good? No, I was going to say they twerk different over there. Over here they twerk like with authority. Yeah. That was like a mini twerking. Yeah, like he looked tired. I mean, that was like, that was not really twerking. Yeah. I feel like I feel like I feel a dude. Yeah. I think American could beat that and it would be like with authority. I could beat it. Yeah. Can you do the twerking? No, I don't have ass. Yeah. I don't have ass. I twerk with my front. It's called a helicopter. Where are we giving this man? I will give this thumbs up because I'm never going to hate on someone's ambitions. OK. I have to succeed. If you hate on people's goals and ambitions, your goals and ambitions won't come true. All right. So I'm happy for adabanjo. Good job, man. Guys, that is all I got, man. That's all I got. All right, guys. Don't be a hoe. Shut the fuck up. Yeah. Never sleep in on the flow. Now my jury box froze. Fuck up, fuck up, stoke. Counting millions in a coke. Bad bitch, booty, slow. Got a own bank, broke. Can't fold. Dusset, no. Hits, shot, case, clothe, clothe.
