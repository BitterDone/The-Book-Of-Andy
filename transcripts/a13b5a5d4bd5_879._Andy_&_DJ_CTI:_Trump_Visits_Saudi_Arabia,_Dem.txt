there before he even touched down though apparently they fuck when I'm pretty heavy over there they like them they like Trump they respect Trump they respect the country and to show their sense of respect they had a mobile McDonald's pull up this is a real deal holy field right here man I didn't even know it was possible they President Donald Trump will be well catered catered for if he gets a sudden fast food urge in Saudi Arabia journalist covering his trip to the Capitol Radea noticed a nearby mobile McDonald's the movable fast food joint was hooked up to a large idea Radea is that what it's called Radea I think I'm pretty sure it's Rhyad yeah I don't know what you're reading there I think I hooked on finances failing you yeah it messed me up well I mean those you know they that one

new Radea yeah oh look a unicorn I know they made that just for him I guarantee you it's really nice so much fucking money over there yeah all of it like it don't even like they don't care yeah we would too if we drilled our own fucking oil yeah I mean but that's that's cool yeah I'm saying that's pretty cool like I mean that's cool like that's a that's a nice touch yeah you know apparently a lot of other things came out of these discussions I don't know how you could eat a big Mac where when it's 120 degrees you're wearing a suit you just be oozing that shit out your pores yeah stuff something like it's just you feel dirty it probably got good stuff though they got the good beef you know I'm saying do they don't know they might I'm not gonna go there I'm not gonna go there I'm gonna be good this episode you think they use camels probably like instead of beef probably they probably use whatever they got cambergars I mean I'm sure it's not bad I'm sure camel you think something else yeah he's gonna grab that camel yeah right right good old camel I'll take two of those oh get a fist full of camel I said I was gonna be good man you're bad influence I know and you're bad influence so they got McDonald's for Trump wait can I get a can I get number nine and the number eleven no it's your back that bad I think that'd be what you would order in Israel yeah whoo anyway so Trump got himself a a couple camel nuggets some camel nuggets there's a lot there was a lot of talks though a lot of good talks yeah really another thing that we're getting by we the United States Washington DC we're getting an Arabian leopard there's also pieces of the exchange going to the Washington DC zoo an Arabian leopard that's cool looking leopard I mean that's cool you know bring some animals over here some other ones yeah what's wrong with you man that's all I just did a world man dude oh yeah all right well dude so that leopard's pretty cool though no that's a nice looking leopard man that looks like it looks he's built on camel nuggets oh for sure yeah for sure for sure yeah but a lot of good deals man so they signed a defense deal the United States and Saudi Arabia MBS that's his nickname his real name is Muhammad bin Salman they sounded defense I think I'm gonna start going by my initials to you know AJF AJF yeah I mean I'm gonna start doing it actually already go by initials they're right the MFCO that's your other initials yeah that's real that's a good that's a good and that's a good nickname what both of them MBS no my MFCO yeah that's pretty hard it goes hard yeah I'm gonna say I'm gonna change it to Gersh darn it that's darned it made him yeah yeah yeah so they signed this defense package it's worth about 142 billion dollars so that's weapons artillery vehicles things like that you know that happens there's also gonna be some strategic so they're gonna pay us yeah right oh nice right right that's not changed yeah finally we're not just gonna get it to them which is leave it there yeah now that's also comes with a major strategic some strategic financial investments in the US together so all in total when you look at the whole package it's about 600 billion dollars that's estimated to produce about 3.4 million jobs this year alone between these two deals this meeting this this guy had and then so they did some backdoor deals some things behind the scenes of course but then they did this this conference and there was a lot of people there so when they brought Trump up on the stage to announce them they allowed God bless the USA song you know Trump's famous song likes to play they allowed that song to play and not just like a piece of it they played the entire song and while the song was playing everybody in the audience stood on their feet the entire time yeah bro I mean it's respect let's check this clip out forget the men who died who gave that fight to me and I have this stand up next to you and the man. They respect the fucker country again man they never did it that's the point it's not that they didn't we are lied to over here about about Arabs in general okay we are lied to think that they are just savage people who do crazy shit look do they have extremist in their yes but so do we okay and yeah no shit that's what I'm saying and the other thing like dude relied about the Arabs to intentionally create a negative viewpoint about their culture about them and on for the benefit of the criminals the mafia that runs Israel that's the truth all right so what they always do with the propaganda is they make these people sound like they're fucking savages and bro you know what they are to criminals the way it should be if you steal over there they punish you harshly if you do crime they punish you harshly that creates civility in society now do they have differences in their culture absolutely okay but all in all we are lied to we are propagated about Arab people how they are what they're really about for the benefit of us being aligned with Israel for our citizenship so that we can go out here and fight all these wars on behalf of Israel's interests against these people and dude it's bullshit you know it's just bullshit it's not it's not it's propaganda it's a lie like dude per you know everybody over there dude Persians everybody in that from that whole area you the ones you meet in real life are fucking great people and they have high standards and they have they they hold themselves to a strict code and that's reality man like it just is in the other different parts of the culture that we as Americans might see as negative sure but there's a lot of shit that they see about our culture it's negative but all in all these people have much more respect much more honor than what we are told and it's never been what we've been told like bro like when they started the shit in the early 90s with operation deserts shield and desert storm and making everybody think that all Arabs were bad and all these countries are savage and blah blah blah blah and dude honestly for a long time I bought that yeah I bought that especially after 9-11 dude I was pissed off they served it up all nice on the planet of course yes and as I've gotten older and as more information has come out we're starting to see that actually the complete opposite is true okay and all of my friends that live over there and I have a lot of friends that I talk to that live over in that area they're cool dude and they they they they run by the code and they they tell the truth and they're honest and when they disagree they say they disagree and sometimes it kind of pisses you off because you're not used to it because you're dealing with like people over here that will fucking lie right to your face and then go talk shit personally I appreciate people who can look you in the eye and say you know I don't agree with that like just like when Billy was here the other day like that's I you know I might not agree with what he's saying but dude I respect that he has the fucking balls to say that that he believes that so you know dude I just think I think you know a lot of people are starting to see we saw this when Trump was in office the first time too yeah like peace in the Middle East yes bro like dude art it's a lie and it's propaganda period well I think that's the other like that's a key point too right I think when we look at just like global humanity everybody just wants fucking peace everybody wants prosperity everybody wants to just be left to fuck alone all these individual countries and like it's made intentionally to to just create animosity intentions for for what reason for what reason um and it's because like a couple of things other happens happen while Trump was there so you know he got on stage start talking and he announced a big deal um this was a pretty big deal Trump announces the plan to lift sanctions on Syria so this was another big deal um Trump had heavy sanctions on Syria and said that uh that he's going to uh to to give them a chance at greatness let's check this clip up among others and friends of mine people that have a lot of respect for in the Middle East I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness look how happy they're there is that you on yeah you're on is there but uh Sam Batman is there just like it's it's it just shows man it's a great deal of respect you know and I and that's what like again we can we can debate on what's not happening good or what's not happening fast enough but one of the things that I thought was extremely important coming off for the four years of Biden but like nobody respected the office nobody like the representation of the American people was not respected because of who we had in there it listen they knew what was they know what happened yeah they don't if you go and anyone they knew that was a fucking coup yeah everybody else in the world knows that was a killer yes yeah that's real I mean because I can mean do like one of the things like and I was looking into this a little bit too so mbs you know typically like it's customary that you know he sits in his palace the diplomat you know I like Trump like when leaders come to the White House Trump comes outside and greet him that's not custom there they wait inside and you just come inside and see him mbs for the first time he's never done this for a world leader actually came down went down as escalators and met Trump outside as soon as he pulled up like it's just well dude that's just you know that's that's just respect massive you know I'm saying and it's not it's not supplicating or bowing down it's it's just a man respecting another man yeah you know what I mean yeah which is nice to see it is good to see man it's refreshing it does not surprise me though yeah it doesn't yeah well I mean to your point I mean it makes sense dude like they they knew what the hell was happening over there they saw it like man looking who the medicans put in like yeah yeah fuck is this all broke that listen just like we know that you know for example like we know that there's tons of people in Israel that do not like Netanyahu okay the people of a country are not synonymous with the leadership of the country and part of being the leader of a country is to remember that and so if the leaders act and crazy you have to be cognizant of well that's not the entire population right it's it's probably not even most of the population so you know I think the these guys understand that the world is safer and better with somebody who is in office who isn't manipulating the welfare of their own people for their own gain as an as instead trying to legitimately and honestly make the world a better place and whether or not Trump makes all the right decisions I think his intent is to do that especially after what's been going on the last few days which I'm sure we're gonna get into yeah we're gonna get into later are we these are what the real stuff yeah I've been seeing I wasn't able to like really like I mean we let's talk about it though yeah I mean there's been some interest in shit happening yeah so allegedly you know um Trump is super pissed off at Netanyahu for trying to drag us and manipulate us and propagate us into a war with Iran um and they've been like the main and I think it's yes and I it seems like he's finally figured it out that these people are not doing things for the welfare of the world but for the welfare of themselves and it seems to me like he's he that's finally clicked for him with some of the things that he's come out and say now we will have to wait and see what he actually does um but you know he's not just unconditionally supporting them at this point which it felt like he was doing up until this point for sure so close through his silence like through no action almost it almost made it seem like that yeah well my my point I mean look man he you know I don't know I'm not in those discussions yeah but it definitely feels like now things have changed yeah and it feels like all of the things that that we and many other people have been talking about in terms of the Israeli mafia that's what I'm going to call them because everybody else calls them the Jews I'm not going to call it that it's not the Jews it's the it's the it's the Israeli mafia yeah interfering with this country embedding itself in our intelligence agencies embedding itself into our government and I think he's finally starting to see that that's a big fucking problem yeah for sure so we'll see what happens but I feel better about Trump today than I did last week for sure and like I mean do it like again we can talk about things that aren't happening quicker or faster or at scale um but I do think it's important to show some of the wins that have been happening so some of the other things that have come out um well dude I think it's important for us to just be you know objective yeah like like object look man the internet's full of people that are on one side or the other and they built their identity like attached to that what the fuck are you getting from that side right it makes me think you're being paid like we should be able to look at things and say well I like that and that and that but I don't like that I don't like this I don't like this and this and this but that was a good move right and we should be able to objectively observe both sides or whoever's in office no matter how much you like it really shouldn't even be about like it should be about what are the actions being taken and I don't know president Trump I don't have an emotional attachment to president Trump I I don't ever attach myself and I think this is one of the things that's made me very successful in business I can like someone and admit they did something wrong I can also not like someone and say that guy's good for business it's a right that's right so like the like it's not yeah it's not a thing for me dude and I just I don't know I'm wired that way and it doesn't seem like most people have that ability especially like the influencers that we see on the internet it seems like they're all attached to one side or they're all attached to another side which makes me think they're getting paid to be that way a lot of them are well yeah I know for sure well I didn't think that at first you know but I think it's now it's come down to okay you guys could say what you want but don't talk about this in a negative light or don't talk about this in a positive light and we'll keep paying you and so it sounds like it's genuine but when it comes to that one issue or two issues they don't say shit about it right and if they could be objective about everything else and then they can't about this or that that's that's that's that person's that's a clue yeah that's right so like I can assure you yeah like I am and I don't say this to brag I say this as a matter of fact I am self made extremely successful okay I do not need any of their fucking money so I don't take it well that's the other piece broke because you got to look at it like a lot of the conservatives influencers out there I told they do what who were they before the Maga movement who were you I'm saying what were they doing what were they doing they were little nerds tweaking on the internet you know I'm saying so it's like yeah they didn't have it right it's how they make their living dude that's why us not taking ads on the show is such a big deal okay we're not like I'm very transparent about that I can't I couldn't be taking ad money and telling you I'm not that's not even legal right so yeah bro it's it's a problem and you know it's not that I like because dude you know sometimes people get pissed or like bro what are you dogging on Trump I'm not dogging on Trump personally I'm saying that decision was stupid or good or whatever and if we all thought that way we wouldn't be able to be manipulated that's my point of all of this 100% man but yeah let's point out some of the good stuff that has happened in the last recent days um uh Trump took major actions to reduce drug costs for Americans so I mean this was pretty cool this was an executive order that just came out yesterday to reduce drug prices in America to rate similar to what those and other nations pay and so I saw one of the examples like you know right now they call it the the fat shot you know the skinny shot whatever one of people want to call it there's like we're gov I think is ozimpic things like that like an OGLP once yeah right yeah and so like you know here for gov for example it's $1,300 for a month supply where you go to Britain it's like 88 bucks you know I'm saying so it's like there is a big disparaging like what's the problem here and so Trump Trump sounded executive order yesterday um this is a quick clip of film well that's that's the whole system that that is how it's set up here bro they do all of these things to propagate you to be unhealthy they tell you to be fat they they fucking allow fast food to put addictive chemicals and all kinds of extra shit they create all these health problems through all these ingredients then you get sick okay and when you have sickness and the drug prices are you know $2,000 per script you got to have insurance all right so the insurance and the pharma industry work together and the media and the food all work together to create customers for their system and you know it's insane bro like it's it's just a fucking racket uh so yeah man I mean this is something that should have it should never be allowed to be the way it's like if you don't have insurance you can't afford to get healthy right you know I'm saying if you don't have a healthcare you can't afford to like pay out a pocket right like that's insane that's bullshit well I think the other cool piece about this too is like because there's been a lot of talk with like Bernie Sanders and AOC and they've been running on this platform I'm like you know we're gonna go after a big forum and well I mean I don't know about you but I'm pretty sure that just pissed off a lot of the big forum but like their stocks fail the moment he announced this decision um it pisses off from globalists I mean like so it kind of took the the the the air out of the sale why's that what do you mean why why why why are why are those people getting pissed off because that's where they get all their fucking money to operate it's how they the tally they make their money man tally make money just shake this clip out so for the first time in many years we'll slash the cost of prescription drugs and we will bring fairness to America drug prices will come down by much more really if you think 59 if you if you think of a drug that is sometimes ten times more expensive it's much more than the 59 percent you know it depends on the way you want to analyze it but in one way you could analyze it that way but between 59 and 80 and I guess even 90 percent so when I worked so hard in the first term and if I got prices down I remember I was the only one to ever get prices down for a full year but I get them down like 2 percent and I thought it was like a big deal while we're getting them down 60 70 80 90 percent but actually more than that if you think about it in the way mathematically and farmer has to say we're sorry but we'll not be able to do this any longer to these to these countries that have been so tough they've been very tough nasty it's trade it's trade and farmer is also very powerful and the democrats have protected farmer democrats have protected farmer why they preach to people that they're going to fix these things and make their lives easier like we always talk about on the show but then they go protect farmer and they create situation what was do you remember what one of the first changes that Biden made when he got into office he took insulin from 60 bucks and re so trump sign in order to bring it down and then he signed in order to bring it right back up right back up bro it's it's people have short term memory loss man they forget oh people do forget yeah go look that up that's a fact forget about it yeah I mean look man it should really make people angry like it really should and it it should make you angry now not when it happens to you you know that's a big problem here it's like people don't have empathy for other people who are struggling with this because they're not being affected with it themselves but then when they get affected with themselves they freak out and say it's not fair well it's not fair all the time to everybody bro like this is we this country was not made for the citizens to be propagated and poisoned and intentionally made into customers for the biggest country or the biggest companies in the world that's not what this was okay and a coordinated attack yes you know because it's shoved down our throat physically and then it shoved through our fucking brains on ads and TVs dude it wasn't it wasn't insane like it's just it's once you see it and once you understand it it's infuriating because we are not free we are and not only are we not free financially we're a fucking customer farm for the biggest companies in the world that make billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars and Dude it's just not right it's not even close to right no no it's crazy man it's crazy one of the other last little piece I want to show up bring up in the show is the the big beautiful bill is moving right now so the tax bill right they've been an interesting piece of conversation and the house Republicans just relieved a release the Trump approved tax plan the one big beautiful bill tips over time family paychecks to get huge boost so I got a couple of bullet points from this we'll link it on the website for you guys to read through the whole bill for yourself but got a few bullet points here so the extension of individual tax rate cuts so the Trump era tax rates that we had reduction permanent it eliminates the 2025 expiration so I just expanded that in for the foreseeable future increased standard deductions child tax credits went up no tax on tips create a full income tax deduction for tips earned and traditionally tipped industry so wait staff hairdressers etc that goes through 2028 no tax on overtime pay so allows workers to deduct qualified overtime compensation that's huge it's a big deal it's huge it's a big deal um what that allows is that allows people who have like and like what I would call quote unquote you know the kind of job that most people have hourly jobs hourly jobs to save money legitimately stack money to progress their lives potentially open a business or send their kids to you know private school which honestly like that school is going to be done the way it is anyway but the point is are you talking about freeing up anywhere yes yes I mean extra 1500 3000 dollars a huge deal that's a huge deal big deal okay and yeah that's it listen we should have just fucking no tax well I think that's it I think that is I hope that's the move because like I've been seeing some of this stuff too and it's like there's still like cutoffs and it's like you know but if you make you know this much well that yeah but remember these big changes have to come in phases it's so yeah but we'll see what happens yeah we'll see man he also boosted small business tax breaks went from 20% to 23% for past three business income and it made the deduction permanent beyond 2025 limits on itemized deductions casual loss mortgage interest limits I mean there's a bunch of stuff military has it pay student loan relief he's done a lot I mean it's it is one big fat bill man but I do think it's just one step to where we really need to get going to which is just completely eliminating taxes I mean look if they brought spending in line where it should be and they made everybody pay the same amount it would be a flat 10% tax it would be 10 to 12% you know and it would pay for the entire government there would be no waste they'd be able to do you'd still be able to have the most powerful military in the world and you would be able to do a lot of extra shit in combination with the tariffs and the other shit that we got coming in yeah the flip side is is it would be a lot more of what has already happened which is the elimination of a lot of federal jobs but I mean dude that's that's ripping the bandaid off man like it just is and if you think about like what most federal jobs are this is what's going to happen I mean let's just be real you got Elon standing right next to him we think Elon's telling him yeah he's saying hey dude we don't need any of these jobs these are all administrative bullshit jobs where people show up they fucking file some paperwork they get paid an exorbitant amount of money with massive benefits and we could do all this shit with automation that is what is going to happen and they're doing it in phases yes it's engines they give walking what I'm seeing I'm seeing them doing in phases yeah and uh you know I don't know I don't know what's going to happen because with the advance and technology it really creates a whole new set of problems for people like that that legitimately have no real skill okay and what do you do with that do you implement universal basic income do you say hey you better figure out how to be useful like do you say a little bit of both do you give it a time frame like the last thing we want is for you know 40% of Americans are 50% to be on fucking welfare yeah you know yeah you know I've been thinking about this topic lately a lot too and I think what's really gonna happen bro I think there's gonna be a massive boom in the middle class because the middle class definition like the bracket is gonna open up exorbitantly right if you talk about bringing back a lot of production to America bringing back a lot of these other jobs like there's going to be space for these people who have typically just been you know not that yeah but I don't agree with that because the so you're you're assuming okay let's say oh manufacturing comes back to America and you're you're visualizing like people on the lines yeah construction those people are not going to have jobs that's what people are failing to realize like that's not going to exist robots will be doing that work okay like a plant will be run by three humans the whole fucking plant okay um you know a lot of I do my perspective on this has just changed dramatically yeah in the last year or two now I know that I've been morally against this forever and I still am I think it's a I think it's bad I think it's bad for people that doesn't mean it's not gonna happen you know I I think I think there's a lot of things that are bad that still happen and for this to have not happened there would have had to have been people standing up against it a long time ago and that's not happening laws regularly and so when we when we when we see what I see happening is I see a bigger separation I see people who are ambitious people who are willing to adapt people who are willing to develop new skill sets they are going to become mega wealthy and they're gonna have more money and the middle class half of the middle class will move up and half of the middle class will go to poverty and I think because there's gonna be people like every single technical revolution that's ever happened you know when Henry Ford made the car there was a bunch of people who said man I'm gonna just use my buggy well how many buggy's do you see you know I'm saying when accident chain so listen bro when I'm when I'm when I was in business you know when I started my business the internet just became a thing and there was a lot a lot of business that said well that's not for me we do it this way and those people are out of business so now we're talking about it at a micro level we're talking about it as human beings and their careers and their jobs and a lot of careers and jobs are in their in major jeopardy anything that is technology based or I don't know like it's it's it's weird because specialized skills that people could charge a lot of money for are going to go away in like very short amount of time and the government doesn't seem to be stepping in to regulate it so what eventually happens in my opinion we're gonna have two extreme classes of people and then we're gonna have two different kinds of companies you know we're gonna have companies that that fire all their people and automate their business and then we're gonna have companies that equip their employees with the technology to scale to a much larger size so it's uh it's gonna be interesting to see how people react but I don't think that it's going to create a bigger middle class I think it's going to eliminate a middle class that's my opinion um without some sort of intervention intervention regulation but like then you know it's like well what does that mean because then we're not gonna be as productive as other companies that don't regulate it you see what I'm saying so like it's like steroids and baseball bro like when steroids were the big thing you used it bro yeah everybody I used it they had to that's right yeah they had until they said no steroids like you know it was it was a it was a problem yeah so you know and that I mean dude I hear a lot of blue collar guys and I even said this I said this a couple years ago in the show I said you know if you want to learn trade skills that's where you should go and I do think that will be the latest the last thing to flip over but I think it's gonna eventually flip over I mean because we have all these nerves and technology legitimately thinking this is real cool look what we built look what we did look what it can do not realizing and not caring that it's gonna fucking crush people yeah so it's it's gonna be weird man it's gonna be weird and uh I don't think that the American markets are principled enough to buy and do the right thing because if they were everybody would be shopping at the companies who stood up for them the last four years and they they didn't do that no one fucking gave a fuck you know what I'm saying like I mean like some people did but I mean you know I see people I'm just I'm not saying this to bitch but like I see people in my DMs or in my story that tagged me and shit who you know use other companies products that I know are inferior to ours and those people never said a fucking thing you try to protect them we're staying up for them those companies never do yeah right you know what I'm saying so like they they avoided all the smoke and and these people are still supporting them so what that tells me is that people aren't morally principled enough as as a culture I'm not picking on any individuals but to support the companies that stand for the right things when it's slightly inconvenient because if that was true Amazon wouldn't be Amazon right now yeah it's just the truth and bro Amazon's completely I know retrained I know how humans think about I know but like it that's what I'm saying the thought process of the thought process required to stop this from happening does not exist in American culture at scale so it's a big fucking problem and what it ends up being is because the customer doesn't care about who they buy from in that way it puts their own livelihood in jeopardy so it's like really it's really a weird thing to think about yeah for sure man guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that being said let's go check out some of these comments man we got we got crews the commentary before we get into that real quick I just want to say you know that's not all customers that's not all people but there's not enough of them right that's all I'm saying so all right crews the comments as far as well let's go to EAD racing 100 Americans versus 100 Brits come on dude we already settled this have you not seen patriot we've already settled this I think we do this before this has been settled a couple hundred years ago yeah this has been settled this is this is a this is a this is a moot point you don't want that smoke again that's what I'm saying again all right there we already I thought we settled it already you guys can't even keep foreign invaders out of your own shit what 100 Brits versus a million Somalis yeah that's that's what you should be worried about let's be asking that question yeah all right man there's next one at Maggie Bassett 6340 you've been doing all this and writing 25 books fuck us suck at life well I mean it's not like well I mean I'd had to take some shit off the table to do that like I used to post almost every day so I took the you know the time from posting and doing social and making content and I made something that I'm really proud of that I think you guys are going to really like and most importantly I think it's going to change culture even more so than 75-hours of live-hard or anything else I've ever done so you know you always got to you got to give something up to do something else and you know I mean the reality is it's like bro don't we get tired of seeing these people post 75 times a day anyway like there's people I like and now I'm looking at I'm like fuck I don't even like this dude anymore because like all I see is this fucking face like I don't even want to see you that yeah like like dude you know I don't think people you know there's a there's a concept that people just I don't know it's a stupid discussion but the point is is that you know I I'm built for that you think no dude look listen remember what his old hand was here and we were talking in in the in the garage yeah Mary Jane now and I was trying to I was trying to uh basically tell him like how much I've been struggling to like find balance and shit in my life and then he was like well why would you you're not wired for that did you ever think that maybe you're just wired for the fucking battle that that one little comment he made changed my whole perspective and just because the most people say oh I'm this is fucking wrong or you shouldn't think of it like this or blah blah blah blah blah blah well motherfucker I ain't you you know I'm saying and if I ain't working and I'm not building and I'm not creating I'm fucking miserable that's the truth and people say oh you're running from I'm not running from anything bro I've I've I've had a couple near death experiences for real where I've almost died I got stabbed in the face I got a misdiagnosed brain tumor where they told me I was gonna die in 2012 and that changed my perspective and I like I like creating I like the stress I like the battle I like the pain and the frustration I live in that shit and I enjoy it and I like the result of it because people change because of it and it helps people and ultimately I like both aspects of it and I know that not everybody can understand that but there are people wired like that you know what I mean there there are lots of people like wired like that and you know those are those are pretty much the people that change everything in the fucking world I mean you know let's let's let's examine Elon's personal life you know I'm saying like like not everybody has the white picket fence in fact dude I think the white picket fence and the perfect family and this fake standard I think it's fake I think it's a standard that is pumped out to make everybody feel like shit nobody has it I don't know anybody has it I know very few people that grew up in a very stable home with the perfect life with no pro everybody's got problems everybody's got stress everybody's got their things and that they had to work through and push through and just and because we're presented with this false idealistic representation of what life's supposed to be like we all end up like mentally torturing ourselves because we're not living to it bro everybody's wired different everybody has different challenges everybody likes different things and that's another thing like for you dumb fucks that post on my posts and say well I wouldn't want to live I'm not posting for you now posting for the 20 year old Andy I'm posting for the 25 year old Andy I'm posting for all the mother fuckers out there that are trying to get through it that you have no comprehension of what we're talking about so like save it bro we ain't like you we're not gonna ever be like you and if it makes you feel a certain way then fucking unfollow me I don't give a shit you know what I'm saying like bro everybody thinks you're talking to them I'm not talking to you what ego do you have to have to think that somebody like me who writes some savaget savaget shit or says some savaget shit on the show is speaking to you yeah but well I'm not talking to you you know what I'm saying the fuck out of here to real shit me go fucking fucking do what you do I didn't know what you do probably nothing go do nothing fuck out of here I love it man you don't say no like why is he internet like that what it like are you are people that fucking stupid yeah they really are dude not all shit not all but like but enough I would never go on someone's post that I need like if I went on someone like these soft touchy feeling fucking weirdo people that live in their victimhood for their whole life I would never go on their post and be like well yeah but technically I that's not what I do I do sometimes well I know you do because you like you like to piss people off you're a troll but like dude I don't know like with one point in time do we think do we have an ego so big that we think everybody's talking to us and that my content's made for you my kind of is not made for you it's made for people that want to fucking win and don't apologize for wanting to win and I am one of those people and I'm talking to all the other people like that so fuck off that's real we got one more a couple more I got two more for you this next time Kyle McNab 927 I got to sign up for some of the white privilege need to oh who that's you same same same same yeah same same oh man there was some comments about

fucking friend and that's what missing in America that's where that's the reason they're able to divide us and you guys to get mad at someone because he has one now you could say hey I don't agree with that I think that's bullshit but I had a lot of people like personally insulting him and it's like dude you're the problem yeah you know just because someone has a different perspective doesn't

say hey man you know how come you never had any that's a different that's a different thing it's different yeah anyway proximity I'm just saying that like I think that's a fucking ignorant thing to say it is yeah it is yeah man it's so awkward too well let me explain it to you mr stranger right fucking idiot just have the birds in the bee stock yeah yeah it's crazy man let's get some more cruising yeah we've got some more to cover let's cover some some lunatics uh headlong too uh democrat rep um mc-iver I did not body slam anyone ice created that confrontation so this was a hot little hot little thing that happened over the weekend um i think this was like last Friday maybe uh last saturday something like that um lamonica mc-iver she's a democrat out of New Jersey uh set Sunday on CNN state of the union that she did not body slam anyone during the arrest of newwork mayor ross baraka at the delaney hall detention center last week host Dana bash that quote I want to go back to some of the footage where we were looking at at some and I want our viewers to see that you are the woman the red blazer as we show them dhs says that obviously there were uh that there were chaos uh that maybe you were trespassing you can talk about that but dhs also says that in their words you were body slamming and ice officers that what we're looking at is that what what happened um so that was a little confrontation you had a group of uh a group of politicians local level state level politicians decided to go to a dhs facility in ice facility um and i guess fight for them i guess or or should virtue signal for them um and it's and it's funny because uh this other democrat rep puts out put out a disclaimer before uh a lot of the body camera footage was released saying uh that if ice does produce bodycam slam footage it's manufactured it's fake what do you mean it's ai it's what it is uh it's uh yeah it was a mostly bro you're gonna be really able to claim that as defense for real yeah you really are yeah it's a scary thing man um yes these people tried to rate a dhs facility basically another claim in uh you know that they didn't do anything wrong it was mostly peaceful let's check this little clip out but there's no reason for it nothing happened other than the chaos that they created themselves of anything we were pushed and shoved uh and found in a very vulnerable situation for the three of us then why'd you go there why be there first of all i'm so tired of seeing these old elderly weak and even the small weak people nerd vegan fucking weirdos trying to think they're gonna go tough like intimidate people bro eventually people just got kicker ass okay so i really don't care if they did body slam you or throw you over the fucking i don't care no this day so the the lead isn't read right there yeah they're saying that she did body slam an officer i know but what i'm saying is i don't care if they did them oh yeah well i mean it's crazy so like more some of some people need to be checked dude for sure in a physical way for sure you know for sure like and i'm not talking about women for those of you that are gonna i'm talking about anybody like if you're if you're gonna get in the fucking smoke don't be surprised yeah that's right don't be surprised when you get it dude like you're asking for yeah you supposed to be high yeah you get you get out here and you say all this crazy shit like getting people's faces do this and like dude you do that with the assumption that people aren't tired of your shit and that they're not gonna do something back to you and dude i'm be real people are tired of it yeah they're fucking tired of it well i mean there's also this thing too like i mean bro you see these people do this stuff and then they play victim i just wish like as hard as these fucking politicians are fighting for these illegal migrants if they would fight that hard for actual americans they they would never will where is those fights they never will because it's against their own interests you know what i'm saying like listen those if or what were those what where's that camera for this it's never gonna happen it's against their own interests they need the people here to get the votes that they need to stay in power like go fight you like well you're a new reggaert's one of the biggest cities in jade you go fight for it like what what what's your community actually look well a smart fight for some of that shit they i mean bro they need that to get in power they can't do anything but appeal to people who consider themselves to be victims and the only way for people to consider themselves to be victims is to create an environment where they believe they're being fucked over and that they feel like victims you know so then they can come in and promise the change and the change never happens they get to stay in power that's that's what we're dealing with here it's it's it's disgusting man it's disgusting but yes so the new work mayor was arrested on charges of trespassing um apparently a few more charges are coming out for those individuals because again why are you there they're blocking the gate and shit like i saw one video there was like a van coming in drops in people off um they're like trying to chain link themselves to get like move move move um and uh eight the truth of the matter is dude and like this is just reality man the only way for society to fix itself is for ridiculous litigation stop happening for simple assault that's the truth if someone gets in your fucking face and starts screaming a shit or like pushes you and you knock them the fuck out they're gonna learn a lesson they're not gonna do that again we used to have that in this country now we don't have this in this country right we have men that don't respect men we have women that don't respect women we have women that don't respect men and then you know we we have all of this shit we have men that don't respect women you know we have we have all of it but basically at the end of the day for thousands and thousands and thousands of years the reality is this simple force physical violence has maintained order and civilization and i'm not saying go around and beat the shit out of people i'm saying that when people instigate and they get dealt with a proper response they stop doing that okay and when we litigate those things or arrest people for those things or you know and my my example is this when i was growing up i understood that if i just respected a teacher in my school or disrespected another kid or a grown man there was a chance i was gonna get fuck a punch in a face so you know i would maybe walk that line a little bit more carefully and it developed respect for other people now now i respect people even though i know at this point in time there's likely not going to be violent repercussions just the potential idea of getting punched in the face kept society in line and we don't have that anymore and now we have chaos and this is this is why we see kids attacking teachers in school like bro i'm sorry it's just reality this show is not called what's right or what's wrong it's called real all right and what's real is people respect simple violence and sometimes people need to be punched in the motherfucking face learn a lesson it's consequences bro that's it like i do i remember i think it was like 2001 that was the last year uh your teachers could spank you in school right so like i went just like i started like when i started schooling i'm younger than you right i know you had it in school but like yeah but it was a thing like our principal he's a big tall dude and he had a wooden paddle with fucking holes in it yeah he's fucking spank you bro you know that shit you get spanked i mean this is why this is why the crime rate is what it is in Singapore like we talk with Billy you know if you do goofy shit they'll fucking pull your your bear ass down in front of the town and came you and guess what happens they don't have any crime and you know what happens the dude you don't die from getting camed it's hyper embarrassing super embarrassing it checks you in back in line and some of these people might have a king for that shit though well yeah of course but my point is my point is bro is that there is no repercussions for anything anymore and like dude when i mean what ends up happening is what's happening now instead of there being simple repercussions that don't really hurt anybody the resentment builds and builds and builds and builds and builds and builds and then we have a fucking war where people die repercussions right yeah yeah so it's you got to have those blow off vows bro and you got to have those natural checks to have civilization and check that's that's the truth that's real bro yeah i mean dude you think do you think police officers will be getting into so many fights if people if that was if that was yeah they knew they tried to fight these police they're going they're gonna that's right it wouldn't happen but they had but the police and the rules are handcuffed they can't enforce because they're told and dude there is problems with that there is problems with that there's there's problems of you know you get the guy who was picked on in high school who gets to be a power a member of authority and but those people already exist they're already there so we're taking away the good parts of it and we're letting the bad part it's no different than the gun argument because it comes down to personal accountability yeah like you like don't do bad shit i don't know bro like i just dumb shit it's you might be all right you know saying like more often than not you'll be fine we wouldn't have had this huge communist progressive thing even happened if that were the case yeah person would be out because these dads that are normal you know when the when the you know the the the queer teacher was trying to transition their kid or change their net the dad would punch him in the fucking face and it would stop yeah it wouldn't happen again and they they you know now what they do is they instigate instigate instigate and then whenever they they you know finally do get a punch in the face they're they played a victim okay pride flag yeah right yeah it's crazy man it's just dude you can't have a civil society without consequences and simple consequences that aren't deadly are are honestly you know really not that harmful like letting boys fight it out this fight instead of now they're shooting each other right like when I was a kid dude you would never think of like shooting someone yeah it was not even a thought and now we're gonna bear knuckle bro that's right that's fine and you learn a lesson and you get respect and and by the way every single time that ever happens you end up with more respect for the other guy even if you beat your ass you know I'm saying even if you beat his ass there's respect and dude that respect for other people has been lost in society 100% and then they can't you can't fix society the way that it should be without that so another entitled bro like what a lc say and there there will be held to pay if they arrest these people for trespassing on like what do you mean yeah what are we talking about man well and that's also why you all it's always these it's it's literally always the women politicians that call for the shit call calling for yes because they're protected from it maxine water yes see I mean yeah now I did here I did hear Pritzker say some shit like a couple of these guys protect themselves that's right that's what I was just gonna say that he's a fucking billionaire fat ass who can't he can't protect himself either no you know this is a big dude but yeah we'll see it in did something funny here so seeing it and decided to have have somebody on to talk about what happened at this Delaney hauled the tensions and let's check this clip out quickly we should let viewers know there will likely be more arrests coming we actually have body camera footage of some of these members of congress assaulting our ice enforcement officers including body slamming a female ice-off officer so we will be showing that to viewers very shortly you say a video of members of congress body slamming ice that's what I put her in jail that's correct sir it's disgusting okay and so or if you have that video are you suggesting that members of congress will be arrested who were there yesterday this is an ongoing investigation and that is definitely on the table who has the video ice doesn't we will be releasing that very shortly okay let's talk about yeah it's whatever yeah speaking of uh refugees as you see we got our first wave of white Afroconner refugees yeah I did and I saw I saw that the left's fucking throwing a fit of a yeah freaking freaking fuck out and 59 individuals primarily 59 59 people versus 20 million people who do not contribute at all these are people with skills yeah these are farmers these are people that could plant food by the way they South African people are fucked they're fucked well let's see other people like they're actually fleeing actual fucking like racial like real racial issues well you know I'm saying like I mean there there's it's not like you know there's six legal mind bro I'm sorry murder this is gonna really piss people off but that's what happens when you give up major you give up control to a violent minority it's the truth that's not racism it's fucking true guys with that big says get to our third and final headline uh we got to headline number three uh this is an interesting one um let's talk some culture music happening going on uh yay song glorifying hitlers gets millions of views on x while other platform struggle to remove it yeah so this is uh this is shaking shaking some some everything bagels yeah yeah let's talk about it let's let's talk about it so Spotify this is NBC or Spotify Soundcloud and other tech platforms have worked uh to remove a new song from yay that praises Adolf Hitler uh but the song and its video had uh have continued to proliferate online including across x where has racked up millions of views various mainstream and alternative tech platforms as week yay formerly known as Kanye West has been able to share his latest song titled Hail Hitler along with its companion title World War Three which similarly glorifies Hitler the architect of the Holocaust well some platforms are taking steps uh to attempt to pull down the song or there has seemingly let it spread freely uh they continue spread of the song and varying uh approaches to modification exemplified increasing fractured environment online on social media some platforms are pulled back on their moderation practices in recent years while others have tried to maintain higher standards when it comes hate speech um so yeah so as of right now hate speech wasn't even a thing that existed 10 years ago no that's a new term so just so we're clear new that's a term designed to control whether you disagree or agree or you're indifferent to what someone says hate speech is a form of control of speech and thought which there's a reason for that that's my biggest like okay like if it's that bad what we give more like by the reaction that they give this stuff does not make it well bro when you say we're removing this yeah you can't see it what do you want to do automatically i want to fucking see it why because it's getting attention look man simply because you don't want me to see it i want to see it well and why would anybody not want you to see something of any kind when they say oh don't look at that or you can't see that or you know what what is that why would they do that okay like it's the more that they try it to just to censor this the more attraction it's going to gain and they seem to understand that they don't get that they don't get it and like there's my here's my issue part by personal issue with it right like i've heard the song i'll be honest i think the beat it slaps i like it i mean it's cool like the the the the production piece behind it it's nice song um but you know i remember when like little nizx you know how the song come out and you know by worshiping the devil that's fine okay we can know Satan okay that's fine okay so right yes we can dig with eight our communities with sexy red like that's fine there's no nobody's pulling that shit off the internet i agree i don't listen dude like what the fuck man listen i i think i stick to my set my i don't fucking like it i think it's it's in it's inflammatory intentionally but i think it has a right to exist right and i think if people are going to say dumb shit they deserve to deal with the consequences now i i don't know i'm not saying here's my i think what you just said is the reason he's saying this i think he is pointing out and also i think that he has been heavily damaged by people who are Jewish and i think he is miscategorizing all Jews as part of the ones that are part of the the Jewish mafia yeah and and i don't like that i don't think that's right but from his perspective he has had his family torn apart he has had his career torn apart he's been backed he's been drug he's been made to be crazy by people that he perceives to be the Jewish people and if you were that and and and you know you had multiple Jewish people that got into your life and fucking destroyed it and you didn't have i mean if you're in an emotional state you you're probably not going to have the ability to discern between the the bad people and the good people and the masses right and and so i think that's i think there's a lot to this that should be discussed more than oh i i you know think he's a fucking big it for making the song that's not the conversation here the conversation here is and i know what you were saying you weren't saying oh i like the fucking you were saying like you know if it said it's provocative the if you if you said no the video and and the beat and all if it said other shit it'd be it'd be awesome to be a banger it would be but like the message behind it is you know i don't know it's not i don't know dude i think we got to be very careful going down this road i think free speech is allowed i do think Kanye is and i think he's very fucking smart brother he's in protest right now i i think that's what it is i think he is showing people the truth he's showing people the double standards that's right when people the fucking the manipulation again like we can do nothing says nothing says you know Kanye's crazy like him saying something about Jewish people and then all the fun the sudden he's debanked in his de-platform right like he says oh they're doing this shit to people when they don't like it and they're saying no we're not he's anti-semitic and the next thing you know he can't he fucking exactly what he said is happening like like bro that's what's that's what's opening up the whole can of worms is because like he's exposing it and you know again it's not Jewish people it's fucking there's a there's a mafia just like there's a mafia for all races or used to be um no that's that's my biggest piece man it's like you know there's a lot of music out there and to me it does way more damage you know again like when you look at the the societal effects of it right like I mean even his song gold digger it's like it bro it's not listen there's tons of songs that are equally if not more damaging for sure you know when you've got little nizx getting fucked in the ass on on on his video in the middle on on that's the at the Grammys or whatever and then you got uh Sam Smith yeah yeah I mean like bro what are we talking about and then you have you know and like this is this is hypocritical in my part because I listen to this shit but I'm also intelligent enough to not fucking live it but I mean then you got every mother fucking rap song shoot him up shoot him up yeah shoot him fucking fuck bitches smoke fucking crack you know drink the scissor you know fucking purple drink like be fucked up all day like that's the but dude I like that shit but like I'm smart enough to understand like I'm not living that way I do it anyway right right right like but I like the stories that it tells you know I like the I like the story of starting out and going through like dude I really relate to like young doll's music because he talks about how he started it or like Biggie's music how he started on the corner and he worked up and he built something and we can argue with what they did or didn't do but the truth of the matter is is that is you know that's the game they knew and they progress through it and everybody knows this that's why movies like American gangster are so fucking popular so don't come at me saying whatever dude like it is what it is it's the it's a success story from a different place and I like it and I fucking listen to it all the time and it makes me feel hard as fuck when I listen to it so I don't care what but I also don't go around fucking smoking crack yeah you know but like bro but it's it's interesting and it is interesting and we should have an objective conversation about this it's interesting how we can promote literally everything that destroys the culture we can we can make it cool we can make porn cool we can make only fans cool you know look how many girls out there who this is already happening who are doing who did only fans and now they're like fuck I wish I hadn't done that you know we're creating all of the I mean fuck dude even little kids that are 12 years old 13 year old 14 years old having top surgeries and having irreversible you know alter I mean you know irreversible fucking damage to their bodies and their minds and all these things are propagated and allowed that's cool yeah and then you know when we talk about major genocides we leave out you know genocides that happened in the 1900s that were exponentially larger than that one you know all of these things lead to a natural person who has a normal IQ to who is an objective thinker to say wait a minute this doesn't fucking add up that's a clue yes so so like dude you know the end of at the end of the at the end of the day the whole truth is not being shared at a minimum that's that's the truth and I think Kanye is trying to do the most extreme shit that he can a lot of people think oh he's just trying to stay relevant no I don't think he gets a fuck about being relevant now I think he's richest fuck he don't I don't think it's about that I think I think he's so bitter and so angry and so pissed off that other people of a certain you know uh yeah protected class have been able to destroy his family or attempt to destroy his family and and and and destroy black culture through this sort of you know what I mean like I think that he knows exactly what the fuck is going on and I think his only way that he can get people to look at it is by doing shit like this that's my that's my take on it yeah and maybe I'm wrong and I don't know I don't know but I will say this anything that they try to censor is gonna cause more people to look at it's gonna cause more people to talk about it's gonna cause more and more uh noticing you know what people want you know what I'm saying yeah right when the reality what the place should be is just let it die out don't give it any fucking like if you don't like it no if it if it was anything else people would just be like that's fucking stupid yeah and that's it yeah that's it yeah man I mean what do you think bro yeah that's what I think dude like leave it alone like you keep pumping them up and doing the exact shit he's saying you're doing and saying you're not doing it but then do the exact shit he's saying you do it well I mean look man you know I don't think people I don't think people have looked into history enough at all I think I also don't I also don't think that people question what they're taught in school I think I think most people it's beyond their ability to believe that a textbook or a lesson plan or a curriculum would not be historically accurate when that's exactly the point okay they get you to trust and then they put these things in as factual that aren't factual for the reason of creating a belief system that benefits somebody else and it's it's a very difficult thing for people to talk about and it's very uncomfortable but propaganda has been used for centuries and centuries and centuries and if you want propaganda to be effective you introduce it when people are small when they're kids and you know out of all the things that we were taught in school that was absolutely unquestionably true it was the fucking it was what happened in World War 2 you know what I'm saying and we have genocides like the whole demours that happened in Russia we have polpot we have mal we have rwanda we have all of these other genocides that were very relevant and some of them were much bigger than what happened and we those get no attention why is that you see what I'm saying so there's just a lot of things that don't add up to the historical narrative and I think people are starting to understand that a scale no and um yeah I mean and I think I think people get very angry when you talk about that um but I think it's if if those people really want that kind of shit to stop then they should have they should be willing to have an open discussion about it without trying to destroy people's lives because the the attempted destruction of people's lives or speaking out about things like this is what creates more of the shit that that they don't want so if you're telling the truth and you got nothing to hide and you want this shit to stop have an open discussion about it you know you know what I'm saying and and bring the fucking receipts for real and when people say shit that you think is crazy like have the ability to prove that it that it's crazy and that's how you defeat an argument you don't defeat it by saying that's terrible you're a terrible person you can't talk about that and if you talk about it we're gonna take your whole livelihood that just makes everybody else around go fuck that's a clue yeah for real dude so like you know I know it's not fun to speak about and I know it's it's difficult and I feel bad for a lot of the regular Jewish people who are who are now suffering from you know real bias you know I because like dude I don't know that's what that's created yes I know and and and the real the like the regular Jewish people it serves their interests to say well hey what is the truth here what is actually happening here because it's just dude it's just fucked up yeah man and I think everybody you know I may be a realist but when it comes to like how things should be it's it's not that hard for everybody to get along and it's only hard because there's people at the very top of the food chain that intentionally propagate division and hate and frustration and get us to argue and fight and kill each other so that they can push narratives to benefit them and that's never been that's always been the way and unfortunately you know I don't know that that'll ever change because people don't seem to want to think critically and and and when they do think critically they're punished for it you know so it's it's a difficult thing and I I will never be someone that generalizes entire populations of people by the actions of a few I just won't it's not right it's not who I am it's not what I genuinely don't believe that and people will say well what about the the you know the religious texts says this and this and this and this bro listen you know many people there are to say the Christian don't know what the fucking Bible says you know I'm saying that's interesting yeah you know how many people that that uh that are Jewish that have never read what's the fucking book that the the Talmud you know like they don't fucking like yeah let's let's fuck cut the shit man it's not all of it you can never generalize entire groups of people it's just not true so they want you to though because that creates you know a blanket a blanket of defense to say oh we're the victims and and no accountability happens during that yeah in any situation yeah I mean bro like think about think about this like think about a year and a half ago two years ago when the when the Israeli government started just this genocide of clearing out Palestine and I remember dude like the first day it happened I said look it's fucking bullshit you know I'm saying and uh you know much I got phone calls from people I hadn't heard from in years being like you're a fucking anti-Semite no I'm not here I think it's bullshit to fucking kill children that don't fucking know any better relentlessly and then act like it's it's like we should support justice like bro I I can't support that now you know and that doesn't make me some sort of fucking anti-Semite that makes me a human being you know and and dude that really the way they reacted to this whole thing that happened in in Palestine I think it opened a lot of people's eyes to question a lot and I think people I think there's a lot of information that has now been released from Pandora's box that is not going to go back in it's not so I don't know what's going to happen or how this is going to move or but at the end of the day bro I think it's important that everybody but everybody understand that that you can't generalize you have to look at specific people you know what I'm saying that's real man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think uh down in the comments with that being said a final segment for the show guys as always we do thumbs up or dumb as fuck but this time you know someone different yeah don't play a game any we play in bash or pass okay someone put some pictures up is this like smash or pass yeah but with food okay all right all right with
