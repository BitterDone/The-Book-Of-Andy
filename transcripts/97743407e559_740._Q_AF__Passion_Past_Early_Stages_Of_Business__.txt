like a joke but it wasn't really a joke yeah if you appreciate dad humor you will love me yeah so that's good all right well we got today dude man well listen I got some good one good ones for you guys yeah I got three good ones here let's knock these out let's get into these guys Andy Vaughn question number one hi Andy I've been an entrepreneur since 19 I've started multiple businesses some failed some worked I've got myself to a stage now where I have stuck to one industry for over five years financially I'm in a good place compared to most people I make some really good money and the future looks bright in this industry I see many ways I can scale up the issue is around how passionate I feel about what I'm doing I remember you saying in a recent episode that passion is super important to get you past the early stages I'm already past the early stages now but far too often I feel myself getting burnt out and dreaming of doing something else feeling like my full potential will not be found in this industry I'm currently in I'm scared to chuck away everything I have built to chase an idea but equally I don't know how valid these feelings are or if I should stick to what I'm doing have you ever felt like this is this normal to feel like jumping into a different industry in order to meet my full potential or do you think I'm simply in the wrong industry if I'm always feeling like this my main concern is the amount of time I've spent building the initial compounding up for this current industry I know how vital that is however I cannot keep doing something forever that I don't feel fulfilled in can I I did think about getting this to a stage where it's made me a large amount of money and at that point finding what I'm truly passionate about but I just feel lost thanks Andy is this normal is this a normal thing that that I guess business owners go through this this idea of passion few years in I think that it's very easy for people once they have their basic needs taken care of once they have a good income stream coming in to look around and lose the gratitude for what they have what you have is what you desired more than anything five six years ago and now you have it all right and you're looking at it and you're saying well it would be nice if I could go do this or it would be nice if I could go do that I think it's important that when you do spend time compounding the effort and the skill set and learning the process and going through this journey it's very important to remember that you're not always going to feel like doing it in fact you're probably not going to feel like doing it once you've done it so many times but that's what gives you the expertise that you need to be successful it's about mastering the monotonous actions all right and in the beginning these actions are not monotonous they're exciting they're new they're fresh and we want to go do them because we don't have any money coming in and we want to build this and we're going to conquer this and we're going to create that and it's exciting and then after we do it a thousand ten thousand thirty thousand times imagine how many times I've done the things that I've become great at over the last twenty five years probably literally hundreds of thousands of times and anytime that you do anything at that level of frequency and repetitiveness it's going to become monotonous so you have to be okay with a monotonous existence to provide the lifestyle that you're looking to create because you can't become a master of a skill set without that many reps so we have to be very careful about is this valid or is this not valid is this how I'm really feeling or is this how I'm really feeling today and when it comes to passion passion is an overhyped over talked about abstract feeling that you do feel in the beginning and the reason I say it's important in the beginning is because in the beginning for the first two three four years it's going to be really hard and so you have to really care about what you do and the mission that you're in order to become great at it when you're not getting any money coming back so what's going to carry you through that time where things are really hard and you're not making any money well the only thing that's really going to carry you through is your excitement for what you do and also how much you desire the end result and so it's very very important to stop yourself right now at this point in time and ask yourself a real question do I feel this way because I'm losing sight of how grateful I am to be in the position that I'm in or do I feel this way because this is truly something that I hate doing and I can't do it but the truth of the matter is is that once we start making some money once we start becoming successful and once we get a little bit comfortable it's very easy to look at other things and say oh I'd rather have that or I'd rather have this but you have to understand to have that or to have this is probably going to require the same amount of time investment that you put in to be good at what you're at so we have to really break down all these pros and cons and you know the question was have I ever dealt with this well yeah dude you don't think that I look online and dream about completely different lives sometimes you don't think sometimes I'm like fuck dude I'd really love to live in Tuscany and like just grow fucking tomatoes you know I'm saying or whatever right like we all have these little dreams that are like you know I guess fantasies about what we would do outside of what we currently do but we have to remember there's a reality and the reality is is it's very hard to make a decent living for anyone and if you're in a position where you've put in time and effort and skill to get yourself in a place where you are making a good living you should really think hard and try to remember what it was like before that before you just throw it all away and I see people do this with their business I see people do this with their relationships I see people do this with as an entrepreneur in their jobs they get comfortable things get a little bit boring and they want that excitement back but what they don't realize is that excitement is always temporary so if you're always chasing that new feeling just like in a relationship if you're always chasing that new feeling you're gonna always be dissatisfied because that new feeling is always fading out so you have to get comfortable understanding that to be successful is not always exciting right and if I were you if you want to make it exciting again I would start thinking about what it is that you do and how you could scale that into a legendary vision that is maybe something that no one's ever done with what it is that you do okay so you can make these monotonous things exciting by expanding your vision and expanding your your goal for what it is that you do and then it plays into your core competencies that you already have a natural skill set for so that's my take on it I think that far too many people value buzz terms and things that are popular on the internet and they think because they consume these data points all the time from every single person that they must be doing it wrong and I think we should all consider that maybe the reason that these people talk so much and the reason these people throw out all these buzz terms is because they need to evaluate what they're doing not you need to evaluate what you're doing and so a lot of this information that's out on the internet that we read you know that's like all this touchy feely feel good buzzword shit you have to realize that as an entrepreneur that's not for you that's that information is not for you we have to learn how to look at the information that we receive in the proper context that applies to us as opposed to just consuming all of the shit that's on the internet and thinking it's for us because someone with a couple letters behind their name wrote it all right the reality is most people will never even get to where you're at and you're going to throw that away because you're comfortable with it now that doesn't make sense dude I mean let me actually listen because you've also said before too it's like you know you had a couple of very big I guess shifts in perspective in your entrepreneur you know timeline right where you know it was money focus was about you then it switched to the customer focus and delivering that but then there was a switch also where you had to realize man like I got this far and it wasn't just because of me it was the people that I had around me my employees yeah so then that became a big focus for you too is that something that maybe could ignite some new you know passion right like taking care of the people they helped you get five years in right oh yeah bro I mean look dude I think I think a I think a big reason why a lot of people get bored with what they do is because they they make it all about themselves and once them once they are taken care of they don't really have something to work for anymore and it never crosses their mind ever that they should work to create the dreams that the people that work with them have for them just like they helped you create the ones for you and it never it goes right over people's head and it's really weird to me because I believe that that's a responsibility if you're on a team to really do your best to present people with a big enough vision and a big enough plan to where they can build their dreams and their lives within it and then when you really dedicate yourself to that it becomes a bigger more motivating purpose than what you even had for yourself I mean I could tell you this and this is true for me I don't have to work ever again like I don't know that people understand that like I do not have to work I do not have to be here I do not have to do this and that is without me selling any of my companies okay so why do I do it then well I do it because I have people in this building that have been here seven eight nine ten seventeen eighteen years you see what I'm saying and my goals to make sure that they and their families are taken care of and that is a huge motivating factor to me and so I come in here like dude I don't even take a paycheck from this company like that's what people don't know I come in here every day and work for fucking no paycheck so that I can help these motherfuckers build their shit and that is more fulfilling and exciting to me than it ever was when it was just about me and so yeah dude we can expand the vision to be about other people and then if you want to take that a step further you should take what it is that you do whatever service or product or whatever business offering you have and figure out how to make that benefit people at the at the highest possible level and now you have this exciting business again where you're solving people's problems you're building people's careers and you know and all the while you're getting some benefit from it because your business is growing you're building an equitable asset and you're being rewarded with these amazing feelings of like watching people by houses and build their families and yeah it's never easy you know and you always wish like hey I wish I could like you know do more for these people but at the end of the day they have to build their own shit and the best thing that you can do as an entrepreneur is to give them the opportunity to take the initiative to create their own lane and some people will take it and some people won't but it's very fulfilling to make it about other people as well and I think that's a really really really important point I think a lot of people that are unhappy as an entrepreneur are unhappy because of one main reason which is they don't have a mission they don't have a purpose that's outside themselves right there's three elements to happiness okay there's discipline am I practicing discipline am I living a lifestyle that allows me to control the things that I'm in control of too am I full of gratitude do I have gratitude for where I'm at and it sounds like this guy might be missing a little bit of that because you're born it's natural that doesn't mean you're bad dude sometimes we're very thankful sometimes we're not sometimes we are again sometimes we aren't we feel better when we are and the last thing is and this is the big one is what is my purpose and what is my mission is it very clear to find do I go after it every single day and if you have those three elements it never really gets boring it gets boring when you're missing one of those elements and that's where you start to feel unfulfilled and unhappy and what it is that you're working on just a circle back and re-emphasize some of the things that you said I think expectations are huge I mean I have a great wife I have five great kids I get to work with you in my business I can coach and consult great entrepreneurs and yet on almost every other day I feel like shooting myself in the head yeah it's just life you know and I'm not going to but and so I think people's expectations of happiness and just emotional fulfillment on a day-to-day basis are very very unrealistic and we just need to realize that and I think if I'm not going to be too hard on this guy I'm going to say that when you're down and when you're bored it's usually because you have high standards and people who have high standards are always going to deal with some sense of dissatisfaction some sense of wanting to do more some sense of being bored and getting getting kind of itchy to do something you know better and greater and more life impacting and it's like what you said you really have to go back to that issue of gratitude cultivate gratitude obviously being content is not the same as being complacent but reminding you of your blessings reminding yourself of the things you've accomplished so far and just keeping your your head in the right place in that regard but I would also say this I love what DJ said about like redirecting your attitude toward the people that you know are helping you and reconnecting with your team I think the other thing that is really important is to as he's built this company I think he probably I'm guessing has gotten further and further away from the front line so maybe he's not experiencing how his company is really changing lives and I know with you and me something that completely fueled our fire when we were doing the MFCO is to hear these actual stories of how people's lives were being changed I got a I got a text from a mutual friend of ours who went over a hundred million dollars right in that amazing and he's one of the things he said was he's like I learned all of this on the MFC CEO project and Alex you know has literally he's he's literally the case study of taking everything that he learned in that podcast and accent-cuting it to the letter yeah and so that that I think is so important is don't I've got about a I've got about half a dozen people who have messaged me from RITA since the day we started that are doing now over a hundred million bucks yeah yeah it is amazing and it makes you feel a lot of them started less than eight figures they were in they were barely into seven figures like a million bucks yeah yeah and it's so in five years well some of them started ground I could promise you this there's not another motherfucker out there that has touched mongols like that no no but it's it's reconnecting with your team it's reconnecting with your customers and maybe maybe he just needs to do that maybe he needs to get on the front lines again and really see how he's impacting it's a huge deal dude I'm happiest when I'm in here working with the team I think that's a massive fucking point that that you're making you know you're making yeah like when when we start out we're excited about something and then we start to instead of work in the business we start to work on the business and we back up we back up we back up now we're detached from this thing that we actually were excited about in the beginning I totally relate to that you know there's nothing better for me than like legitimately still yeah when I visit the retail stores and I get to talk to people like on the floor like that's the coolest things I get to hear their story I get to hear their struggle I get to hear where their need help and I get to assist in that and that's very rewarding and now I find that with my employees right but I think that's a great point dude yeah sure last thing I was gonna say is just went on the issue of passion and motivation I mean we obviously understand that stuff needs to be created and that's why visualization is so important that's why connecting every day with your vision you know what what you want for your personal happiness what you want for your relationships what you want for your professional success doing that on a regular basis because if you don't regularly cultivate it it's gonna die it's not like you just create this vision for yourself and it's just one time right yeah it's just you know static no it's dynamic you have to continually revisit it and restrain it so that you create that passion right it doesn't just come and go yeah yeah I love it man I love it guys uh any question number two uh Andy first I want to thank you guys I've been a listener since 2017 I don't think there's an episode I haven't heard I went back and listened to all the MFCO episodes um you've had a profound impact on my life uh for the positive I've completed 75 hard multiple times and had big leaps for it every single time my question is how do you intercept negative thoughts and actions when they come up I do my best to exercise discipline and the ways you often talk about but I catch myself taking shortcuts on occasions sometimes I don't even realize it till it's too late then I'll mentally beat my own ass for it uh it's probably not productive so how do you catch yourself or is it just continuous awareness um and I'll get better and intercept my mind before I go there how does that work how do you stop those bad thoughts the moment that they come in if at all well first of all I think it's important to remember that you're always going to have bad thoughts no matter how strong no matter how condition your mind is no matter how mentally tough you become those negative thoughts are just a part of the human experience and so we are going to have negative thoughts no matter what uh you take the toughest person in the world that you look up to and you think nothing rattles me I promise you there's a lot of shit that bothers them and in fact I would bet that there's probably a lot more stuff that bothers them than the average person which is why they're so successful because successful people are usually experts at taking anxious frustrating negative thoughts and turning them into productive action that is one of the biggest separators between people who do and people who don't it's that people who do have the ability to take those negative thoughts and give them a sliver of legitimacy and let that propel them into action what what people who don't win do is they hear the negative thought and they do one of two things they either brush it off completely and act like it didn't happen okay which then ignores all the signals that are trying to be sent to that person about what they're not doing and what they're supposed to do or they dwell on it and they paralyze themselves because they let themselves get so negative and what we have to realize is that there's value in negative thoughts usually those negative thoughts are exaggerations of very valid points these are these are valid points that you need to address that have been exaggerated in your mind to meet become this mountain of a problem when in reality all that requires is a little bit of action so we have to learn to discern between what is an overly negative thought what is true and what should be dismissed and I think that a healthy place to be is to be the person who can look at the negative thought can deduce the truth from it and say okay well this is exaggerated but I do need to really work on this one thing and then take that negative thought and then propel it into immediate action that is what champions do I've never met someone who is what I would consider successful who doesn't operate that way with negativity and I think a lot of people especially earlier in the journey they believe that having negativity is something that the high achievers do not have and it's not that they don't have it or they found some trick to get away from it it's that they've learned how to use it productively without letting it paralyze them so that's my little take I mean what do you think dude I think you're right when you say that you're always going to have negative thoughts and I don't think you can necessarily get rid of them you just have to replace them you have to replace them with positive thoughts because it's not it's not enough just to run away from something bad you have to run towards something good and you know for me I you know working with you reading different books there's a there's a question that I ask myself that I got from a book called relentless solution focus that is a very simple question is when I'm when I'm attacked by a negative thought it's one what's one thing I can do right now to make this better yeah what's one thing I can do right now to make this better and you don't you don't focus on perfection you don't focus on perfectly solving the problem you you focus on progress because that's what obviously that's what elite achievers do they focus on getting better they know that you can chase perfection but you're never going to get it right so you just focus on moving along point by point day by day getting better and and that's I mean that's what works for me and I think that's what works for pretty much everybody I knew who's successful successful well dude I also think that it's important to realize that if you could just break this down in a very logical think about this logically okay and let's I know everybody likes to say we're not in a competition this is just about me versus me blah blah blah bullshit okay there's another there's a whole bunch of people I hear trying to do the same shit that you're doing and there's limited spots for that position whatever it is whether it be a place in the market of business whether it be a place inside of a company whether it be on a sports team whether it be auditioning for a play there are limited spots at the top of the fucking mountain regardless of what anybody else has told you and so what you have to think about this is break down what this means to you if you have a negative thought and most people get the negative thoughts and they shut down they start saying poor me I need therapy I'm broken I can't get ahead my parents screwed me over I was born in the wrong place and you start telling yourself all this stuff all right that's what most people do when the negative thoughts come in they beat themselves down into parallelization now if that person then works themselves out and let's say they take some two days to get over their negative thoughts so for like two days the quote unquote resting and recovering and processing their feelings all right and then you have you all right and you get the same negative thoughts this person gets except when you get the negative thoughts that this person gets you take those negative thoughts and you act in a way that moves you further from the place that you're afraid of immediately meaning you take that you pivot your actions into production now compare those two people like they're in a race all right they get the same amount of negative thoughts the first guy gets the negative thoughts it costs him two three days every time the second guy you gets the negative thoughts and it super charges you the right direction every single time what is the difference and how far you are going to go over the course of 10 years operating like that it is years of progress we're talking about either gaining or losing depending on how you handle negativity and depending on how you process it and do you process it quickly do you let it paralyze you or do you let it propel you forward and if you could be the person that lets it propel you forward you're going to have a massive advantage over almost everybody else and if I had to put a percentage on it I'd say like 99% of people 99% of people let the negativity stop them in their tracks stop their action make some reevaluate instead of pushing through they start saying well maybe I should move to Alaska and become a fisherman you know they started looking at all these other things when in reality dude you're just getting a signal it you should be looking at it like damn I'm blessed to have these signals I'm I'm kind of blessed to get this little burst of intuition that tells me I need to move right these are things that matter a lot to the progress of an individual and when you scale them out over time dude it's it's lifetimes of difference and so you just have to think about it practically you're you're racing a person who gets paralyzed every time they have negative thoughts so what are you going to do yeah it's almost like the negative energy it's it's a renewable energy bro the dark side energy is fucking a thousand times more potent than positivity the mental health days that's that solar energy bullshit bro listen it's like the EV shit listen dude it's a big prop the victim culture that's perpetuated in society is a huge problem for high achievers because high achievers that information is not for them that information is for everybody else it's for all the people who aren't going to ever really do anything we're going to wallow in their own lives in their own situations and they're going to create an identity around why they can't and why they're broken and why they're upset and that information isn't for you to consume as a driven ambitious person that's for other people who are never going to do anything the information that you need to consume is all the information is going to make you not like them all right so I don't know any high achievers that honestly like spend a lot of time in that in that you know touchy-feely and touch with their emotions type shit it's dude even me like I was around it for four or five years with a lot of people who were very much into that and bro it infected me it infected my mentality infected my personality in a negative way where I was like always processing like how I felt like it fuck I was felt like shit you know why because like I was all I ever thought about why do I fucking feel weird why do I feel weird what you know what you know what cured it getting into fucking fight bro warriors need to fucking war they need a fucking project to build they need an enemy to conquer they need a mission they need a purpose ambitious people need that if you you know you don't need rest bro you need fucking you need something to do you know and so when we think about like how high achievers are wired versus everybody else we have to look really realized that a lot of this information that's on the internet is poisonous to what we're trying to accomplish now I'm not saying that it doesn't help some people it probably does but I can tell you this sitting around focusing on your problems all fucking day long is never going to help anybody ever it's going to make it worse it very unpopular opinion but I think when people are down on themselves or when we're down on ourselves our our natural human response is to want to show compassion and want to be empathetic and that sort of thing but the reality is is that when I'm down on myself it's usually for two reasons number one I'm being selfish I'm just being prideful and focused on myself and I've lost the reality that really it's not about me that my motivation should be to provide value to other people it should be to help other people so get the focus off myself get it on to other people and get to work and that's the second point is that it's often because I'm lazy I'm making excuses I want to I want to look at myself and I'm going to say oh I'm so deficient in xyz I'm just never going to do anything special in life well no stop getting your focus off yourself and as you put it many times in the MFCO project put your faith in the work yeah get your focus off yourself stop wallering in self pity and just get to work and when you when you make it your point to help people when you get the focus off them and on excuse me off yourself and onto them and when you put your faith in the work and take action the negativity dissipates well dude and also you know if you've never done anything before how how do you know that the work is going to work you don't right okay and that paralyzes a lot of people a lot of people say man I'd really like to climb out Everest but how how do you climb it well bro you climb it just like everybody else climbed it's one fucking step at a time and it's going to be hard and you're not going to be able to breathe and it's going to it's going to be one of the hardest things you've ever done in your life but other people have done it so you could do it too and so we have to realize that you know we can't live in this place of idealistic thought we have to live in reality and in reality if you do the work eventually some good things are going to happen okay and when when the good things happen you get a burst of confidence you say look I did this work it's working and at the first time that ever happens you're so excited you can't even believe it and then what happens you keep doing the work because you got a little taste to something and then and then another win happens and all of a sudden now you have a little bit more confidence and then you keep working and another win happens it is bigger than the first two and then you keep working a little bit more so when ends up happening is you start to realize that you're just like everybody else if you do the work the result will be there and this idea that I'm going to do all this work and it's not going to work for me that's total bullshit okay what one man can do another can do and if one person goes through the maze you can go through the maze but you have to realize that you're going to have to start walking before you figure out that you can get to the other side and that's the big discovery of I guess of entrepreneurship is that we have to do the work to get the belief we don't have the belief and then do the work you might have a little belief you might say well I think I can do this but that's not really belief that's sort of like this might be a good idea right to actually have this unshakable unrelenting belief in what you were doing and who you are and what you're capable of you have to go down the path with the work so you have to put the faith in the work first get a little bit of reward you believe a little bit go a little bit further down the path get a little bit more reward your belief goes up you do that for five or six years bro you're going to realize that you're capable of anything as long as you go down the path and most people won't go down the path because they always ask themselves this what if I do all this work and it doesn't work and that's just not a reality I've never seen I've never ever ever seen someone who does the work the proper way and fucking fails it does not actually happen it's a myth if you look at the failed businesses if you look at the failed relationships if you look at the failed fitness journeys it's one of two things either one they didn't do the work long enough to get the result or two they were doing the wrong work okay so you were you thought you were doing it but you were doing the wrong thing that that's just as important you have to know that you're on the right path so how do we know on the right path we follow people who have been on the fucking path and this is why I talked to you guys about not buying these corn balls entrepreneurs courses who haven't built anything because how the fuck do you know how to get to China if you never fucking been to China you see what I'm saying so that's how you know you follow someone's path you role model them you learn by watching them and yeah Vaughan the fucking work is gonna come before the belief and if you want strong belief in yourself you're gonna have to do things to earn it that's why 75 hard is such a valuable program because you lack belief you lack confidence you lack grit you lack perseverance you lack all of the things that you actually need to that encompass what's called mental toughness to achieve once you develop these things you have high confidence and you know that you can achieve and that's the most powerful thing of the program it's not that people don't know what to do it said they don't have enough discipline to fucking actually do it which is what cost you everything in your life yeah I love it man Andy I want to actually just I don't I don't want to lose this and then this is listen this is a real-ass question I hate and this might go over some people say all right but I want you to give me a real answer here okay because we're talking about using this negative energy negative energy is powerful either way it could be it could help really help you or could really fuck you up right depending on how you use it are there times that you or maybe somebody else that you know high achievers right where they will literally create this negative energy out of fucking nowhere yeah I do it every day zero substance I do it every day can we talk about that yeah I wake up in the morning and I don't want to get out of bed yeah because I don't sleep very well so every morning I wake up my fucking exhausted I haven't woke up one time in the last 25 years and been like damn dude I slept good she's not reality for me and don't fucking send me your fucking protocols and all your fucking bad bad yeah yeah mother fuck I tried it all okay I've had fucking ton of sleep studies put crystals in your butt you guys right don't send me your shit that's what happens all the time yeah everybody's a fucking backyard expert like I just I've struggled with it forever I've never fucking explored the solution I've tried to figure yeah um so when I wake up I'm tired so I have people I hate on the internet right and so what I do is I fucking go right to their pages quietly I see what the fuck they're doing I get really pissed off I get the fuck out of bed and I say I'm gonna beat the shit out of these people today dude I use it every single day to get going every single day because it gives me anxiety a little bit in the morning and I'm like oh fuck I better get up because these my fuckers are added already okay and and like you know I'm an action deep shit right here I'm not actually hate them right but I do because I want to beat them you know I'm saying so I convinced myself that they're the enemy when in reality they're probably just doing their own thing yeah it reminds me like the you know the movie The Water Boy when when Bobby Wu-Shay is on the field and like he puts his that dude's face on the other player he's like would you say about my mother you know I was in like he's creating they in it but well that's that's that's a that's a play on a scene from the program so if you've ever seen the program which is a famous football movie is the best football movie ever fucking made really yeah even better than remember the Titan yes the pro anybody that actually played football knows the program okay place it at the table yes right starting defense place at the table there's this scene where Alvin Mack who is the star middle linebacker starts looking at this dude on the field and starts being like I saw you come out of my mom's house blah blah like it starts like making this shit up and the guys like we're talking about or you're about to fucking kills the guy right so like Michael Jordan's famous for that I was just gonna say yeah there are rookies that will say yeah like during games he'll look at him and go would you say to me I didn't say anything you Mr. Jordan no you're disrespecting me yeah and he would just create it in his head yeah that these these rookies were disrespecting him and then yeah rest this history it's a big deal dude a lot very all you know Tim Grover talks about cleaners everybody out there you think you're fucking cleaner you don't know shit about cleaning okay fucking Tim Grover is the only person in the world that could tell someone if they're cleaner or not you're not a fucking cleaner otherwise you would you wouldn't even think you were because that's how much of a cleaner you would be he talks about this all the time he's like the greatest people fucking invent problems to solve they invent enemies and three things that I have to have for me to feel motivated out of the three things is I have one of them is I have to have an enemy I have to have someone to defeat and you know when you're beating everybody's ass sometimes you gotta make that make that up you know what I mean or you've got to expand who your enemy is maybe maybe it's not this guy that's behind you that you've been stomping on for a while maybe it's this dude that's 10 miles ahead of you and you see what I'm saying yeah that's some deep shit yeah well rush limbaugh was pretty popular up until 91 but he took off in 92 because Bill Clinton became the president and then suddenly rush limbaugh had this like ultimate enemy that he could leverage and go after and it brought out the best of him and he obviously ended up becoming a legend and broadcasting I love it man I love it well guys Andy question number three third of final question hey Andy I'm 18 years old and I just finished high school my school went virtual three years ago and then we went back in person my senior year but it just felt weird and wrong I and many of my peers had a really hard time adjusting back to in person I feel like I'm just completely socially awkward I have a hard time speaking to people meeting new people and it honestly gives me a lot of anxiety to even have to think of doing it I'm not afraid of people I just feel like I get in those situations and don't really know what to do I don't really even remember what it was like before this cannot fix this of course you this is a perishable skill people skills a perishable skill if you don't practice them it becomes uncomfortable all right especially if you're an introverted human I am an introverted human that has had to learn extroverted skills and most people when they meet me they're like there's no fucking way this dude's an introvert no I am an introvert I had to fucking learn the skills most of my time I spend alone all right and I have no problem with it I'm not trying to like you know call Vaughn and say Vaughn I'm always alone no Vaughn calls me I'm like what do you want yeah right so like I'm not having these fucking problems with it like it's what I like and my skill set has become so strong that it doesn't even show right but when we get ourselves out of that as introverts like if I'm not around people for a long time or I don't like you know because dude there's there's months at a time where I'm not around anybody but here right and I know these people these people are family to me but like I'm talking about outside right my skills diminish it's just like shooting a pistol or playing a guitar or you know being fit if you don't practice it on a regular basis your skill set diminishes and so can you get it back yeah you you can get it back very easily do you know how you brush up on a skill set that you have diminished you go practice all right so how can you put yourself in a position in today's day and age with the technology that we have to have reps in terms of people skills well there's a number of things you can do you can get a job where you have to talk to people every day retail jobs are great for this okay but one thing that you could do without changing your job is something that I used to do all the time I made a little exercise for myself which is actually part of Livhard and phase three where I made myself go into a grocery store and actually have conversations with people and so when I was bad with people and I realized that I needed to improve what I would do is I would go to the grocery store and I would force myself to have three conversations with total strangers these are not conversations like hey nice shoes I'm talking about a conversation okay and three or four times you're gonna get shut down people are gonna look away they're they're gonna act weird and you have to get through that that's the point okay and once you start to get back into the the zone of having these reps where you talk to people you get used to it again you get good at it again and and the problem that you're having dissipates so yeah dude you could definitely get that back but you got to put yourself in a position to take the reps actually a lot of studies have been done on this and to encourage people to actually do it you're right that you will encounter people who are just don't know how to handle you and don't know what's rarely personal though it's just they're they're they're in the same boat that you're in but they've done all sorts of studies on this and the reality is is that most people are anxious about opening up a conversation with a stranger but 90 to 95% of people who are surveyed say that they are very open to responding to a stranger they just don't want to initiate it so that's good news for anybody who wants to practice their skill set is that those people might not you know start the conversation but they will engage in it but the other thing that I find really interesting and I just read this in a book called Super Communicators by Charles DuHig is that most people really don't want to do you know shallow small talk they're fine if you launch into a serious conversation they're fine if you launch into a deep topic and so you have that opportunity to not just strengthen your skill set in terms of your people skills but you have the opportunity to get reps on how to really build rapport with people how to go deep with them and I mean can you think of a better thing that you need to be able to do to succeed in business in life no to be able to connect deeply with another human being it's absolutely 100% essential yeah I feel like to you know even I mean especially like this younger generation man there's a lot of things that I think have kind of just been left out and and we we cover a lot of this stuff on the other episodes you know but not going too deep here but it's like even just simple stuff like a handshake man like how important a handshake is dude I think we're in a situation and culture right now where a lot of people think that they can get by without the people skills but what they don't realize and what you what you have to understand is that understanding people is essential to sales even if you're doing it digitally if you're a digital sales marketer and you don't have people skills you're going to be shitty at marketing the people so having people skills is it's the foundation of all business success because you can create a cash flow machine and you can create a funnel and sell a widget but how are you going to market if you don't understand people if you don't understand their wants their needs their desires their problems the only way you could do that is by talking to people and the person who has people skills versus the person who doesn't is going to win exponentially bigger this is a big reason why I'm successful in business and more successful than a lot of other people a lot of people that I compete with did not have to do business pre internet okay my first 10 years in business was in person before social media before the internet really became what it is today so what did I learned during that time I learned all these skills of how to deal with people how to talk to people how to go through a sales process all of these things and when that translates into technology it makes you immensely more powerful than any of your competitors that don't understand that so if you do have the people skill you have to understand most of your young colleagues and most of your young peers are ignoring that skill set thinking that they can get around it and if you put the time into getting it and you learn the skillsets that you'll crush them you'll run them the fuck over okay so having great people skill and by the way this translates into who you're going to date or who you're going to marry or who your friends are going to be like do you really want to create this little cash flow funnel and you think that you're going to have all these high quality friends that's not how it works bro I don't sit around with my wealthy friends and talk about bullshit we talk about real things we talk about real business and you know what we talk about the most how to manage our businesses and you know what that is that's people okay so if you don't have people skills or deep understanding of people not only will you not be a successful in business you won't be interesting and you won't have a great friend circle all right because here's the truth of the high level people that you want to be around they assume you are already making money that's no one cares like no one gives a fuck how much no one in the wealthier circles sits around and talks about how much money they make they don't because everybody has it so what do they talk about they talk about how to scale how to grow bigger what new ideas how do we get people to do this how do we create that how do we put this initiative in play how do we move people this direction how do we create our organization to be this those are the things that are discussed that it's not Taylor Swiss new tour and the widget that you sold through your click funnel no one fucking cares man so realize that even if you're a little bit successful with your digital platform if you don't have people skills not only will you not be as good as you could be you're going to get crushed by people who have it and by the way the people who crush you that have it are going to have awesome relationships and awesome connections and a deeper network which is going to make them even more formidable to compete with so if you're young and you don't have people skills or you're an introvert and you don't have people skills I would highly recommend making an intentional investment in developing those any way that you can because it's becoming more and more rare which means it's more and more powerful the young man mentioned that just making that transition back from COVID and virtual to in person and real it you know produces a lot of anxiety social anxiety and Andy you've talked about before that a huge way to overcome that is to do what you call auditing your attempt yeah about that yeah well look dude if you if you have the right intent it's really hard to mess up okay you know this is the the power of intent is something that I've learned through the course of learning how to speak when I first started speaking you know I'm standing in front of eight people in one of my stores with a piece of paper in my hand shaking like a leaf scared to death right now I go on stage in front of fucking it doesn't matter how many people right and I'll go up there and and crush it and people ask all the time they're like well how do you do that how do you do that well it's very simple if you have the proper intent I am here to serve I am here to help I am here to teach I am here to make sure that these people walk out of this room better than they walked in the room that intent they can feel so what you say and how you behave kind of gets lost and overshadowed by the intent that you have so it becomes very difficult to fuck up when you have the proper intent about delivering some sort of benefit and in the sales process or in the people process it's the same thing if you're intent with a customer is to help them solve the problem the best way that you can in a way that makes them say damn dude I really enjoy doing business with these people if you have that intent my intent is not to sell you my intent is to solve your problem you are going to make more money than everybody else because everybody else is selling and you're helping and a lot of people think well that's just a creative word switcheroo no it's a totally different thing because selling has one intent and helping has another intent all right and people know the difference everybody knows do you know when you're going you're being sold 100% do you know when you're being sold do you guys listening know when you're being sold you're all shaking your head yes and everybody knows so what's standing out to you when you meet someone who doesn't sell you well it's their intent they fucking care they want to solve my problem they were very helpful they didn't push me they made me feel good about what I'm doing they were there for me post-sale very very important concepts for your company or your individual position of being an entrepreneur so go ahead oh sorry I didn't mean to and on the issue of intent and knowing when you're getting sold for me a clear indication that somebody is trying to sell me rather than help me is that they're just talking yeah just have a monologue yeah they're not they're not asking questions they're not listening they're not they have a they have a rehearsed yes they have a rehearsed script that they have said a million times hey sir thank you for coming in no no no it's not like that that's not what it is it's it's here's what it is this is why this is why sales people get like that they start like that okay they start they don't know shit then they figure out a little bit of stuff and they start to come up with like a little talk track hey Steve are you doing I was the family how's your kids oh your kids play soccer my kids play soccer and they have this like cheese dick presentation that they think sounds really good but they don't realize that they're not fooling anyone and so what it is is it's someone it's a salesperson's own ego thinking that they are smarter than the customer and they've had success with this talk track getting in the way of actually actually listening actually communicating actually having a conversation and dude anybody who's an experienced salesperson can see this immediately this happens a lot with young salespeople young salespeople they think that they're so smart they think that they understand more this person you're talking to has been on the earth just as long as you if not longer do you think they've never been sold before do you think you're the first person to come up with some sort of talk track that's her Steve how you doing man like with this fake enthusiasm that you do like dude it's important to be enthusiastic but you should be enthusiastic with the right intent hey Vaughn dude listen man we're gonna get you where you're trying to go all right like this you have to actually care it's not this fucking rehearse talk track that's repeated 70 times a day because you have so many calls to make and that's the difference between people who make a lot of money and people who don't people who make a lot of money in sales in business they take the person in front of them and they treat them like a human being they listen they respond appropriately they solve the problem and they do so in a genuinely enthusiastic way because their intent is lined perfectly with what this person is trying to get and so when we talk about like Vaughn's mentioned a couple times on this show helping people right changing people's lives like these are things that allow you if you think about what it is that you do to have the right intent when you speak to someone your job like for example my job with employees is to offer so much value that if they leave our company and they go somewhere else they say dude I learn more work in there than anywhere else I could have ever worked that's my intent when I teach our employees it's not about just here it's about everywhere they go so if my intent is that for them how do you think they feel about me you see what I'm saying now if I went in there and I said just do this for this and this and this and this and this and this and I tried to like teach them all the hacks and the tricks and then this they're gonna walk out of there being like bro this is some bull shit right I should be selling fucking home warranties or car warranties because it doesn't this doesn't really mean anything you see what I'm saying so we have to fucking find that right balance where's your intent how much do you actually care are you trying to solve the problem and then that by the way that doesn't just happen to the customer that's what your employees to what is your intent for your employees is your intent to milk every ounce of productivity out of this person for the cheapest possible amount of money or like most jobs or is your intent to put them through the process of growth and let them understand that if they do this and learn this and apply these skills and do so over time and they use the you know the the skill skill set effort plus time formula which is what success that's all success is all successes how hard you work what kind of skills you have and what kind of time you put in and if you if you teach people this and you teach them skills they they love you for that because you actually give a fuck about them this is the same way with friends it's the same way with employees it's the same way with customers it's just a way of life that if you live is not only extremely fulfilling and rewarding but also highly profitable and a lot of people in business they don't understand how much more business there is to get if they would just look at it that way right like they're in business they're saying oh I'm doing well I'm making bro if you're someone right now and you think I'm doing great this is bullshit all I got to do is keep doing this dude you would probably make ten times the amount of money if you could figure out how to implement what it is I'm talking about that's the truth because now not only do people just come to you they're out there telling people to go to you you see what I'm saying they become loyal they're not just satisfied totally different thing absolutely I I be honest with you this kind of stuff is what I'm super interested in this I this is my jam this is what I I try to become the best student possible that I can on impacting people making a connection with people I love watching you over the years how you connect with people knowing you're an introvert and yet being at summer smash seeing how you're got the icon tag going got the the handshake got the asking the questions and for me as I've observed and read and studied to me there's a difference between the thing that makes the difference between average people who know how to communicate and connect and the elite level connectors are the average people ask questions about facts and elite level people ask questions to build friendship and I've kind of come up with a little acronym for me to help me remember is L O V E love what kind of questions should should you ask people ask them what they like ask them their opinion ask them what they value ask them about their experiences don't just ask oh what do you do for a living no ask hey what's what's the greatest thing about what you do what do you enjoy the most or where you from don't ask where you're from say what's what do you love the most about where you're from you get people to ask questions or sorry you ask people questions that get them to share what's inside of them what they value what they what what they've experienced what they like all that stuff and that builds rapport that creates emotional connection and which sounds a little foo foo but what I mean by that is it's it's it's what I've got an acronym for that yeah it's G a Y yeah I just can bro I love it I just had I just had no I couldn't think of a witty come back for that I don't know I couldn't think of a witty come back for that I don't know for that but you're really good at asking questions I mean when we first met you were asking great questions and then I was the one who was interviewing me you right when we first met it when I was a editor at a magazine but I think that's just showing genuine interest in people and not asking these canned questions like you were saying these cheesed it questions that that sales people ask and I really wanted to get to know people and to value them and if you do that people are gonna respond really well yeah I'm just teasing that was really no no no I know where I'm used to it I'm not really I love it man guys Andy Vaughn that was three yeah man hey thanks for coming in on the show dude I think this is really relevant to a lot of the young guys and gals who are listening to this I think that there's this idea that to be a charismatic really great people person you have to be this super eloquent speaker you have to be really polished it's just not true you have to be authentic to who you are and I think that anybody who's ever had an experience like where they went into somewhere and maybe there was a person and they were really nervous and they weren't really you know polished but you could tell that that person really wanted to help you like that makes all the difference in the world so I don't want anybody thinking that to to be this great people person you have to be super sophisticated and polished you know fact I think you know I think I think that's such a myth bro that that actually handicapped people a lot because one it makes them not start because they don't think they're polished enough or two they're so polished they don't connect right million dollar smile yeah right right you know what I'm saying remember that guy yeah yeah yeah so oh damn what he said he's dead oh is he you guys let's get ready to smile no what it was it I'm fired up that guy that guy passed away yeah he did oh he did he's dead yeah all right I guess you got the zero dollar smile huh hey look if you guys enjoyed today's show remember we have the msco project coming back now it's going to be on a private platform it's not going to be on iTunes it's not going to be on Spotify so you're going to have to pay attention for when it comes out we'll make sure that we hit you on the email blast if you're not on the email list go on to Andy for seller calm get subscribed to the Andy Graham I'll send you an email every day I'm not going to spam you but I'm going to send you a motivational slash informational slash positive information email that you're going to get every single morning it serves as my post sort of like what I used to do on Instagram but it just comes through email so a lot of you guys are like why don't you post dude I haven't missed a post in four or five years every single morning you get one if you're on the email list and if you're on the email list you know you'll know when the msco projects gets gets going too so I'm really looking forward to that these are some of my favorite types of conversations you know I love talking about what's going on in the world and I love joking around with you guys but at the end of the day the the solution to what's happening here is not just awareness it's execution it's skill set and that's what we're working to build with you guys with this new project that we're getting ready to launch so let me ask you a question yeah some of your listeners not might be wondering this why bring mfco back why not just have me on real a f and and do q&a's like we're doing today because first of all I think we when we moved from doing mfco into doing real a f I saw a need okay and the need was there was not enough awareness to what was happening in the world and because there was not enough awareness to what was happening in the world the soil that allows us to grow our businesses out of was becoming infertile where we couldn't even have the opportunities that I've been blessed enough to have and I recognize that I'm usually two or three years ahead of what I see coming down the road and that comes from being an entrepreneur that comes from me having to look down the tracks with my business to figure out what's going to happen so I can anticipate that so I applied that to real a f for the last four years four and a half years and the awareness is there people have woken up they they understand their responsibility they understand they have a responsibility to be great and I enjoy doing the CTI's with DJ we have a good time it's it's more humor it's as much humor now as it is information and we have fun doing that but I've also recognized we're not going to stop doing that because it is fun but I've recognized that there's a very big need for tactical information again about teaching especially young people how to win you know the education system is failing we have a lot of parents out here that don't know what to do with their kids and don't want to send their kids to a $200,000 university and I think you know I have a duty to share with the generation coming behind me all the things that I've learned along the way and that's what we're going to do and we're going to create a new version of you know personal development skill set practical skill set how to think how to act what the skills are that is you know in podcast format and we're going to bring back you know what is the most successful entrepreneur podcast of all time and I'm looking forward to it me too I enjoy the conversations like I genuinely I genuinely I don't always enjoy talking about what's going on in the world because it drains me but when I have these conversations and I share like you know what I've learned and and all these things I know it truly helps people because I hear from you guys all the time and that's what we need I think we have a lot of people now that realize like oh shit I can't just coast if I do just coast you know our country's going to and our culture's going to be bad and I think we're in a situation where when we started doing the MSEO we caught a lot of people that just wanted to make money and be successful now with real AF we've caught a lot of people that understand they have an obligation to be the best they can to protect the country so we have two different groups of people we have a group of people that wanted to be successful because they want to be successful and then we have a group of people now who have figured out that they have an obligation to be the best that they can possibly be and so now we're in a situation where we need to start teaching those skill sets and the the reality is is I'm a different human and I think differently even though a lot of the lessons are practically going to be similar there's a whole lot of new perspective that it had since we stopped that podcast I'm a much better operator I'm way way more intelligent in business I'm way more educated in different levels of business because since then our company has grown exponentially so there's a lot of new information and there's a lot of new things and I think when we really talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion we we you and me have to put our efforts towards actually cultivating this next generation of leaders and winners and and that's that's you ask why that's why yeah well personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion and in my opinion excellence in business and life is the ultimate form of patriotism yeah yeah and well and also I think it honors the creator pretty well 100% you know what's your feelings on that we talk about that a lot yeah we talked about that yeah I mean I think the greatest thing you can do as an act of worship to God is to become who you're meant to be yeah and to fulfill your potential and to do everything you can to maximize the time you're on earth the treasure that you've been given the talent you've been given and to turn every opportunity into a win yeah I think that's that's very honoring God yeah I agree so that's why and we've been working on it we've been working on this project for almost two years guys so we're very very excited to get it launched for you guys very very soon so keep an eye out for that email we'll also talk about it here on real AF and we'll let you guys know but dude thanks for coming in and being on the show bro oh you bet appreciate your man yeah I appreciate you all guys DJ huh I appreciate DJ too appreciate you ball yeah you got more melon in my let's go to
