Yeah, yeah, I ran a little bit this morning Where's your unto you That's all I said no, I ran a little bit outside for real I ran the the the shorts of the buildings you did With your rock on with my rock on. Yeah, it's hard and it's different. It's weird. Yeah, it is it's like bouncing you around Yeah, my calves are on fire. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I pride a little bit too. Yeah, yeah, it's gonna hurt your subscription Count over there on the olden calves. Yeah, you got to protect my make nothing good. I boost it up really my calves are looking fucking sweet Right, yeah, they are that's home. How do you how do you tell? Little is that just you say an add or your subscriptions going up?

Yeah, so if you make some more money on them calves, then I'll hear you're you're bragging about it Well guys, I thought to you sure No, man, listen, we got a lot of really really good stuff going on in the world And I felt it was appropriate to start off with just exposing some Apocrycy okay, I think it's very very important and I just I love personally just love exposing Apocrycy like when I see it I just want to you know freak it out, you know I want I want to expose some hypocrisy as well. Yeah, yeah My own oh, yeah So I made a I made a I made a story yesterday where I told everybody not to worry about the haters Right and stop talking about haters Uh-huh and then they can't get very far if they keep spending their energy on haters Because every minute that you talk about a hater or you think about a hater or you or you spend energy on a hater is Energy that you can't spend on moving forward and I got some Pushback on that you know from a lot of people who've done a lot more things than me too. Oh, yeah So how did I go? I yeah, I was sarcasm. Oh, okay Something like wait, wait, what did must they but these people these people were like You but you always say to take the negative energy and use it to move you know shit, man Like can we just get to a level of common sense please? Can we understand that there's nuance and everything that everybody says can we not can we just get to the point where you don't have to blast me with the details of something I said Over here when I say something else over here and can we use our critical thinking to kind of make a little common sense sandwich Both things can be true. Yes, please. Yeah, please Because I mute your fucking ass the minute you send me that shit just so you know So there's my hypocrisy of the day. Yeah, you see their message and they no longer see you. That's probably how that works bro It's just it's just like people want to be the first one to like display how intelligent they are gotcha And it's like oh, yeah, you got me bro. Yeah, I totally changed my tune, you know like holy shit dude Like what is this? I don't know what is this in culture, bro 2023. Yeah, it's weird man. It's a weird time man It's a weird time y'all gotta think a little bit more. Yeah, I'm saying well do the internet is full of it in them I mean you ever need to fill that cup up all you do is just go online for like 10 minutes. Oh man It is there ain't a lie. It's just like this first topic, man before we get to our main headlines guys I want to bring this bring this topic up because I it's just hilarious So you're familiar with the Miss Universe thing right? Mm-hmm. I think so there's like all different ones. Yeah, you know, yeah, there's a lot of universes right now for sure Yeah, there's some alternate realities But yes, there's this universe contest, right? So this is in the news again. It's trending right now Because of the most recent winner of a select country guys. Let's dive in for this conversation in case you guys have not seen this yet So the recent crowning of a white Zimbabwean as the nation's Miss Universe representative was met with much Derision after many voiced their disapproval over the winners race in a country where white people make up a small minority Brooke Brooke Jackson Which I think is a dope name just like I mean anytime you like double repeated. I think it's cool Like Coco host like Coco host. Yeah Yeah, I don't know about that yet. You guys will see that later. Yeah, but Brooke Brooke Jackson a 21 year old Herod native was crown Miss Universe Zimbabwe 2023 last Saturday after edging out 11 other finalists after the competition Return to the African country after a 22 year absence. So here's Brooke Brooke Okay Here's Brooke Brooke again Okay, now now listen. She's she's born raised. She's a as a bobway in native, okay, so she's actually like born there Okay, um, which that that comes up a little bit later Um, but she put this post out on Instagram. I thought it was important to post um because she has a very real perspective of of what's going on She she posted this on Instagram Um Saying it's giving behind the scenes at Miss Universe Um, just wow Zimbabweans are so talented this work of art says a thousand words about Our beautiful nation this costume is a celebration of diversity in the human race The recycled zebra skin and the porcupine quill show the beautiful art created by black and white stripes A representation of unity amongst people the color of our skin should not define a person or who each person chooses to associate with Together, we are aligned a beautiful kind made by God the calorie shows our representation of fertility and womanhood And this is to say we are all born the same way no matter the color of of your skin But we are brought into earth through the same path Um, and this was the picture that went along with that. I agree with her Absolutely agree now here's a thing. That's an amazing message. She's been getting a lot of hate Um, by black people um all over the internet with tweets like this one Um from a legendary nobody, okay, there's the name of that person's social media posts Um with the caption saying a white woman can be Mrs. Zimbabwe in the real world But a black girl playing a fictional mermaid character was a bridge too far for some Um or tweets like this saying LMAO the shot is still tragic though all those beautiful Melonated women and you're telling me the European woman want a contest for black people Um, and it just goes to show the ignorance right and they posted this along with that that it's not ignorance. It's hate Yeah, it's hate just like it's hate when it was happening to black people here in this country Yeah, but I mean, but I say ignorance being like coming from like the true lack of knowledge. No, it's they don't care They don't care if they know the facts are irrelevant. This is an emotional response Mm-hmm. This is our shit. It's not your shit. Fuck you. Yeah, that's what that's what this is This is no different than when black people were fighting for you know equal rights and a place in culture and a place in this country and They were they were faced with people who were saying well because you're black You're not an American because you're black. You don't deserve the same rights because you're black You know stay out of our schools stay out of our Workforce know your place stay out of our community right that went on in America for a long time This goes on in other countries exactly that same way today Versus white people right where the white people are the minority and if we take any race and We were to say this was Asians and let's say another an Indian right the minority is always singled out This is not exclusive to black or white. This is this is human group think behavior and tribalism and it's dangerous and it's wrong Yeah, and um doesn't matter how advanced the society is no that's people that's correct. Yeah, and so We that that woman Rickbrook who wrote that post she's correct If we do not understand if we as human beings can not get on the same page That we are all the same and that we are all here for a reason and that we are all here to contribute to each other help each other Push each other to be better help each other when things go wrong be there for each other be examples for each other And we can't like learn to like work together bro We're always going to be ruled over by these elite tyrant fox who rape and pillage our community and our society and steal everything from us and make our lives miserable the reason they they exploit that these elite people globally the globalists they exploit the human bias towards people that don't look like them and that that's something that takes conscious effort to overcome and Bro, it doesn't matter if it's you know anti black or anti white or anti Indian or anti Asian or whatever bro It's fucking wrong. We're human beings. Yeah, right and You know, it's interesting to me that uh You know, I mean look dude. I just can't stand the hypocrisy. Well, no, I can't stand it either bro because like when you see headlines like this Right like you know model makes history as first black plus sized woman crown miss great Britain You know You go over to miss miss irland who won uh Asha accord accord a crown miss universe irland 2023 That's supposed to be irland. Yeah, but dude listen man. Why are they doing that? Why is this happening? Well, they want they want to normalize generalization like they want everybody to be the same They want to remove any type of merit or hold or nationalism hold on hold on When you think of Irish people, what do you think of? I think of uh Guinness no, what kind of people to what do Irish people look like white people White people what kind of white people is red hair Leopard guns. Yeah, all right. They're now leopard cats right though, but they got red hair. Yeah, all right And they're white. Yeah, okay, funny now. Yeah, and they drink a shit time. Okay, and they do yeah now here's the thing If you wanted to create a one-world government What would you first have to do to all the individual countries? You would have to redefine the cultural standard at which people view the people who inhabit those countries All right, that's called demoralization national identity That's the removal of a national identity so that people won't resist the formation of a one-world government system Okay, so what this migration is about that's been happening in Europe for a long time and it's happening here is about changing the The actual visual Identity that people have for these countries so that people have less to fight for and less to be proud of all right The reason it had the reason they have a hard time doing it in America is because Americans are not inherently racist And most Americans understand that we are a cultural melting pot of many different cultures of many different kinds of people that come from everywhere else in the world and Look many different ways and so we all know that like we've already been taught You know our whole lives for the most part minus these kids that are like 20 right now, right? The rest of everybody has always been taught along the lines of like what Martin Luther King taught Which is we judge people on the content of character not on the color of their skin Which is the truth? That's how we should do it But when we think about what's actually going on here. This is not about anything else Other than removing people's sense of pride in their host nations So that their host nations can be conquered by a globalist communist movement that keeps everybody under this one identity Of globalism right a citizen of the earth And for that to happen we have to remove their identity as an individual nation and that's what we're work That's what we're witnessing here and they're using people's bias and racism and inherent you know differences against each other to make it happen So yeah, I didn't it's frustrating, you know Well, I think that's one of the other things so that they're trying to accomplish this division Uh, between these different no quote-unquote races like correct They want everybody fighting over they want people to fight over yes, they want white people to get pissed off They want the black people in Zimbabwe to kill these fucking white people and they they want they want that same shit here in America They want white Americans to like hate black Americans. That's why that's why they do this shit. You know You know like you guys disagree tell please tell us how I mean like listen bro. It's late. I see now It's what I see in the other like do listen black people get so pissed off Okay, real talk dude You and you and me together we're together fucking I'm more I'm with you more than anybody else any other human on this fucking planet. All right Not bad, right? No, it's all right You know I get a front row seat the only calves. It's good shit. All right, but like here's the thing bro How many times real talk? How many times have you opened your phone and showed it to me? Where they've been highlighting some like really disgusting poor behavior amongst black people and been like bro This is fucking embarrassing. How many times have you done that to know thousands thousands of times They do that intentionally because they want white people to hate black people and then they want to paint white people as these like Racist bigot people to hate black people because without that Contention and without that division these people can't run their play Yeah, there's no control right and so we all have to get smarter when it comes to these things and start to realize that when we start to have these Feelings of animosity towards people of another race that they are winning the battle that they are trying to fight Okay, because it's easy to have those feelings right like it's when I watch 20 videos in a row of a black mob being the fuck out of white people Like I start to feel a certain way about it Just like people will feel a certain way if the roles were reversed and that's intentional They feed us that and we have to be smart enough to take a step back and be like bro They are feeding us this shit bro. They feed you listen think about this They feed you ads Based off of what you talk about off in verbally right your phone Here's what you're talking about how many times have you been talking about something and you pick up your phone and see an ad for it Okay, now if they're that skilled at presenting you with an ad that you didn't even search for that you only talked about Think how skilled they are at feeding you this information to make you hate people that don't look like you Right to see things is gonna invoke this Yes, and so we have to be real about this bro And we have to rise above it and we have to stand tall on it and say dude this isn't right No matter if it is upsetting us. No, we have to step aside and be like bro. Yes, that's wrong But this is not representative of the big picture Most people are good most people want to the same things we want to be left alone We want to have a shot at the American dream. We want to have an equal opportunity We're not gonna ever have equal outcome. I'm tired of hearing that shit. All right But the reality is is if we're gonna win this fight against these people We have to not only not comply with their demands But we also have to not comply with their manipulation that they intentionally yes. Yes So like dude, it's you know, it's an uncomfortable discussion to have like bro I don't feel good saying like yeah, man When I see these videos of black people just attacking the fucking innocent white people walking down the street Like it makes me angry and it makes me mad and it pisses me off That's not a comfortable thing for me to say but it's true Right, and I have to step back and be like bro. They're they're trying to do that We have to remember we're being manipulated. Yeah, how many times we had that talk? Thousands yeah, thousands and both ways too like both ways like wait when you've been pissed off And I'd be like hey remember and when I and we all have to do that together We have to check each other's own because yes because this extremism Is being manufactured intentionally and I'm seeing a lot of extremism on both sides now right? Like I'm seeing a lot of black people openly fucking hate white people and I'm seeing and by the way That's been going on for a long time That's been accepted my entire life It's always been acceptable for black people to openly fucking say mean hateful shit towards white people and then when white people say well, that's reverse racism or racism They say it can't be racist because we're not the we're not the oppressing party Okay, that that's what that's what the excuse that's been my whole life. I'm just being honest. Okay Now if you flip the the roll over the other way the same applies Okay, we have to be able to say surgeons on that side now where you yeah bro There's people there's people that are white that never said shit before that are starting to say like racist shit And I don't fucking like that either It's not right either way and I don't think you defeat You know that culture the like we have to get we have to rise above it is what I'm saying and like dude it We shouldn't be judging people on their fucking skin color like what no matter what it is that's that's a that's a low IQ Way to look at the world That's real shit, man. I mean, what do you think? I want 100% man, and I think too like I mean I think it just shows Or or reveals like the people who are writing these posts like this right like How ignorant you know, I'm saying like like bro. It's just like you're showing how Hold on low IQ of a human you really are are they These are both anonymous accounts with no personal name on them. Oh, well, yeah So are these just people who are just ignorant or are these people who are Okay, well, that's a road. Yeah Yeah, I mean because like listen, we all know that's a real thing There there is no doubt there are bot forms out there and just like you alluded to it's like you know There's algorithms of a design to show you exactly what they want you to see not what you want to see what they want you to see right It's very possible, man. Just remember Remember this this is real shit If black people in America if black people and white people ever figured out that they aren't actually enemies Those people up at the top they're fucking done They are done and they know they're done if that happens. That's why they propagate that message so hard Fuck man guys jump it on this conversation Uh for this intro. Let us know what you guys think about this Um, definitely an interest in conversation. I think it's a worthy conversation to have we got to have more of it Yeah, 100% yeah, and like girl we have to put away these top these labels and shit that you like when people when you start to talk about race And people say well, that's racist just because somebody calls you a name or throws an insult at you or you're afraid of that does not mean Should not have the conversation because that is a tactic that they use to keep us from solving the problem Right, and why do they want us to not solve the problem because they're hoping that we don't notice that they are The actual problem. It's a fact, man It's a fact. Well guys, it is cti remember if you want to see any of these pictures Videos links articles go to Andy for seller.com you can find them there You can also drop down in our youtube description Uh for this video and check out the links hyperlink there as well Uh, so that with that being said that's uh, let's get into headline number one.

It was called comedy and those jokes Yeah, well dude all good comedy is based on the truth. That's why it's funny. So like When we when we think about like How we handle things now like it really takes a lot of the juice That you would really enjoy about your life and that we would enjoy as a culture out of the game Because we can't even like make slight little jokes at each other like we would do amongst our own kind Right like because it's interpreted as racist like bro We have to get away from this we have to get back to laugh them with each other having a good time with each other Appreciating each other's differences learning from each other like dude this shit this shit that they're doing bro It's nobody's with it. Yeah, like nobody's with it bro like Dude Black people in with it. No, they're not like you in real life when you go around black people and and you know Like you fuck around joke around everybody laughs and vice versa like it's Well, that's the thing where nobody's gonna give you permission to do it either like that This is something that you guys are gonna have to on the individual level exercise Well, like and you see it all the time with me like bro.

Why people don't know how to use internet. Hey, hey, hey, hey Bro, you got the president of the United States saying shit like that. Yeah, I was quoting yeah Well guys, let's get into this first headline headline number one headline number one reads a McCarthy confronts key decisions as Congress hurtles towards government shut down This is a CNN article to jump this conversation off With six days until the government runs out of money how speaker Kevin McCarthy has a choice to make does he risk a shutdown to keep his job What does he cross his republican heartliners by working with the democrats? It's a defining moment that has been months in the making to build favor with his detractors McCarthy is allowing Republicans to move forward with voting on a series of appropriation bills this week Even though they will be dead on arrival in the democratic controlled senate But time is running out and republicans have felt a rally around a short-term option Uh, and the promises McCarthy made in January when he Bout to hardliners to get a speaker's gavel are finally coming home to roost quote This is the third major fight of the Congress opening week Dead-selling and now government funding said GOP rep Patrick Mahinry of North Carolina one of McCarthy's trusted allies Who helped negotiate the bipartisan debt-selling deal quote? This is this was always going to be a battle Now we're seeing articles and headlines all these things are popping up now is looking like it's gonna be Like it looks like the government is gonna shut down Um, everybody's pretty much an agreeance Got articles, you know, trying to already like, you know tell people what's gonna happen and who's gonna be affected from the military federal employees National park public spaces airports things like that um, but you know high food stamps will still run so that's good um and uh You know i rs That's not gonna shut down. Right. That's good. Uh, but here's a thing though guys Uh-oh Guess what's not gonna be affected Ukraine. Oh man you craze gonna be just fine This uh headline reads Pentagon exempts Ukraine operations from potential government shutdown This decision means that training on American tactics and equipment can move forward uninterrupted if lawmakers don't reach a funding deal By the end of the month. Yeah, they'll be just fine and you know uh, what else is gonna be just fine in Ukraine Uh, all of their first responders. They're funding fashion stores their schools and their forms are all gonna be just fine Even though our government will be shut down um over 57,000 first responders. They're gonna keep their jobs They're gonna keep their pay. They're gonna keep working and not gonna have any issues um Andy, what do we got on this? I Don't know how any American citizen can be okay with your hard earned tax dollars being used to support something in Europe that nobody Has any connection to personally in this country. I don't think that If I'm being honest, I don't understand how there hasn't already been a revolution here. Oh man Yeah, I really don't like we've been It's because people don't understand the financial oppression that we've been subjected to Or in survival mode. They don't understand it dude. Yes, they're in survival mode So they can't really grasp what's happening. You know, you have a president Who has intentionally done all these things that have damaged our country and you can say oh well It's not intentional. Okay. Well if you were going to intentionally destroy the country from the inside What would you be doing differently right all right? So you have a guy who has come into office who has taken Uh, you know every single step possible to make things harder on the American people He shut down the strategic uh pipelines He just finished the other one off in Alaska like two weeks ago now gas is going back up right which means that transports going up Which means that cost of goods are going up um He has You know open the border so we have all these these migrants here that need to go back where they came from Um, we could go on and on and on down the list He's sending all of our money to Ukraine We're letting all this crime happen in the cities etc etc etc And The American people are still working And they can't afford to eat they can't afford to like pay their bills credit card debt is at an all-time high credit card default is in an all-time all-time high uh and This has been going on for for you know decades like this the real problem with the real system Which is the fact that 50% plus of our income is squandered by 600 people in Washington DC While we all are out here trying to just you know get our piece of the American dream They've intentionally removed the American dream from the palette of possibilities for us By creating it a situation where it's almost impossible to survive from the middle class right And that's part of what we've been talking about for many years on this show Which is to have communism you have to have two classes you have a very rich elite class And then you have a peasant class and so everything they've been trying to do and this includes these big financial institutions these big fund management Who've been buying up all the residential real estate right like They're intentionally making it impossible to be a middle class American right and while they're doing this They're sending all of your money to Ukraine And and a lot of you guys are still thinking it's okay to vote for this shit You're still identified with a quote-unquote I'm a Democrat or I'm a this or I'm a that bro you what you are is a fucking idiot Okay, because we are fucking slaves in this country We are people who work very hard and our money is sent to all these different places and then stolen by the people that we elect to look after this country and It's infuriating you know like when I see this fucking twerp Zelensky and Washington DC in our Congress giving a speech, you know like you did a while back and then come here again And asked to address Congress like dude You don't get it bro like we ain't with you and in fact There's a whole bunch of people here that will cut your fucking head off if they had a chance Did you see all the videos of like when they leave in the hotels when you get in fucking like yelled at and shit? Canada too. Yeah people hate them and because they recognize what's happening and our countries being destroyed For no other reason than people won't speak up Yeah, and people won't stand up and they'll continue to not have uncomfortable conversations Like that's it Like how how is anybody okay with them being taxed the way that we're taxed with the prices the way that they are With America being in the condition that it's in that we're sending a dollar of aid to anyone To anyone this fucking how he'll dance and dude bro, I can't stand it And the people you guys who continue to support it your traders to this country. You just don't know it You're on the wrong side They tell you oh Russia will continue to invade and conquer and they'll eventually come here you guys are fucking idiots You're called you useful idiots in the communism playbook for a reason and if you're still supporting this shit And you still have a Ukrainian flag and you're still saying oh, you pro Ukraine all this shit You need to take a step back bro Because what you're doing is you're you're destroying eventually you will have been seen Just as the SS was seen in 1930s and 40s, Germany You will you are that these people who blindly go along with all these narratives They're they're point the fingers of people like me and you and say that we're those people no they're those people and they don't know it yet They're gonna find out. Yeah, that's real shit guys jump it on this conversation Let us know down in the comments what you guys think a hashtag the show must go on Uh, let us know what you guys think man I think it's funny how all these people like like they say well you're a nationalist no shit bitch I love this country, you know what I'm saying? This is a great place. This is an amazing country. It's our country And we're taking all of our resources and we're ruining everything It's always been great about this country and people say well, you're just a nationalist Yeah, yes Got me Well, that's the thing to like like the preservation of this country has never been left up to the government Right the present the preservation of this country the the pride the identity It's always been left up to the people like that was the original goal of this country was the people have the power And they've been able to manipulate us through technology through narratives through propaganda to make us think differently And that's that's not the case has never has been the case It never will be the case unless we fall into that trap of believing that you know, like listen I don't understand why people are tolerating it dude. Well, I mean again That's the dangerous part right like when they I think a lot of people people in the survival mode It makes it very very easy to control What it is their focus on yeah, I think that people are waiting I think if I'm feeling this outright I think people are just waiting for whatever the thing to happen is to happen Yeah, and I think whenever that thing happens These people are all going to be like literally exterminated Yeah, because the overwhelming response is going to be extremely Fucking violent and extremely fast and it's extremely dangerous what they're doing Yeah, this is why people have to realize that your fellow citizen is not the problem It's these people in this government who continue to do this crazy shit to all of us while they steal our money And send it over to places the end of funneling like funneling it back to them. That's what's happening What's happening is they're sending it to you how do you guys know what they're spending it on Ukraine? How do you when they said when they sent a company in Ukraine You know 10 million dollars how much of that do they actually get and how much of that comes back to these politicians Or companies that they're invested in or you know political contributions like people don't understand what's happening Your money is being stolen by the people that you elected to manage this country And they are using that money to oppress you and take more and more and more from you That's what's happening and people do not understand it because they're so busy trying to survive They can't follow the actual narrative of what's really happening. Yeah It's a vicious cycle that we need to get out of and it's going to take people taking a step back and questioning What is actually going on here and then having a voice and having courage to stand up and speak up against what is going on No matter what Along the way we were propagating to believing that silent majority was some sort of noble thing We were propagated to believe that political correctness was noble that self-censorship was the way that we should operate Because we don't want to offend anybody And they've conditioned our population to operate this way And in doing so It's prevented the truth and the actual people from standing up and saying hey, I don't agree with that That is not what I want that is not what I believe in and they don't do it because for 20 years We've been living this propaganda Cultural conditioning called political correctness and then followed up by the silent majority The time the time is over for silence The time is over for political correctness the time is now for facts and data and actual analysis and the truth That's what needs to be talked about and that's what needs to be said and that's going to be uncomfortable for people because for 15 years They haven't been able to talk about it Well, the time is now to talk about it and we don't talk about it now and we don't stand on it now And we don't speak the truth now we will never have the opportunity to do so ever again Guys before we get to our second headline We got to cruise the comments Let's get in a right. Yes, so this this comments coming from bin web 5992 he says Quote andy speech in Salt Lake City yesterday was powerful a f I heard he is a great speaker, but I will never be the same. I even got to see DJ looking sharp a f holding down the stage stairs That was cool. That was fun event. That was a great event. Yeah, had a great time man. The crowd was amazing Crowd was been I appreciate that dude Very very much the the entire The entire event was was awesome. Yeah, it was a good time dude. Yeah, the people the crowd wrote Look, we're talking about important shit. It's easy to give a real talk When the shit we're talking about matters, right? We're talking to you know, I don't even know what it was a 7000 Yeah, 7000 people or something about Uh, you know the importance of them winning okay That's an easy thing to talk about because it's very real We have an obligation in society to start painting the picture of what it looks like to live the American dream So that the people behind us can identify it and work to live it too And they have shamed us into this situation where they have made us believe that us pursuing the American dream is somehow some Immoral cause to pursue when in reality everything great that this country has ever produced has come from people who have been pursuing the American dream So when I can get in front of a mayor a bunch of entrepreneurs and go getters and people that want to be better I am going to point out very clearly that we have an obligation to set that standard for the rest of society And that's what I talked about and it's a very real thing It's very easy for me to talk about because if we don't do it And we don't set the standard and we don't go out and win and we don't go out and build great lives What do your kids and their friends have to look at as something to aspire to and this is why they have villainized every single American success story for the last 15 to 20 years as opposed to before that time frame Making it those people the heroes of our country. Okay, so there is nothing more noble For an entrepreneur to do or a success driven person to do then to become the most successful version of yourself And maximize that potential to a degree where it sends a message to every single person you know of inspiration Because they know if you did it they can do it And this is a huge deal in culture right now This is a big problem and it can be solved through entrepreneurs taking the obligation seriously The other thing that can be solved by entrepreneurs taking the obligation seriously is actually installing the culture that most people live In their daily lives All right, and we have a big problem with small business a lot of small businesses Try to emulate the fortune 100 companies who are controlled by these big banks who put down these qualifying social and economic standards Inside of them, you know these movements like d i or c i or e s g right and they put down these behavioral codes of conduct through their culture So that they can qualify for the money that they need to operate and because they put this culture down to their employees Their employees end up taking that culture home as if it's the right way to do that And because small businesses Emulate big businesses and think that this is just the way it is we have it Rippling through society and an unprecedented rate when nobody actually wants those things what actually people want as they want Good-hearted Americans who do the right thing to stand for the right thing and Tell the truth and be this normal functioning America that we've always had which is based upon common sense and that can only be solved if Small entrepreneurs who employ most of the people in this country stop copying these big companies and start emulating the American values that they believe that they should stand for and that takes courage Because when you run a company on the traditional American standards that we talk about meritocracy right the best people play in the game Data-driven results etc etc etc hard work these things are not accepted in society anymore For the sole purpose of demoralizing our country and taking away its identity So it is up to us And so when I do get on stage about these things I tend to drop mother fucking bombs Okay, because it's the truth and it's real shit and it is our obligation and it is up to us And if we don't do it nobody else can do it So that's why the entrepreneurs right now are the biggest Problem solvers and have the biggest weight to bear when it comes time to doing this and like I told these guys on Saturday if we take that obligation seriously and we take our our our live seriously and we take producing that ultimate version of ourselves Seriously and we go after that with every ounce of our effort We won't just make America great again We'll make America greater than it's ever been and this is what is needed at this point in time It can only come from entrepreneurs So I appreciate you Ben. I appreciate you guys that came the guys who put the event on Keaton and Dan Dan Fleischman Keaton Hoskins all the speakers it was awesome But let's not forget this isn't just about making some fucking money This is about correcting what's going on in the country by painting the picture of what is possible So that the people behind us can come behind us and say that's what it looks like Someone did it for you and at some point in time you've opted out of that pursuit And you are dropping the ball in your own obligation as an American citizen Go be that badass motherfucker that you always wanted to be That is the best thing that you can do for this country And ultimately that's what's going to save the country because it's going to show everybody else What it looks like to be a fucking awesome badass mother fucking American Man thanks to all of our real ass fans guys don't forget to like comment and subscribe and Keep not being holes. Yeah, yeah Yeah, all right, let's get back into it. We got headlight number two headlight number two reads dozens protest plan to turn former New York City College dorm into migrant shelter This is an interesting one and I got some crazy stuff on this one It's gonna be good. All right You're the guy you're Bridges like what was it kind of prelude I prelude on my all my stuff.

I feel like I'm your young man I'm trying to mentor you like you would be much funnier But would you would you also agree that if I like the jokes that I do tell With the prelude would be funny had I'm not Prelude to them. I don't know. I'm gonna have to pay more attention. You know, I'm saying does that make sense? Hey listen Here's what I think I think you I think you got a lot of raw talent I think you got a lot of work to do this American Idol brother. Yes, I think you got a lot of raw talent I think with a couple years of good hard practice. I mean only right right on this right? Yeah Yeah The best thing you got going for you is your fucking laugh right there, bro They're not like they're not agrees I'm back next year. Yeah, well, hey look, you know, if I didn't believe in you, I would have you sitting here man I appreciate you got the golden ticket. Hey listen always be learning. You know, that's right. That's real I mean if you got to get you know, 20 trophies taken away. It's what it takes Got can't be afraid throw some shit out there. Hey man, listen You fall down seven times Fall down eight Yeah, so let's get into this the dozen got protests going on in New York City protesters rallied Sunday outside a former college dorm in the Bronx Up in arms over city halls plan to convert it into the big apples latest emergency shelter for silent seekers As many as 75 angry demonstrators um armed with signs that read affordable housing. Yes, migrants know And other signs that said quote no land grab save our children stood in the pouring rain to slam plans for the one-time men hadn't College housing site quote over our dead bodies shot at guardian angels founder Curtis Slaywa a frequent critic of the city's handling of the unprecedented migrant crisis now across the street stood about 50 counter protesters The recently renovated seven story 83 unit farmer college dorm on west two thirty eighth street Has become the latest tipping point for residents and the five burrows pushing back against the migrant shelters Now the building was purchased by the stag group for 18 million dollars earlier this year And was to be a homeless shelter Last week a senior official at the company announced that it had been in talks with the city department of homeless services Quote as it relates to migrant housing and families now here's the interesting thing um Well first here's a picture of what the protesters look like and by the way, I'll say there's 70s not enough Okay, all you guys that are up there complaining you guys all feel the same. There's no way there should only be 70 people out there protesting this All right, yeah, and here's another thing when you say over your dead bodies That's what they're counting on mm-hmm Absolutely Um, but here's the thing the counter protesters right counter protesters have made their presence known Uh at each of the rallies gathering and smaller but equally boystress numbers to support the migrants quote as a Jew We know what it is to be scapegoated and migrants are being scapegoated Said Naomi Charlene a member of Jews for radical economic justice outside the x-brox dorm on Sunday Quote a leader who is failing and struggling to size scapegoat instead of acknowledging that it's a challenge and building coalitions and that was their group with signs that read welcome migrants and Signs that said migrants welcome here. Okay. Well then take them into your house. Yeah, do it Shade them your homes. Yeah, okay, if this is if this is a You know, you think this is the same things as Jews being persecuted wherever they've been persecuted, which is many places Okay, if you think that's what that is then you should take these people to your homes and allow them to live with you and you care for them And then maybe you could set the example for what it looks like for everybody to do what it is that you're asking them to do Go first Shabbat Shalom. I don't think that that's I don't think that's un uh I don't think that's an unrealistic request Okay, oh yeah, but here's the thing when you at we if you go ask these people like hey, you feel like migrants would be here Oh, yeah, of course. All right. Well, you can take one in your house. Well, oh, hold on. I'm I'm pushing. I'm not hold on Why are people persecuting these migrants? Why is because hold on why Let's not just say oh, they're being persecuted. Let's ask why Okay, and let's ask why people are being persecuted whenever they are persecuted at any point in history ever Let's ask why calls them effect. Let's ask why Why are these people being persecuted? Well, here's why because people don't want them here They are coming here and they're taking our resources and they are taking homes and they are taking tax dollars That should go to citizens of this country not people who just decided to come here Okay, that's that's a realistic That is not racist that is not bigoted. That is we take care of Americans This is America we take care of them first and then after we have our own shit sorted out Then maybe we could talk about solving some other people's problems But we have gotten to a point in this country where we look to solve everybody else's problems But our own and that's a that's what's a you know going on and that's intentional by the way This is what they want the moralization right and because these migrants are they They're robbing people they're hurting the killing people raping women. I mean Well, it's not like they're they're just coming here, you know and family drove us. That's not what this is Go ask France what they should have done Go ask Italy go ask go ask Ireland what they should have done actually UK you can't undo it once it's done And these people understand this and so This is why I keep saying over and over dude what to sort this problem out. It's going to take some hardened people Some hardened citizens to understand what it's going to take because bro. It's gonna be emotional It's we're going to have to go round these people up and we're going to have to drop them back where they came from I'm and by the way and previous times in history you know what they did they rounded them up and they put them in camps Okay, or they killed them. I'm not saying that. I'm not saying anything like that. That's wrong. That would be make you a bad human but For America's best interest It's going to be required that these people who are illegal who have come here from other places Be rounded up and take them back to where they come and then if they want to come through the proper channels Like my man right here did and yeah, right Okay, and actually learn the culture of America learn what this is about Become a contributing member of society then maybe you can come back Okay, but this is this is wrong and and it's wrong to compare this to other you know persecuted races of people And if we're going to talk about the persecution of different situations I think it's a reasonable Discussion to ask why that persecution has happened or why it's happening So prevent it from happening again correct important right, but that's not how the that's not how our our society works We just say oh, they're persecuted and then there's no justifiable reason what so ever to persecute That's not right. That's not true. Just existed. That's not true. This is what we see with the pedophiles right now Okay, we see persecution towards pedophiles and people are like you guys are They're minor retracted people but no, we're not buying that bro That's never going to be that's never going to be bought by us And so when you wonder why people say things like pedophiles belong in the wood shipper um We should be able to validate that there's a very good reason why they belong in the wood shipper Why do you mean here's the crazy thing too on the story so the new report came out Um about you you mentioned the tax dollars going to these migrants right and I think we did to read it some rough numbers Just in Chicago alone in the last six months has been about $20,000 per migrant that they've been spending of taxpayer dollars and Emergency spending on these migrants But that's that's not even the tip of this iceberg Um, this headline reads migrant search sparks spending spree a Chicago in New York City dish out eye watering contracts Now we talk about this all the time okay, and most people this this flies over most people's head as far as how this actually works Okay, I'm the mayor of of Chicago Okay, we have a problem. I got migrants coming in. Okay, cool. And we have all these tax dollars to our disposal, right um We need we we got to have clean sheets for these migrants right so the like there's a company that and he owns that you know You do the laundry service, right? I'm gonna give you the government contract, but because we're boys you're gonna kick me back a little bit more That's right, and I'm gonna you're gonna bid is you're gonna send me a hundred K. I'm gonna send you back 50 Yeah, 100% or in this case hundreds of millions of dollars, but I'm simplifying it. Yeah, right like so so it cost me Let's say 10 10 kit. This is how this works It cost me like 10 grand to do the job. Mm-hmm. All right, and normally I'd ask 20 right okay? Let's just say Just straight up But I'm gonna ask I'm gonna give you You're gonna give me the contract for a hundred. I'm gonna give you 50 and instead of me making 10 I'm gonna make 40 and that's how this shit works and this is why we're taxed at a rate of 50 plus percent when we add them all together So handle all of this unnecessary Correct It is um Yeah, so Chicago has paid at least 56 million dollars to favorite health care staffing to care for the more than 13,000 migrants who have arrived this year according to an NBC five investigation that found that nurses We're making a hundred and thirty five dollars an hour or more a manager was paid fourteen thousand dollars For just one week of work and a nurse earned an eyewatering twenty thousand dollars a week And December both invoices included overtime That's the other part of this what we're talking about bro. This trickles down. Yeah, okay? So this everybody gets their peace along the way So something that should cost you know like where they said 56 million Where it should really cost two ends up being 56. Yep, and guess what then that comes from us 100 percent But guess what these nurses are gonna be the same ones that turn right back around and advocate from one migrants Why cuz they're making one money you're making twenty grand a week. Yeah, bring them in Yeah You know, I'm saying people Leave a la vida. What are they saying? Yeah, but they're not thinking they're not thinking that those kids Their kids are gonna grow up in a country that is actually run by those people Once they get them healthy. Yeah, it's a crazy thing man And and and so it continues to see invoices like that are disgusting They are outrageous and they are cause for an immediate investigation Raymond Lopez told NBC Meanwhile, New York is currently paying three times more for contracted laundry services at some migrant shelter Then it does at homeless shelters according to a report by gothimist Isn't it great. Yeah, wow dude. How how can people be be okay with this they're not People look at this shit and they act like this. No, that's not really what's happening. It's not actually what's happening Exactly what's happening. Yeah, it's exactly what's happening and here and here's the kicker for this topic Final final little little supporting peace on this conversation This comes out under pressure from New York City the by-demand Gives more than a swale of migrants temporary protected status the decision gives more than 200,000 migrants the right To obtain work authorization and live in the United States without fear of deportation So all those job creations that they talk about yeah, that that's a big portion of them Yeah, and the other portion is when they're talking about the job creation They're talking about it coming from the shutdown that they created and the big in the first place Yes, so they're counting these people getting their jobs back Which is still less than the total amount of jobs that existed before As growth in the economy. They're not wow. No, it's not. It's exactly what they did with COVID It's the same way they lied about all the data with COVID to twist it and make it look When this fucking guy gets up here and says by nomics and you are like look at your own shit And you're like the fuck's he talking about like realize they're lying to your face and they don't care They do not care Like these people know exactly what they're doing. They're doing it intentionally. It is not in competency and You guys continue to not understand you just do not get it They're stealing your shit. They are going to steal your entire country They're gonna ruin your culture. They're gonna ruin the opportunity for your kids to grow up in a civilized society They're gonna they're gonna take everything that is your fucking birthright as a citizen of this country and ruin it On your dollar because you won't speak up 70 people show up to this bro. That should have been 7,000 people should have been 70,000. Yeah The amount of fuck it is shit would stop in a day. Oh If everybody who believed in this shit started showing the fuck up and actually speaking up like we've been saying for years on the show The shit would change and it would change fast That's real man guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you think A hashtag order at the border dude all these people gotta go back I all these people gotta go back You know how hard that is gonna be on some people to watch you think of the optics no bro because it necessary is going to It's going to look like Just like what we see in the movies and shit there's gonna be checkpoints There's gonna be people asking for their fucking papers like it's gonna be very hard thing To stomach for a lot of people, but it's necessary. It's a necessary thing that has to happen for us to actually maintain the United States of America for Americans. Yeah To a shit man Guys, let's get on to our third and final headline headline number three our third and final headline reads New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez and wife and died it on federal bribery charges Shocking This is kind of culminated what we've been talking about how these dirty politicians work. So let's dive into this Because I think this is like the I think this is like the uh the prelude So what they're gonna do abiding So let's see how we can connect those dots and if you agree on this So this is a NBC article a CBS news article reading democratic senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and his wife have been indicted by a federal grand jury according to court filings Unsealed Friday with prosecutors alleging the couple accepted lavish bribes and exchange For official x the bribery offenses against Menendez stem from a years long public corruption investigation by the justice department The indictment until Friday charges Menendez and his wife Nadine Menendez with three counts in connection to their relationship with three New Jersey businessmen Menendez who 69 and his wife face one count of conspiracy to commit bribery Conspiracy to commit honest services fraud and conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right The three New Jersey associates identified as whale Hana Jose Uribe and Fred Davies are also named as co-definanced and face two counts Menendez and his co-definanced are expected to appear in federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday morning um And of course he's saying he'll be exonerated He says everything's fine in the statement Friday Menendez denied the allegations and condemned Quote how quickly some are rushing to judge a Latino and push him out of his oh yeah, oh yeah It has to do with your fucking latinoism. It's tacos, baby. Whatever He says you continue saying quote. I am not going anywhere He said vowing to quote continue to fight for the people of New Jersey with the same success I've had for the past five decades. I think that's a problem right there Yeah, like why have you had success for five decades when you're a position of service? Yeah Maybe it's because of all the shit you're doing in there bro. Yeah, you know and like like hey Bob What about the hundred thousand dollars and gold bars brosalist and they rated this dude's house And they found like he's living like El Chapo He's like he's like He's El Bob Chapo you know, I'm saying we're he ain't living like El Chapo. He's like a hundred grand It's all well, but that was just some of it. He's living like Cheapo yeah That's right. Yeah, Cheapo. Yeah, I got changed the hashtag Oh, this is fucking great Cheapo ain't no fucking El Chapo bro Oh, no fucking things he is though. Yeah, I don't know El Chapo. Oh Bob Chapo That's great. Uh, yeah, so let's dive into this so so The New Jersey lawmaker called the claims against him salacious and insisted he will be exonerated because prosecutors Sometimes get it wrong He didn't mention the more than 100,000 dollars worth of gold bars or the Mercedes Prosecutors say he received for doing favors for a new Jersey developer As he confirmed he will not resign so In a June 2022 raid on the maninda's home investigators found 400,000 dollars in cash Stuffed in envelopes and in the pockets of jackets with maninda's name on them They also found gold bars worth a hundred and ten thousand dollars Um, and end as defended the money saying he often kept cash on hand because it's a lesson he learned from his parents Who escaped Fidel Castro's Cuba to live in the United States? He didn't mention the gold bars found in his new Jersey home Um, now this is where it gets kind of kind of crazy, right? So we talk about the the charges that they brought up on the guy Um, but the indictment also charges the senator with providing sensitive United States government information And took other steps that secretly aided the government of Egypt Okay, I'm an end as defended his record on Egypt. He says quote throughout my time in congress I have remained steadfast on the side of civil society and human rights defenders in Egypt and everywhere else in the world If you look at my actions related to Egypt during the period described in this indictment And throughout my whole career my record is clear and consistent And holding Egypt accountable for the unjust attention of Americans And others Uh, and the human rights abuses he says now You know all these indictments. I mean, what about the human rights abuses happening in America for Americans Yeah, yeah, I'd agree um, and these are some of the pictures that the FBI released As this jacket um, that's just some of the money his wife got a brand new Mercedes Ben She's also got a Uh, low show or no show is what the prosecutor described job Uh, for one of those three co-defendants I'm getting paid ridiculous amounts of money. Well, clearly there's corruption happening. Yeah, no doubt no doubt I mean look they're trying to make it like They're trying to make it like look out. Okay, I gotta be honest. Okay, this guy's crooked as fuck. Yeah, here's what's happening He's not doing something they want him to do. That's what's happening. Mm-hmm All of these people do this all of these people are like this all every single elected official up there does this bullshit All of them. They're all like this and the reason this guy is getting Pinched is because he didn't do something or there's some sort of other interest at play here that no one's talking about her scene um We'll go back to like the photograph they posed right like doesn't this not that one the one of his jacket doesn't that seemed very Similar to the photographs that they did whenever they raided Marlago. Mm-hmm. You see what I'm saying like we have a corrupt justice system on top of it Like is this guy guilty of shit? I'm sure 100% real. She is. Yes, yes, but why did it come out? Yes That's what I'm saying. This guy is being targeted. It's not because he's Latino That's his political public defense right It's because he's not playing ball with them in some way that that he's expected to play ball and now they've turned it against them and You know, it's like when you're in you're in When you're out you're fucking out. Yeah, or when they're done with you. You're done You know like that. That's what these guys failed to understand These politicians that are up there You know, they continue to play ball and they do the insider trades and they do all these things Not realizing that eventually your time's going to come and you're going to end up in prison for it You know, and they don't do it like how it should be done where we have a mass collection of all the corruption and a trial and a public fucking accountability measure They do it one at a time Right they they selectively pick these people off as they go when they don't play ball with them like this this this is When you look at the government and you think that these are like people That are elected and they're in there doing the work for us You're you're you're misunderstanding it completely and that misjudgment and that misunderstanding is what's costing us our country these people Most of them were not successful before they went in there wouldn't be successful cannot be successful in the real world and the reason they want to be Politicians is so that they can get in on the game Anybody who's out here saying I want to be a politician look out for those people bro Because there's nothing cool about being a politician like if you're a successful human being No, this is why you guys fucked up a lot with Trump now. I agree Trump says some real dumb shit But the truth of the matter is you had a dude Who had the the biggest most baller life ever and gave it up to go fight for you And half of you guys started believing he was what they said he was when in reality the only reason they said That he was those things is because he was actually fighting for you He wasn't in right and that's why like dude, you know You can have all these judgments about Trump. He's not a perfect candidate like he's not You know like there's a lot of things about Trump. I don't I don't necessarily like But what I do like is that he's not part of their shit And you know what else I like? I like that he has motivation To like literally hold these people at the highest level of accountability. I like those things But What does that turn into after that right because what we really need is we need a solo type leader from Rome Who was the first dictator of Rome right the last dictator of Rome however you want to say it? Okay, this dude came from the people served in the military Fucking killed all the corrupt people became leader the people loved him They said you're your lifetime dictator of Rome and he said no I just wanted to clean this shit up and now I'm going to fuck home and that's what we need Yeah, we don't need another person to come in here and say oh, I'm gonna I want to be the president because I want to be president We need a fucking warrior that cares about this country to be elected president And to handle business and then leave us alone That's what we need Yeah, that's real and and and won't run on the fact that I need eight years. Don't take eight years It did it would take it would take fucking it would take one year You know that's real I also thought it was interesting last little point on this but Bob Menendez hires hunter-biden's lawyer to defend gold bar bribery charges As Democrats demand he resigns and so yeah, I mean everybody's been jumping on the ship to you know kick him off the ship Both left and right which further supports that fact like they're all in on it Yeah, it's just when you're out. Well, this guy could be threatening to blow the whistle on these guys Which doesn't be his best defense he should do that He should do that like bro that like that would absolve you of everything. Yeah, most of well Well, at least in public opinion and public opinion people would be like well Yeah, you know, it might it might not be straight to the woodshipper But you know you I mean yeah, there'll be some detours. Yeah Look man The corruption is the corruption is so deep and thick it's gonna take a massive action of Of accountability to solve it because that's the only way we're gonna be able to ensure it doesn't happen again At least for the next hundred yes, we hundred that's what needs to happen You know and like dude, I don't think there's very many people that are willing to do What needs to be done with restraint right because when you when you execute that kind of play all right No pun intended all right what ends up happening is these people get power hungry And then they start to like go after these other things right like it should be left alone like fix this country Get rid of the corruption get rid of the evil shit and when I evil shit, I mean pedophilia Okay Get it to fuck out of here get these migrates out of here fix our economy Fix our crime fix the judicial system go to fuck home That's what needs to happen.
