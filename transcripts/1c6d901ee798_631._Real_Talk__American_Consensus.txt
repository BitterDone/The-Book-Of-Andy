What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the real estate about the lies and thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome to motherfuckin reality guys today we have a special episode I don't even know what to call this we call this real talks this is a real talk real talks because you're here yeah okay so real talks with Andy and DJ that doesn't sound right man what do you think we're not now we'll just call it real talk okay this is a special real talk okay because this one might last longer than 20 minutes and DJ's gonna be on the show but you know we always talk about what's going on in the world and we always talk about what's wrong with the world but today I wanted to talk about a couple things that I think we could all agree on in terms of how things should be 90% of this country understands that things are messed up all right there's only 10% of people and by the way they're not all on the progressive left there are some people on the far right and I would say that 8% of them are on the far left and 2% of them are on the far right that are fucking insane okay but if we talk about the rest of us the 90% I think we all want the same things we all know what we want we all know what we would like we all know that we're not getting it but we can't ever have those conversations because we're told that we shouldn't get along or that we can't talk about things or you know because this person is a Democrat or this person is a Republican or this person is from the inner city or this person is from the country or this person is black or white or straight or gay that we inherently will not agree and I don't believe that to be true you know I get called a lot of things because of the content that we talk about a lot of times I get lumped in with the far right I am not right I am common sense and I believe most of you are as well and I think that if we took a minute maybe a few minutes to talk about some of the issues from a common sense standpoint by what this country should look like maybe we could find some common ground you know I talked about the situation that's going on with child abusers and child traffickers and child molesters and I talked about it in my story and I said can't we all agree can we not all agree no matter who you are no matter what political affiliation no matter where you come from no matter the pigment of your skin no matter who you like to have sex with any of these things okay can we not agree that no matter what children are off limits you don't fuck with kids and if you fuck with kids these people deserve harsh public example making punishment that sets a standard as a deterrent for a civilized human culture and I made that story and the response was 100% positive okay so if we can get 90% of people to agree on that issue don't you think it's possible that we all want some of the same things so I figured what we do today is we would just go down some of the issues and talk about how we here believe they should look in real life what do you think yeah 100% top 10 I mean they're not in no particular order I do think it's important to because I'm sure you guys watching this listening you'll notice that there's a couple of issues that are not on this list right and you have addressed those as things we we call them below the line issues yes such as abortion yeah okay a lot of people like to make their whole entire identity around abortion and they like to argue about abortion but what they fail to realize is that abortion may be a situation that comes up in someone's life one or two times in their entire life maybe okay and we're willing to make political decisions that affect the entire rest of our lives the rest of our existence around this one issue that is below the line it is below the line and it's below the line for everybody based upon the frequency of which this issue comes to the forefront of our existence and there's other issues that are below the line there's other things that don't necessarily matter every single fucking day I'm not saying it's not an important issue every single day for our society and what these elite quote unquote representatives of our people trick us into believing is that these are the most important issues which allows them to destroy all the other things that we would need to have a civil happy productive day to day life yeah and that's not that was important it's very important because a lot of you guys will say I believe in this okay so because you have a stance on abortion you're okay with them taxing you at 70% right you're okay with the crime going crazy you're okay with things costing 10 times more you're okay with the government taxing us into oblivion and stealing the money you're okay with all of these other things that affect us every single day you're gonna vote yeah abortion though yeah that makes no sense no it doesn't make sense for anyone and so no one's saying it's not an important issue but we have to learn to delineate between above the line issues that affect us every single day and below the line issues which are still important but not necessarily important enough to change our daily existence and environment and I think that most people because of the state of our country right now have realized that that's probably a good idea we should probably look at other things like crime and the economy and what's going on in the world then getting all stirred up about things that you know we only deal with a few times in our life we can we can we can argue over those things but let's get the main thing straight yeah for sure I think that's that's a good way to look at it for sure I want to ask you to right so I for people listening to Andy would are they supposed to agree with everything on this list no all this like what's your goals for people listening to this my goals for people listening to this is really a couple different things one I want people to understand where I stand because there's a lot of you know there's a lot of clips that get shared of the show that are taken out of context and dude I'm a fiery guy so I sound you know sometimes a little and and so people associate that with radical and I am radical but I'm radical common sense and so part of it is I want people to understand how I think things would be if I were running the show what I would do and how I would run them you don't have to agree you know that's why we have a vote and shit I'm not running for office but I think some clarity would be good for people and I also think that it would be good for people to hear some ideas from someone who isn't Donald Trump or who isn't Vivek or who isn't Nikki Haley or who isn't fucking Joe Biden yeah because all these people seem to be doing the sit now I will say this about I like Vivek a lot I think Vivek stands out amongst those guys as a real guy but the point is we need new ideas we need new thoughts new strategies and I think if we started talking about things actual particular issues along the lines of common sense I think we could find some places of unity because the reality is guys is that if their whole plan is divide us and then take everything from us which they've been doing for fucking 50 years man how do we stop that we stop that by coming together on common sense issues and getting to a place where we come together and then we dictate what actually happens in politics if you ask most people like who their favorite politician is they'll give you a name but if you say do you agree with their policy they'll say well not really but I feel like it's the best that aligns with me I feel like I feel like and sometimes they don't even know sometimes they just know a name you know so I think it's important to talk about how things should be not just always talk about how things are fucked up and that's what I kind of want to solve today you know for our audience like you guys you guys all buy into us you guys support us you share the things I think we should get some clarity about what we actually stand for like what this logo stands for when you wear the gear which by the way we have a drop and the new draft that you all have been asking about on the real American freedom gear happens this Wednesday the 17th of January we have all new pieces they are not the same pieces that were on the last drop what is that seven o'clock at night seven PM central standard seven PM central standard we will have that release so you know there's that to you yeah so you should know what that stands for when you wear it they don't just go by this you like know what it means and then this is what about to get into again in no particular order with exception of this first one because this this is important the first the first point of the American consensus is personal excellence yeah let's talk about it well look we have a duty to be the best that we can be millions of Americans have died and sacrificed for us to have the opportunity to live this life there was a time in this country when everybody understood that there was an obligation of the citizen to be and exercise their freedoms and to be the best that they can possibly be and we have abandoned that and traded it for this idea that freedom means that we can just do whatever we want and we can just live a lazy life and we can be less than and we can we can over consume and we can be all these things and what we don't what we fail to understand is that when we buy into that idea of freedom we are actually trading it for real freedom because what happens is we fall right into what their play has always been their play is to make you fat to make you sick to make you uneducated to keep you poor and the reason they do these things is because for twofold one when you eat the food you're consuming the food then you you get sick because you're fat so you consume their medicine while you're fat and sick you consume all their data you consume all their information you become a mega consumer of streaming okay you become the ultimate consumer when you opt out of living a truly excellent existence on your own all right so you have to understand that for us to exercise freedom we have to live it in our day to day life and if we don't exercise freedom in excellence then that freedom ceases to exist okay and we want we look around and we wonder why culture is so fucked up why is everybody so zombie like why is everybody so sick why is everybody so overweight why is everybody so broke why is everybody so dumb and then we look at ourselves and we don't ever stop to think well maybe it's because we're setting a bad example because the reality is there was a time in America where all men especially men took this responsibility seriously there was a sense of pride of being a strong American man and a good example in your community which meant your household saw that your neighbor saw that your community saw that your peers at work saw that and that made other people want that too and when other people observe winning an excellence it inspires them to be better and a rising tide of good culture raises all ships it raises the standard for the American people so the first thing that we have to understand is that we have to become the best versions of ourselves so that people can understand what that looks like and also we aren't at the whim of their matrix that they have created we have unplugged ourselves we are now healthy we are now fit we are now eating good food we are putting good information in our brains we are treating people right we are becoming successful we are building a nice financial portfolio we are have a nice income we are setting the standard for American culture and palace ticks is downstream of culture so if we want to fix what's going on in politics we have to fix culture first and that's why I say all the time personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion because it unplugs you from being a dependent on them which maintains their power structure over all of us so if you're not living an excellent life which is ultimately what this logo stands for you are failing your obligation as an American that is my belief love it man point number two of contention crime crimes up all across the country major cities you got homicide rates are up out of the roof on robberies invasion I mean anywhere you look it's up where what is the common sense plan on crime the common sense plan on crime has to do with one being able to talk about crime in an honest way part of the reason that we have so much crime is we're unable to talk about crime in an honest way we're not able to talk about who's committing the crime where are the crimes being committed and what kind of crime is committed because if we talk about those things statistically we are called racist okay so first of all we have to get away from that and we have to understand that the reason that the crime is elevated in those areas of our American population I'm not even going to say black American because these are Americans the reason is because those areas have been abandoned by the culture that we talked about in the first step okay they have been lied to and convinced that a certain group of people have their best interests in mind which they do not for the last 50 years under the guise of racism it's the white guys fought it's not the white guys fought the black people are killing each other at a fucking unprecedented rate unless you consider the white guy being the guy that you voted for who said he was going to bring all this shit to your neighborhood that never did and by the way he did that for 50 years and it wasn't Republicans all right so let's let's define that so we have to be able to talk about the crime first of all second of all we need to take some of the tax dollars that we send over to these foreign aid countries all over the world foreign aid which is secret talk for stealing all right embezzlement yes they send the money there the money comes back to them they get rich and we get nothing as American citizens so we have to stop that bleeding and start reinvesting our tax allocation into our first responder network meaning we should take police from a guy who can make 60 70 a hundred grand and they should be making 200 300 thousand dollars that way we can actually provide them a reasonable income so they can survive and provide for their family we make policing an honorable profession we attract better police officers and then we allow them to do our job do their jobs okay it's very simple as far as punishment for crimes we got to stop putting people away for fucking 20 years for marijuana that's ridiculous okay our mushrooms shit that grows from the ground now if they're trafficking fentanyl death okay if they're a violent criminal rape murder death okay these people don't deserve to live in our society at all and now we live in a situation where violent offenders can be clearly identified through forensic evidence there's not the gun or the days of people saying well that guy was falsely acute that never that rarely happens anymore okay almost impossible yeah and we have cameras everywhere bro there's cameras in every fucking TV set and every computer and every cell phone everywhere okay so the idea that we can mistaken identity the rate of that is shrunk very much and the reality is is if we don't have hard accountability for violent crime violence rape and by the way for those of you don't know I'm a victim of violent crime that's how I got the scars on my face all right stories in my book if you want to read it violent crime has to be punished violently because people then will understand that if I do this thing this thing will happen to me and this is not me being overly harsh this is not dictate dictator behavior this is human nature there was a reason that Vlad the impaler put people on sticks in his front yard for forever you know what it said don't fuck with me okay and if violent criminals who think they can go around raping and killing and fucking people up if they don't understand that like dude if you get caught doing that we're going to pull your fucking dick off on national TV and we're going to cut you wide open we're going to gut you like Braveheart and for all your friends and family for pay-per-view and then we're going to take the money we're going to give it to the family of the victim okay that's how shit stops that will stop that immediately okay so we need harsh punishment we need reallocation of tax dollars we need violent crimes dealt with in a different capacity than all other crimes and and also I believe that we need legal we need to fix the legal system so that if somebody makes false accusations about someone and it comes out that they made false accusations that person then serves the sentence of the accusation that they made on the person who was innocent yeah I think that will clean up a lot of the bullshit yeah and get the sorrows prosecutors out bro that's a big that's that's a that's a no that's a no-brainer yeah yeah that's that's that's that's a whole different discussion but yes this is all assuming that those people are removed and we have a just legal system yeah point number three this is a big one man we talk about all the time tax the tax code the tax system right now it just stands we're we're financial slaves yeah how do we fix it what's the common well first of all we have to acknowledge that we are slaves yeah okay American people hate that the hate when you say that the hate when you say that we are slaves here in America because they have been told their whole lives that we are the freest country in the world we are not the freest country in the world we're actually the only country in the world that is asked to go to work then pay most of our money back to the government when you add it all up some of you might be saying oh I only pay 30 percent no you don't add up all the other tax you pay what's that add up to that's the actual percentage of your tax and then for almost all of us that's over 50 percent if you pay tax those we have to acknowledge that if we live to work to provide most of our money back to the government and then upon our death everything that we've acquired with the amount that we were able to keep then gets taxed 60 to 65 percent depending on how you structure we have to acknowledge that we are legitimately slaves to the government we exist to fund the government that is it okay that is not free okay we have to take this country back and make it free and what we have to do is we have to unburden the American citizen from this financial tax structure that has enslaved our culture and our people and made it so that normal people with a normal job have a hard time even existing or surviving or getting a house there's only so much work harder you could tell people people work very hard in this country work ethic actually isn't the problem the problem is is that the tax system is so oppressive that average people with an average job can barely survive that is not free that is not prosperous that's not the pursuit of wealth and happiness that's not anything that we're promised okay so we have to quit this ship of funding the largest organization that's ever existed in human history which is the United States government at this time we have to shrink the government we have to get our tax rate down to 10 percent where all of our tax equals 10 percent and then we have to use that 10 percent tax wisely to fund the things that the government should be responsible for such as our first responder network teaching and that's debatable by the way so the same thing I said about about police officers should apply to teachers we need better quality teachers and tax dollars should be spent more liberally in those areas so with with higher with higher expectations of what we would get as a teacher but ultimately we have to stop sending all this money we have to stop allowing our politicians to take campaign donations from money that they sent over in foreign aid we have to stop the bleeding of America through taxing we're the only country in the world that sends all this foreign aid to all all these other countries which why the fuck are we doing that we'd stop that and if we stopped all this shit and we started spending it on police, military and education and basic infrastructure we would be able to pay 10 percent tax and our country would look like fucking Dubai bro it'd be clean it'd be clean it'd be safe it would be prosperous the people here wouldn't have problems like poverty see they want the poverty that they have right now because power and perverse people are easier to control all right so we have to take this we have to cut a bunch out we have to reallocate the money to the effective places that the government should be and the rest of the shit is what it is so that's why I take on taxes bro major tax reform down to 10 percent how much would how much better would your life look if all you pay was 10 percent tax yeah do you know what businesses would look like bro business or tax at the business level and the personal level the business owners like you don't understand people say oh well if they taxed them that they'd just get greedy and take the money no if they were actually greedy they grow their business and employ a whole bunch of motherfuckers and make them make a lot of money so they keep growing you know we it would create empires of wealth for not just the owners of the business but the people who contribute in building the business and that's hard to do now because of the tax structure as well so there's a lot of change that has to happen with taxes point number four we have an invasion in this country it's immigration what's the common sense standard for immigration what it always has been where we have people to come here they go through a process they immigrate legally and then they assimilate as an American citizen under American culture guidelines not bringing their culture here by the millions coming through a porous border and then us funding them giving them a cell phone giving them money and letting them come in and take seats in our schools and send our kids home to learn on the internet okay so all we have to do is enforce the laws around immigrant immigration we should have border walls we should have a border wall on Canada and fucking Mexico okay and it should be impenetrable and there should be fucking gunman on the top of it that anybody that tries to get in gets fucking shot there should not be a single border crossing in the United States that is even known of of any sort ever should never happen and it's very easy for us to do that and then what we do is we make them go through the process we make them learn the customs learn the rules learn all the history the things that these two guys have had to learn to become American citizens we make them pass the test and then they get to come in that's what it's always been it's not hard we don't need major reform there we just need to enforce the the reality of what what it is that we've always had yeah and by the way all the people who have come here over the last few years they all have to be rounded up a stand back reality people aren't gonna like that we are a pit of swallow yeah well I'm it's what's what's gonna have to happen dude it's gonna have to happen and we're gonna have a third world country people keep talking about what's gonna happen in the world what's gonna happen oh they're gonna turn to power you're right they're gonna turn to power off they're gonna turn to fucking power off bro and you know who's gonna fucking thrive when there's no power no water no shit all these third world mother fuckers that came across the board of the last three years they're not gonna have a problem because where they came from it was already like that and so all of you soft men out there with your fucking non-calist hands and you're fucking you know man bun and shit you're gonna get your ass beat by these people whenever the fucking shit goes down just know that these people are already hard and you're soft that's why that's why they got to go student and later point number five now it's a big topic the LGBTQIA what's the tolerance and limitations on this what's the common sense I don't I don't I think most Americans don't care they don't care if you're gay they don't care if you're a lesbian they don't care we've gotten past that as a culture many years years ago even most conservatives are not now we're seeing the rise of the ultra conservative again right who's saying this is wrong we're not allowing this right yeah but most common sense Americans don't care who you want to live your life with and who you want to love and who you want to be with they don't care all right so the reality of this situation is they only care when you start fucking forcing it down everybody's throat you guys got a holiday in a month every other fucking month okay you force every three problems you force everybody to fucking submit to it or their bigots okay you've pushed on people way too hard and now people are saying fuck you and so gay people just need to go back to being regular citizens let's stop with the activism activism should have stopped when y'all were allowed to get married and got all the same rights as everybody else equality does not equate to privilege all right and right now the rainbow community has privilege in this country and they have such privilege that we have allowed drag queens grown adult men to go shake their penis in front of the little children and it's called inclusion okay no that's where the line draw the line is drawn when you start shoving your pronouns and shit and kids faces when you start transitioning kids at school and not telling their parents when you start telling kids about your sex life in any way shape or form any teacher in this country who talks about their sexuality with students should be fired immediately okay the the line is with the kids that's what a line is and then the other line is with the privilege we're not going to be called bigots because we didn't show up at your fucking parade where everybody's walking around naked all right most gay people don't even like this shit I have a bunch of gay friends and you know they all listen to the show bro and you know because we went to one of them's restaurant and he fucking gave me the biggest hug he goes bro thank you so much for not lumping us in with these people we are not part of that and pedophilia perverts and these disgusting it's never women dressed up as men that are doing it it's always men dressing up as women doing this shit and they have pedophiles that infiltrated the LGBTQ movement and we have a responsibility to protect our actual normal gay and lesbian American friends and realize that those people are not part of that there should be clear delineation between those two and that's going to take the gay community calling that out as well which gays against groomers and communities like that are doing so and that's nice but we need more of that um because when we go back to crime pedophiles get instant death instant death public I am I am for liberal use of woodchippers and public execution to reset the standard and the code of conduct and society yeah and pedophiles should be first on that list and pedophile should know that if they get caught doing pedophile shit that within fucking seven days you're literally going into a woodchipper on live TV in front of the world yeah that would stop people from doing that shit for the time of society's operated for thousands of years correct it's human nature that's why I've lied to him paler put those people in the front yard that's why people were publicly executed and we've gotten so soft as a society that we don't do that anymore because it's it's not fair to the criminal motherfucker they didn't think about that when they were committing all the crimes yeah what's first when they were disrupting society we're off civil human beings trying to be normal and live our lives and be productive and be friendly and walk down the street and we can't because of these people so we have to remove them from society or convince them that they should behave and the only way to convince them that they should behave is public executions real shit it's been happening for thousands of years and because we don't do it anymore now we have this problem yeah yeah so my take on a long ago right what no longer go either no it's but no but it's been long as you how quick shit can fucking it's been long enough for people to forget yeah that's the problem yeah so on my take is you know uh these people are Americans unless they're selling books for kids the sucked-ics praying on kids teaching kids fucked up shit stealing their childhood look at all these weirdos in the education system bro who talked to three-year-olds about who they're I'm like dude this dude shows up and high heels and I'm mixed I'm mixed Smith like this is a fucking kid man like these people are stealing childhood innocence the ability to discover and exchange for grooming them under the guise of experiencing other relationships no how about you let them discover it on their own like they discover everything else so the line is with the fucking kids and that goes for the indoctrination the grooming the the drag queen story hour all the fucking shit that's done and in my America that is done normal gay people you have nothing to worry about I drink a bit of light with you a couple of them all right but I'm just saying like no and I think most people feel this way let us know that this is what this is for most people feel this way most people have no problem with the gay community other than the fucking kid shit yep and it's interesting how when we say these things like I'm saying them that there's gay activists that come out and say that I'm anti gay and I'm homophobic because I criticize pedophiles pedophiles that's fine hold on what does that say about their thought of their own community telling all themselves exactly that 100 percent man there's not a person that should be opposed to what I just said unless they are part of the people predator praying on kids point number six this is a big one it's been tested time and time again two a second of mimit rights I want to ask there's the ATF need to be abolished like I mean I feel like that's part of it but what's your state has some very good friends that are ATF agents and they're good people and I'll hire you because the ATF should be abolished yeah okay um we should be able to have any weapons of any sort that our military is able to have because the second amendment is not about deer hunting like Joe Biden likes to say or like these liberals you don't need an AR 15 to hunt no shit bitch it's not for hunting it's for you that's the point okay and we have to get back to what we to a common sense understanding of what two a is about two a is to balance the power framework between the people and the government and if we didn't have two a right now where do you think we be where do you think we'd be right okay so in my opinion americans that are reasonable human beings that would pass a background check I don't think you should be able to and this is an argument that people who don't know guns don't understand when I go to the gun store here in Missouri which is a pretty liberal state when it comes to gun I still have to get a background check I still have to fill out a piece of paper it still takes time people who don't buy guns don't understand this they think you can just go in there and say I want this and this and this and this and this and they just give it to you that's not how the fuck it works if I go in there and I have felonies or I have this or I have that they don't sell you the guns so we already have a background check framework in place which I think is necessary okay um but I also think that with a reasonable amount of scrutiny on someone's background they should be able to buy fully automatic weapons they should be able to buy fucking RPGs they should be able to buy shit that will keep them from getting fucking killed by their government and if you're a real rich dude you should be able to buy a tank the shoots that's my opinion because I like to have one yeah and what and so what so I guess the counter to that is what keeps the the crazies in check like let's say for whatever reason I able to pass the background check does this just refer back to the crime point yeah if you're a violent criminal you get killed you'll get handled yeah so you know that if you go on a you you know that if you somehow find your way into some situation where and by the way part of the crime situation would be to take some of that money that tax money and put armed veteran guards at every single fucking school in this country okay so you're not going to take some mentally deranged moron that's going to run up to school even with a fully automatic fucking you know M4 and do anything against guys who were trained it's not going to happen okay so we can have these weapons which gives us more security as humans and citizens of this country responsibly if we enforce the laws of criminals you know part of the problem with 2A is that people don't understand that criminals break the law so even if we pulled all the guns out okay criminals will still be violent and they will what happens in London stabbing mass stabbing okay those people the way you deter this is by making them understand that if you do a mass stabbing in 7 days you're going to be in the big show brother you see what I'm saying and we're going to watch you cry and wine and scream and and pray and fucking throw up and get sick and then we're going to watch you dick get cut off on national TV and shove down your fucking throat that would fix shit okay but we need the arms to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government and by the way if you were to elect me I would enjoy this because you guys would all say like the people who detracts from me they would say this guy's fucking crazy dictator and I said cool here's the guns yeah cool here's the guns you see what I'm saying I love and that keeps me honest because I know that I'll get fucking killed go to crazy yeah yeah okay and that's fair let's check some balance how how how how how much of a dictator is someone who gives you the weapons unless you cut your dick off you probably don't need one yeah motherfuckers have to have to these motherfuckers today we'll try to get on the big show yeah that's where they're called we're called the big show big show I like show I like it guys Andy point number seven it is one of these years elections I mean a lot of Americans majority of Americans believe 2020 was stolen there's no doubt about that there's a lot of evidence is out there that suggests that with 2024 coming in what's the commonsense consensus on elections paper ballots in person day of election pay taxes to be eligible to vote if you do not have a current tax return or you're behind under taxes you cannot vote now remember taxes at this point in time will be 10% okay if you're 16 and you pay tax because you have a part-time job you get to have a say now you might have a stupid say but I'm going to value you because you're you're you're you're contributing to the country if you're a homeless person or you're on government aid you don't get to vote okay people on government aid don't get to vote because they will consistently vote themselves more aid which is the problem that we have in the system in the system right now all right and by the way the left school is to create as much of those people as possible so that they will always win because they their whole campaign strategy is to promise shit they never intend on delivering and then taking the funding and putting it in their own pocket and if you don't understand that you're fucking stupid because they've been doing it for 50 fucking years okay so so yeah in person paper ballots same day voting voter ID voter ID and tax return love it to contribute I love it that would have that would change that would fundamentally change the direction of our country well I mean shouldn't shouldn't the people voting and making decisions in this country be the ones contributing yes either like I mean I don't how can you argue that it's hard to argue man it's hard to argue why would somebody who's not contributing who has no input listen you're in a car okay and you got two guys in the front seat and you got two your broke buddies in the back seat and me and you were in the front and our two buddies are in the back and we're driving down the street and I look to you and I say where are we gonna eat and you say fuck I'm you know I don't know Taco Bell sounds all right that's cheap we could feed these dudes they didn't got no money right let's go Taco Bell and then they turn around and they say fuck you take us to fucking twisted tree man we're going to fucking twist a tree and you're paying for it that's what's happening in this country right now oh man yeah that's what's happening right now look here you get the dollar menu and McDonald's all right you're lucky you get shit shut the fuck up yeah next time you you want to go to twist a tree you pay for yourself yeah start working yeah start driving yeah I love it and that's another thing that fits into what we're talking about here which is the welfare problem welfare has to be completely wrecked and redone I'm not saying we don't need it but people will not work unless they're forced to work so there should be a limited amount of time they're able to be on government assistance and they should have to pass drug tests and show that they're actively making improvement towards being employable yeah okay this idea crutch yeah this idea that you're gonna have another kid and get an extra amount of money that shit has to stop okay they have to know that if they go there three years of a lot of lifetime on government assistance are two years or whatever we decide you're on the fucking streets bro and there ain't nobody coming yeah that will get people to work because that's the reality for the rest of us that's my reality that's right yeah if I don't work bro if I don't get up every day and fucking do this shit I'm broke why do you think I do this because it's fun and it's fucking fun it's hard to fuck it'd be nice if someone would take care of me but it ain't gonna happen and I understand that because I was taught the right things growing up and some of these people aren't no so we have to change that as well so shit man guys point of contention number eight Andy we need the common sense on congress with rules and regulations when it comes to who can go there how long they should be there what what is the common sense props top process of congress all right if Joe Biden was our grandpa and we went over to Christmas and he started talking and you and I were in the kitchen and Joe Biden's in the living room he's screaming at you and I are gonna elbow each other and be like fucking grandpa this is my fucking recipe code okay right one of the boy okay but this is the guy running our country and these are the people running our country the elderly people that we would literally ignore it a family function and say they're and we would talk real loud hey grandpa how you doing how you doing those people are running the country that has to stop okay so there has to be an upper age limit there also has to be term limits there also has to be rules that says whatever laws that they pass apply to them as well we have to remove immunity for the things that they do criminally in congress and it has to be seen again as something that is of service and one of the ways that we can incentivize people to serve is by giving the entrepreneur or the successful intelligent human being an incentive to serve by giving them a tax break on their business or their life for the time that they are serving okay so like let's say for example let's say I ran for president and I went in for eight years well that's eight years I didn't get to work on my life all right but during those eight years my business does not get taxed at all that's a fair deal and I would do it other people would do it too okay that's fair so we have to make it fair for the people who are actually intelligent and can run and build and create things to run our country and incentivize them to go do it yeah all right and then obviously term limits yeah what's the what's the deal with the lobby and shit uh I don't think there should be lobbies I think lobbies should be completely eliminated because when we're anything for anything yeah I think we we need a representative congress people who have their own ideas their own thoughts their own perspectives that are not skewed by financial gain to make decisions the idea that our government because people don't really understand like when you become the chair of a certain committee in government people don't understand those chairs and those seats on those committees are bought by the packs that support them okay so what we have in our government is a pay for play situation where if someone wants to be on this committee their pack then buys that seat for them to sit on um you know if if one of these guys best like for example like if I was if I owned fucking amazon right and my best friend was Eric Schmidt from Missouri who is a good friend of mine right and I just said here our lobby is going to contribute to your fund fifty million dollars a year but you've got to vote this way on these issues that's the way the government works you're gonna put you on the tech board yes that will put you on the oil board that's still means that's the way the government works and that's why these big companies don't pay any tax don't contribute get away from fucking everything and create monopolies and put the actual entrepreneur the middle class business owner which is the fucking backbone of this country out of business unfairly all right so lobbies should be eliminated completely completely if you get caught taking money to make a decision of any sort in any way shape or form that should be considered treason and it should be punishable on the big show love it yeah I love it guys number nine now this one is affected millions of Americans at this point are affected by this every single year point number nine is the drug crisis where what do we differentiate here in drugs and also I mean I would love to see to like tie in big former bro like because that that's a part of it okay what's the consensus so we have to have a conversation about what we want to accept as reality for as American citizens and we all have different viewpoints here okay I have a different viewpoint than probably a lot of people but I also believe that my viewpoint is common sense now explain it I've been a drunk okay I've been a drunk of my life I'm not I'm not proud to say that but I've had alcohol issues in my life okay this is why I drink very little in fact I haven't had a drink of whiskey since 2018 all right I know how damaging alcohol can be to someone's life I know the decisions that can be made that are detrimental to someone's life under the influence of alcohol because I've made them many times I'm not proud of it I've never made a decision like that smoking weed I've never done it I've none of the bad shit that's ever happening to me happened to me smoking weed so if we're going to allow alcohol because it's my belief that alcohol is allowed and pushed in culture the way that it is because it's so addictive and so detrimental that it that it keeps people in that place of dependency like we talked about under the personal excellence topic so and by the way I'm not saying eliminate alcohol okay I like I like to drink once in a while still but I'll drink beer and I do it responsibly and I usually do it at home all right because I'm a wild fucking animal when I drink that's the truth all right um so we got to decide on what we're going to allow and in my opinion weed mushrooms come from the earth they're natural things that grow out of the ground and we're going to really make laws in a free country that says you can't eat shit that comes out of the ground I mean I don't think that's right don't sound too free and I don't think that mushrooms and weed are nearly as detrimental as alcohol so I think those three things fall into a category of legalization completely without any sort of restriction federally after that when we get into you know cocaine and we get into crack and we get into heroin I believe that that shit should be illegal and I believe that should be the people who do who create and sell those things should be eliminated just like the criminals because what that creates is the violence in society so I believe that every drug conviction that is marijuana or mushrooms or anything like that should be overturned those people should be freed and there's a lot of people in jail still for marijuana bro a lot a lot okay and that's fucking insane and it's fucking insane all right and um I think that's I think that's the answer I think the answer is to declare a war on drugs and everything outside of that window and allow those things to be utilized at will by the American citizens and and businesses be made around them what's big farmers role in this because I believe they have the biggest hand in the country I believe the big farmer is a monopoly at this point in time and needs to be broken up I believe there's a number of monopolies that need to be broken up I believe that some of these big financial institutions need to be broken up they own too many things which is why we're seeing initiatives pushed down through the system ESGDI which are all failing by the way um and this woke culture that's pushed down through these initiatives into corporate America so all of these big conglomerates need to be broken up uh you know anybody who has I mean we used to do this in this country all the time in the 80s we deregulated the phone industry okay um but we have monopolies in this in this country right now and uh we need to eliminate them yeah so and farmers one of them um the other one's tech it's a big one yeah it's a big one and by the way uh because we don't have free speech on here but just we're gonna address it because because people like in section 230 these companies are allowed to censor and make decisions based upon their terms and regulations around what's on their platform and um that that makes sense right 20 years ago when the internet was pretty new and nobody really knew what was gonna happen but it doesn't make sense anymore because the entire fucking town square is on these platforms so we can't say that freedom of speech um is up to the discretion of three or four of the guys who own these tech platforms right that's not that's not okay because then we're just referring the censorship to them when in reality all of these platforms should be uh they should be not allowed to censor and not allowed to traffic censor okay because one of the biggest forms of of censorship on the internet is just turning off the traffic it's not the removal you don't even know it it's not de-platforming it's shadow banning and traffic throttling traffic throttling is the same thing as censorship we have to eliminate all that uh on social media platforms and make them operate as if they were a free speech platform you know and things that are criminal hard drugs child molestation child porn etc etc etc those things should be fucking those things should be wiped off the internet yeah and those people arrested guys are 10th and last and final point of contention here uh Andy is foreign affairs and foreign aid what's the consensus here well look we shouldn't be funding the rebuilding or the wars or the conflict management anywhere else our tax dollars should be spent on americans america first should be the policy it should always be the policy and i am 100% in favor of us using all of our tax dollars here at home and then creating a military presence that is a massive deterrent and letting other people do whatever the fuck they want okay but we're not the world's police yeah we're not yeah i'm tired of seeing and we have to be real about this every single generation for the last i don't know how many hundred years has seen their strongest most capable men sent off to war to die why do you think this happens this doesn't happen because we need these wars this happens because these people who send the people to wars make a lot of money doing it while at the same time eliminating the the the highest likelihood segment of the population to resist and revolt against them and they do this intentionally so this is why when you go to france france has a bunch of little dudes because all the big strong dudes have been killed off in wars and all through europe this is a commonality and we're getting that way here in america too the strong men are not breeding because they're not it being allowed to breed because they're sent off to fucking die all right so we have to recognize that these tyrants have weaponized war against our own population in a way that we don't really see or talk about it's the fact that they're removing our strongest leaders and getting them killed intentionally so that those leaders won't revolt against them so that has to stop these these this world policing has to stop this membership in NATO this membership in world economic form this membership and all these different things that needs to stop okay we don't answer anybody here we are us we do the best we can we're our own fucking team and yes we have allies and yes we work with people but the biggest deterrent to people fucking with you is a great fucking military and a great threat of force that they are afraid of so that's what we need to have i love it man well that was our two points yeah that's two points final thoughts on this yeah i'm gonna give you my final thoughts you know you can agree or disagree with everything that i said but i feel like i'm a pretty common sense balanced person i think i understand what it takes to have order in society and order in civilization and maybe i'm wrong maybe you disagreed me maybe you think i'm crazy i don't know but that's okay we could disagree but here's the reality we all know that what we have isn't working and more of what we have had in the past isn't going to work any better and for us to create a situation in our lifetime where we're proud to be Americans again and we're happy in this country again major realignment is required all right electing a new president who's not willing to make big changes is not going to change anything all right we're gonna continue down this path we might get a little bit of a break things might get a little bit easier things might get a little bit better but really what this country needs is total reformation all right and it's time because we all know that this isn't working we all know that it hasn't been working and we all know that it hasn't been working for most of our lives most of our lives we've been abused by the government that's a fact and so for us to get to a place where we're actually free we're going to have to have radical change done by somebody who's willing to do it and in my opinion none of these guys are actually willing to do it but i could tell you this this is the way i think it should be and i'm not running for president but i am working to create a culture that you guys who actually believes in common sense and some common sense rules about america so maybe one day we could actually get it and one thing we have to understand is that we could start on this now okay personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion and personal excellence takes time it's not something that you can do today it takes time it takes commitment it takes a diligent effort towards a different outcome than you have been experiencing so far in your life and for us to actually get any of these changes in any way shape or form we have to remove their power over us and the only way for us to remove their power over us is by us either revolting which i don't think is going to happen or two us becoming personally excellent and unplugging ourselves from their control mechanisms we have to understand what they're doing to us they are feeding us food that is filled with addictive chemicals that makes us fat when we get fat they are filling us with medication which honestly makes us more sick long term when we get sick we consume more of their data more they're streaming more their information which allows them to put more ridiculous information in our brain and control our brains all right when we're broke we don't have any leverage we don't have any power when we are demoralized we don't seek any of these things we don't seek any self improvement and that's the goal of demoralization so if we really want to change this country into what it could be and what it should be we have to start with our own selves and we can do that today that's something you can do you can start to work to become the example for everybody in this country to look at all right and maybe not everybody in the country will look at you maybe it's only your family but if it starts with your family it'll go to your neighbors when it goes to your neighbors sort of go to your community when it goes to your community it'll flow beyond that and that's how we create change when people see you win they want to win they want to know how you did it be a good neighbor show them how teach them how help them be better these are the cultural changes that we can make now as opposed to waiting for someone to come in and just make all these logistical economic policy changes that will fix the rest of the puzzle if we ever want a chance of fixing this country we have to become personally excellent we have to stop hating each other based upon differences that the media tells us we have we have to stop tolerating things that are intolerable like the molestation and grooming and disgusting trafficking and shit that's happening with our children in this country which seems to be more and more accepted we have to make a stand there okay we have to be vocal we have to use our voices we have to do the things that we can do okay if we do these things now in a few years we will have a situation where the government will look completely different because the culture will demand a difference so if we think about what we can do you could say oh Andy that sounds all nice and good but still what's going to change nothing will change until you change that's what we have to understand personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion and is the catalyst to all the rest of the change that comes and people don't like to hear that because it takes effort and it's hard and it takes commitment but the reality is is we without that none of the rest of the change is possible so go out there do your fucking part and if we all do our parts we have an opportunity to really make a difference in this country
