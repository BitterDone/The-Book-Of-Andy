boy though yeah so dude before we get into the show you know let's give us some background on how you got to be you know I mean dude you've been doing music for a long time you've been done some really big fucking things in music yeah um got a tour coming up yeah yeah yeah what's how'd you get into this I mean listen to music as a kid rap I mean I'm 40 about to be 45 years old rap you know was that that was all the all-time when rap was the best shit when we were kids you know I mean yeah and everybody says that but it's true for us no really it is we have the best generation of yeah so yeah I just I started writing when I was you know 14 15 years old and and did a lot of music on my own and then I would go out to the city of Chicago because there's no white kids recording or doing any kind of shit like that yeah in the suburbs area anything like that so we just go out into the hood and there was a lot of producers out there and we've record and do shows and shit like that and um that's how I started but that's not it didn't take off from me there there was no social media back then you know I mean I remember and then I ended up getting in trouble and I got in a lot of fights and drinking out the bars and and then I ended up going to do some time uh for aggravated battery great-buyling harm I was on probation and I got another one while I was on probation and I kind of forgot about music and kind of everything and try to get my life together and how long did you have to go I got a three-year sentence I did a little over a year and a half yeah that's enough isn't it you know it's crazy because when you get there if you've never been to prison you get there you're like fuck but the guys that have been there for 10 years 20 years they're like go to sleep you know what time you wake up you'll be going home you know I mean that's a short very short time but never be in there and not and be in there too for what I was there for like fighting it was a police officer the second time but uh he deserved that he he's tased me and smacked on anyways whatever uh got a little bit of a fight there and uh got charged an aggravated brat he aggravated uh battery and great-buyling harm to a police officer went down did my time and it's just a different world and I think that's probably when I grew up and it made me become a man it made me have to deal with the stuff I've been running away from my whole life and my childhood like the shit growing up it was kind of fucked in my life and I kind of had to deal with it there's no way to run in there you know you kind of just have to look at yourself and say I'm either going to thrive in here or I'm not going to make it home from here yeah yeah yeah what do you do what do you do in there all day lift fucking weights yeah all day yeah every yeah that's it you program you wake up you well some guys get fat and you get protein powder in there no hell no you're running off of you're gonna say that they're protein powder I believe you're running off of it lift weights every day and you're running off of straight fumes and you're worrying about knocking cracked over that would a fucking plate yeah I mean so um some of guys are you know jacked I'd be if I was in fucking prison had to work out all day yeah you'd be there's gonna be yoke there's some gorillas in there yeah and there's some guys are just slabs and they they do their time eating honey buns and fucking zoos and whamwhas but um I yeah that's just what the fuck is a whamwham it's just it's like cakes and shit you know what's a whamwham DJ whamwham's like ding dong's a hole yeah you know what that is but you know I did my time working out and programming like you know I I want to be I got I got it's time to be it's time to be that motherfucker's time to wake up yeah yeah like it was a wake up we all go through that yeah one way or another I go through it probably once a year yeah that's a fucking fact you know bro yeah yeah that's a fact all right dude dude for real that's I know what that's about bro I get in those funks too where I'm like fuck man this and then I have I'll be that down for a couple days and now wake up one day I put my fucking feet on the floor I'm like bro you're a fucking man get your fucking shit together and you know being a man like I struggle really a lot every day like mental health type shit yeah uh so I wrote a lot of high achievers do bro yeah it's weird it's like we're we're like the same thing that drives us also fucks and fucks us up well I think we have less people to talk to and relate to that can relate to the things that we go through that's true you know I'm saying yeah isolating we say I mean I you set a bar this high that's almost impossible to reach yeah and then when you have problems bro nobody takes them serious because they're like oh you're famous you're rich you're fucking this or that yeah and they don't they don't hear it they don't understand that piece of yeah yeah yeah yeah I uh I'm just dead now you know I'm happy I'm happy about that but it's been it's been a really cool journey and I'm happy it's where I am today you know I never thought I'd be here you know I mean that's a good place bro coming from where I came from and what 15 year old you be proud 15 year old me would be freaking out yeah I'm saying fine too fuck yeah let's fuck you know you know I mean uh but 45 year old me is like oh man I'm beat I'm ready to be I've done a lot and I and I now I just want to go raise my kids and kind of step back and just enjoy enjoy it you see the breath bro you see the breath I don't know you know I might just go be a professional golfer I don't know what the fuck you golf yeah I do I started golf and I was it wait three months ago how is it I fucking kill in it yeah yeah I finally broke like under a hundred I play like these big courses because I think I'm like you know I'm gonna go play at the best courses fuck yeah and I finally broke like a hundred I hit like a 91 at Caghill which is like a PGA course yeah and it's real score bro for real dude yeah yeah like play golf I never played golf I played I was I was I was I would box I was in football isn't wrestling yeah what's a golf club you know yeah plus I was poor grown ups we we get fucking golf club yeah off is an expensive sport yeah yeah yeah I just I'm I'm I'm just now getting back into it a little bit I play my whole life until I was probably 25 oh wow and then I took like two years off bro and it all went away and then really yeah and then when I went back I was so bad I'm like fuck the shit see I go into it with zero expectations which is rare yeah everything I go into I'm gonna I'm gonna bury you yeah I'm gonna do whatever I have to do to get better and beat you I'm this I go in with zero expectations I have a great time where all my buddies like for I don't I'm not big on networking like I'm not like a networker but like when all my friends that are in business are out saying hey we're gonna go here like the nice courses and shit you want to go I'm like no no like and now I'm like I'm getting a little older I'm like no I actually would like to do that yeah yeah yeah and I don't want to embarrass myself so yeah yeah DJ is gonna start playing golf it's coming back golf's coming back bro it's actually it's yeah it's because the prices are going and the price are going way up yeah I go to a course and I pay and I'm like damn yeah this is how much cost of golf yeah yeah and then you look around you're like you all must be making a fucking money yeah that's that's a new new thing for me yeah yeah so so you got you got a tour coming up yep and it kicks off in September September 19th the war tour yeah okay so where are we hitting on that well across the country 33 dates you know anywhere we go from starting Illinois in Michigan Pennsylvania East Coast down in Florida some parts over in the West Coast California yeah this would be sick and then I'll probably go again in April and I think that's uh I think that's all I think that's it after that yeah that's it for I mean dude so if for those of you guys that have not listened uh to or don't know who Adam is you got to listen bro because like one of the things I found really really awesome is like your ability to kind communicate through music and talk about some very important things man that like a lot of other rappers or just music artists in general they just don't they they avoid those conversations or they avoid those controversial topics if you will and you you go ahead and have strong with a really great message bro I was listening to this earlier this morning yeah I feel like I've done I would did that in my early early career with music but then I didn't really do a lot of it in recent years except when I've done stuff with like time and time for sure you know a lot of them songs went really big like American flags you hear that it like at Trump rallies and parade and all kinds of shit like that so in that cool bro the music the music the music the music has has helped my life and my family's life tremendously and the people uh we have some of the greatest supporters you know deck like pro-american shit is is like declining it's like you're crazy we are the majority you know I mean I don't think I think it feels like it's declining because the shift has been made yeah right like when three years ago when everybody was freaking the fuck out we were all much louder but now I feel like the I feel like culture has shifted so the people are sort of getting back to their like a little bit more back to their routine I know for me like I don't yell about it as much as I used to but it's only because I feel like I don't need to yeah it's just getting done I feel like I feel like everybody starting to pick up the water and carry their own little bit you know and so that's that's been nice um so I don't I don't agree that it's going down I actually think it's going up I just I think people are living it instead of talking it we are the majority yes oh dude we always yeah even when they when they were always called the loudest they had the loudest voices yeah bro listen man it's always been that way it's not even fucking close bro it's we were living in a fucking illusion of bots and fake articles and fake news and it's all perception to make our people feel like they're the only ones am I crazy that's right like when all when they ran that for for last five years they were they were running you know uh uh boys and playing in girl sports and you can wake up and you feel like a girl today you're a girl or you wake up you feel like a boy you're a boy like and I'm like sitting back like wait no this is fucking oh you don't think you don't agree you're a bigot you're a racist you're a homophobic or this and I'm like where hey is it right right where the fuck is everyone bro that's a fuck you're preaching the fuck this is normal what the fuck is not fucking normal but dude and then you go to a fucking event in real life and where it's like your people and they're all like oh Adam bro I love what you're doing I'm so scared you so many buddy yeah but like and then they're like but I can't say that I'm like you know what man I you fucking make me more pissed than they do like fuck dude you don't cut off your balls yes like dude when people come up to me and fucking public yeah and they say that shit after all the time because like dude we were talking in the in the gym you know I had a good thing fucking going not that I don't have a great thing going now but I was enjoying that I like talking about business I like talking about making money actually making money is my favorite fucking thing to talk about that's the truth but the then I had to come around and real I started realizing I'm like dude if we lose this country nobody's making money like we're all fucked so we mean DJs start talking about it and dude for the first two years we're going places and everybody's like oh well we love what you're doing yeah yeah we agree with you I'm like well could you say something bro like what the fuck that's what I'm saying I sat back and I'm like wait this is you're telling me that this is this is the new norm yeah when no it what it really never was never was they were pushing it so far on every single thing and then like pro athletes and shit like that if you don't jump on this and you're not and you don't get a board what we're doing you're you're you're a part of the problem hold on who the fuck the how hard my I have a gray I love you my daughter she's about to be four sh there's boys and girls male female that's it only your only women can have children that's it what the there's zero argue there's nothing you cannot argue that well you know what that's about though dude you know if this is about if dude if you can get people to question the most basic fundamental truth of humanity which is men and women what can you not get them to question then that's the point that's why they went at that right I I married I've been with Margie for 10 years before any of this stuff happened I married a Republican woman because I like my women to not have penises okay okay so there's that yeah well I think that's you know that's I think we all feel the same yeah man you want to add him for pressure yeah okay I'm not just sitting here and say women need to cook and clean and do all that ship but you know what a man should know how to change a fucking tire a woman should know how to fucking cook a meal we can all argue well we can both do that yeah yeah whatever but Mary a traditional fucking woman and be happy or marry a liberal and be miserable those are the choices that's it and she might have it did yeah full of good chance she's gonna have Harry R. P. It's for sure bro I'm smelling she ever dated a liberal girl ever have I yeah if I did I didn't know at the time bro you know I mean like you're talking I did yeah I did back in 2007 I was ever

yeah bro it was a paramount plus right now he knows this whole this whole business I'm just saying yeah um yeah let's get your first headline man so uh we're Missouri boys obviously um a lot of pride here in Missouri not that type of pride yeah we're proud thank god yeah uh amen and uh but uh we love we love celebrating other Missourians that do great shit this is a story came out a couple of days ago we got to give a shout out to our good buddy uh Andrew Bailey um this crazy story so Bondy and Patel they tapped Missouri Attorney General as additional FBI code deputy director alongside bondino so um this is our attorney general for the state okay guy named Andrew Bailey he's a phenomenal phenomenal guy yeah he's been on the show a few times a few times yeah he's a phenomenal guy all right and you talk about like somebody that's been doing it you know I'm not just like writing the mean tweets and not just saying the shit like been actually doing it being the treasure this has been yeah and um he just got tapped to to go to to leave his duly elected position as a g and to serve as a presidential appointee to the FBI in an an assatement bondie told Fox is that I'm thrilled to welcome Andrew Bailey as code deputy director of the FBI bondie told Fox News digital uh quote he has served as a distinguished state attorney general and is a decorated war veteran bringing expertise and dedication to service his leadership and commitment to this country will be a tremendous asset as we work together to advance president Trump's mission so um that just came down now I saw this I know we had talked about it obviously uh you know I even shot him a text might do this fucking awesome grads man and um but I was thinking more about this there there's never in the history has this happened in the sense that we're like you got three people running the FBI usually just the director deputy director and that's it yeah so he's like a a code deputy director right it's one of your own that's one of your own right but it's weird because like I was thinking about this in the sense of like you know let's say you had a job right and your boss hired somebody in for your same position right like to do the exact same thing to work your ass off I would be feeling like okay I'm probably about to get fired you know I'm saying like you brought this motherfucker I'm probably about to get fired well I do have something to talk to you about I can show okay is that my Adam's here I'm here it's not a man but it's like get me a cat out there and some fucking pop tarts let's go dude it's just like I mean I just thought about like dude that's you know I don't I don't I think he's probably going in the fucking take over all of it is my is my guess and apparently it's a big word on the street is that he's eventually gonna move up to be the like the director of the FBI he hasn't confirmed that I'm I don't think he would tell me but he hasn't started to say it's me you know but but it is interesting man it is interesting but what's what's your thoughts on that in I don't know I don't know nothing I certainly didn't talk to him he pleading the fifth yeah that what you doing what do you think Adam I'm fucking congratulations because we need better people in in these high positions so fucking well I think that's the thing like dude bonzino's good like listen cash bonzino they're great guys cool guys right but like they don't have the experience of like bro really is a fucking body slinger bro that's what we need that's what he is okay and here's what's going on I yes I talked okay all right and I can't say the things we talked about for sure but here's what I'll say cash and bonzino are guys that I think can very clearly see what is going on they do not have the legal knowledge and the knowledge of how to actually prosecute people needed to get this job done and that is the simplest way that I can say it without saying what I can't say yeah um he has the practical application bodies are gonna get slung mm-hmm so that's that's I'm excited but it's refreshing man it's refreshing because like I mean dude it's nothing against cash or or bonzino man they just I'm saying it I you're your interpretation um could be correct okay they could move on from that because I believe that Bailey could do the job of all of those people easy like and probably much better than all of them because he's not a fucking pussy and he also he's very intelligent he's not he doesn't have blinders on he can't be bought this is a real dude he's a real fucking patriot dude and I believe that while they could move on from those guys I think they're gonna work all together for right now um to get done what needs to get done and I think anybody who doesn't understand Andrew Bailey and what he is and what he's about this would be like I don't know you're going to battle and and and like you you call up like the fucking uh you know like the the baddest dude ever William Wallace yeah William Wallace you call him up yeah and you say hey get to the front of the line and that's what he is but yeah I feel like in politics especially you got a lot of these guys that are good at speaking right mm-hmm we need guys that are good at knocking heads off that's how he is yeah that's him for sure bro yeah and like again it's not that cashing doing you know good stuff uh this just came out but again it's stuff that we already know you're saying what's already been said you know like it's not a shocking surprise to people that Obama and fucking Hillary are involved in some fucked up shit they all it's not a surprise nobody surprised by that we we know oh so you're confirming it okay cool what are we gonna do about it yeah talk you know I'm saying we're gonna talk about it well Bailey ain't gonna fucking talk that's what we need we need a guy knocked the head he's coming in and and like you know the political landscape is definitely moving I gotta bring this next clip in because we got to talk about it um because we had kind of foreshadowed this a little bit a few episodes ago but right now what's big is like the anti-semitic stuff and how it's not good can't talk about certain groups right we can talk about all the other groups but this specific group you can't talk about that's fine tell my Jews yes right tell my and so I gotta show this clip that just came out from Netanyahu from BB um this clip just came out let's let's check this clip let's see what he has to say you know it's very hard to find to fight the you know the deception the the lies the the starved children the pictures of starved children are turned out to have cerebral palsy or other congenital diseases that leave them emaciated and Israel is of course accused of starving children pretty much the way that in the middle ages Jews were accused of killing Christian children for their blood so you know what do you do against the lie that circles the earth ten times before the truth has a chance to emerge you have to shorten the war as speedily as possible and frankly we also have to do something about the algorithms and the social networks this is how about this fuck this guy yeah how about how about we gotta do something about you killing fucking kids how about that you know these motherfuckers have been going killing you stand this motherfucker they've been killing each other before we were ever involved in anything these these people have been killing each other the thing that what you just said that quit blowing up kids yeah you if you don't you don't want a bad reputation then stop killing fucking kids and it's not fucking misinformation okay it's not a few emaciated kids it's not it's that's cerebral palsy okay like bro let's be fucking real dude Israel and the Israel mafia not Jews not all Jews they've controlled the media for fucking okay so this is the first time you've not been able to control the outcome of information and you're upset about it that's the fucking point and the more you come on TV you dumb fuck and say this shit the more people don't like you like like dude these guys I don't like his face bro this listen these fucking guys especially this motherfucker they are so used to being controlled that they are perfectly comfortable sitting in front of a camera in front of the whole world saying that everybody else is the problem yeah and uh uh fuck that guy and he sits there with his little ribbon and his little pins and his fucking little picture of his family in the background and everything's perfectly placed when really behind all that's all fucking lies and that guy bro that guy that guy dude I listen most Jews don't like this motherfucker okay and a lot of this warship that he's doing it most people don't know this but this is about maintaining his own power okay like he's can he's continuing the war or or like dude like for example like when Trump came in and they did that shit with uh Iran the fucking next day he's miscellaneous Syria and Libya and shit just so he can keep it going because dude when they're in the war they can't replace him as president or whatever they call it over there but dude this guy is a fuck and I am tired like I feel like he's lecturing me no you know like who the fuck are you bro fuck you fuck everything about you eat a fucking dick and die that's what I like this I this is like this is my kind of podcast well bro like and this still have nothing to do with Jewish people this has to do with few criminals at the top of the Israel fucking food chain and massage food chain that hide behind normal Jews and say oh you don't like what I do it is because I'm Jewish no I don't like what you do because it's bullshit what you do it has nothing to do with you being fucking Jewish it has to do with you blowing mother fuckers up and thinking you can do whatever the fuck you want at any given time at any different place with anybody ever like fuck you this industry and two people start saying that shit like their whole thing is to make you afraid right oh we're gonna expose you cool tell everybody what I did the same share by else did you know I'm saying the only ones that like them are the fucking boomer right winners here in fucking the United States who have paid attention and they watch fucking or they paid to support them uh or are paid to support them well yeah but I'm saying yes out of the influencers yeah that's the fact yeah that's interesting how many influencers were totally anti this dude and then all of a sudden they're over there mm-hmm now they just did another trip a couple of weeks ago they just had a big trip over there um I fucking I fucking can't stand this guy this guy's the epitome of fucking tyrannical bullshit what gives him the right I was reading about this bro I was reading about this and people gonna get upset when I say this but I was reading about what happened in Rome in 72 AD okay for for those of you that don't know the Jews were kicked out of Rome in 72 AD and the reason that they were kicked out was because they refused to assimilate to Roman culture they did all their own things they did they did their own religious ceremonies which the Romans didn't like our own set of laws they were trying to correct yeah and then they said it was persecution well here's the thing dude what gives you the right to go to another country and do everything you want your way and then it's in an act like they're persecuting you if they're persecuting you for not assimilating the culture that means you don't fucking belong there okay so if it's never if we don't we're gonna learn this lesson when are we gonna learn this lesson if you want to exist peacefully you have to abide by the culture of the place that you live in and that's fucking it okay so in in in in in Rome in 72 right they had all these different gods right they worship multiple gods and the Jews argue with them in Rome saying there's only one god okay and that's that it's besides the point what's true or not true but you're in Rome and what do they say when you're in Rome that's right okay and they kick them out they kick them out and then they're like oh they persecuted us no you refuse to fucking you violated them correct and that's what's happened over and over and over with with the fucking whole thing and like and like for me the reason I brought this video up is because again like that slippery slope that we talked about like this is where it starts like eventually bro they're gonna move into where they're truly violating our first amendment and that's where that's where this is going that's what he's saying that's where he's going to what do you listen dude the fucking ADL just came out two weeks ago and said America first is anti-Semitic saying if you say America first or you think America first it is considered anti-Semitic hate speech according to the ADL listen well hold on listen to this it's way worse that's crazy so now they're passing fucking laws or trying to pass laws in many different states about anti-Semitic hate speech so what happens when they pass all these laws for anti-Semitic hate speech and they deem people that are America first anti-Semites in our country fuck you that's kind of like what you were just going back to when they were in Rome yeah well it's only happened 107 other times it should always be if it should always be America first if you if you're an American it's America first over everyone that's really the biggest if if if someone's got to go with Campy us I got to get back home with these babies dude I'm with you so that's the biggest that's the biggest problem I have with them is dude get the fuck out of our shit the fuck out of our shit bro fuck you well especially when they come over they do shit like this I don't know if you guys saw this they're really it is really government official just got charged with soliciting a 15 year old in Las Vegas and then somehow he was able to leave the country and return to Israel which they will not extradite him see I don't understand and I said this I want my stories or something you you you got these people that can I don't know what I'm allowed to say here but you got these people who can fuck kids hurt little babies and get probation or get a slap on the wrist and then you got guys sitting in prison with DUIs and fit fist fight and shit like this but you fucking fuck with these little kids nobody kid what why are we protecting the children because they're trying to make it acceptable in culture well what do they call that when when when when when you're when you're what is it maps what is that what an attractive person what no how about put a bullet in that motherfucker there's no that's the only cure I know I know bro yeah this dude I mean in this story is fucking crazy bro so this dudes in Las Vegas he gets caught in a fucking sting right they arrest him the DA in Las Vegas is was born in Israel okay and somehow or another no pros no no no prosecution no charge not even no prosecution they immediately extradited him the media is real like flume right away we don't even have to use diplomatic immunity yeah this shit she did it she's got him out of it get him forgot it and then you like and so this is the guy here this is this is the guy his name is Chad Tom R.T. Om Alexanderovich this guy on the right all right and like it's been confirmed like our our State Department talked about it they're aware of it that he was arrested he was giving a court date but then he gets extradited and you know I started looking into this about about about you know pedophiles fleeing the same the first time that this has happened since 2014 there's been over 60 accused US sex offenders who have fled to Israel via the law of return evading prosecution with community aid and delayed extraditions and I had to look this shit up and very like it's real it's absolutely real I don't know how that's allowed it's just it's sickening to me especially why would they allow it unless it's part of their culture that they're fucking trying to hide it's definitely a part of their culture and it's becoming a part like the Epstein shit how hard is it how hard is this to release a list of of pedophiles why is that hard am I saying something crazy no why why is that hard why is it hard to bring these people to justice when you especially when you run a campaign on that release release fuck pedophiles and anyone involved with them and anyone protecting them you're just as bad as them dude there's only a few logical conclusions they're all on that list yeah you know it's not even about the list bro it's it's so much deeper than that like everybody knows who's on the list the the flight logs have been published for five six years I mean they're all connected and they all make money together it's a good old boys club man yeah it's good old boys club man I don't know guys that's not what you guys think down in the comments chats rolling yeah I mean look dude um I'm I'm fucking tired of other countries interest being served over ours and it doesn't matter who it is it doesn't matter if it's Israel doesn't matter if it's China it doesn't matter if it's whatever we're not the world's fucking bitch our politicians are the world's bitch though that's see I believe in America I'm a proud American I love you I love my fellow Americans I hate our government yeah I I believe in God I don't believe in religion you understand I'm saying yeah I do yeah a hundred percent dude it's like when I post the flag or I look at the flag I don't I don't I don't look at that flag and think of our government fuck no yeah they're not here to help us they're here to keep us that's our fuck flag bro yes that is that's right yeah we the people have the power and we the people need to stand the fuck up and and and talking is cool bringing awareness but there's gonna be a time when we need to get real Americans like the guy that's from here that's going in there do that we need to get real Americans in these jobs well if everybody was vocal they wouldn't be able to get away with the shit that's right yeah I mean like it this isn't we're not talking about where it's gotten to a point where violence is required if we were just in a place where everybody would be evil everybody would be vocal they would go away they're scared of losing their jobs just care to what fucking Chad next door thinks of them and when the kids go to school that teach my child to get back in his

Annie when I was in the gym with them earlier yes me if I seen a movie it's a great movie which they don't make great movies anymore for some fucking reason but this is a scene from I believe kingdom of heaven yep have you seen it yeah it's an awesome movie I like you're sitting out you're sharing yeah yeah what's on the tongue-on man yeah I told you watch it's good it's actually and it's it's partially based on true story it's very historically accurate for the most part yeah 100% um yeah let's get to headline number two guys uh headline number two reads DeSantis state line won't protect criminal illegals since Chuck Norris deputy to nap fugitive trucker so this little follow up just briefly but we covered I don't know if you see that video it was going around viral the the truck driver that made that you turn oh the fucking guy who didn't give a fuck they just killed people right yeah I didn't see that well so they just got it didn't even face like fucking what yeah they they just uh they just arrested him the Chuck Norris arrest him because he's fucked if he did yeah apparently that's uh that's what they're saying yeah I saw that video that guy and he acted like it was like the most nice shit ever yeah wild um and the weirdest part about it is the fact that the guy was in California already so like how did you get back so quick you know I'm saying like how did how did that I don't even know how how he was able to get back to California that quick when you you got three vehicular homicide deaths you're dealing with right now you know I'm saying but um he's there here's the clip of them picking them up uh check this out seeing actually being led by Florida State authorities uh onto the plane there it looks like he's in shackles as he's being taken back onto the plane what exactly senator would your legislation do pertaining to this and other potential similar cases in the future well look there's already a a basic requirement of English proficiency that some of these blue states these sanctuary states are just ignoring an issuing commercial drivers license to truckers uh i think two things number one these states like Washington and California that want to keep issuing commercial drivers license need to show that they are complying with that basic requirement that the people that they're putting on these roads that are going into other states can actually read the signs and understand English and be able to communicate with uh motor carrier safety inspectors and and and instructions for driving and they need to be permanent lawful residents of the united state thank you yes no that's how about they actually live here like yeah like what the fuck yeah man and the craziest part about it is that like so that happened right um but apparently it just happened again uh i got this another clip here let me pull it up it just happened it happened again um with another driver uh let's check this clip out just great you okay be sure yeah i was coming this way and i see the whole thing it's crazy yeah okay i tried to swear so it happened again and um i don't it's it's into it it's crazy it really is um but what i want is it's kind of not turn the attention to um but these guys illegal migrant not supposed to be here um and then you see the public's reaction you know i'm saying and like how people try to like protect these people you know like they they just have this guy down in dc um that was getting detained uh from uh by ice there there's a traffic stop that happens uh federal agents at dc and here's the clip let's watch this here's the clip before we go you'd better get away You know that one. I love my face. You know that one. You know that one. You know that one. You know that one. He's saying he just wants to go back to his family. You know that one. You know that one. You know that one. Okay. Okay. All right. Fuck around and find out. That's what I think too, Rick. Now real quick, I mean a lot of people like man that look cars, right? Like it's not palatable to most people. But here's the deal. Mr. Perez, to your phone, he was on his final order and we're going to be in the car. Just find a load of removal. He entered the US illegally three times. Okay. He is most recent charge was aggravated sexual battery against a minor under the age of 13. So how the fuck is he out anyway? He just wants to get back to his family. Yeah. Now he does. He just wants to get back to his family guys. That's all. I do want to know your thoughts on this because this is something else that's happening around the migrant situation. Is there popping up these facilities, these new DHS facilities, right? To house illegal migrants before they send them back to when they came. And I personally, I'm not with it. I'm not with it because I look at this like we're spending more tax dollars to open up these facilities to date. I believe this is number four. They're opening up a new in Nebraska called the corn husker clink. But that's tax dollars that are being already being spent. Now we're spending more tax dollars on keeping these people at a facility. I would rather spend tax dollars if we have to spend any to get them out of the country as quick as possible. Why is it frowned upon for me or Andy or you DJ to say something like this? And now speaking for you guys, I'll just say why is it frowned upon for me to say this? If you are illegal and you're not supposed to be here, get the fuck out of here. Why is that? Why is that bet? No, these people they're seeking asylum. There's I don't give a fuck. We have fucking veterans on the street. We have veterans that are homeless. We're not taking care of our own people, but you could come here and we're supposed to take care of you. I don't care how they handle these motherfuckers. I can't post up in England or Germany or any other country and just sit there and be like, I live here now. This is where I live. Get the fuck out of here. Come through the legal port of entry. How hard is that? It's not hard. The reason that it's frowned upon, which I'm not even sure it is, because I think it's like 70, 80% of the country agrees with you. That's not enough for frown. But here's a problem with these facilities. What happens if they exist in the Democrats get back in power? What do you think is going to happen? What are they going to do with those facilities? They're going to let them go. They're going to let them back out. They're going to let them out just like they're going to turn them into fucking resorts. They let them out during COVID. They're going to put us in them. That's what they'll be there for. I'm going to tell you this too. Anybody who defends this shit is an enemy of the United States America. For real. You guys who give these people sympathy and empathy and you're like, why the fuck does do are elected like real talk, elected officials that advocate for these people rights. First of all, they don't have rights as American citizens the same way we do. When these people advocate for this, they're advocating against the American people that are charged tax dollars to pay their salaries. Any politician that advocates on behalf of illegal migrants in this country is a fucking trade of the country. That's right. And they should be treated as such. I'm tired of this. America is tired of this. We are tired of seeing people all over the news and in our government and on our media advocating for the rights of criminals and illegal migrants that shouldn't be here. Like, why is it that these people who are elected by us paid by us advocating for criminals? Why would they do that? Why would they do that? Why are they allowed to do that? How is that allowed? How is it allowed for elected officials who are on our payroll to openly advocate for the rights of violent criminals and migrants? That is fucking treason. What are they gaining? Well, they're gaining voters. That's the point. Because America, for the most part, is tired of the shit. So what they're trying to do is import an entire new working class and voter class that will be thankful for them. So they will vote for them. So basically what we have here is we're going to Democrats are legitimately. I don't like Republicans either, but I'm going to say this. Democrats are legitimately catering and pandering to the criminal element and the illegal element, non-citizen element of this country in order to be elected. That's not even American, dude. That should be criminal. And we have people say, oh, this isn't a dictator shit. Yeah, maybe it should be for a minute. Maybe it should be for a minute so we could clean up all the shit. It wouldn't be the first time in history where someone came in, cleaned up, and then left. Yeah. Yeah. You know what, like, dude, this is insane shit. And the fact that we have AOC and these far left, like they're always advocating as if the criminal is the victim. Right. AOC is still around. Yeah. I thought she had like an only fans page now. What the fuck is she doing? Dushy? I'm just saying, dude, like this, the American people should not tolerate this. They might, and then they have these people brainwashed, like the upper middle class white. It's always the humor. It's always, bro, they're brainwashed because they are so privileged and they have never got their hands dirty. They've never been the victim of a violent crime. They've never gone through the system. They've never been punched in the mouth. Dude, listen, I got stabbed in the fucking face at 23 years old. Okay. It fucked up my whole life. That's what this is. This is, this is, and I got one in the back too. And, bro, it fucked up my whole life. Okay. I understand what the fucking ramifications are psychologically of being violated in that way. And we have these upper middle class, bruncher women who advocate for fucking the rights of criminals and illegal migrants until one of them does something to them. And then it's like, what are you doing? You don't have to deal with this shit. You're not the one that has to, you're not the fucking dad or the mom that has to kick down a door to get rid of this shit. And they think they're noble. They think they're, they're, I've got a bit of, they're, they're... They did their, they did their, they... They did their deed for the day. They did their deed for the day. Yes. They protested for a moment. You want to do your fucking deed for the day, then stop allowing these motherfuckers to come in and kill other people's children, and rape other people's children, and take jobs from the American worker, and ruin our culture, and dilute the American dream. You want to do your good deed, then stay up for that shit. No. Because then that would be called racist. Well, you know what? You're looking back at the Becky. Yeah. I stopped caring about all that shit a long time ago. Yeah, me too. Yeah. We kind of grown, uh, dissensitized from all these little words that they've, you know... No, you just look at it and you're like, yeah. Like you really, you really want to fuck with someone? When they call you the name, just smile, but like, that's right. Yeah. Capital R. Yeah. Yeah, I was saying, yeah, let's get some chat and hit chat. What we got on this, man? Who wants, uh, who's got something to say on this? Let me go Hitler. Okay. All right. No. Hey. Matt Strowman. All right. Here we go. Matt, you're the time to shine. Hey, Andy. Hey, DJ. Can you hear me? Yes, sir. Talk to me, man. What you got on this? Really quickly. Before I get into what I want to say, I got a shout out, Andy, real quick, because about nine months ago, I was fat, broke, and $7,000 in debt. But now I own my own townhouse, and I have a home studio and I'm making music, and it's all because of 75 hard. So thank you, dude. Thank you. That's what's happening, bro. That's what's up, dude. That is the fucking revolution, bro. Personal excellence. Going from being a slave to their bullshit to handle in business. I love that. Sir, yes, sir. But now with this subject, I have a crazy theory. I don't know if it's true. It's just my little tinfoil hat. So if you got the horn hat, you might want to put this on. But with all these trucker accidents that's going on, there it is. Oh, wow. So, I'm thinking, I'm ready. Let it rip. What are the odds of this whole, like all these crashes happening with this certain demographic? What if it's people trying to make the trucking industry look bad as a whole? So that way all the farm owners of people like Bill Gay, it's people in the China buying the stuff to get their own people in and take over that business. I would twist that. It's automated. Yeah, I mean, look, dude. What's the next thing that Elon's going with Tesla? Like right now, like can't you send your Tesla out to be a taxi and shit? Yeah, yeah, I heard about that. Scary shit. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, dude, it's highly possible. I mean, look, dude, getting back to the Netanyahu thing, Netanyahu and that little group of guys has shown that they'll do anything to get anything and they're tied into the world economic forum and, you know, the leadership there will sacrifice anybody to get their way. These people have shown that they will gladly kill whoever do whatever, create whatever war, whatever situation has to happen. To get what they want to get and it's definitely possible. It's definitely possible. Well, that is awesome. One of the fans made that for me, dude. That is the best. You know, I got one too. You know what it is? It's a fucking the do rag. Do rag. And that thing looks sturdy. It is. The guy who made it did a good job. I got a do rag there. I'm proud of it. Yeah, man. Guys, jumping on. Well, there's somebody who knows what's up. He said the Kazaars. Kazaar, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know what's funny? I see people say, why doesn't Andy talk about it? I'm like, bro, you don't want me to start. That was sound we got. Yeah. Like, do you have a fucking 12 hour window for a history lesson? Yeah, right. I'm just breaking it down and bite-sized chunks, motherfucker. That's right. That's right, man. But yeah, guys, let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that being said. Our third and final headline headline number three. We got to talk about it. That's just amazing. Yeah. We don't run ads on the show, but if we did, the great spring B for this amazing four-manager great smash. The great spring is pretty good. The great spring is pretty good. Andy just went black. Dude, the best fucking, that is the best sound fucking bit, clip, whatever, ever. Did I pass the test? Yep, you passed the test. Did you get that? Was reached out this? Where's my wallet? Where's my wallet? I got it right here. That's the magic of the great, baby. Stop. No, DJ. I gotta ask you something. That's amazing. I'm where I'm supposed to be right now. That fucking thing will fry your brain, bro. I was downloading the internet with everybody. All right, no, next topic. Yeah, dude. Let's get to our third and final headline, man. Something's gonna make me mad. No, no, this is good. No, it's not. It's not good. It's gonna piss you off. Cracker barrel, man. You guys are fainting place. What? They have good pancakes. I like the crispy pancakes. I love Cracker barrel. Okay. All right. You might not like it after this. So Cracker barrel unveils new simplified logo. Our story hasn't changed. Yeah, they're in trouble. They're all, bro. It is bad. They stirred up the hornets. I haven't seen them. So they fucking show. All right, so hold on. Since you haven't seen it, you've been to plenty of Cracker barrels. Of course. You've been on the road. You fucking dump into Cracker barrel. I'm playing around. I love that breakfast. What do you love about Cracker barrel? Crackers. Hold on. Not you. They're breakfast. I love the crackers too. I feel like I'm at home. Yeah. I love the name of the store. The name of the restaurant. Okay. When you walk in, they got all the shit, right? And it kind of reminds you of like grandma's house. Yeah. Right? Like they got all the rocking chairs. Then you go in. They got all the old candies. Yeah. Bro, my neck's got the grape singing from the ceiling. It's great. You were supposed to see that. So, dude, but you walk in, right? And like my great grandma. She's from Shawnee Town, Illinois. You know what that is? There's no exactly where this is. Okay. So, it's a, they had a fishing barge. She's from Shawnee, Illinois. Shawnee Town. Yeah. It's on the border of, it's right on, how river? Okay. And they had a fishing barge. All right. It's actually an incredible fucking story. But like, dude, when I walk in the Cracker barrel, I feel like I'm walking into my grandma's house, bro. Or like that time. Like it feels the same. And there's an nostalgic feeling about walking into there. And they're getting rid of all that shit, bro. I love it, bro. What? We're about to dive into it. Yeah. We're about to dive into it. Yeah. Yeah. We're about to dive into it. Yeah. We're about to dive into it. Yeah. We're about to dive into it. Yeah. Yeah. So, so Cracker barrel has debuted its new logo on Tuesday, removing the main resting, I'm sorry, the man resting on a barrel for the first time in 48 years that the logo only features text. The old country store opened in 1969 with the text only logo before adding the iconic image of the man sitting against the barrel. I was in 1977. So here's the OG logo. Everybody's familiar with this. Yeah, that's the best logo of all time. It's fucking classic, bro. This is the new logo. It looks like it looks exactly like Golden Corral's logo. Yeah. Look at it. Yeah. It's like it's, you know, the crazy. Gay. This is gay. Bro, they probably paid whoever fucking designed that they he probably got paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to come in and consult and fucking. Oh, wait, wait. Why did they do this? Well, let's talk. Hold on. This is like a, this is like a, yeah, just show the picture to lady. Okay. You'll know why. You ready? He's just missing the fucking blue hair. No, bro. She's a dude. No. That's a dude, man. That's a fucking sturdy chin. What is going on here? Oh, yeah, bro. Oh, my God. Yeah, you got that sturdy chin. So cracker barrel is no longer cracker barrels. What you're telling me? Well, I mean, what's cracker barrel without the crackers, bro? That's right. Bro, the barrel and the dude is like his story. It's in. You turned the Washington Redskins into the Washington football team. What? No. They fucking turned it into the Washington commander. Now it's that. All right. So let's make sense of this. We take an iconic Native American warrior that Native Americans are proud of. And then we replace it because it's offensive with the mother fuckers that killed them. Fuck, put that hat back on. Fuck. And that's more politically correct than he just nailed that mother. Flip that. Yeah. Same thing with taking an antimimma off the fucking syrup and all that. We're just going to erase. Don't even taste the same. Nobody wants this Miller syrup. Shit. We want to add to my I'm saying how you should be. It's these when I say man, fucking white people. It is white people. It's those white people. It's. Well, I mean, but the odd your mom had things like even digging into that right? Oh, I want to answer my mom and show my house to hey, baby. So I want Uncle Ben. Yeah, I want to be what the fuck are we doing? I want Uncle Ben cooking my rock. Wait, you take. Yeah. Right. So you want you want to take odd to my mom off and replace it with the name of the place that owner. Yeah. Bro, and none of it makes sense. No. Yeah, and you're right. It is these these. This is that is the culprit. You're fucking shit up. Why is she even having in in charge of anything? Why is she in charge of cracker barrel? It gets worse. Cracker barrel should be run by a dude named Howard. A cracker. Yeah. Like a real cracker. Anyway, barrel is representative of American culture. People understand that. That's where men used to meet and play checkers and chess and shoot the shit. Like. Yes. Well, it gets worse because again, I mean, you got to touch on a little bit. You guys don't know what the inside of cracker barrel. Of course. Who's outside of cracker barrel. Right. Okay. Well, this is because along with. Don't. I don't know. I'm going to be upset because along with the brand name change, logo change. This is now the inside of a cracker barrel. Coming to you soon. They're just sort of everything in a progressive like liberal. It's a GTV. That's what the fuck this is. That she's listen. She's probably making a decision based upon I bet if you looked at their sales numbers, they probably got declining sales numbers. And it probably has to do with things other than the atmosphere is not the atmosphere that's causing the decline. I haven't been in a cracker barrel in a fucking minute, but I would bet that if people aren't going there, it has something to do with the customer experience, the quality of the food. And that's probably it. Pretty much it. Okay. Like it's not the decor or the brand or the field because that's actually the only mother fucking thing that is for sure right about cracker barrel. 100%. Well, let's listen. Let's take a break here. Don't fuck with my cracker barrel. I want to go to cracker barrel. I'm going to pass the checker board by the fire fucking place and have Sydney, sweetie fucking Serbian pancakes and American Eagle jeans. Fuck you. How about that? Yeah. I agree. I agree. I'm with it. Well, I'm going to say let's hear the CEO out. Okay. She has something to say. Oh, I bet the first was yikes. Oh, you've made. All right. She has something to say. Let's check this out. This was the CEO's remarks on this. Honestly, the feedback's been overwhelmingly positive that people like what we're doing. I'll give you another sound bite. I actually happened to be in Orlando last week with all of our managers. We bring them together and once every other year. And the number one question that I got asked Michael was how can I get a remodel? When can I get a remodel? How do I get on the list? Oh, really? So because the feedback and the buzz is so good, not only from our customers but from our team members. They want to work in a wonderful restaurant. So that's gaslight. We're doing everything for our guests and our team members. Okay. Do the Macino. It's wonderful. What's up? Pleasure to be here. Thank you. You're the fucking CEO, dumbass. What do you think they're going to say to you? Michael, straight hand also. What a bitch that dude turned out to be rough. He's like that. It was a badass fucking year of bitch. Bro, here's what I'll say. You're the CEO, dumbass. Everybody says all your ideas are good. Ask me how the fuck I know. I got to twist people's ears and shit to make them tell me that shit's bad so we can fix it. That's right. Hey, what do you think of that idea? Oh, man, it's fucking crazy. I do ever. Hey, me. Dude, that's the oldest trick in the book. Of course, you go together with them once every other year and they see you once every 24 months and you think they're going to say, yeah, your shit sucks, lady. That's right. You're not going to say that. I know what we'll say that. I will. Then fucking pocketbooks are going to say that. I'm looking up the current. Wow. Past week they've gone down. Yeah, I'm looking at it. What is that? That's fucking half percent. Huh? Yeah, that was just in one day. I dropped 10%. Yeah, well, it's just the start. Yeah, who owns cracker, bro? I know who owns it. Just guess. Black rock. That's right. Who is it? Black rock. They own every fucking. They own 15% of cracker, bro. They are. They are the majority of them. They really own every fucking course. And Larry thinks on the fucking, he's the head of the world economic form now. Really? And there's multiple videos that we've featured on the show before where Larry think it's disgusting, forcing culture, forcing companies to do what they want by withholding the funding that they need. For D.I. Yes. They put this shit in, bro, because nobody's with this shit, right? Like nobody agrees to this, but they force the company's hands by putting in those standards of whether it's getting access to more capital or other loan options. Why are we ruining everything that we grew up with? Like that was the best shit. Yeah, why are we ruining this? That's why. That's why they're ruining it. Why are there people who live in this country that are just ruining this? No, no, no, no. They hate you. They hate themselves. No, no, no, no, they hate you. They hate, they hate you. They hate me. They hate people that look like us and speak like us and talk like us and believe it won't believe you. They do not want American people like us. You say they, who are you talking about when you say they? When I say they, I'm talking about the government. Yeah, no shit. Yeah, that is what I'm talking about. Okay, but I'm talking about it's higher than the government. Yeah. I mean, we're talking about the world economic forum trying to create a global government and to create a global government, you have to remove national identity. To remove national identity, you have to change national culture. To change national culture, you have to erase all of the things that make us us. I hate when they say there's no such thing as like American culture. I just want to fucking head butt people in that way. Yeah, well, maybe if you ever heard of a fucking Daytona 500 motherfucker. Yeah. You ever heard of Walmart bitch? You're like, you do Kyle. What the fuck? Let's see what the chat guy did on this. We are the baddest motherfuckers that walk the earth. Let me tell you something, buddy. Listen here, buddy, opal. Let me show you guys. Bro, there's that meme. It's like white people have a have a derogatory name for other white people. It's buddy. Yeah, she's some chief buddy guy, pal. I've had it up to here with it. Yeah, listen here, buddy. You hear that? Come on, white dudes mouth. You better pay attention. Yeah, that's why people shit. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's a nice salad you got there, Bob. Thanks. That's the white people. And it's okay. It's fine. It's right. It's right. Yeah, it's right. Can we get the black people shit sound? Can you do it real quick? Yeah. What's the black people sound, Adam? Right here. Hey, hey, hey. Why don't they just put a new battery in it? You can't hear it. I can't hear it. It's the sense of that. Oh, man. Yeah, man, guys, tell us what you guys think about this, man. It's kind of suck, man. Because you know, brother, there's a cracker barrel right off by my house. There's one right here. Cross street. Yeah, I go to the one by my house. Where's the one by your house? Oh, man, right. Bottom there. Yep. And you know, we don't go there all the time. You went there last night? No, no, no, no, no. What you get? Oh, that is the fucking shit, bro. Oh, no. It sucked. Well, see, there you go. That's why that's why they're sales are now you waited an hour. Their food was bad. Yeah, we don't need HGTV and the fucking cracker, bro. They need the bro. You need Gordon Ramsay coming in and beat some people up in the kitchen. That's it. Yeah, that's it. Make some idiot sandwiches. Yeah. It'd be fine. Yeah, guys, let's go down to the comments. What you guys think? Bro, it's Paul. It's Paul. Paul Corden in the fucking Paul here. Paul Corden. Paul Corden. Yeah, I bet I made sure he. He has VIP right? Yeah, he has VIP access. Come on, Paul. Say something. Get off mute, Paul. Are you putting him on? Yeah. There you go. I'm here. Paul. Paul porn. What's up, Paul? I can't believe it. I'm actually talking right now. Words. What's the word, Paul? Well, I think that everything that you mentioned and that it told just very commonly and kind of obvious that they're all Jewish. The guy Larry Fink, which is last name's probably Finklstein. And he was Jewish, banker, replacing the head of the W E F who was also Jewish. They also own Krakow Barrel and the CEO's Jewish. And it's kind of too much to just not say that it's some kind of way Jewish. I mean, how did Jews get all this shit? Facts. Hey, facts are fucking facts, bro. How did the Jews get control of everything? Well, according to them, they're better with the money with us. They're better with money. And point that they help each other and they support Israel. I mean, the guy who escaped from being a pedophile was from Israel. The district attorney who let him go was born in Israel. And she's district attorney here. And I understand that it's not all Jews, of course, but Jewishness has an element in the equation. You can't deny that. That's a fucking fact. No, that's real Paul. Yeah. Well, guess what, bro? Another car episode coming up real soon for you, buddy. I have to watch it. I have to watch it. All right. Hey, Paul, good here from you, bro. Thank you. It's great talking to you. You're really a great, amazing person. Thank you. Thank you, bro. You too. He said his last name is probably think of Stein. Fuck yeah, Paul. I mean, look, bro, listen, it's mainstream. Dude, everybody's talking about it. It's just because, dude, we just got to be smart about how it's discussed because Paul's correct. It's an undeniable reality that it is all that these are always connected to the same culture. That's still in the big scheme of things, a very small minority of that culture. Yeah. You can't say all blacks, all whites, all blues. The generalization is what gets us. That's where we need trouble with those. Yeah, bro. Well, that's, but that's where bad things happen, right? They weaponized collective thinking into mob mentality. We saw it during COVID, right? We saw how they weaponized the boomer and the leftist and fear-mongered and got everybody collectively mob mentality to come after anybody that questioned the agenda. This is no different than they do with Jews, okay? They, and I actually think there's a lot of responsible conversation happening around it because people are realizing like, that's not a good thing. Like nobody wants, you know, a genocide of whatever, right? But I'll tell you this, the biggest fear of Jewish people having massive attacks comes from their own leadership in Israel because they're willing to sacrifice their own people and the reputation of their own people and hide behind their own people. They hide their evilness and their crimes and their deceptions behind anti-semitism. And so what they're doing is they are collectivizing the Jewish people, their own leadership, which puts them all in fucking danger. And so like, you know, when you, when you want to know who's collectivizing the Jewish people, it isn't white people. It isn't black people. It isn't anti-semitics. It's their own leadership who's hiding behind them and then saying, oh, well, you don't like what I'm doing. So you hate all of these people. No, we don't. We hate you, right? You with a name and a fucking address and a role in society. And if we can identify these people as, you know, let's say out of what, 16 to 20 million people on the planet, there's probably 5,000 of these people that are fucking it up. So to say, what's 5,000, what's 5,000 divided by 16 million? What is it? What's the percentage? Oh, I'm asking when you're asking when you're motherfuckers to fucking do it. It's a public schooling. Yeah, I'm black. What was the reason, Sean? He wants you in the end. He's in jail. Okay. So you have 5,000 of the leadership class Jewish mafia. Okay. Just like the Italian mafia, just like all the organized criminals that have existed in the history of time. So you have 5,000 of these people that are working together globally. That's 0.003% of the Jewish population. So to say it's all Jews is not an accurate statement by any means. And it's a very dangerous statement. And the fact of the matter is, is there's a lot of Jewish resentment because they're starting to understand that their identity and their families are at risk because of the actions of this being fucked up by these guys. Yes. And do the best thing that could happen in the world is that the rest of the Jewish population start pointing the finger and be like, bro, fuck those motherfuckers. Yeah. Yeah, man, that's really because you can't defend the shit that they do. The deception, the subversion, the propaganda, the dismantling of culture, the pushing of migrants in all the Western countries. Dude, why is that? It's to dilute the cultures of everybody else while maintaining theirs. That's not okay, bro. I'm sorry. Have you guys ever talked about what Kanye said about some of this shit? Oh, yeah. It's he's. He had some valid point. Listen, I think my fucker's crazy, but he said some valid shit. I don't think he's crazy. I think he said that shit intentional. Look, the way I'm explaining it right now doesn't get clicks, views, or attention. Yeah. Okay. Because it's got common sense and it's true. The only way, and you know this, you're in the fucking media, the only way to truly get attention is to say shit in an outrageous way. But the problem with that is that it creates generalization and risk. And they miss the point that you're asking for. Correct. But I believe because yay knows how to use the media properly, I believe all of that shit he says is just to move the conversation, just to get the conversation going. I don't think we would be having these conversations. I think he's done that. I don't think we would even have in these conversations had it not been for the stuff that you had. And that's the other thing when I hear some of the shit he said, I'm like, I'm not supposed to agree with what he's saying because people are saying what he's saying is crazy. And he's doing it in a way that almost makes him, well, no, that does make him look seem crazy. But if you actually listen to what he's saying, it's like, oh, he's actually saying something to something here. But he's just doing it in such a way that it's like, can you take him seriously? You know what I mean? But then that's when you have to go do your own research. Well, that's where the conversation starts. It starts. It's like this. Dude, since conversation we just had, we wouldn't be having that conversation in saying crazy. Okay. So like, bro, do you see what yay said? He fucking said he loved Hitler. And you know, the conversation goes, yeah, that's crazy. But. And then people start talking about like some of the truth. Well, why would why would why would he say that he like what would he, what could he possibly love Hitler about? You know, like what could he possibly love about Hitler? He loved the fashion. And then you look into it. It's like, oh, he loved the fashion. Yeah, he loved the, how they dressed. He loved it. He loved it. Did you see he did that interview in like a black clan? Yeah, sorry. I think what a diamond bezel swastika. Yeah, I saw that. I saw that. Like unreal, but the shit he was saying, he was bitten. Well, you know that this for, for 99% of the time that the swastika has existed, it meant positivity and good fortune like in India and other countries. Still all over Indian culture. Yeah. So it doesn't mean what they have made it mean for this one motherfucker. Well, yeah, I'm against anything to do with Nazis, even that because the greatest generation of all fucking time that ever lived went over there and killed them, sons of bitches. You know what I'm saying? So it's like, yeah, they did fuckers, motherfuckers. But would they have had the internet existed then? Yeah. I don't know. Would they have if the information flow was free? Because all those guys were doing was what they were told was the right thing to do for America. Yeah, that's right. You know what I'm saying? That doesn't wait in three weeks for a newspaper update. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, that's right. There's no, the internet was created for the purpose of control without them having the foresight to realize that they didn't control the information anymore. Yeah, bro. It's crazy shit, man. Guys, jumping on the conversation down in the comments. That's not what you guys think. That being said, let's get to our final segment of the show as always. This is our thumbs up or down this fuck this where bring a headline in. This shit is awesome. We talk about it. And it gets one of those two options. So that with that being said, we talk about culture a lot on this show. That's what it is. Culture needs to be that. That's who you look like. And especially in these clips, you kind of like deck press got right there. Press got that press got. Is that a compliment? That's who you look like in that clip. And he looks like he's not going to the moon because I don't think we ever were there. We didn't go. We didn't go. That's total bullshit. We didn't go. But we talk about culture a lot and where culture should be. And you know, it's funny. We got, you know, you guys are in the same kind of generation timeline, but grew up in the time where people got punched in the face and it was what it was. And so, oh, please tell me it's the clip. I think it is. Please tell me it's the kid getting body slammed. Yes, it is. Yeah, staff member, man handles California student, Internet says he's a kid. You're an adult. No. He was being a cash. Did you see this? Yeah. That's great. Well, that's watch the clip. This clip is going viral right now. It's a mass millions of views. A lot of people's opinions on it. So let's watch the clip for those who have not seen it yet. Here it is in 4K. He's trying to reason with him. Yes, that's what this generation of kids needs right there. That kid's 120 fucking pounds and thinks he's hard as fuck because those adults cannot fucking do anything back to him. This entire generation of kids needs exactly that. If not that, bro, if you're going to, if you square up with a grown man, you're going to get treated like a grown man. That's it. That little kid, bro, you punch the teacher in a fucking face. And then we got like you're saying, we got people sympathizing with this. But this is because that because that kid acted like that because of gentle parenting. Yes. Yes. He's never been punched. He's never dealt with consequences, dude. You and I grew up where if you went to your dad, I'm not even. I'm not even a mom had a sword from that. Huh? Yeah. No, a side from that, dude. If you said the wrong thing, you might get punched in a fucking face. You're my mom. Yeah. Slap the fire out of your head. Yeah, bro. Yeah, dude. And this kid's a fucking five to a hundred. Dude, here's the truth. This is the honest to God's truth. We have to allow males to face the consequences of their violent outbursts in natural order. And the reason that has to happen is because this kid will go out in public and act like that and get killed. That is the truth. And then everyone's going to be like, oh, he was such a good kid, though. Yeah. He was a future doctor. That kid and all the kids like him need to they they're has especially for men. We cannot remove the natural pecking order of men. And that has to be done through physical confrontation. I'm sorry to all you intellectual dorks out there that think it can be done through discussion. It cannot be done through discussion. Sometimes they have to feel the force of another man's fucking hands on them so they realize not to do that to anyone else. And dude, this is the reality of natural order. You don't have lions roaming around in the jungle. And then, you know, the young lion gets out of control and the old lion says, son, don't do that. It's not nice. No, the fucking lion bites his mother fucking face off. And then the thing comes back with his head down and realizes this place in the world. You know, it's good about this video, though. It's not only did that kid learn something today, all those kids watching. Yeah. And they celebrated it. Like when that happened, the kids go crazy. I can do that. I'm going to get fucking shit. I'm going to slam on my head if I do that. Half of those kids are probably like, oh, God, he's going to get sued. Yeah. Which you probably will. Probably will. But like, dude, we got to change the rules with this. Well, here's the thing. This generation, this generation is going to be in the workforce. That means your fucking customer service is going to be terrible. These kids think they can talk to you. However, they fuck they want. No, dude, it's called the end. What about lawyers and doctors and these kids are the next fucking? How the fuck are we going to be a society? These kids are fucked. But these kids, so who's going to run shit? AI. Well, we're fucked then. Right? You know the crazy I was watching this. You know what? A movie reference I thought about seeing this was Malibu's most wanted. Oh, yeah. He was giving me Malibu's most wanted. Chaps, dig. Yeah, taps to it. I think that's it for a man. Dude, there is little kids 10 years old on video all over the internet. Squaring up to grown people, running their mouths and shit. Nope. Don't learn the date. I see you. You could teach a lot of, you could teach a lot to somebody with an open hand smack. Mm-hmm. For real. Like I'm talking about smacking them on the fucking ground. You want to embarrass a man and teach him where the fuck they belong? Oh, so where? Slap them in the face. So where? Yeah. That's the worst. They won't do shit either. Most of them. So what his dad's not teaching him at home. He just learned by some stranger at his school. He pry cried and said, oh my God, I can't believe this happened to me. They abused me at school. Cause like dude, to real talk, these kids are bitches. Mm-hmm. But you know why this happened, bro? Cause they took the old man next to the barrel off the cracker barrel. We need more grandpa's and we need the guy back on the fucking cracker barrel's line. It's right. We need to remove, we need to remove fist fighting from an arrestable offense. I go, dude, I agree. I know you do. I know you do. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. But if we remove, if we remove fist fighting as an arrestable offense, there will be natural order will be restored amongst men. Repercussions to your actions. I'm not telling the world. Now the minute you have a weapon or it's excessive or whatever, that's different. Bring back the rules. Bro, you knocked somebody out. You don't keep going. Yeah. Cool. I just want to say this. We all in here are not the tough guys in the world, but I'd much rather have a fucking little fist fight and saw a fucking difference. Not only that, what happens afterwards usually? That's gonna have a beer, bro. That's right. That's right. Cause they're, and why? We respect each other. That's right. And that's what we have going on in the country right now. We missing that element. What? Andy. This isn't the 80s and the 90s. We live in fucking pussy world now. Andy? AI is gonna run shit. I'm outta here. Hey, being you have to live longer now and guys like us. So we're running shit still, I guess. No. Bro, so thumbs up for this. Yeah, I think you should have got it way worse. Bring bet, throw punch in. Let's go. Bro, you pushed a grown man. You punched him and then you pushed him. Do you not? Now, I know that man that he pushed is not a big man. But do you know what kind of restraint he had to have to not do anything back? That man that that man would whoop that kid's mother fucking ass. I don't give a fuck. How so? And he's being like, look, he's like he's trying to be civil. You got the crowd behind him. Sometimes the best thing you can do is push the weakest push ass. Bro, you're done. Bye bye. Night night. Bro, I love it. I love it. More of that. Exactly. Bro, listen, when I was in high school, all right. So when I was in high school, dude, when I was a freshman, all right, we had these two dudes in our high school that were both bad ass motherfuckers. I was a freshman. They were juniors or seniors. And like two of the toughest dudes in our school, I'll never forget it, bro. One of them was his name was Dave Truman. And the other one, his name was Chris Colleton, okay? And they got this fucking fist fight literally three feet in front of me. And like these are the two biggest toughest dudes in our school. I can blood everywhere. Like I'm talking a fucking fight. Our teachers, two of their men teachers jumped in and beat their fucking asses. And after that, bro, you know what? I didn't talk back to those teachers. Dude, one of those teachers, it's Tim Reigns dad. No, no shit. Yeah. Paul Reigns, like 75 years old now, I'm gonna tell you what, if he said shut the fuck up, I'll shut the fuck up. Yeah, I'm saying. Like, dude, that was the things that happened. When we were in school and like nobody called the police, nobody said like it is what it is. And you know what? Those two dudes, they calm down too. There was no more of that. You know what I mean? Oh, man, that's not so serious. You know what the craziest thing is? That's how we used to handle things. Yeah. Fighting with our friends, shit like that, guys talking shit, whatever. And look, we all live. Yeah. And we're all actually better men for it. That's right. Well, that's the thing, man. Like we're capable of violence. We have to just learn how to control that. Like that's what these scenarios allow us to do. And to learn those fucking those lessons. You know what I'm saying? And learn if you really care about what you want to say and learn how to defend it. Or you might, you know, maybe it's not that important. It's a valuable lesson in life. Super vital. It's super vital. You got to know where the line is. Yeah. You got to know where the line is because dude, especially for these kids who are growing up in a society where it's not about, hold on. What's all this? It's tiny, no, it's not. Dude, these kids are such fucking pussies. No, I'm being serious, bro. That lie of me. There's such pussies because they've never been exposed to actual repercussions of any sort of violence that they automatically go to weapons and guns and shit like this. So like dude, that kid right there, if he acts like that and out in the world with somebody close to his age, like back in our day, we, we, the worst thing we thought would be, all right, we're gonna fucking throw down. But now dude, like, you don't know to shoot him. Yeah, right. You know, yeah, man. Guys, we got thumbs up on this. I said thumbs up. Yeah, 100% two thumbs up. Yeah, I agree. Two. Yeah, 100%. Man, well guys, Andy Adam. Hey, thanks for having me, man. This is awesome. Yeah, bro. Thanks for coming in, dude. You have to come back, man. I was so in love, too. Thank you, guys. All right, guys, that's the show. Don't be a hoe. Shoot the show. Got a own bank road. Can't fold. Just a note here. Shot case. Closed.
