out yeah he invited us to go to to a show tonight so I think we're maybe go to that oh sweet yeah oh that'd be sick yeah yeah yeah we're talking to him he's like man this is awesome he's like five years ago it's built houses yeah sweet man that's awesome dude what a very very cool dude yeah well let's make some people better today guys Andy question number one uh hey Andy I work in the automotive industry wrapping cars installing ppf specifically uh I've recently been asked to manage a massive shop that I was previously let go from due to the shop not being profitable in the past I was just an installer but showed that I have the qualities and passion to turn the shop around my new position will be a general manager position while still also installing my salary right now is around a hundred and twenty a year I know taking on this new position will be a lot more work and with that comes headaches and responsibilities that I didn't have before the struggle I'm having is coming up with a number or salary to propose to the owner I was wondering if you have any insight on that how do you how do you measure your value of worth and dollars how do you do that well you know there's a right way and then there's the way um that everybody else does it which isn't the right way uh most people just make up a number and say this is what I'm worth um five but billion dollars yes and that's what they do and they and I'm just giving you the the owners perspective you know people see things on the internet they hear things from people on the internet they talk to their friends their friends all lie about how much money they make they come in they say I need this and they get laughed out of the room okay because there's a reality to what jobs pay because contrary to what people understand is that there is a budget on the back end where it has to make financial sense you know a lot of people think that there's like a money tree in the back of every business that you just go pick dollars off of and hand them out that's not how it works it has to fit in the puzzle of uh you know a responsible financial budget and so uh you know just making up shit based upon what your friends say or what you know that might work for a company that doesn't really know what's going on uh but it won't work with a legitimate company um they're gonna want to know there's gonna be a budget that is available for the position that you are in and uh then there's gonna be incentives for you to grow and you know if you're gonna come in and say hey this is what it is that I'm worth you're gonna have to show that you've been paid that before what you've done before you're gonna have to have a documented you're gonna have to show that you did these things that you said you did especially when you're talking about salaries that are in the six figures so um the best thing that you could do is you can document all the things that you've done all the things that you've done well uh in fact I would be transparent about the things you did wrong too and how you learn the lesson because to an owner that that shows that hey uh this person's being honest they're telling the truth they're explaining how they learn to do certain things and I appreciate that because that's how I learned how to do everything um there's awareness there yeah for sure and and there's also uh courage there right because it doesn't always you know people don't want to tell you the things that they did wrong they're afraid that if they tell you the things that they did wrong that you're somehow not going to be interested in them and I actually think that whenever they tell you the things that they did wrong and they say this is what I learned from that I think that's a plus not a minus um so when it comes to coming up with a number you know all of these things go into play uh it's also very similar when you go for a raise you know a lot of people think that because they were somewhere for a certain amount of time that they do a raise yes there's companies that operate like that but they're going to give you a raise of like fucking 2% a cost of living adjustment you're not going to change your entire existence the people that are listening to this show are looking to scale up their lives in a meaningful way so when you go get a raise I'm assuming you're going to want more than 2% so how are you going to do that well you're going to make sure one that you're effective at what you do now what are you doing now are you the best of what you do now are you producing the best results of what you do now because a lot of people feel like that what's what happens is is they're going to get at some place and they're going to be there for a long enough time and then eventually the manager or the leader or the boss or whoever is going to come up and say hey I need someone to do this and then all of a sudden you're going to magically turn the switch on because the opportunities there which is the backwards way of thinking how it really needs to be set up is you're executing at a high level now you're kicking ass now you're doing better than everybody now and you're staying hot meaning you're operating at that level all the time so that when these situations for you to progress come up in conversation in the boss's office you're the automatic person that's mentioned first now how do you ask for the money well you do the same thing you do when you're going for a new job you say this is what I've done here's where I've contributed here's the statistical data that shows what I've done and you have to figure out how you're going to show that and document that that's on you that's not on the company so you you make a list here here here here here here this is what I did and by the way these are things that you've done at a high level these are not things that you're automatically paid to do already a lot of people especially younger people will if I said hey make a list of the things that you've done they would put something on there like I've never been late to work well no shit you're not supposed to be right I work really hard when I'm here no shit you're supposed to those are things that you're already paid to do so you have to be careful not to put down things that are normal expectations of your current role and then pretend like there's some sort of bonus because they're not and the if you go into the wrong manager who doesn't give a fuck about you and won't sit you down and explain this to you they're just going to look at you like you're an idiot and they're going to assume you're an idiot forever and they're going to say this guy's going to wash out so the point of this is documenting making a case making it relative to what makes financial sense for the company and where it fits and sometimes it doesn't sometimes you outgrow companies sometimes you you do everything right and there is no upward mobility for you to have and that's where you go to a new company and you start there with that skill set and you have to document what you did at the old company and by the way the old company has to agree that you did these things because the new company's going to call them and say hey did they do these things so you can't lie you can't cheat you can't make it up and a lot of these younger kids now they think they can go from company to company to company to company to company and just make shit up we see it all the time bro people try to apply here they're like I was making four hundred thousand dollars over there okay well let me see your W2 oh well I can't show you that you see what I'm saying like there's a lot of a lot of these young kids think they're fucking really smart and they don't understand how these things are checked and balanced on the backside so make a list well first of all perform at a high level stay at high level make a list of what the fuck it is that you've done and then have a negotiation with the party that's what it is and you know like you you say oh you're making a hundred and twenty for installing wraps on a car if it like really because like if you walked into me and said that that you made that for installing wraps on a car I'd fucking know that was bullshit you know how I know that's bullshit because my wife used to fucking run that company that put wraps on cars so you just sat down and wrote me an email where I know for a fucking fact that you're not getting paid a hundred and twenty grand to put wraps on cars how do you think do you knew did you know that I hold on did you know that I would know that right do you know how I met my wife I met my wife because she wrapped they wrapped my car and I couldn't fucking pay the bill so you didn't know that I know that you see what I'm saying don't fucking lie I'm promise you you're lying let me actually this because this is another portion of this too man I feel like there's also this weird if I fucking went and checked that person's W-2 a hundred percent they're fucking making that up yeah I mean it does sound like a shit kind of money to be wrapped up everybody out here lies about what they make dude this is why you can't listen to your friends this is why if you're a social media influencer you ever notice how all the social media influencers are making a million dollars opposed it's bullshit yeah and if you walk into a situation asking for that that company who knows right is gonna say well fuck this person they're they're delusional they're gonna be hard to work with I don't want to deal with that shit and you're not gonna get the opportunity that work yeah let me actually that feel like there's another weird uh I don't know if it's a false expectation um that that happens in the workplace where it's like you know who is the honest on the employee or the employer to initiate those conversations you know well about raises and stuff oh well look listen I think it depends I you know there's been plenty of situations over the years where I've seen someone just kick and ask and not say nothing yeah and they don't say anything so then I have to I have to sit them down and say all right look man here's how you do this do you do you want to make more money yeah you do right right okay well do you think I'm gonna give you any more money if you don't fucking ask right okay so I sit down and have that conversation because look dude I want my people to move upward in life that's why I still do this that's why I come in here every day I want all these people and that's why when you support our companies you got to know you're supporting good shit because I don't need to be in here I don't need to do this shit no more I already paid my fucking dues I'm financially where I need to be everything for me is good I want these people to progress and when people come in and they kick ass and they do good sometimes they're afraid to have conversations about money because their parents or or or their teachers or their answer or uncles they always taught them these these things don't talk about politics don't talk about religion and don't talk about money and if you don't learn to talk about money in an effective way you're not going to make very much of it so you have to get comfortable having conversations with people about money or they're going to keep it from you forever so what I'll do as a owner or a manager whatever I don't do this anymore because I'm not involved in day to day like that but um I would sit down with someone and I would say hey what are you doing you're doing a good job man I see I see you bust in your ass what are you trying to do where are you trying to go well you know I'd really like to do what are you doing to get there what do you think about your pay why I'd like to earn more money well you're doing a good job you're doing great are you doing the best that you did what were you gonna ask you right right you see what I'm saying right um so there's situations like that where people don't want to ask and then there's situations where people will say they'll say hey you know um here's what I did you know and here's what I've done I've done this and this and this and that's a conversation um and then there's a third people who always think they deserve a raise no matter what you know yeah bro they don't and those people just don't stick anywhere you know those are the people that went from here to here to here and then you say why'd you leave wasn't enough money we don't get enough money at an entry level position bro that's why it's called entry level you know what I mean you know shit man yeah I love it uh guys any question number two uh hi Andy first I want to say thank you to you uh DJ the whole real AF crew my questions day is how do I lead discipline and mentor those that were once my mentors uh to give a bit of background I work for a public agency maintaining public infrastructure and utilities the type of work comes with a lot of institutional knowledge they get handed down over the years I started in this industry when I was 17 years old now it has been my career for the last 16 years I started at the bottom as a temporary laborer and have worked my way into a leadership position where a good amount of my employees were once my mentors these guys not only taught me everything I know in the industry but have helped lift me up to the position I'm in now these guys have been to my wedding that my family my kids and I consider them uh some of them like brothers I take a lot of pride in our team and the culture we have built and as time goes on through in generations collide I'm beginning to see conflict uh between the new up and comers and the old dogs that came up with some of these situations require a shift in my leadership style while others have required some discipline on both sides I always find it harder to discipline the people that were once my peers uh then the guys who have only known me in my current role also find it harder to get these same peers to follow along when I make the change in the direction that that their group is heading any advice would be appreciated god bless america all right look uh yeah that's a difficult situation you know um when I started my business I was 19 years old um for that first 10 12 years I was employing people that were older than me and people for some reason when they're older than you much less when they actually taught you what you know our resistant to younger people running uh or leading the situation unless the person leading is so much better and so great at what they do that it is undeniable okay so if you are so great at what you do and you are so skilled at what you do and you are that much better than everybody else at what you do leading usually isn't a problem even if the people are older so the first piece of advice that I would give you is to distance yourself from them in your skill set as far as possible meaning be so much better than them that they understand they have to listen to you when you say shit okay that's the first thing the second thing is to understand that most human beings understand the dynamic of a workplace and because this is your first time really leading people like this you have personal hangups that aren't necessarily real hangups out in the real world it's your own internal uh I don't want to say insecurities but we'll just say hangups you think that because these people helped you that you are incapable of leading them because they're just going to like laugh you off well that's your own hesitation that's in your own mind can do this Joe might say this exactly because every person that is there in that environment understand that there's a chain of command and that things have to be followed in a certain order they understand that somebody's got to call the play and then the play has to be run every single employee that is employed across the country and every single fucking job has a basic understanding of this flow down system of here's the play to run I got to run the play here's how we make the fries I got to make the fries that way you see what I'm saying everybody understands that so to be hung up on that in your own mind just because you're younger than everybody is in irrational hangup all right they all understand you're the leader you're going to call the plays now getting them to run the play that's going to come down to the first point that I said the better you are than them at what they do in terms of like understanding how to do their job what's going on how skill set you are and by the way the better track record you get at leading them down the pipe into the right position where the team wins the more confidence that they're going to gain in your ability to lead which means you're going to have less resistance when it comes to calling the play that they need to run so a lot of this has to do with you earning their respect with you being great at what you do with you not being an apathetic or lazy leader and I think the age thing is a very irrational hangup that a lot of young people have that can be cured by very simply just being very good at what you do not flexing leadership where it doesn't need to be flexed you know you said you went these guys are in your weddings and shit like that look bro I got guys that work for me that were in my wedding when we're here at the office they understand when I'm at their house drinking beer I'm not telling them to get me a fucking beer you know I'm saying like I'm getting the fuck up and I'm saying hey can I do anything can I get you something you know and so we we balance out our roles at different areas when they're appropriate and the saying of you know you can't be friends with people that you manage or people you work with yeah if you're a weak leader if you're a great leader and you're a servant leader you're all gonna love each other not all the time but most of time because you're gonna understand that your intent is to get the team to win and that's another thing that you have to earn the respect up because a lot of leaders you have to remember that a lot of these people that you're trying to lead have worked for shitty leaders before who are selfish who want their own name in the headlines and they're really all about themselves and they they've never worked for a leader that actually cares about their their progress or their team when and when you when they know that you care about those things more than you care about like just getting the credit or whatever they're going to fight for you dude they're going to go to war for you and when they know that you put their interest in front of your interest they're going to go to war for you when they know that you are going to put the team's win in front a year-old person a win they're going to go to war for for you. The problem is is that most leaders and managers don't have the discipline to do that. They want all the credit, they want all the money, they want all the fucking claps and cheers and all this shit. When none of that's relevant, bro, when you're a leader, your job is to take responsibility when things go wrong and give credit when things go right. And if you can understand that, that will take you most of the way. The rest of the way will be gained by you being great at what you do and respecting people and having the right intent for them. And if you can put all those things together, you'll be an effective leader. I don't think the age thing is even an issue. I think that's a bullshit issue. There's all kinds of examples of this. And all cop, do you think Patrick Mahomes is shitty leader? He's the youngest fucking guy on the fucking team. You know why people listen to him? Because he's fucking great at what he does and he respects the rest of the team. I want everybody to win. He wants to win. And everybody wins because he wants to win for the team. Right? These are the leaders, bro. And Patrick is one of the youngest guys on the team still. So you understand what I'm saying? It doesn't matter about age, bro. It matters about all these other things we're talking about. Let me actually, I do agree with you. I feel like there definitely is that preconceived notion that it's going to be this thing. This if I do want to actually this on this culture aspect because he is bringing in, there's new people coming in. They only know him as the leader. What if a situation does arise where one of your old guys, there's a challenge publicly in front of the new people. How do you handle that conflict? I can definitely see that being a potential thing. Where you're getting a little pushback from the one of the old schools in front of one of the new schools. That could be a toxic. Well, first of all, if you have led your team the right way and you've built rapport the right way, your older guys are going to know not to do that in public, but it's okay to do it in private. I don't care what someone says to me. I've had employees tell me, I'm in the biggest piece of shit and we can argue straight up, fucking fuck you arguments in the office. And then we comment down and we go out there and we act like everything's normal and we get back to fucking doing our thing. I don't give a fuck what people say to me. If they want to vent to me, they want to fucking whatever. But if you do it in front of people, we're going to have fucking problem. And you as the leader have to respect that about them too. You don't go embarrass them in front of everybody else. They want to embarrass you in front of anybody else. And if they do embarrass you in front of the young people, that's where you don't react. You pull them in the office. You say, hey, look dude, we've been working together for a long time. All right. Steve over here is brand new. You just create a scenario that we're going to have to fix with him because he just saw this and this and this because if you're lack of discipline. Now, you know, from working with me, I don't give a fuck what you say to me, dude. You bring me in the office. You fucking tell me I'm whatever. We'll work it out. But if you do that in front of that guy, not only are you hurting my ability to lead, but you're hurting your own ability to grow the company, which is going to hurt your career long term because now we have a guy who's not bought in the way that he should be bought in because you just did that in public because you lack your discipline to control your emotions. So there's a lesson there, right? So then we fix that lesson and we move forward. So yeah, bro, but those things do happen. But you know, they happen. I would say 90% out of inexperience and lack of discipline to control emotions and 10% out of maliciousness. Now, if it happens out of maliciousness, that's cancerous and that's where you have to make changes. You can't allow that shit to happen. I love it. Does that make sense? That makes perfect sense. Yeah. If Steve ever tries, shut the fuck up, Steve. Well, you know, and then and then dude, if you've trained, if you've built the proper rapport with your team and the proper culture, those older guys that have been in a while are going to like when that young guy culture is self-regulating. Like that's what people don't understand. It is a living, breathing thing that your business creates and you create intentionally. And this is what we will talk about. You know, we talk about this in Arte. We'll talk about this on MSCO at some level. But you are creating a system of how things are done automatically. And when you create the proper culture, one of these guys who's a veteran with you, they're going to go to the young guy and say, Hey, don't fucking do that. Here's why. And they're going to they're going to correct these scenarios. Yeah, I love it. I love it. Guys, Andy, let's get to our third and find a question. Let's flip this from you ever been you ever you ever been like when you went to play college football, right? When you first showed up for day one, the coach didn't stand there and say, Hey, this is the way we're doing all this shit, right? The practice just started and you fucking were like, I don't know what the fuck you do, right? And other dudes would come over and be like, Hey, my fuck, this is what we do here. Hey, this is what we do here. Hey, you better run hard here. Hey, now we're going to do gasses. You got to do it this way, right? Absolutely. Now we go to this station. Now we go to that station. Now we go eat. Like you had other guys on the team tell you the coach didn't tell you they the other guys told you. That's how the culture works. You see what I'm saying? 100%. 100%. Guys, let's get to our third and find a question. Question number three. Let's flip this a little bit from somebody who is being led. Let's focus on this. This is a really good question here. Question number three. Hey, Andy, I am a 28-year-old entrepreneur in a small 30-ish employee's size company. Now listen to your show for a few years. Thanks to Dan Holloway for introducing me to the show. Since joining this new company a little less than a year ago, I've noticed that there are a few who understand the mission and are willing to go the extra mile. And then there are those who just punch a clock and really couldn't care less if we excel as a company or not. For me, I know that what I do every day affects 30 individuals, families and lifestyles, let alone my own. My question is as someone who is not an a leadership role, how do I get people to help row the boat? Basically, how do I get people to care about the work they are doing? I want to win and I need those around me to buy in for us to succeed. Thank you. Okay, so what you're talking about here is peer-to-peer leadership, which is actually probably the purest form of leadership because there's no title associated to it and people don't quote unquote, half to listen to you. So if someone, and this goes for if you own a company, if you have a great peer-to-peer leader, that motherfucker is going to be a rock star when you give him the quote unquote position to lead. All right, so becoming an effective peer-to-peer leader is one of the most effective and valuable skills that you can create because what you're actually doing is creating another you by your leadership ability. And dude, there's three to four main valuable skills that people get paid big money for. One is selling. If you sell, you're going to pay the most money. The second is managing. If you can manage a team, you're going to get paid money. The third is initiative. If you can creatively come up with a solution, see it through to it from beginning to end without having to talk to anybody about it, that person's going to get paid a lot of money. And the fourth person that's going to get paid a lot of money is someone who can replicate themselves in a leadership position. So if you're a great leader and you could fucking create someone over here who is also a great leader through your example and you can replicate that. That's extremely valuable. You can write your own check. All right. So how do we do that? Well, it's very simple. It's actually the simplest form of leading to. You've got to be amazing in what you do. You've got to operate a high standard all the time. There can be no holes in your game. And then you have to fucking call people out when they're not at the at the level that they need to be. And that doesn't mean, hey, fuck you. You're doing a shitty job. Sometimes it may mean that. But what it actually means is, hey, man, look, bro, I know, I know you're capable of more. And by you not doing this, you're not just hurting yourself. You're hurting me. And I've got a family. And you're hurting Tony over there. He's got two new kids. Okay. You're hurting Stacey over here. She's got a family. By you not doing what you can do, look what's happening to the rest of the team. That's not good, man. I need you to fucking get with me. And let's go fucking win. You want to win, right? So then it's more of that kind of conversation on a consistent level. And I think that's a constant conversation that has to be had and appeared appear environment. You know, you kind of have to set the pace and you kind of got to call everybody else up to it. And that comes from your performance. It comes from you doing things a certain way. And, you know, if you have a smart leadership team above you, they're going to recognize you for what you're doing at that level. And then other people are going to want to follow. So, you know, there's a whole, there's books on this. There's a book on this called 360 leadership. There's a lot of different books on leadership that that teach peer to peer leadership. But at the end of the day, leadership is very simple. It's doing what the task is supposed to be done at a high level. And then it's getting other people to do it with you. And that's it, man. So how do you do that? Some people do that by yelling at people. I found that to not be the most effective way. Now, sometimes when there's high urgency and things are on the line and let's say, you know, like back when the company was smaller and we were within 30 days of going out of business for fucking 10 years straight. Yeah, sometimes it got fucking hot. And it's like, Hey, motherfucker, you fucking do this. You're fucking out of here. Right? The most effective way to lead? No. Does it get the fucking job done in a pinch? Yes. I would consider something like we're in a firefight and fucking me and you. And I'm like, Hey, fucking go over there. And you you're going over there right now. We're going to get killed. Right. That's what that's a bullet. It's fine. Why you could. I don't like the fuck over there, bro. We're going to get fucking killed. Right. See what I'm saying? That's that's how it is when things are more urgent. And when you get in a little less urgent of a scenario, you know, you could soften that a little bit. But the boundary still has to be hard and it has to be this is what the expectation is. And I think the main thing that leaders do that really discount their own credit credibility with people is that they don't operate on the standard that they try to hold everybody else to. And they think they can fool people. They think they can they can people don't see them, you know, taking the shortcut or taking that playoff or, you know, coming in and fucking, you know, 11 when everybody else is there a fucking eight, right? Like they don't people see that and you can't hide it. And when people fucking see all that shit, it reduces the amount of credibility that you have with them. So when you're a leader, you got to understand, bro, that it's got to be real. You have to perform at a high level. You have to be effective and you have to teach these other people how to do it. Leading is more about teaching than it is about fucking like demanding. You know what I mean? It's more of a show. It's it's it's more of an education. Yeah. You know, hey, I think a lot of leaders get in trouble because they assume that the reason that and by the way, when I say a lot of leaders, I'm also saying myself, I for a long time assumed that the reason that people didn't do things was because they were lazy. Okay. And really the honest truth is is that it's not most of the time that people are lazy. That's just an immature leader. I was a very immature leader for a long time. Well, you start to figure out as you get older as everybody wants to do better. Most people do want to win. Most people do want to be on a winning team. And yeah, there's a lot of losers out there, but your job is to get away from him into an environment where you want to win. And um, you know, when you when you get around winners, lazy'sness isn't the problem. Lack of skill is the problem. So you have to transition your mentality from assuming that everybody's just lazy to they want to win, but they don't have the skills to win. So then you become a teacher. You see what I'm saying? I love it. Yeah, I absolutely love it. Man, guys, Andy, that's a Monday, man. Yep. Let's go out. Let's kick some ass. And we'll see you with CTI tomorrow. Cankful. There's a note here. Shot case.
