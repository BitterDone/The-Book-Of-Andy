I just wanted to address it put in the right spot That's a good spot. All right Well, let's keep it moving because I got another dumbass of the day Uh, this one goes said. I don't even know how to pronounce his name. It's a it's a weird one um This guy he's a NBC uh Journalist, okay, and he was cool. Her. Yes. What a total. Yeah for sure He's named Dan Killinian or something like that some weird ypc but um He's doing a live report at the supreme court building, right and let's just let's just watch this Because by not agreeing to take it up when jack smith first asked them to do so on an emergency basis And then by not taking it on an expedited basis sort of taking it under regular order here They've already created and a significant delay here that means that this election case however they rule Uh can't go to trial probably before the fall and now we come to exactly what they're considering here Which is the question of whether a president has absolute immunity Uh, and then there's a second Which is whether anything that Donald Trump is accused of would actually constitute a president a presidential act Implicated in the news your fake news Just making sure you're okay. Do you need is everything okay? We hear someone yeah, it's fine. We have a heckler here I've got to say they obviously have been following the David Pecker testimony they're yelling fake news And they obviously want viewers to know the Donald Trump lied about JFK assassination tried to blame uh blame Ted Cruz Delberts got some to say huh Bro, but how does he spin it to talking about JFK's Emission that just shows you what these guys do. Oh, he's like whenever the guy's with the guy said fuck Joe Biden Everybody started chanting fuck Joe Biden and the guys like Let's go Brandon and then they're like oh, they're chanting for Biden Oh, they're yelling fake news. That means Trump's a liar. I think I think dumbass of the day just goes to the entire mess NBC bro all three of them they're all criminals too. They've all lied They've all they've all given out false information that false information that's hurt people It's killed people. It's it's made family suffer. It's When you go back to what happened in the pandemic these people were guilty of crimes against humanity. 100 real talk 100% This dude looks like he could be in a room With one of the person shit his pants and lie about it. Yeah He looks like he's shit his pants are ready with that fucking smug ass face Look at his face he looks like man. I just took a shit nutty all know The fuck he looks like All right, yep, all right guys. Let's get into the cruise Dilbert's my least favorite media. You don't like dobert MS. What's that guy's name? Well, this is no that not that guy other guy anchor guy. Yes. Yeah Fuck that guy does not he look like a fucking cartoon character. Yeah, he does. I could see that You looks like a fucking cartoon character. It's like a newspaper Made this dude in a pod and said we're gonna make a news anchor Who's a douchebag? Give me a little bit more news They fucking maxed it out on this dude bro. They turned it all the way up there in the red. Yeah All right, all right. Well, let's do the shit. Let's get into it guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos Go to Andy for solid icon guys and find them linked there with that being said Let's get into our first headline. Let's do it headlight number one headlight of worn reads trump attorney Supreme court justice clash on whether a president who ordered a coup can be prosecuted This is an interesting one, but I'm gonna preface this right now guys. Listen. This is not the story of the day All right, this is what they want you to think is the story of the day, but I got that coming for you um Let's dive into this a little bit. So An attorney right now, Donald Trump's uh, his lawyers are battling in the supreme court right now Um over a presidential immunity and what are the limits of presidential immunity, right? Um, so in attorney the article reads an attorney for former president of Donald Trump and the presidential immunity hearing clashed With supreme court justice, Alina Kagan over a hypothetical question on whether a president who ordered a coup could be prosecuted uh quote if it's an official act there needs to be impeachment and conviction beforehand Trump's attorney john sawer argued Thursday before the supreme court which is being broadcast publicly via audio only Well, that's our statement Was in response to justice, Alina Kagan's hypothetical question asking if a president who is no longer in office Directing the military to stage a coup would constitute an official act quote he's no longer president. He wasn't impeached. He couldn't be impeached But he ordered the military to stage a coup and you're saying that's an official act, Kagan asked Quote, I think it would depend on the circumstances whether it was an official act If it were an official act again, he would have to be impeached sour responded Quote, what does that mean depend on the circumstances? He was the president He is the commander in chief. He talks to his generals all the time and he told the generals I don't feel like leaving office I want to stage a coup is that immune from prosecution Kagan pressed sour responded It would depend on the circumstances of whether there was an official act If the hypothetical quote uh president would be immune from prosecution Uh quote that answer sounds to me as though it's like yeah under my test It's an official act but that sure sounds bad doesn't it Kagan uh said To which this and this I like this statement from sour um he says quote the uh that's why the framers have a whole series of structural checks They have successfully for the last 234 years prevented that very kind of extreme hypothetical And that is the wisdom of the framers Uh what they viewed as the risk that needed to be guarded against was not the notion that the president might escape You know a criminal prosecution or for something you know sort of very very unlikely in these unlikely Um to which uh Kagan responded the framers did not put an immunity clause into the constitution They knew uh how they were immunity clauses in some state constitutions They knew how to give legislative immunity They didn't provide immunity to the president and you know not so surprising They were reacting against a monarch who claimed to be above the law Wasn't the whole point that the president was not a monarch and the president was not supposed to be above the law Now I would love to hear your thoughts. I just quickly want to say you know I think what they're actually what's actually happening here is a kind of foreshadowing the The precedence that's going to be set going towards Joe Biden. Yeah, I agree Because that's how I'm taking it. Yeah because I know we all know and I've been saying this for years and years and so is DJ that When when Trump gets back in office if he is who he says he is Okay, if he does what he says he's going to do which we don't know Because he's already said he was gonna arrest Hillary and do all this shit when he was in there the first time Which he didn't do which I understand because The media would have crucified him and and the the social dynamic at that time was very much Still asleep with the mainstream media right now. We live in this scenario just a few years later Where lots of people are suffering a lot of people are waking up sure There's still people that want to be right so they're hanging on to their opinion for their whole life They're not objectively looking at that playing field to see what's going on And so you know, but a lot a lot a lot more people are citing with Trump And if Trump is who he says he is Which he may not be He will put these motherfuckers in jail at a minimum right And so what I see this as is just what you said I see this as they're trying to set a precedent for When the discovery comes out about what Joe Biden's done and what these people have done that they get some sort of immunity for And there's no fucking immunity for staging a coup Okay, that is hanging that's the immunity that you get so I think that there's two things right because like my thoughts on the whole coup situation is that you know Who determines if a coup was necessary who determines because this country was technically founded on a coup right Like we we took over this well it all depends who stays in power exactly. That's my point Yeah, and so I think that's the important thing to ask and it's like when you look at it And I also think more importantly is the will of the people yeah, it's the will of the people It's not these judges. Yeah, it's not no fucking congressman in DC Because in any given time bro these people could go up there and get rid of these people exactly It's the will of the people the people determined yeah, if it's okay or not Right and we've been okay for the last 200 and some odd years and we've decided that it was that last coup was important to do And it was it was okay and we the people willed that into action And so I think we're coming to a very interesting point where it's like you know the people who call it that Do they have any actual bases for it? And I think you know if they call Trump taking you know getting duly elected as another coup That is what they're gonna call that's what they're gonna try to call it and I'm okay with that well It's absurd. It's absurd shit and I think what we're gonna find out Is that the coup actually happened in the 60s with JFK's assassination and ever since then we've had a banana republic That's been hidden very well and over the course of time they have played The left then the right the left and then the right and they've done that to keep people Under this illusion. Yes under the illusion now. We live in some sort of actual Republic and democracy which I'm starting to believe that we don't and a lot of people will say Well, that's why I don't want to vote well listen dumbass if you don't vote there's no evidence that There was a coup so Regardless if you think so and so is a perfect candidate It's very important that you go vote for who you think is the best even if you think the best is still shitty Because if we don't have the votes to count we can't prove the cheating that's being done So it's very important that you guys and it's not some moral shit Um, refusing to vote because I believe in some impersonal autonomy and this and that okay good That sounds nice right we all understand that we're free individuals We're sovereign individuals we're who the fuck we are, but that's not reality The reality is is the government dictates at this point in time your entire social environment and your entire life And you could stick your head in the stand and you could pretend that's not the way it is but it is the way it is because of the egregious encroachment on individual rights that has happened over the last hundred plus years It's gone slow slow slow slow slow almost imperceptible and also the overbearing tax burden that has been creeped in on the citizens Okay, and when you when you think about how this has gone down It's it's hard to believe and it's hard to imagine because our life spans are Or shorter than how long this is taken okay, so when we when we talk about what's about to happen You know everything right now is setting up for worst case scenario for them Um, and I believe that these people are this is this is what we've talked about for a number of years on the show These people are afraid they're afraid they're gonna be held accountable They know what they've done. They know what they did with COVID They know all the shit that they pulled and they know the evidence is gonna come out And so when we look at this in these hypothetical situations We know Trump did not order a coup in fact the evidence and the facts are he actually asked for 20,000 national National guard men to be at the capital on January 6th which was refuted and refused by Nancy Pelosi Okay, so this guy knew that tensions were high This guy knew that shit was could happen riots could happen There was a million people in DC and this dude says hey, we need some protection We need to make sure none of this shit pops off It's a good get to crazy and then they said no and then the FBI went into the fucking crowd and got them all stirred up And dude there's there's tons and tons and tons and facts. Yes, there are there are Thousands of hours of video tape even the small amount of tape that's been released shows that that's true, right? Okay, so It's not bullshit and the only way that you could believe that it's bullshit is if you're watching MSNBC and Dilbert And you're just listening what the fuck he says right these people are lying to people and if you dig at it Even a quarter inch below the surface. It's very easy to see what's going on And the more they push this J6 this coup shit this Trump's Hitler shit Do they not know that Trump's already been president for four fucking years and during that time the economy was the best It's ever been American people know What to expect with Trump they already know you're not gonna scare him into this fucking thing of like oh He's a fucking Hitler. He's gonna stay in power the guys are almost fucking 80 years old Or he's gonna be he's not staying in power, bro The guy wants to restore respect to our republic and fucking clean out all you fucks that have been doing this to us Now he may not do that. He could be a part of those shit. We could be walking into something I can't tell but what I will say is that if he is who he says he is these people are fucking terrified of that Because they should be arrested for the things that they did at a minimum during COVID at a minimum during COVID Okay, they denied Ivermectin as effective their puke when they knew it was true They shut down the country they transferred wealth they opened the borders. They dumped the prisons They forced people to take an unproven medication Okay, they forced them. They said you're fucking fired from your job. They removed these people from the military They removed these people from the police. They let riots burn down the fucking cities bro These people these people this is crimes against humanity and it's global It's not just our government. There's people all over the world that coordinated that shit that has fucked our fucking countries up Not just the United States but everybody's country And they need to be held accountable bro On some I don't I don't even want to call this you know tenfold hat shit But man, have you seen you know, we talked a lot, you know, what's your biggest gripe with Trump? That we talk about the I think the vaccines. Yeah, right. It's a big deal It is and he is always very very, you know pro. I'm like he's proud of that right I saw some stuff I saw interesting thread and kind of went down this rabbit hole was able to kind of confirm a lot of this There's two different vaccines There was Trump's vaccine and then when Biden got in office There was a a second emergency authorization that went through and Pfizer Modern they all changed that vaccine So it's possible. This is the theory. It's possible that what Trump is saying is true that the fact that his version of the vaccine that was authorized was effective I just thought that was a real I don't care bro. No, that's right. I don't think I don't care People fucking are sick now people are myocarditis is that Has increased at a ridiculous rate all caused death is up somewhere between 35 and 40 percent across the fucking globe This shit was forced on people. I don't give a shit Okay, I don't give a shit about this or that or the intricacies It was crimes against humanity and Trump Needs to own that before they flip it over on him and say it was his fault You know, and a lot of people do say it's his fault, but the reality is Is dude if you can remember back and you're honest About society's temperature at that time They had villainized Trump they had destroyed Trump Do you not remember leading up to the election for the he's not going to get reelected? And they said it like they knew it. Oh, it was interesting It was not like oh, we don't think he's going to get elected They said there's no way he's not going to get elected And then you have Fauci coming out a year and a half before the pandemic started talking about how the pandemic is coming Remember that clip where Fauci said You know, I think it's going to be very interesting because we're definitely going to have a pandemic in the next couple years Like he these guys were so proud of what they planned they started telling people they ran Event 201 like all of these things This is this was a coordinated effort and that's what people are just now Starting to figure out you and I've been talking about it since it started happening 2012 the end of 19 and 20 we've been consistent We have all the fucking receipts There's not a single mother fucker on the fucking planet That has been more correct than you and I on what's been going on and we got all the receipts. They're all online okay And now people are finally waking up like all the other conservative influencers and now they're all like oh fuck You know what I'm saying and even though the Democrats and outside of the far left crazy fucks But people that are Democrats and the Democrat their whole life They're realizing what's happening and they're like fuck this dude I'm not with this shit right and then they're walking around with this shit in their body Terrified dude go on the internet and like go on reddit and look at it go go look at like these The there's fucking tons of pages that talk about vaccine injuries from COVID and they're not it won't make the news It won't make the news on anybody's platform because they don't want people to know what they actually did but everybody knows everybody knows so If we get a change of power in this country, bro There's gonna be a demand for accountability, which is why I think and I believe that they're getting ready to flip the game table over How many times did we did did we say it's gonna be another pandemic which they tried back in September remember when they Try that shit in September and everybody's like now fuck you. We're not doing it And then what I said was the second thing I said it would be a war what's the third thing I said it would be Oh a cyber attack to shut off the fucking grid I mean dude these people are about to flip the game table over because they're losing so bad So they're gonna have a black swan world-changing of that come through And people need to be ready for it. Yeah, yeah, I mean 100% man But back back back to the the start of this topic, you know This is what mainstream media would like you to believe is the biggest topic of the day Right followed up by this headline, you know, they there was this big indictment that came out of Arizona um There was several people all close allies or former input, you know workers for Donald Trump. They all just got a dive in Arizona That's not the story. That's not the big story now We got to remember you know until you're a point, you know these things that they've done We got to even go back to 2017 with crossfire operation crossfire hurricane which was orchestrated by Obama and Clinton Which use the CIA use the FBI to generate still document which led to all of the impeachment trials It led to all these things eight years now. It's been eight years eight years of complete division complete disruption complete bullshit They've divided everybody they've got everybody at their throats They've disrupted our way of life We're not getting those eight years back and they've done it for their own personal interests They've done it so they can maintain power over us and we will never get that back The amount of shit that has been caused for the last eight years in our culture and our society will take forever To fucking fix and these people did it on purpose Yep, and so you know, I think you know when you take all of that into into into account Right, and then I want to paint the picture too people got them sent when when the president of the United States The amount of intel that that person receives right is insane Like they know exactly what's happening right and when Trump was president The access to all of the intel he could possibly need right do you remember when Mar-a-Lago got rated? Yep, okay. Well here is the real story that they don't want you to know about today Um, this is how I'm reads revealed Court document release Indicates Jack Smith and FBI or after Obama and North Korea related documents in the Mar-a-Lago raid Hmm it gets deeper than that So this is the gateway pundit and they did a pretty decent job Investigating this and I've been able to look through and get some stuff on my own um That's what the raid was about now. They made it seem like all he took all of these you know classified information and classified documents, right Um, and then they made about well he's not allowed to take that which has already been proven that you know When you're the president you can unclassify anything you want anyway any given time yeah, right? Not like the boxes that Biden as VP had in his garage, which they did nothing about um This is a report right so these are newly unredacted documents Um that you know the raid that Mar-a-Jack Smith led um um This is a document from NARA which is the the records uh holding entity for the government. This is the email I mean this was um Um This was basically like the initial report that was sent up after the raid right and it kind of goes through all these different things and you know It talks about you know what what interesting things they found and um you know locations of stuff the boxes um But there's one interesting line here okay There was in the lines right here uh says it reads there was one accordion folder in the mess So it stood out it contained among other things the Obama letter In North Korea correspondence two separate things not tied together Um, it continues saying what we need to verify that all of the correspondence is there But I think we are in good shape What letters they're talking about that's my question Why would be why would it be so important To raid the president's house and well obviously because there's something incriminating There's something the Obama letter yeah, it has a title What's the Obama letter and why are they in good shape now that they have that letter out of Trump's hands So i think this goes to the other point we'd say this all the time guys like this is a speck in the little show Right and we do our best we deduce the information we get and obviously there's there's gonna be things that we don't know There's gonna be things that Trump knows that we just don't yeah, right I think this is it What do you think it is dude? I think it's something. I think I think whatever it is Is is really really bad like what I mean I don't even think it was that because that shit already came out the gay stuff for the Obama that already came out I don't think it's that I think this this might be just the proof of like you know the kabal movement going back to the crossfire hurricane stuff Like I think it's gonna I think there's a lot of stuff in that a lot of very just bad incriminating shit Yeah, but the fact that Specifically they say we need to verify that all of the correspondences there, but I think we are in good shape What are they what are they so happy about why are they why would they be so hopeful? Well, they probably think they're covered now, but the thing is do you not think that if it was that important that he doesn't have more of those He doesn't think that he has them in more than one location. Do you fucking idiots like that's how I look at it But these people are not this hard, bro. I'm not a fucking. I'm not a fucking genius But I'm gonna tell you this if I had some real shit that I needed to fucking keep Do you think I'm keeping it here first form? Right, do you think I'm hold on do you think I'm keeping it in my house? No, do you think I'm keeping it at my farm? Why keep my shit you ain't ever fucking find it? Mm-hmm, and you think Trump does it Trump's got properties all over the world, bro He's got friends all over the world people. There's his friends love him Okay If I said to fucking one of you guys I said hey hold on to this madat don't no matter who fucking comes Never fucking give it up would you do it? I never give anything. That's right So like bro everybody has a circle like that. That's real trust So to think that that's it in my opinion they're probably letting he's probably letting them think that that's all the hats Exactly well because then that was the interesting thing too, man It's like I was reading through this report that they had and so two-page document We're posted everything you know of course you guys will be able to have access to this um You know but they but they they talk about it There was almost like the sense of frustration from them because it's like everything like nothing's like organizers You know what I'm saying so it's almost like it was almost like it was set up by Trump because he intentionally put it It wasn't like in a special location lock under key. Yeah, like bro Just lens yeah, it lends to that. Yeah, I mean look. I just what do you think the darkness dude? I don't know shit bro. I think these people were legit criminals bro. I think Obama is legitimately I think the Obama Legitimately was placed in the power to start the destruction and the third realization of America That's what I think no he introduced all these socialist ideas He he he started this shit with the he's the one it started the racial tension shit Okay, and it started back when fucking Uh mic brown happened, you know mic brown was just a fucking thug criminal Okay, and we're from St. Louis bro that happened 15 minutes from here Ferguson He was a fucking thug criminal He had a criminal history in a criminal past and had Obama in the news media not made that into a thing It wouldn't have been a thing. It would have been just another criminal doing fucked up shit Right, right then when those five Dallas police officers got killed remember that I do remember and he fucking he didn't denouncing he was like You know like he acted like it was no big deal You know and that's set the path of and there's a bunch of different things right like a lot of his policies and shit like that But his temperature in the office is what set us on this path and I believe he's still running shit Joe Biden's I run a shit Obama's the one is doing this shit. He's the one is leaving the border open He's the one that's draining the strategic oil.

So let's let's keep this cruise moving. We got headline number two headline number two reads Well, this is a couple of them. Sorry. Hello number two. Let's get into it So we got some interesting things happening those anti-Israel protests that been going on right? Yep People get being in locked up Cool, whatever Yale they they've arrested 47 people Princeton you got people getting arrested at Princeton UT Austin I think they locked up like 30 30 people at UT Austin um Even the the University of Texas at Austin president Jay Hartzel he released a statement Saying all rules matter and they will be enforced um, and so these pop-up encampments happen and all over at a lot of our I really Emory and was another school where a lot of students are getting arrested This is all happening a lot of stuff happening now we covered I believe on the last episode That one guy who talked about hurting people who were anti-Semites. Yeah, okay. Well We're in their lives get him fired right hurt him up financially. Yeah, I um, which by the way Jewish people say they don't do those things right then out of control a little alert control. It's interesting It's interesting Because it's weird Well, just go on I have some things it's a little weird. I've got some things that I've observed. Okay. All right But but so so with all of this stuff going on all these kids getting arrested and stuff, you know um Which up you know at the same time two these are the same kids that Biden is Forgiving their loans. Let's remember that But you have this guy comes out and he makes a very interesting tweet Um, the Tetonon reads Chris Hayes Deletes glib post about National Guard shooting Columbia students amid anti-Israel protests So as anti-Israel demonstrators continue to protest on campuses across the country MSNBC host Chris Hayes sent out a social media post mocking calls for the National Guard to restore order at schools now We'll show you his response because he tweeted this out and he deleted that tweet and then this is his follow-up to that He says I deleted a tweet because it was angrily glib But the earnest point is that sending armed National Guard troops to break up peaceful student protest is a terrible and dangerous idea That was his response tweet. It's follow-up tweet Now of course it's the internet nothing gets deleted. So of course I got the original tweet original tweets right here Quote I'm sure the National Guard shooting a few college kids will settle things down and shut everyone up Well, that's what they want But but there's like these two polar opposite tweets and so you know one He's calling for it then in the follow-up tweet after he's deleted is this stance my question is who It's almost like he was instructed Or corrected To doing this like these are not like which ones your genuine feeling is it this this tweet that you really feel Strong about you know, and I think you know, we've seen all the videos of like you know the mainstream media and they're all saying the exact same thing and it's like you know some my question is Do they want the protests Or can they not like do they not want the protest but they can't say that they don't want the protests like I just don't understand The dynamic between these two and this one just feels instructed like he was told to tweet this out You know break up peaceful student protests because it's not what they've been called I mean got people getting arrested. It's just I don't know. It's interesting Yeah, Hayes who is called for a ceasefire in the Israel Hamas war has made other post In reference to the arrest of protesters at university quote As a sheer tactical matter mass arrests of the protesters seem to be having the opposite of its intended effect He wrote Wednesday Hayes also shared post about the lack of credible reporting I'm about anti-Semitic incidents At a protest at UT Austin. This is Chris Hayes there Now these things have been getting weird, but I think it's important to understand to you like it like I was saying my other point You know, these are the same students as Biden is forgiven there Their loans for these schools I think let's just check in with the students themselves. Let's see what you know what they're saying what their point of view is I think that's important for everybody. So here's a clip And what would you say is the main goal with tonight's For us. I think the goal is just showing our support for Palestine and demanding that NYU stops I honestly don't know all of what NYU's doing. Is there something that NYU's doing? I really don't know I'm pretty sure that you know what NYU's doing About Israel, where are we protesting here? That was more educated. I'm not either Support so I came down I heard there's lots of cops and people are saying it was getting dangerous. Do you know what she's at? She says she doesn't know what the fuck's going on, but she's there to protest anyway. I wish I was more educated Yeah, well, maybe if your ass would be in class Well, it's not like they educate these kids these universities. It's just total far left and indoctrination This is like these people are told Harvard Columbia, oh Yale and if I go there, I'm fucking smart You know what I'm saying? There's a meme going around it says repeat after me Capitalism and then it goes capitalism is bad and then they go is bad and then they go good job Here's your degree 300k and they're like yes, and like dude. That's these people They don't even know that they're being capitalized on like they're so fucking stoop. They're a product of capital. Oh They're yes It's just it's insane there man fuck that's deep. Yeah, these people are dumb as fuck They're the dumbest people in the fucking world. That's why they're called use-filiidates No, and the problem with use-filiidates is they think they're very smart They think they're smarter than you so they don't listen to anything This is what we talk about on the personal development You can't learn things you think you already know and if you've been framed out to believe that because you went to Columbia or NYU or Fucking Harvard that you're smarter than everybody How likely are you to listen to anything that anybody else has to say You see what I'm saying. It's a framework that's intentionally installed in these people's brains as programming Well regards to the Chris Hayes tweet how I see that is He's being sarcastic in his first tweet. He says I'm sure the National Guard shooting a few college kids Will settle things down and shut everyone up What he's saying there is going in and if we go in there and fucking fuck these people up It's just going to create more of a problem and his next tweet is saying Hey, you know, I said that sarcastically. I should have said it like this my point is if we go in there and break up These peaceful student protests which by the way they seem to be they do seem to be actually peaceful It's a terrible and dangerous idea and that's true. So I actually see that oh bro. Listen dude There there is a lie being told here that all Jewish people Support what's going on in Israel and that's not the case A lot of Jewish people in fact. I think most Jewish people Realize that this is very bad and they're feeling the heat in real life because they're getting lumped in with these Certain kinds of Jewish people that are doing these things which is basically the Israeli government and the criminals at the top top top This is why I get so aggravated when people say oh, it's Jews Okay, it might be some Jews, but it's a small percentage of the overall Jewish population And we shouldn't be saying this shit just like we shouldn't be saying that all black people are criminals or all white people are fucking You know smell like baloney or fucking whatever right like this generalization is hurting society And so the truth is you know, it doesn't matter if haze is Jewish Because he probably realizes it's wrong They're like this lie that everybody is with Israel if their Jewish is not true at all and so But also in addition to that dude here's something that I see That is not being talked about okay. It's interesting what they did with the riots of 2020 Isn't it they let those riots go on and on and on they didn't break them up at all they didn't break in any peaceful Uh, I'm sorry. They didn't they didn't arrest anybody. They didn't do anything to let these people go around When supposedly the worst pandemic in human history was going on right and then nobody addressed it like oh well, you know It must have skipped them or something right And now all the sudden You have people protesting the Israeli government Okay, who are Jewish and now they're gonna bring the cops in now they're gonna bring national guard in Now they're gonna and these are the people that say it's anti-Semitism to say that Certain Jewish people have control over the media Hollywood big business our government That's anti-Semitic to say it's not anti-Semitic to say because it's a fucking very clear observation Now does that mean that all Jewish people are part of that absolutely not But there is a gang of Jewish people at the fucking top who are making it look like all Jewish people are there So that they cannot be criticized and have to be defended by anti-Semitism, okay? So that's what I see going on and it's interesting because they will say oh well you fucking we don't do that We that's a lie that's a that's an old wives tale. It's not true Bro you can look down the list of these people They're fucking have dual citizenship with Israel, you know a big part of our government has dual citizenship Huge part of the media ownership huge part of big business Hollywood okay, the this is just true. It's true. It's an objective fucking reality truth So then you have to ask yourself well, why do they make it seem like it's not true Why do they destroy people that point at it and say you guys are controlling all the shit and fucking everybody and then we look at something like this where They let the riots go in 2020, but the minute that these people start criticizing Israel they're fucking arresting them peacefully Okay, so so you don't do any of this shit. It's all conspiracy. It's all anti-Semitic rhetoric, but People just happen to get arrested the minute they start protesting you That's a great point, but they didn't get arrested when they were protesting for George Floyd or burning down cities or doing shit that was extremely violent Nobody gave a fuck about peaceful protests for real, but we had guys on the news who standing in front of buildings burning neighborhoods burning Saying oh mostly peaceful protests exactly and they let these motherfuckers just go and destroy everything now if you're a black person You have to stand back and if you're a black person that lives in the inner city and black community you have to stand back and say Why would they let us burn down our own shit? Why would they let this go on? Why would they let this law as a miss go on? Why would they defund the police? Why would they not prosecute criminals? But the minute they're criticized they prosecute everybody, right? Okay, so what does that say who the racists actually are? Because you're gonna let these people destroy their quality of life destroy their neighborhoods let law and order go Why the wayside and criminals run the city But the minute someone criticizes what's going on in Israel? Which by the way most by the polls most American citizens Believe that is wrong, okay? Most American citizens believe that that's a genocide going on and most American citizens are not blaming the Jews They're blaming the government of Israel So we're not allowed to criticize the government of Israel for shit that the road did you not see the mass graves? They uncovered they uncovered a bunch of mass graves over there were doctors in their scrubs had their fucking hands Tie behind their back and they were shot in the back of the fucking head. They just found this yesterday in the day before Okay, so So we can't criticize that and say that's wrong because why oh? Because they don't want anybody finding out what the deal really is Okay, so there's a big play happening in the background that they're trying to cover up with this anti-semitism But they expose themselves the and I'm not saying Jews I'm saying the people at the top who happen to be Jewish and use every day good Jewish people as a shield for their crimes those people are getting exposed Do Gen Z seen it these people who are their core voters are seeing it Bro fucking everybody's seeing it and they're getting on the defense and dude This is a big problem because when I say they gonna flip the game table over These people have the power to do so So it's interesting too because where else has this same exact play been ran Right when you look at the alphabet community. Well, I'm gonna give you respect the lgb community It's the same exact play when you have you know when there's talks of pedophilia running rampant When there's talks about these grown men shaking their balls in front of kids And then you go to go to question it or or you know protest it in any way You just hate all gay people. Yeah, right. It's a divit. It's a divisive tactic They hide under that umbrella umbrella is what shields them from the rain. Yeah And dude people are starting to understand history too. They're looking into the YMR the VIMR Republic They're understanding what happened there, bro And it that wasn't about quote unquote Jews that was about a certain segment of Jewish people that happened to be communist Who were degrading society and when you say like I've said on clips before go look at what happened in 1930's Germany And people are so fucking uneducated. They're like oh, so the Nazis did all this shit first That makes a lot of no actually they didn't it was communist Jewish people that were living in Germany That fucking were causing all this and that's why a lot of the Jewish citizenship was not with that shit So like bro you got to under and I'm not saying anything other than that I'm not saying what happened was justified. I'm not saying that's not what I'm speaking on What I'm speaking on is that this has happened before which yeah I think it's important and those books that got burned in 1930's Germany that everybody talks about burning books burning history Remember it was fucking the same books that they try to put in the kids schools today It was it was kids sucking each other's dicks and cutting their dicks off and confusing society and demoralizing society and attacking Family structure because it's not a Jewish thing. It's a communist thing No, it was just also why you can't question it Can't ask about that. No, you can because they can't do shit to you tell them to fucking eat a dick Let's shit make sure it's kosher. All right Bro, you know how many Jewish people have reached out to me and be like bro. Thank you for speaking up about this It's you're doing it in a responsible way. We're Jewish. We do not agree with this shit. It's fucking insane It's making us all look bad bro. I've got I've probably got Let me know. Yeah, let me know if you do I've been hundreds of those messages a week Yeah, you know, and there's some people that are talking about it, but they're talking about it in such an extreme way We can't repeat history and say oh this whole group of people is guilty. It's not fucking true. It's not true Do you guys agree with our government now? What if you lived in fucking Poland and you're looking at America and you're saying all Americans are like that would they be accurate? No, okay. Well, that's the same thing that these far right aggressive people do when they say it's the Jews That's not an accurate statement dude Yeah, I love that I think the feedback you said you've been getting. That's awesome. Yeah Yeah, right now the tension's so high with the the Jewish thing I don't think it's a good idea like bro Like I'm all about making fun, right? But when tensions are high like that It's important to have legitimate conversations and you know when things are not high like Because like dude for regular Jewish people right now It's getting a little hot You know I'm saying and that's not cool man. You know how many friends I have that are Jewish as normal dudes They're normal dudes in fact like some guys I don't even know they're fucking Jewish. They're like yeah I'm Jewish bro like this is fucked up. You know I'm saying like so I just think you know We got to be responsible and careful with our words But we got to draw a hard line about what we're gonna accept and not accept That doesn't mean give a pass that means call out the motherfuckers doing it say their fucking names who the fuck is it Not what race are they? George Shabbat guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments What you guys think with that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three Uh, this is interesting. So uh Uh, headline number three reads Kamala Harris attacks Tennessee Republicans for passing bill allowing some teachers to be armed Um, so vice president Kamala Harris Attack Tennessee Republicans on Wednesday calling them extremist For passing a bill that allows public school teachers to be armed in classrooms After meeting certain conditions such as firearm training and approval from administrators Harris who visited the volunteer state last year to push for gun control called for lawmakers to pass a Quote an assault weapons ban In red flag laws.

Yeah, I know they want to do more school shootings so that they don't want the teachers armed because it won't work Listen and like and then and then if they go try to do the school shootings when the teachers are armed They'll show that that actually works because teachers be blown motherfuckers brains out I said one plus one nigga No Not non plus one Administrative carry get it. Nope. Okay. Keep one in the head. You know, I'm saying like nine plus one all right Well, let's keep moving. Yeah, so if signed the school factor of faculty and staff they can carry a concealed handgun if they possess the enhanced carry license They have to pass the background check everything that she's actually already asking for there that that's part of it Um, do we not already got a pass of federal background check to get guns? I'm pretty sure every time I bought a gun I got to fill out like a three-page piece of paper and sit there and wait while they go see if I'm like a criminal You you had to do that? I know you just steal yours Hey, don't hey, hey, it's a joke I'm gonna shaft somebody show it. Why do you know your guns have fucking cereal dollars on them? But yeah, background check they have to obtain certification by health care professional that they're mentally sound and they have to complete 40 hours of fire on training Um, I'm cool with it. I'm cool with it now back to common now. Let's add a couple veterans in there. Yeah, I'm saying give them those positions for sure Like a mini gun let the teachers teach the books that you know, we want the kids to read our kids Just leave the teachers let them just focus on teaching Bro, you know what they used to do in a wild west. What's up? They used to take a rope and tie it around people's feet and drag them behind a horse. Hmm. They never seen that movie Troy No, where they do that to the guy. So here's what I think no Oh, man, it's great. This is called Troy. That's it. Yeah, it's Brad Pitt That's not great. No, it's good. Is it yeah, so so They used to tie the feet and then drag them around a horse until they were dead and so like dude we could actually pass the law This is what I would do Pass the law to where like we give them all a four-wheeler right and then like if they catch a school shooter or a potential school shooter They tie the rope around the feet and then drive it around the parking lot until the guys dead. No, man It make a good YouTube like it'd be great short form like I'd watch that all day But like how long does that actually take? I don't know we'll find out how long you're taking the movie I mean, I don't know. That's a movie. I don't know but like in real life. I'd be curious. No. Yeah, like I'm curious Like how long would that take then you could put up like 55 gallon drums that are like filled with concrete and you could like get points if you could like swing them into the You know saying we can make a game show out of it You know, yeah, yeah be cool. We like yeah, fuck because that's what really should happen to criminals and fucking grand people who try to shoot kids in the school agree Should give them the the ability to just handle the round of spot. I'm down with that. Yeah, I'm down with that All right, now I'm talking about points and the you know, and then like we could put it all on on TikTok because we're gonna un-band-ass shit and And then we you know we make a rating system and then like whoever makes the most points gets a prize a new gun What yeah, okay. Yeah, exactly. I like that new gun. Yeah, even we'll let you skip the background check because I earned it There it is yeah, all right now back to Kamehmey real quick um I could not imagine having a work where and like doing a full circle jerk here, right with the the the bodyguard You know security service detail in the beginning Um and guns full circle jerk here Uh, did you see that one of her secret service agents went crazy?
