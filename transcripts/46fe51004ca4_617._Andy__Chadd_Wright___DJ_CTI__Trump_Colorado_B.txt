some ideas about that all right so we also have this thing called the fee for the show okay we say pay to feed I mean share the show um we don't take ads for the show I don't take money from people because I don't want to be beholden to what they tell me I can and can't say it probably wouldn't be a great relationship I do this show at my own expense and I just asked one thing from you guys and that's this share the show make sure think if it makes you laugh it's something that you think needs to be heard which all of these messages do need to be heard right now otherwise I wouldn't be doing them uh please share the show don't be a hoe show the show all right Chad what's up dude holy crap man I know I had a ball bustin workout this morning dude there's a with the first form team now somebody told me there was a little little little drama amongst amongst the workout well there always is man that's why we train right yeah that's why we train dude it's is to expose our freaking weakness uh-huh we train hard we freaking grind because I don't care how good you think you are Andy there's some chinks in your armor that's a fact and the same with me dude people look at me and they think odd man this joker so mentally tough it ran 250 miles this year and does all this crazy stuff right man there's still chinks in my armor and the only way that we can expose that is by putting ourselves in this situation where things begin to hurt more than we wanted them to hurt and that's what happened out there today that freaking workout we did dude that's a workout I designed about two years ago I do it once a year I do it once a year for a reason because to do it twice a year would be pretty just insane it's a once a year type workout it's a grind and so you know we're getting after it man we got some awesome athletes out there I want to tell you how amazing it was for me today to be able to give back to the first form team because all I have done for the last four years is I've taken from from from for I mean that's not true that's not true but I think you're being overly humble that was not true I cast listener I take the thing the things that you guys talk about have helped me tremendously and so to be able to come here today and leverage my unique gift to pour back in to the people who make all of this happen you have no idea how much of an honor it was for me to be able to do that and the whole time I'm watching because that's what I do best see God gave me a unique gift to be able to unite people to bring people together to form real teams that literally become a single organism that are ultimately unstoppable that's my unique gift so I'm watching what are the chinks in this team right here right so we get toward the very end of this I call it the combat standards test and this is where it's getting harder than anybody really wanted it to be they showed up knowing yes going to be hard we know that but but this is a little freaking ridiculous man and that's when I really start watching right so some of the the faster team members they finished first right and so I'm out doing my run and I'm looking and I'm noticing that we're missing some people right and those faster team members who finished first I said I know where them jokers are at they they don't ease back up in the gym you know we're running outside they don't ease back up in the gym you know and they're they're they're waiting for everybody else to finish so I stopped my freaking run which pisses me off by the way any of you guys listen to this that were responsible it pissed me off that I had to stop my freaking run and come into the gym and tell you guys negative negative we started this thing as a team and when you start something as a team you don't freaking go and take care of your own little personal needs until the mission is complete there's three things that I look for in a teammate all right the first one is dependability you got to be where you said you were going to be when you said you were going to be there you got the guys checked the box this morning they showed up on time on target ready to train dependable they checked it the second thing I look for is you must be skilled I want a teammate that skilled whatever purpose that individual is supposed to serve within that organism I want him to be able to perform that task better than anyone else can perform that task everybody that came this morning they were skilled I mean we ran a lot we did a hundred burpee pull ups with with a 20 pound vest on a bunch of heavy front squat their skill those are skilled people man they showed up they were able to accomplish all of that without injuring themselves right the last one so we checked the box skilled the last one and the hardest one but the most important one is selflessness and that's what we missed that's what we missed this morning if you are part of a team and you guys you're on a mission you're trying to accomplish something you you have set an objective for the team if you finish your job before you go and take care of your own little needs before you go take a shower before you go change your clothes before you go take a hit off your water bottle whatever it freaking is you need to look around you and say is there anyone else out here that I could potentially help do that put your teammate before yourself that is the essence of selflessness it's really hard to become selfless if you have a team that is composed of selfless individuals and everyone on that team is looking around and thinking about the needs of their team mate and putting the needs of their teammate above their own personal needs if everyone's doing that that freaking team is unstoppable you cannot stop that team all right you well you have to kill them you would have to kill them it's hard to become selfless what do you what do you have to do to become selfless you know Jesus Christ said the weirdest thing I ever heard in my life man the joker said all kinds of radical stuff don't be offended that I call Jesus Christ at Joker Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior all right we're just having conversation here he said this really radical thing he said those who decide to try and keep their keep their life will lose it but he said those who decide to give up their life or lose their life for my sake will gain it Jesus is trying to show you what it looks like to become selfless you become selfless by dying to yourself if you're on a team you might need to remind yourself every so freaking often that you are not that important the way you feel is not that important if somebody said something to you that hurts your freaking feelings that's you're not you're you're not that important die to yourself and you will gain your life so that's what happened this morning that's what happened this morning I fucking love chat these are my favorite guests you ever have bro when is this number five before huh it needs to be more dude whatever it is need me more well I love you brother look guys I'm gonna tell y'all what man how they respond how they respond on the debrief with because like I know you told him this lesson like in person yes yeah we talked we talked through this in the after-action I imagine they respond pretty well so immediately so when I when I confront when I confronted them about you know their selfishness they immediately recognized and they and they and they Roger that man yeah they you could see it in their face yeah it was like dang man we could do that better yeah oh yeah and and dude they got out there and then it become it became this this this unit I'm willing to bet that those people those people are probably because I know who the best athletes are in the building and there there are leaders here so I know that that lesson was a valuable lesson for the people for sure that was the reason I came here this morning man yeah and I brought my whole team with me yeah I brought my whole team with me I brought cornbread chilly chilly brother little brother Blake yeah and I appreciate y'all let me do that man because you know bro you're welcome here anytime so that's how he's like how I brought this your fucking home yeah yeah yeah you gotta do those guys you know I told them I was coming up here to to be to hang out and to do this workout and they're like you know they got other responsibilities within our business back home and and they said you know I we should probably stay here and and do the jobs that we need to do and I'm like no now this is pretty much a mandatory trip you're coming let me tell you why I did that man if I can get the listeners to understand this I don't know if they'll I don't know it I think that they're going to think that I'm just trying to say something that sounds good but if I can get them to truly understand this it is going to change the the trajectory of their life you know how you when you get a little further along in your journey you can look back and you can see how things happened a little more clearly all right I'm kind of at that point in my journey where I'm now able to start looking back on the last 20 years of my life and start to see what led me here right right right and one of the main things that has led me to the place that I am in today and to becoming the person who I am today is the fact that I have wanted things since I was 18 years old I have decided to want things that are seemingly impossible do you understand how freaking stupid I felt when I walked into the recruiter's office as an ignorant redneck that barely graduated high school that had no freaking skills whatsoever do you understand how absurd it was for me to want to become a navy seal absolutely absurd do you understand how stupid I felt when I showed up to take my first physical standards test to get a seal contract and I didn't know how to swim the test was a 500 meter swim and I didn't know how to swim and what has led me to this point is the the desire to to have things that are seemingly impossible but it's not just enough to want to have those things because you can sit around and want to have those things all you want and nothing's gonna happen the way it works is you figure out what you want I don't care how freaking big it is or how ridiculous it sounds and then you get your lazy freaking butt up and you walk into environments where you feel like you don't belong you feel like the biggest freaking turd idiot there everyone around you is smarter than you everyone around you is looking down on you and you're the idiot that shows up to take a swimming test that can't even freaking swim but you keep showing up and you and you start to you start to kind of feel a little bit more comfortable in that environment right and and it's very subtle is very subtle this has been my whole life it's been my whole life how do you think I felt standing on the start line of a freaking first hundred mile race I ever run yeah how do you think I feel standing on the start line of a 250 mile race I felt like an idiot man I brought my team here for that reason because I knew that when my team walked up in here they were going to see something my team is seeing something today that is impossible when I come to this place I look at this place and I say I want this I don't as much as I love you Andy I don't just want to be a part of this man I want this I love it but I can't get this unless I walk up in here even though I know you have accomplished a hundred times what I have accomplished but I got a walk in here and I got to have a conversation with you like a man because I will never have this unless I come here and just touch it and that's why I brought my team up here with me today man and my team is going to leave here and and what they used to believe was possible when we leave here in an hour on the drive back home to Georgia what they thought was possible before they walked into those two double doors right there you know what that's going to be different that's going to be different how valuable is that and all they had to do was show up that's all they had to do that's been my life man yeah that's been my life too bro every every bit of it you know every every bit of my life the whole entire way you know it'd be 25 years for me in business on January 1st like a week right the Lord man yeah I was telling Emily last night I'm like dude it feels like a thousand years does not feel like 25 years it feels like a thousand years people don't understand that you know I've given everything up everything every normalcy every convenience everything that everybody has and you know takes for granted as a normal person's life I've given all that shit up to do this one thing and it's been hard like really really really hard and I want to take it back to you when couple things you said that first of all I'm not a hundred times more successful than you or accomplish more than you you went into different things than I did and had you put that time into those things the same things I did or vice versa we would have done the same things most likely but secondly you know the first thing you said about cracks in the armor I want to make this point really clear because there's a lot of young people that listen there's a lot of people that hear um you talk about running 250 miles and the amazing things that you've done or the amazing things that we've done in business and that we continue to do and they think that that takes some sort of that's some sort of gift that is bestowed upon certain people that other people just don't get and because they didn't get that gift they think that these exceptional things are impossible and what people don't really understand about me and this is just really I was telling Alex Ramose this today this morning on the phone is like I'm legitimately the laziest fucking human on the planet like legitimately like you guys don't understand this I am the laziest fucking human on the planet and people hear me talk about mental toughness and about developing your mind and becoming more mentally tough and they think I walk through and this shit is just easy for me no it's actually the reason I know my shit is so good and that it works so well for you is because I am you I am that lazy motherfucker that can't get it going and I use certain systems to produce the results that I have to keep that in check yeah that's it I'm a systems guy I'm smart I can figure out how to make things and if I participate in the system just like the Navy SEAL training or the Navy SEAL course you're gonna come out a fucking weapon right and and so like it's a common misconception that people look at people who have achieved things or are achieving things and to think that those people have gifts or talents or skills or toughness that they don't have when in reality the entire problem for most people is that they've never put anything they never put the pen to paper to actually extracting the potential that's inside of them and that's that's the issue with you guys the issue isn't Andy has some sort of gift or Goggins has some gift or fucking Chad's got a gift like yes it appears that way because we've been doing things for decades okay and that we are good at those things if you were to pick things and stuck with them for decades you would appear to have the same gifts they're not gifts they are skills and we have to practice them on a daily basis we have to find out ways to make them work for us and one of the things I love about Chad is and just quite honestly dude like you're the most regular exceptional human I've ever met in my life you know what I'm saying you're exceptional yes yeah like this is a regular man who like has done incredible things he's he's an incredible leader he's an incredible speaker he's an incredibly knowledgeable I mean I just wish we could take that and put it into people's brains dude like so many people sit and rot because they're out here dreaming all these dreams but they never execute which creates this it creates this this vacuum of unhappiness where they can escape it like dude you're unhappy bro you guys were listening to this and you're dissatisfied with your life the reason you're dissatisfied is because you have all these huge dreams and you have all these goals and you you never execute and so that creates this torturous existence that you can't move through and and dude it's your favorite saying you sent me this amazing painting that is hangs in my office at home it says one thing it says three words on it what's it say execute execute execute that's all it is that's all it is guys that's all it is and I know we're getting a new years a lot of you guys are starting 75 hard or whatever you're doing you know we're gonna start off the year strong we all encourage that but just remember dude this is not about a week it's not about a month it's not about a two months it's not about 75 days this is about your fucking life and this is about executing day in and day out and if you could just figure out and build the qualities within yourself to execute on a consistent basis you will discover gifts within yourself that you never ever ever imagined you had all these things that these guys look at and they see all these because dude how many mega personalities of you met now all of them right yeah they're all normal they're just normal people who do the thing every single day man and that's the mystique about it it is bro it's really simple and it's not magic to it and the reason people think there's magic is because there is some people who are not humble enough to admit that they're just a regular person doing the thing they want to make a mystique around it or they want to make you make feel like I'm superhuman and you're just you and it's unfortunate you know what I mean like that's not the case guys all of us have greatness in us and if we want to talk about God for a second that's the purpose that like if you had a son all of you had a son would you not want the son to extract the gifts that you gave your son that's that's a legitimate biblical obligation and you living below what it is your potential could be because you're afraid or you're afraid of what could happen or what people might say to me and I'm not a religious expert but to me it seems like that would be spitting in the face of of of your creator and I think it's I don't know it's something I think about a lot man Jesus said I have come that you may have life more abundantly that is the standard that has been set the abundant life that is why Jesus came to give us life more abundantly and Andy I just got to say something I just got to back you up on this in a very in a very practical way um I want the listeners to understand what Andy what Andy's talking about here I was not supposed to become a seal I was not supposed to become successful successful in business as we have been up to this point and we're just starting I was not supposed to become this ultra merit none of these things was I supposed to be able to accomplish there there was no visible evidence that I had what it took to do those things it is the it's the practical application or the execution and let me give you a very practical example about this if you guys listen to Andy so Andy you're your mentor to me in business um so you're you're a mentor to me in just life well I appreciate it so you know when I listen to Andy say things about about business I listen and I and I hear what he says and guess what most people will try to do when they hear you say something that then they is is going to require action on their behalf guess what that most 90% of people do they make any excuse tell a story is why not of why they can't do it I made a post the other day I said seek people that are better than you and and get and spend time around them right and and the every comment every reply to that post was how do you find those people how well how to how and look not I want you to understand understand something about excuses your excuses nobody believes your stinking excuse except for you so when you send me an excuse of why you can't do something that I'm telling you to apply in your life do you understand how stupid that makes you look to me like I read it and I'm just like I just laugh man because no one believes your excuse except for you so what you know Andy said someone to podcast a long time ago he's talked about he's talked about how the car you drive matters that's a very countercultural to how I grew up but I hear this dude say this and and he's my mentor and business in a sense I mean I I don't want to overstep my bounds by calling you that but that's that's I take it with the immense amount of gratitude respect so so he he talks about how it's how the car you drive actually impacts how you operate as an operator in business as as a leader it and and I had never freaking heard that before man because the way I grew up it was like I cars a car it's a it's a it's a utility utilitarian type of thing right but but I said you know what if he's saying that I know that that is true as we choose to I know that that's got to be true and I don't understand it but I am going to to actually apply that in my life so I literally I have me I have me some side money that I've been hiding you know from from the wife you know I have me some side money and I thought you know what man this is this is like my play money and and I like having that around by guns within stuff like that but you know I was like that's what side money is for yeah yeah for sure guns but I took I took every last dollar of my side money and I said you know what I'm gonna have this company retro designs build the vehicle of my dreams like if I could have one freaking vehicle I'm gonna have them build it and I and I used all of my side money to do that and it's it it it has in so it has indeed affected the way I operate and that's yeah a lot of you guys are gonna listen to that and think that's freaking vanity look man I'm not a materialistic person I don't know how it works but it freaking works you go out and get in this thing and now my truck's not fast it's just it's mine it's mine it's it's an extension of your personal self image that reinforces how you feel and look about yourself and people who say well that's that means you're insecure that means you don't that's bullshit it really it's no different than wearing a nice suit it's no different than Jerry Rice used to grace why receiver every play football used to have this thing that he said look good play good if you go on the field you look good your gloves are nice you got the right towel everything's proper you feel good maybe when you guys went out on missions you had all your shit in the right places you know everything was where it was it probably saved your life because you're confident right yeah it's just a different angle on the same thing yeah you know what I mean it reinforces our confidence you know I want to hit on something real quick dude that you said about becoming be surrounded by exceptional people do you know what the quickest way is to be surround like y'all say oh well how do I find these people do you know the quickest way to find those people become one of those people and then they find you that is the fucking game okay you're all waiting around and you say well those guys won't let me in my circle those guys yeah because you're shitty that's what it is so you become that shitty you get yourself in shape you get some things going for you you become a person of standard you become a person of ethics and and a high character and guess what happens they come to you but dude that's uncomfortable I know it takes work and it takes time and you can't do it in a day you know so people don't like that answer but that is the truth yep yep it's a process yeah it's a process yeah I thought about a suit thing too you know I do I do a lot of speaking engagements it might be different for it's different for everybody it's whatever you see yourself it like when I see myself like I'll post these selfie like when I put on one of my suits dude I always post it you know why because that's the true image of myself that I think of in my head when I think of myself in my head you guys probably think of me sitting here in a black v-neck in front of this because that's how you see me that's not how I see me how I see me is wearing a fucking three-piece suit with some sunglasses on looking badass as fuck that's that's that's what I see when I look at myself in the mirror and you know what you guys say well how can you be so confident well when you see yourself like that is pretty easy you know saying like that's what I see and it makes me feel good and and I think if people are honest with themselves and just let go of other people's opinions and and figured out how to reinforce their self image in those kind of ways we're much happier we're much more effective but but ultimately it the important part is well they they're tied together but when I think about it the important part isn't that it makes you feel good yeah it's that it affects your performance for sure because I feel good because you feel yes so with with the speaking engagement like dude I I have tried this because I heard you say it right and so I did as I did a speech to a large crowd just a few months ago and one of my biggest speaking engagements I've done and I said you know what I'm gonna wear the nicest outfit that I have and I wore that and it was literally the best speech that I have ever given in my like I walked out of there and I was like that's it man that's it yeah and you you guys listen to this man if if you want to sit around and wine and and say that this is vanity and wine and say that we are materialistic people cool keep losing yeah because I'm telling you right now this freaking crap there's something to it and I don't understand it but there is something to it so I just do it and it produces unbelievable results sometimes that's you don't need to know why you just even know that does right right you know I'm saying we get we get we get worked up with the why and the how some things just are the way they are yeah I mean even then you can get into the the technicalities of it and there's there's some answers out there but in a day does it win the best that you feel what's the bet wins the best that you already know wins the best that you feel when I'm on my shit when I got my fucking well I'm looking good feeling bro when you put on one of those David August suits it's over it's fucking over it's it's all bro I got you I got you I got you I got you listen on me I fucking got you bro a hundred percent we should get on my list right this is execute though yeah have them do the fuck yeah so so so all my new I just got an order of suits from them dudes shot out to David David August Chad is my guy over there Chad sent me tie to go with that with one of those new suit that I gotta I got it sound it's gonna sound weird when I say this because it's actually like it's burgundy but I call it purple like you can't see me wearing a purple suit but this shit is so fucking pimp dude and he sent me a fucking he sent me a tie that you know I have those shorts to say fuck you on them yeah that was Conor McGregor suit that says fuck you he sent me a fuck you tie for that suit like the suit is fuck you bro like it's so bad ass but like you know only special people get that shit so anyway I got you on this I'm hooking you up we're fucking putting our shit on and we're gonna go fucking we're gonna make sure we go somewhere where we get some get this on camera yeah there it is we're just gonna straight up flex on a whole world no crap and then you guys so would say it's vain or whatever fuck you I don't give a shit we're awesome yeah man be awesome like us yeah I think I think a lot of people are confused like man Chad like how do you reconcile this with with your faith right like how do you reconcile this with with you know what what Jesus said to the rich young ruler when he says hey you know what what do what do I need to do and Jesus says well uh well well why don't you go home and sell everything that you own and then come and follow me Jesus didn't say that to that rich young ruler because because he wanted that person to be poor and not have anything that's a standard for everybody he told him that to see who his God was he he taught it was a test it was like will you okay what what are you worshipping our important is this to you 100% man see the Lord the creator of the universe doesn't want you to be poor he doesn't want you to to not to not have anything but he also doesn't want you to be a slave and worship those things over all other things exactly yes everything belongs to the to the creator of the universe God the father everything belongs to him he's gonna he's gonna bless his children with that because we know how to wield that stuff as a matter of fact we are people who are filled with the Holy Spirit of Christ are pretty much the the only people on earth who can truly wield that type of of wealth and riches and influence and leadership without becoming completely corrupted like you have to have to wield that stuff you have to have power from a source who is more righteous than you yeah because it will destroy you as a human being yeah very easily very easy I see I know so many people I've witnessed this a lots of times and I could name names and you guys were recognized but I've seen so many people just getting that place where they've worked work they're good people work work and I don't want to discourage anybody because this might discourage some people because a lot of people like to hang on to their faith as a reason for doing nothing they like to say I'm holier than you because I'm doing nothing and you went out and did something and did that and noise the shit out of me okay because it's false but I've seen a lot of people who are good people become successful materialistically and wealth wise and then let that become their God so to speak you know none of the stuff that I have the stuff I don't give a shit about I mean you know this is true DJ knows this because he's with me every day and like I'm sure a lot of people you know whatever or I don't give two fucks okay it's not my identity it's not who I am it's it's not it literally is just stuff but I've also recognized that by me having stuff other people get inspired and other people decide to do more with their lives and other people step out and say and you know one of the prayers I always say when I was growing up dude was God if you help me I promise I'll help other people and one of the ways I help other people is by inspiring them to do better and do more I'm one of those people well that means a lot of those freaking people man yeah and that and that's that's up against a lot of criticism for those things you know one of the reasons I don't show my life the way that I used to which I'm going to get back to by the way is because I started listening to some of those criticism a little too much I started believing instead of listening to my own knowledge which which I knew meaning I know that someone has to be the example for the other people I started listening to the haters and listening to the critics and I started getting shy and being like fuck dude you know what and almost a little embarrassed because I had become so successful that it was like fuck nobody deserves this this is gonna piss everybody off you know what I mean and the truth of the matter is is you know I made a promise my promise was if you help me I'll help other people and I got a follow through on that and that that that means standing up to some of the criticism for you know for some of the things that I've done in my life you know what I mean yeah yeah that are that are that are healthy things you know what I mean that you you showing that side of your life has has literally I mean I've only been in business for four years now yeah and it's freaking hard man yeah yeah and like but you showing me and so many other people what is possible it makes me want the if I if I if I if I didn't know like if I didn't have that example like I wouldn't even know what to want yeah like you're yeah you've created something for me that I can see and I can say I freaking want that man yeah but without you showing that well then I'm proud how would you know I'm probably gonna be wanting something that is way way less than what I could actually have mm-hmm right mm-hmm and then you're gonna be convinced by the rules of society that you probably shouldn't even have that exactly just be a poor little man take what you get shut up and these these dude all this you know every time I come in here and do a podcast with you guys you these cats right here what's up brother these cats right here they will cut they'll cut something between the three of us and they'll post it and it'll go freaking viral yeah on Instagram on YouTube and uh it's some little clip and then you know in the past I've went and it's dude some hate for freaking comments man yeah hateful dude and and you know I struggle with that for a long for for quite a while I'm not gonna lie to you guys man I struggle with that because I'm new to all of this and yeah I'm seeing people even people that I know that are saying things about me and I'm like but but like you don't have the whole story man yeah like like like come on dude and it gets to you right yeah and so the Lord has has the the most recent process that I have been going through is uh is literally putting my old self to death mm-hmm and it's like that's a journey man so I'm literally sitting down with it with a good brother of mine and I'm telling him my story no holds barred from start to finish in detail it's freaking wild man and let me tell you what's wild about it what you this is something you're doing this is something I know who it is I bet what's that who the guy is oh no no no no you don't know who this guy you you wouldn't know who this guy really no no this is a he's a yeah you you wouldn't know him but what's wild is man is as I'm going through through my story you know there are things that have happened in my life that I feel like or like the the big things like the really bad things like I remember those things and I'm thinking like those are the things that I need to really unpack and talk through but what I'm realizing as I'm telling my story to this man is that there are things in my life that my mind has blacked out so I've always known there are these large portions of my life that are completely black I knew where I was but I don't remember any detail of what I was doing and so I'll go through my story man and and this thing will pop up man that I didn't even freaking remember that I didn't know was there and it was a sigh it will just hit like hit me like a freaking ton of bricks man like the other day we got to the part of my story where I had to have my heart surgery right I got kicked out of the Navy I got kicked out of the Navy a part of that story I've never told you guys when they kicked me out of the Navy and told me no you cannot do this job they literally took everything that I wanted out of life they took it from me man I never told him by this when I got back home to my little small town in Georgia I wanted to wear my uniform out to dinner one time that's all I wanted to do man because I wanted to finally feel like I had done something in my life that I could be proud of I wanted to wear my uniform to the Texas Roadhouse and eat dinner one time and then I would move I would move on after that but I couldn't do it because I wasn't in the I wasn't in I wasn't associated with the Navy anymore and I remember telling people around me I think I just want to go out eat in my uniform one time just to kind of put a cap on this and people would say you don't need to do that just move on from that right but I just so badly wanted to be proud of something as a 19 year old man who had never done anything worth doing and when I didn't even remember that until I'm telling this man and this thing pops up dude and it freaking just hammers me and I'm like you know having everything that you wanted taken from you that's why my mind had blacked all that out because it freaking affected me that deeply but I didn't even know it was there right talk about contrast I went from having everything I wanted taken away being told no you can't freaking do this to less than two years later after an elective open heart surgery being elected as the honor man of my freaking class literally the example why was I the one man out of 300 people to be elected as the hard charger the honor man of my freaking class why why was I that man because of that time that they told me negative you can't freaking have this contrast dude I can't I'm going through this story man and the reason I'm doing this is because as I bring these things to the surface that my mind has blacked out that my mind has hidden from me as I bring these things about my old self to the surface I can literally put them to death this process is a process that is meant to put my old self to death that is my desire and let me tell you when I get done with this every one of y'all suckers listening to this episode when this old man that was Chad Wright that freaking screwed so much crap up that freaking did so many wrong things that that that that just didn't have a freaking clue when that old man when when when that when that old man has put completely to death you better get out of the freaking way son because that's that's when the party starts that's when you become wrong and that's my mission man and that's my mission man I love it that's what the Lord is doing right I'm going to be working on that I've been doing that for about two months now yeah I've been doing that for about two months and and I thought I thought it was going to be a fast process but you do a book um the top secret no I mean I might I might do one you need to do it later I'll do dude I'm gonna tell you man I'm gonna tell you what brother I got a freaking story that you that that will knock your socks off as a matter of fact I got a story like no story you've ever heard and you know why you've never heard a story like my story because nobody out there not a swinging serious no nobody out there that's got a story like mine has the courage to tell it yep that's why when I finally tell you guys my full story you're gonna say holy crap oh man that was good bad and ugly and it's not because there ain't a bunch of other dudes that's lived a similar life to me it's not because there's it's not because my story's unique it's because with people people out there with stories like mine haven't found the courage to tell it yeah they don't tell them that's all it is man yeah kind of say penis on here that's I think that's approved I love you guys speaking of penises DJ oh we got a show we got a lot of old small trivial ones yeah I'm talking about yeah um it's a tie man the channel I just love you man yeah I do love you man yeah let's let's get into it there's a lot of there's some interesting things out there so let's share some perspectives to see what we got on these these topics but before we get into our first headline we got to draw the line on something all right and this is something that that's that's personally bothering me and I feel like it needs to just be addressed we've got seen this this headline reads New York bill would force some chick flay locations to open on Sundays and cross the fucking line hey the only place they cross the line the chick flay is off limits do you like chick flay uh yeah I mean I like I like what the what the company has always stood for and um you know obviously them being closed on Sunday that's a that's a representation of their values it's just freaking mind boggling to me that that that that government could could influence anything about a privately owned business and how they are is this freaking mind boggling dude that's insane yeah that's wrong and well it's communism it is communism because that's actually their explanation believe it or not uh their their argument it says uh quote while there's nothing objectionable about a fast food restaurant closing on a particular day of the week service areas dedicated to travelers is an inappropriate location for such a restaurant the bill just a for justification reads quote publicly owned service areas should use their space to maximally benefit the public allowing for retail space to go unused one seventh of the week or more is a disservice an unnecessary inconvenience to travelers who rely on the service areas that's common to what kind of service areas they're talking about yes apparently there uh this restaurant it's uh it's in the New York State through way authority um one of the rest stops I guess they have a little Chick-fil-A location in there and because they're not open on Sundays they're saying they think of the incident travelers they're trying to force them to stay open oh yeah I say Lee Chick-fil-A the fuck I bet you if they do this I bet you they close those locations are here and see you these guys don't band on their stuff they really don't know they don't man and and they've they've done well enough as as an organization to they've got a huge following yeah they've got a lot of very loyal customers and I believe that that because they were founded on uh Christian values they have the creator of the universe on their side um uh so you know what man you freaking mess with Chick-fil-A you're probably going to lose that battle man yeah I agree yeah 100% I was gonna leave him lonely I'm with Chad dude I'm so sick of these people thinking they can put their hands into everything dude yeah like they've like it's fucking everything listen dude people people that don't own businesses have no idea like I live in a pretty free state for the most part Missouri okay and it's still insane it's still insane the amount of of the amount of government regulation needs to be reduced by like 90% across the board it's big the United States government it's the biggest organization it's ever existing in history of humankind think about that there's some of millions deep that we're talking about 12,000 years of humans documented human history like the biggest organization ever that's the United States government that's insane bro yeah it's not required and you know we need a big we need a big reconciliation in this country it's not yeah it's not only not required it's literally not the way it was designed so correct um you know as I was riding up here with my with my team yesterday uh I have considered in the future potentially running for the governor of my state because I truly believe that this that a huge part of this solution that needs to happen here in America is returning power back to the states or state sovereignty right and I was telling my buddies I don't know if I should say this on air or not and I said uh you know if I get elected governor I'm gonna go county by county and uh and I'm gonna raise a militia county by county I'm gonna find every single fighting age male that I can muster which by the way won't be many because uh we've gotten pretty fat and lazy and freaking weak and stupid around here which is a big problem but I'm like I'm gonna go county by county and muster every man that I can and I'm gonna form a nice little militia and then I'm gonna tell the federal government to kick rocks and my buddy Cornbread said yeah you know they did that one time back in 1865 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Yeah yeah that that that was all about States that that was about states rights yeah a lot of a lot of people think that's about it was exclusively about slavery which it wasn't did no do you have to understand that that when when George Washington was elected as the first president of the united states why did they elect George Washington. They elected George Washington because he was the man who could unite the states. They did not elect George Washington to be a ruler. They, they, they, they elected him for the sole purpose of the fact that he was the one person who could unite the states. And guess what? Back in them days, when George Washington or the federal government, which by the way, George was a federalist, um, he advocated for bigger federal government, right? But back in them days, when George and his people would, would send something down the pipe to a state like Georgia and the state didn't like what old George was trying to get him to do, guess what the governor of the state did? Told him to freaking kick rocks. Like no, screw you, man. Like your job is to unify these states, not to have authority over the states. That's the way it's supposed to work. It's decentralizing power. Yes. If we can take the power from one single organization and we can decentralize it and split it into 50 different elements that are self governing. It's the perfect solution. And it's the, the way it was designed to work. Yeah. So you know, you think about who should be president? Well, the interesting thing about George Washington that people don't realize is that he had to be convinced to be to run for president like over the course of many years. He didn't want to actually do it. Yeah. We didn't even have a president. No, no, no. He told them no like for years. Like I'm not doing that. You should read his bibliography. It's called Washington. Yeah. Everybody should read that. He was an unbelievable man. So you know, when I think about, okay, Chad, well, you think about who the appropriate leader is for a country. It's got to be someone who really doesn't want to do that. It's got to be somebody who doesn't want to do that, which is an interesting conversation. But it also needs to be somebody with the unique ability to unite people. That is the foundation of the issue. See, we can sit here and say, we want the president of the United States to be a very shrewd business man. We want him to know the system and the laws and all that and all of that stuff is important. But I would go as far as to say, all of that stuff is not necessarily important specifically for the president of the United States. I don't want a president who's a good businessman. I want a president who can unite the country who can bring people together and form this country into a organism that is so freaking strong that it can't be stopped. Just like we did out here on this PT today, I want a person who had, and that's a unique gift to be able to do that. Right. Now, that individual needs people around him who are good at policy who are good at business. But that person, and this is what I look at as if I ran for governor. The only reason I would do that is because I recognize the unique ability that God has given me to unite people. Now, how do you unite people? Well, the best way is through suffering. And let me tell you, anybody listen to this show. If you think we are going to get out of the situation that we are in without suffering, you are choosing to live in an alternate reality. There is a time coming where every single one of us as Americans are going to have to suffer. Now, when that suffering begins, if there is someone in place with a voice who can capitalize on that suffering and use that suffering to unite a nation, to unite a state, it's an unbelievable result. Now, if somebody's in place who's going to use that suffering to continue to tear down the morale of the people, to continue to tear down people's identity as American citizens, to continue to just tear every because you can you you can wield suffering to tear down, or you can wield suffering to unite. I would go as far as to say we are living in a time right now where we are starting to see that suffering happen. It's it's it's already starting. And so when I think about how am I going to you how would I unite the state? I would just straight be straight up with him, hey guys, we about to make some changes and we're going to suffer together. But guess what? We're going to rise up out of this together and we're going to be stronger than you could have ever imagined this state or this United States being. It's the ultimate ingredient suffering is the ultimate ingredient to unite a people. But it can be wielded either direction. And right now it's being wielded to continuously tear down. Yeah, to divide. Yeah. Now I'm not I'm not going to run for president in 20, 20, 28 because you're going to do that. And I'm going to watch you learn from you. And then I think I'm going to come in right behind you. All right. That sounds good. Travis sell it to you. Yeah. I love it, man. Well, guys, let's get into our headlines, man.

California main exploring options to keep Trump off ballot following Colorado ruling. This is this is a big deal. This is a big deal. So let's dive into this a little bit because there's a lot of interesting things happening right now. Let's try to make sense of it. So this is a bright bar article reading. The states of California and Maine are now exploring options to keep former president Trump off their respective state ballots in the wake of Colorado's ruling. As bright bar news reported on Tuesday, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled in a four to three opinion that the Constitution's insurrection clause prohibits former president Donald Trump from appearing on the ballot for the presidency in 2024. Quote, the court found by clear and convincing evidence that president Trump engaged in insurrection as those terms are used in section three of the 14th amendment, the ruling red. The ruling will partially reverse a previous ruling from Colorado district judge Sarah Wallace who ruled in November that the 14th amendment would not apply in the case of former president Trump, being that he is not an officer of the United States and was defined at the time of the amendments ratification following the civil war. So on Wednesday, Maine's secretary of state Shina Bellows, this lady right here, passed up, son. Yeah, it was reported to be seeking options on the weather not to exclude Trump from the state's primary ballot in March. Last week, for instance, attorneys seeking to bar Trump from the ballot argue with Trump's legal team at the state house hearing. Quote, the challenges have the burden of providing sufficient evidence to invalidate the petition. Bellows office said in the statement last week, Quote continued saying, at the hearing that will be an opportunity for both the challengers and the candidate to present oral testimony of witnesses as well as additional documentary evidence and to make all argument pertaining to the challenging light of that evidence. Same things happening over in California and California, Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kulanakalis, this lady, it's a great picture. She on Wednesday to the set, wrote a letter to the secretary of state Shirley Weber to explore options on taking the former president's name off the ballot in California as well. New York is also following suit. New York Dems renewed push to ban Trump from state ballot. It's kind of happened a little bit of everywhere. And there's been some pushback from a few notable people and people who you wouldn't expect pushback from. One of those people I kind of like what he had to say that was Robert F Kennedy. He tweeted out who we all know he's the independent four runner for the 2024 race. He tweeted out this and this is in order. He says, quote, it's time to trust the voters. It is up to the people to decide who the best candidate is, not the courts, the people. That's democracy one on one. He then said, if Trump is kept out of office through judiciary fiat, rather than being defeated in a fair election, his supporters will never accept the results. This country will become ungovernable. And then he finished it out saying, quote, every American should be troubled by the Colorado Supreme Court's decision to remove Trump from the ballot. You got guys down in Texas, Lieutenant Governor Patrick. He's starting to conversation. Maybe we should take Biden off the ballot in Texas. So he's putting that out. Now the Supreme Court, there's several liberal judges for were for taking Trump off three were against, but they've been receiving death threats and all sorts of targeting and warnings about being beheaded and shot. I mean, it's getting pretty serious. But here's the interesting thing that makes absolutely no sense. We've been seeing the polls. We know where Trump is. He's killing it in practically every single state in every poll. But out of nowhere from left field, apparently allegedly more than half of Americans approve of Colorado, this qualifying Trump. New poll shows a quarter or than half. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Right. More than half. Yeah. New poll shows a quarter of Republicans also back the bombshell Supreme Court decision that has sent shock waves across the country. So I call bullshit obviously. And I think most importantly, this is nothing like they they are in fear. They are scared to death of losing. And they know they're going to lose. And this is what they're doing to try to prevent that. Andy Chad, what do we got on this? I got a lot on it. Well, first of all, this is the literal end of the Republic and the end of democracy when the the judicial system steps in and removes somebody from a ballot without Donald Trump has not has not been found guilty of insurrection. In fact, in fact, he was excused of it during the second impeachment. Okay. So now what you have is you have a group of people who are in government deciding that you don't have to be guilty of a crime in order to suffer the repercussions of a crime. And if he was found guilty of insurrection, then they could lawfully remove him from a ballot. And this was intended for Confederate officers to not hold office after the Civil War of who none of them were convicted or where this was used on them at all. Correct. So we have to acknowledge the legal situation that's happened here. And this is actual reality. The Republic of the United States of America is over as of if the Supreme Court does not fix this, it is over. And in my opinion, people should be ready to take up arms. That's where we're at. It's real shit. Okay. This is not anything that America was founded upon. And I do believe that what you're saying that I believe these polls are bullshit. I've had Democrat family members, people who hate fucking Donald Trump recognize the impact of what's actually going on, messaging me, texting me, telling me like, I hate Trump. But this is fucking this is crazy. And I actually think this is pushing more people to support them. I think the more they push, the more people that support them, I believe people are generally starting to see the narrative of what's happening. And the harder they work to contain the narrative, the more people start to think outside the narrative. And I think they're creating a whole new dynamic and a whole new segment of the population of potential voters that are going to vote for him just because. And you know, if I was one of these Supreme Court justices making this decision, you should be prepared because what usually happens in their world countries when these things start to happen is those people get assassinated. They get killed. Yeah, it is the truth. I'm not advocating. I'm not calling for that. I'm just saying what has historically happened. When the destruction of the country actually starts to come, people who are patriots kill those people and hold them accountable. And you know, the next thing we're going to see if this continues to progress is we're going to see the arrests start to happen for wrong thing and hate speech. And then we are going to see the arrests happen for misinformation. And they're going to try to remove all the centers from the country and round them up and kill them. This is the mask in my opinion. This is the mask of communism coming off right in front of your face. And those of you who are approving of this because you don't like Donald Trump or whatever you've been, you know, led to believe or whatever you don't understand what you're cheering for. Because the next time around if this were to have if you were on the other side of this, you'd be terrified. And I think we have a lot of weak people. I think we have a lot of liars. I think we have a lot of corruption. I think we have when I see this poll 54% of people approve that is fucking bullshit. That is bullshit. Paul. So in my opinion, you know, people should be ready for what's coming if this isn't stopped by our Supreme Court. And what's going to come and they could be trying to induce it. They could be trying to incite a literal civil, uh, that's what they want. Civil war or civil conflict or that, you know, it could be that too. They could suspend elections that way and maintain power. I told you for the last couple of years that they were going to find a way to not have elections. And this is a way to not have them. So intentionally stir up the yeah, the pygmy bro, this is disgusting shit. This is disgusting end of America. Shit. And anybody who supports it in my opinion is the enemy of the United States America. No. Chad, what you got? First of all, Andy, I want to thank you for referring to our union here as a republic and not a democracy democracy democracy is my rule. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So thank you for for doing that. Uh, I want to ask you anybody in here. If you know, when was the last time that we had states who Abraham Lincoln? Thank you. Yes. That was the last time that we had states who were removing a presidential candidate from the ballot. What did that result in? Civil war. Civil war. Because it was the same party. I think, I think a lot of, I think a lot of listeners might kind of hear you talking about the seriousness, the dire seriousness of the situation that we are in. And I think that they might just go ahead and just kind of brush over that as just political commentary. I want you guys to understand. Look back at history and look what happened the last time this happened. And I want you to hopefully look at that and say, you know what, oh, Andy over there, he's not just trying to get me razzed up. I'm actually not at all. He's actually right when he describes the, the dire situation that we are facing right now in the United States of America. It is freaking serious, man. It is serious. This is not a joke. This is not a joke anymore. No. Okay. Oh, you know, you remember back in the in the late 90s and early 2000s where, you know, political commentary and you watch the debates and it was just all kind of, uh, it was a dog and pony show, right? It was, you could just kind of laugh at it and it'd make you angry. But then you just kind of realize this is just a dog and pony show. You know, it's not that way anymore, guys. This is, this is not a joke anymore. We cannot take things like this lightly because we have specific examples in the history of our nation that we can look at and then we can watch the result of that. We can look at that in history and, and let me tell you right now, man, all these freaking jack legs that are watching this, all you stinkin red necks that have your guns and stuff and you think, well, bring, bring it on. You're an idiot, man. You don't want that to happen. I'm going to tell you, man, if we ever fall to fighting around here, it's going to be so ugly that you, you, you can't even comprehend it. Children will die. People will starve to death. Ugly, ugly. You don't want that, man. We have to find a better solution. Yeah. And, but the problem is, bro, is that if this isn't reversed by the Supreme Court and these people continue down this path, these are a very loud minority people who are happy to be in power right now who are also very weak physically and unprepared for that kind of situation. And what they're failing to discount is that there's millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of patriotic Americans that are very quiet. Yeah, there is. And they're waiting. And these people, if they don't reverse this decision, like actually, like what I think, and, you know, I'm just just being real. I think those Supreme Court justices in Colorado just signed their own death warrant, regardless if they get the thing flipped over in the Supreme Court or not, because there's some fucking crazy mother fuckers out here that are going to say you started it, bro. Like I would be the history books. I would be very uncomfortable if I were those four Supreme Court people and or any of the people defending them or the police around them or whatever they have, you better be on fucking high alert and it's not going to stop because the Supreme Court stops it. Like this is this is a line that has been crossed now that is very real. And there are elements of the population that are so extreme that they are going to look at these people as targets from now until the end of their lives. And it's nerve wracking and scary. And it's disappointing that we've gotten to this place. But at the end of the day, the people who are rallying around this as the right decision are the weakest least equipped, least intelligent, least resourceful people to handle some sort of disturbance in society, such as you're speaking about. They can't handle it. These people are fat, they're fucking sick. They're loud on the internet. And they think they've got the power and they don't have the power. And if they had the power, the government would have already fucking done what they were trying to do and got rid of all those people. But I'm telling you right now, there are more Americans in this country who you've never heard of that you've never seen that you've never seen on the internet that are well prepared for situations like this. And I think these people are opening up a hornet's nest, whether it be on purpose or whether it's just be their desperate because they understand that accountability is coming, that they're not going to be able to contain and control. And I don't like that. I think that I hope the Supreme Court does its job. But do we have a rogue media? We have a rogue government. We have people who have taken money from foreign adversaries. We have a presidency that is legitimately intentionally destroying the country by all accounts. Every strategic way possible and then acting like they're just dumb and incompetent. And to me, this is all part of what I've been telling you guys. They're not going to, they don't want an election in 2024. And you think what they did in 2020 was, like if what they did in 2020, by creating this public emergency, dividing people along all these lines, shutting down businesses, shutting down society. If you think that that's the end of what they're willing to do to maintain control, what they were willing to do in 2020, pales in comparison to what they're willing to do now because of what they've done between then and now. And what's on the line right now. Yeah, but what I'm saying is, in 2020, it was like, okay, we got to get back in power. Now it's, they've got four years of treasonous activity, legitimately, okay, to cover up for that they're going to be held accountable for if this man gets back in power. And I believe that there are nothing off the table for these people in order to get their way. And I think if the Supreme Court reverses this decision, it will be something else that will be that much more drastic. And we need to all be prepared for it. And real talk, dude, if we lived in a society that was that our military was actually holding its oath and our police were actually holding their oath that they've taken, they would arrest the people doing these things because this is anti the Constitution. If our, if our military was led by actual people who took that oath and took it seriously, if our three letter agencies, if though, if those people had taken that oath seriously, if our police departments had taken that oath seriously, those Supreme Court justices would be in jail right now, right now. And so what are administration? And so it's disappointing because I always grew up thinking that like our military was there to stand between us and a tyrannical government. And that's just not the case right now. They're standing on the other side. And it's unfortunate, dude, but it seems to be the case because I haven't seen anybody in the military stand up and say, hey, now fuck this. And so it's scary. It's scary, dude. And we see all this predictive programming coming out about cyber attacks or civil war or pandemics. And I think the next 24 or the next, the next year is going to be very destructive to our country. Yeah, well, I'm just not thinking of it sooner than that because we're about to give them to head on number two. Guys, on this topic, let us know what you guys think. Hashtag Trump. I don't think it matters what you think of Trump. It doesn't matter. It shouldn't matter what you think of Trump, what you don't think of Trump. What matters is is that they are doing something that's legitimately against the constitution of our country right now, fucking faces with zero apologies and zero regret. And they don't care. And you have the mainstream media on the internet cheering this shit on. You have people cheering this shit on. If you're cheering this shit on, dude, you're a traitor to this country. That's a fact. That's a fact. It doesn't matter what Trump is. And when they say, like Nikki Haley said recently, I think today or yesterday, another Trump presidency will destroy democracy. You have to understand what she's talking about. She's not, she is a establishment fucking pond. And what she's talking about, the destruction is exactly what the rest of us want destroyed, okay, which is their corrupt communist, Marxist ideology, oppressive government system. That will be destroyed if Trump gets elected. I 100% agree. But it's not democracy, like what they're presenting it to be. It's the corrupt system that oppresses us all that takes more than half of our money and tax that fucking, and you're saying, oh, well, I don't pay half my money in tax. The fuck you don't, you just can't do math, okay? You can't add up all you think taxes income tax. You don't talk about the tax you pay when you buy shit, sell shit, own shit. The tax you got to pay on all these different things everywhere you go to fill up your truck or fill up your car or do all these things. The death tax that you pay where they take 60 to 65% of your shit when you die, like we are slaves in this country. And to this democracy, we are fucking slaves up. And if we're being honest, that does need to be destroyed. So when Nikki Haley says, he's going to destroy democracy. What she's really saying is our corrupt ability to take advantage of the American citizens will end if Trump is elected president, which to me is a pretty fucking strong endorsement. That was sound too bad. Yeah. And I'll take his mean tweets and all the shit that you guys don't like about him. I take that shit all day long. Yeah. Well guys, let's keep this journey moving. Let's get to headline number two because this is another big one and this may actually give some context to the timing of everything. This is another one of those articles, man, that popped up. There's not a lot of people talking about it. So let's talk about it. Headline number two. Headline number two reads, Jeffrey Epstein, scandal federal judge to unseal 180 previously redacted names. This is a massive deal. This is a massive deal. And I believe this is what's going to start this. They can't. Those two stories came out on the same day. Within hours apart. Some draw man. Yeah. Listen, I'm just saying like I'm not an alarmist, but guess what Paul Revere was an alarmist. That's how I look at it. All right. There's some shit going on here. So let's dive into this. This is a Fox News article reading a federal judge in New York has ordered the unsealing of dozens of documents naming people linked to the disgraced financier and sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein. The documents are expected to identify more than 180 people, including associates, victims, investigators and journalists who covered the case. Some of the names will remain under seal, including those belonging to minor victims who never spoke publicly about the case. And a person who the judge said was wrongly identified as an alleged perpetrator by a reporter. At least one person acts the court not to release her name arguing that it could put her at risk of physical harm. Now this was a victim who did testify under under oath and under seal. She's asking to remain redacted. Probably is reasons because these people have called out all these people. So US district judge Loretta Preska outlined the reasoning in a 51 page order on Monday. The order comes as part of a 2015 lawsuit between Epstein accused of Virginia, Goufre and his former lover and accomplice, Gleimax. Well, the case was settled in 2017, but the judge indicated in hearings in 2021 and 2022 that the names would not remain sealed indefinitely. So Goufre has alleged that Epstein and Maxwell trafficked her when she was 17 years old. She's now in her 30s. Some of the names have been withheld in the documents, but belong to people who have either spoken publicly about their connection to Epstein. I've already been identified in other court documents or were identified in Maxwell's trial. So the order included a two-week delay. Okay, so we're almost what we got seven more days? No, 10 more days. I think we're looking at 10 more days before all hell breaks loose allegedly. You know, so and people to talk about it, Senator Marsha Blackburn, she tweeted out, I'm pleased that this court agrees with my calls for transparency and accountability on Epstein and his associates. The American people deserve to know who participated in Epstein's crime with Virginia Goufre responding back to that saying, quote, finally, we are hearing members of the US government senators about the need for transparency and they call to arms for accountability. There's going to be a lot of nervous people over Christmas and New Year's 170 to be exact. Who's on the naughty list? This wouldn't be possible without the honorable judge Presco. What we got on this? Well, 170 is only a small fraction of the actual names that they have. So that's something that people should recognize. It's like 10% or 8% of the total names. So it's not like a full transparency. That's first thing. Second thing is this came out the same day as the previous story. So we have to remember all these indictments that have happened against Trump, which through every single legitimate legal expert has said contain no real basis in their process. We even had one of his attorneys, a parliamentary on the show to talk about that. They come out with a, every time something happens to them, they come out with something against Trump. And this is the same. These people look, dude. Epstein's case coming out. Okay, let's get Trump harder. Look, dude. Here's the deal. Epstein Island was a Mossad CIA op to blackmail people of influence to control the narrative society. That's what the fuck it was. How do you think they get all these Hollywood people to say whatever the fuck they say? How do you think they get people to fucking advocate for things they wouldn't normally advocate for? How do you get? How do you think they get Hollywood to do what they do in Hollywood and push all this fucking crazy woke shit? A man is a woman, a woman is a man blah, blah, blah, blah, all this politically correct nonsense garbage that isn't based on truth or reality or fact. How do you think they get so many people to do it? They fucking blackmail them. Like I've been telling you for fucking years. Okay, they go up to them. They say, hey, come to my island. I'm a big baller. I got a plane. You want to come? It's going to be awesome. You go there. They have video cameras on the every inch of the island and they invite people like, you know, these guys who own these platforms, right, to come down and then they get them getting a back massage or worse from some underage girl that they don't even know is underage, right? Because let's be real, dude. A 17 or a 16 year old girl can very easily look 25. All right, you give somebody a couple drinks. You're not going to fucking know and a lot of Kate. You're not going to know. And what are you going to do? Ask for ID? No, they're not asking for ID. I'm just being real, dude. These are fucking people who go there to party and hobnab with their wealth and show off their fucking shit. I'm a somebody and they got caught up in this in this blackmail operation. And there's this is one of many blackmail operations that is a cooperative between our government and Israel, which is why you have so many of these fucking government people advocating for Israel so fucking hard. Okay, because they understand what Israel has on our own people. So when we all when you think about what this actually is and why they defend it and why it's protected and why people get killed over it, that's why. And that's what we're dealing with. And so you you guys, you know, there's all kinds of conspiracies, you know, that there's this massive pedophilia network and people are being true. I do, who knows how deep this goes or how big it is. But look, dude, at the very basis, listen, very basic shit. At the very basic shit, it's a blackmail operation to control society, control the world and have their narratives push to create the culture that they want, which has been very obvious. I do. This is why the social media networks behave the way they do, because they're all on these fucking lists where they're all compromised people. And so once they realize that they're on the inside of that, they voluntarily go along because they realize so many other people are too. We can't tell each other why do you think, oh shit, Oprah, you're exactly why do you think these people all say the same shit? Why is Jimmy Kimmel saying the same shit as Oprah saying the same shit as fucking, uh, whoopie Goldberg saying the same shit as all these actors. Like why? And I'm that's allegedly, by the way, like I'm alleging. Okay, I'm speculating. We can substitute many names in for that. But like those are the names that come to mind. All right, I'm not saying that they are guilty. You know what I'm saying? But what I'm saying is it's possible. Okay, so when we look at how this is all played out and the narratives that are put down through society and we look at the world economic forum, we look at how they brag about pushing down culture. You got you got the biggest most powerful leaders in the world bragging in front of the world about how they force culture through business financing to make businesses who take loans, uh, and force a certain kind of culture inside their, their business that is not meritocracy. Okay, that is not around who's the best for the job. It's more around, you know, meeting certain quotas or things like, uh, like bro, this is and it's all presented as like being a good person. Bro, it's all bullshit and it's all forced on us. And this is at the center of it, which is why they protect it so much. That story is the biggest fucking story in the history of the United States America and probably the world, which is why they defend it so much. You know, you know, by the way, that's that information that I just gave you about it being a massage CIA up. Where do you think I, you think I made that up? Most fucking, I was told that by people who were in those organizations directly. Okay, so there's that. What? No, I was, uh, I was about to say, I forgot what I was about to say. Well, I think I think it's because, you know, Andy, when you break this down like this, I mean, do your mind, the way your mind works is unbelievable. The way that you can see these situations, the way that you can break them down, I can't do that, dude. So like when you break stuff down like that, it almost leaves you freaking speechless, man. Well, bro, maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think I am. No, no, and it's like, it leaves me speechless because I'm like, wow, I, we live in a fucking matrix, bro. First of all, I can't comprehend that level of not not only wickedness, but corruption. Yeah. And so the whole time you're breaking that down, what am I thinking? I'm thinking, okay, this makes freaking sense because Andy has a very unique gift that's given to him by God to be able to see things like this and break it down. That's one of your unique gifts, all right? And when I listen to him do that the whole time, I'm listening to him. I'm like, dang, like, okay, what do we do about this? What do we do about a, a, a literal level of, of wickedness and corruption that cannot even be comprehended by, you know, your, your, your, your, your, your, the mind of a, of a freaking good human being. A good person. Right. Right. Like what, like, what the crap do we do about this, man? And then it leaves me with this feeling of like, it's so deep. It's so entrenched. It's so intertwined that like, I just cannot see again, a way of fixing this without suffering greatly without literally, they're going to force that on us, dude, without it literally being torn down to the foundations and, and being rebuilt. And, I think that's what they intend on doing, dude. I think they, they intend to instigate the destruction of this country so that they can rebuild it. That's why we have these guys who are building bunkers and fucking Hawaii for $200 million in shit like that. Well, I, I, I would agree with you on that, but I don't, but I don't think they want to build back some sort of fucking utopia shit there in charge of. I don't think it's for the reconstruction of, of a, of a, of a nation. I think it's, it's for the reconstruction of a, of a global, of course, of course, totally agree. Because that's the thing they have to destroy Nash, like our national pride, they have everything to destroy all that. And ultimately, they want to destroy everything. The infrastructure, the highways, the systems, they want to completely destroy this, like when we say destroy this country, people think of it metaphorically. Like we think, oh, they want to, they want to make this country not what it used to be. That's not what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about is total actual destruction of the country so that it can be rebuilt and think of the money to be made on the reconstruction of a country. Think of the money, like you see what I'm saying? Like if we, if we, if us three were the most evil people in the world and we said, fuck dude, you know what we could do? We could fucking destroy this country. We could wipe out the currency, start our own currency, reset it and make a fucking fortune rebuilding the country the way we want it to be. And that's what we're dealing with here. We're dealing with a bunch of super elite, super wealthy, above and their mind above the rest of the world type individuals. We are above them. They are peasants. They are, they look at us as expendable nuisances to their plan. They didn't, like you guys because you have good hearts and you believe like in your neighbor and you say, man, you know what? That fucking guy, he likes Trump, but you know what? He's still all right, dude, right? Like that's America for the fellow countrymen. For sure. That's America, dude. Like with, with, with the exception of people who are on the far, far, far progressive communist side who are, it's literally 0.001% of the country. Everybody else is like, he's different, but he's still a good person. Yeah, yeah. You know what I'm saying? These people are literally pawns of Satan. That's correct. They, these people, I actually believe that's actually literally true. I believe that literally true. Tucker Carlson just talked about this in an interview, dude. He was asked about aliens about what aliens actually were because there's a story that Eisenhower actually made a pact with a, with the aliens in the 1950s. And it's, it's historically documented if you dig into it. Eisenhower actually like was in one location and then another location over the course of an impossible amount of time. And he has believed to have been transported by these aliens. Okay? It's, it's, it's no, do you know that that's, that's biblical? Like that, that's a biblical, that, that fits with a biblical narrative, right? No, I didn't know that. Yeah, yeah. Go, go and read. I think it's Genesis 6. The Bible actually, so what is an alien defined? It's an extra terrestrial being. Yeah. So the biblical narrative talks about in many places, these extra terrestrial beings, they're mentioned as angels, as, as demons, as, as these other entities that are not human, that live outside the realm of earth. The Bible actually gives a description of those beings coming to earth and making packs with men and actually get this breeding human, women, and producing a race of hybrid humans called Nephilim. They were giants. They were called, they're described in the Bible as the heroes of old. And part of the reason that the Lord destroyed the earth in the flood was to destroy this tainted race of humanity. This all fits with the biblical narrative. Go read Genesis 6 about the sons of God, literal extraterrestrial beings coming to earth, sharing knowledge with man, and then actually reproducing with females and producing this race. This is all in the Bible. I didn't know that. Yeah, most people don't know it. So when, when you talk about aliens, I'm like, well, yeah, yeah, we can call them aliens all day long. So Tucker just did, I forgot Tim Kast or one of the other big shows. And it was like a live show when he talked about aliens. And, and he was told by someone in our system, apparently, that these aren't actually aliens. They're actually demons. Yeah. And they, these demons made a pact with the world leaders. But a demon is an alien. Yeah. It is an terrestrial. I never heard that before. So like to me, I was like, fuck, like that doesn't sound good. You know, so, yeah. So the idea that he's talking about is that there's a pact, legitimate evil pact amongst people who worship Satan, who are not of God, who are legitimately here to destroy the planet and destroy humanity. I realize it's Satan. They, they, they probably don't even realize. Dude, why do you think all these Satan is a deceiver? Why do you think all these statues of Satan are going up in certain places of the world? And it's particularly in government building. Yeah. Yeah, dude. The best thing Satan ever did was convince the world that he wasn't real. He's been a deceiver since he was in the garden of Eden. He deceived the first, the first two examples of humanity that were ever created, right? So this all makes total, this all makes total sense to me. I know it sounds crazy to people who are like logical thinkers and they're maybe not that spiritual or not, but we have, we have, we have to look at things as the way that they are. You know, and we've clearly live in a very corrupt anti-good environment. You know what I'm saying? Like it's not good for kids to be exposed to men dressed up as women and have them dance around. I mean, there's good and evil. Yeah, I know. So what I'm saying is is a lot of people have lost sight of that, bro. Oh, yeah, yeah. A lot of people really don't believe in that. Like a lot. Excellent. That's, that's the ultimate objective of Satan. Yes. That's the, but a lot of people have for, like legitimately, dude, like I'm saying, it's in a literal way. A lot of people do not believe that there are consequences for their actions that they take while they're here on earth later. So if you believe, most of the people that listen to this show believe in some sort of higher being, okay, whether they be Christian or working here. Yeah, yeah. All of them do. Most of them believe in, you know, they might be Christian or they might be Muslim, but they answer to something, okay? Well, you have to realize is that there is a whole lot of people that believe that this is it, and it doesn't matter what they do or not do when they're here. And that's, that's a, that's a non relatable character trait for people that believe. Okay. So if you're dealing with people, a group of people who do not believe that consequences and morality. Yes, they don't believe that. Yes, they don't believe like basic things like vows, shall not kill. Okay? Or whatever, right? If you have people who just don't believe that there's any consequence for anything, what are those people capable of doing to people that are? Okay, because because you have one, you're very basic. You have one team on one side of the football field and you have another team on the other side. And one team's playing with no rules and the other team's playing with a whole bunch of rules. Okay? And that means that the team plays with no rules is going to be very easily able to have an advantage over the team that plays by the rules. And so, playing in the weather, not back in the blind. And you know, we need, we need a whole bunch of good men who are willing to say, you know what? Rules of the size. Fuck the rules for a minute. That's also biblical. What's happened? Yeah. You have no, you have no grounds for morality, whatsoever without a creator without without a without a like one of the attributes of anything that is true. Something that is true has to come from an outside source, right? Because in other words, you're just making things up in your head, right? So it had, we have to start with saying there is a creator that cares for us and that has given us this guideline for how we should live this life and treat this earth and treat each other. Because if you don't have that, what are your grounds for your grounds? You have no grounds for morality. Yeah, that's exactly right. You have, you have, you have destruction of any civil boundaries. You have, you have exactly what the fuck these people are about is what you have. Yeah, you got, and you got a lot of people listening, get freaking tired of me talking about my faith and all this stuff. And I'm like, man, it's literally the foundation of civilization. Yeah, it's the foundation of civilization. And so these individuals that don't have any belief, like you said, in any repercussions for their actions here on earth, well, how there's no negotiating with those people? No, no, no, no, you cannot negotiate and negotiate with pure evil. Yeah, cannot negotiate it with because those individuals and these individuals that we're talking about that are in the upper, whatever you want to call it, echelons of society that think they're above everyone else, we say they're being controlled by this evil being that we name as Satan. Well, and they don't even know it because what's happened is they have been turned over to what's called a reprobate mind. So, a minute ago, I mentioned they don't even know their, what they're doing is evil. Yeah, well, we call them now as NPCs. Yeah, they've been turned over to a reprobate mind to where if you rebel against God for long enough, this is why it's dangerous to rebel against God. When you have some inclination of, you know what, man, this Jesus, this might be for real, when that is God engaging you, right? And if you rebel against him for long enough, he will turn you over to a reprobate mind to where you are unsavable at that point. This is crazy that you say this. This is crazy that you say this because I have a totally different, I have a, I have a different way of understanding that's true, but it has to do with a lot of drugs. Okay, so I got to tell the story because it's appropriate. So, I might have done some mushrooms, all right, on accident. Okay, so one of my buddies owns a mushroom company and he makes these little chocolate bars and he gave me some of them for anxiety. And I've never done any drugs besides smoke weed. That's the only drug I've ever done besides mushrooms now. And I was eating these chocolates which were little squares. And I'm in the, also people don't understand, I'm in the cannabis business. So, to make concentrated cannabis like a little cartridge of people smoke on a vape, it takes a lot of marijuana. Okay, and that's what I know about making drugs. That's about the extent. Some other people I know some others, some other people in this room might know more than that. Okay, but that's what I know. So I ate all these chocolate bars and I had a friend who had access to the actual mushrooms. And one day I was in my garage and I was smoking and I was like, you know what, I'm out of the chocolates. So I'm going to try some of these mushrooms. And I had never eaten the real mushrooms before. So I didn't know how many to eat. So I text my friend and say, how many of these do I eat? And he said one gram. Okay, now remember, I'm already been smoking. Okay, so I'm not really thinking that clearly. So I go up to my house and I get a scale. And the scale is a little food scale. And I start weighing these mushrooms out. And I weigh the mushrooms out and I'm putting them on there. And like, it's starting to look like a lot. Like, it's starting to look like like a fucking like a lot. Yeah, like a lot. But in my mind, I'm thinking like, all right, well, that makes sense because I'm eating these little chocolates and it probably took like a lot of mushrooms to make the chocolates have that much psilocybin in it, right? Juice. So it may know, it made sense to me. I'm like, looking at him like, all right, well, fuck, dude, this seems like a lot. So I eat them. And it's like a pile like this big dude. And so I eat them all. And and I go up and I sit by my pool and I'm like chilling and I'm like, I'm looking up at the sky. And I'm just like, dude, I fucking feel great. I started feeling pretty good. I looked up in the sky and like, the sky, the clouds start to twist and move and like kind of go together. And I'm like, and I never seen that before. I'm like, oh, fuck. Like, you have crap happening like that in Hillweat. Really? So so so listen. So I had the mushrooms. So I started thinking about it. And I'm like, I'm like, fuck, I wonder if I ate too much. So I went down and checked the scale. And I had to set on ounces and not grams. Okay. So what's the fucking? What's that? What's that? How many grams are in ounce? Okay. Well, I ate that much mushrooms. 28 grams. I ate 20. I ate 20. It's a fucking shit, ton bro. And he said, he won. Graham one gram and I ate 28 grams. Okay. I've been headed to the emergency. So dude. So I didn't I'm like, so now I'm like freaking a fuck out. I'm like, oh, fuck, dude. I'm like, I don't know what's going to happen. So I call Emily on the phone. And I'm like, Hey, I was out by the pool. It's a hey, come outside. She's like, I'm making dinner. I'm like, no, you need to come outside and she didn't know I had been like, eating these little chocolates and shit. So I'm like, Hey, look, I promise you, I'm not like going off the rails. I'm not turning the drugs. I tried these things from anxiety. They were working. And I think I might have fucked up. All right. And I started having these like legitimate visual hallucinations, dude, like legitimate. Like I was looking at my phone and the fucking screen went to three screens. Like I started seeing all this crazy shit. And I saw like four distinct visions during the like five hours that I was in outer space, which is where I fuck I was. But the first vision that it fucking showed showed me the first vision was this. The first vision was me and a swimming in a river. Okay. And there was a river and it was rapids. And it showed me swimming in the river, but I was swimming upstream. Okay. And when you're in this state, I don't know how to describe it. But it's like information is being downloaded into your brain. It's not like I have to comprehend it or think about it or think like, is this true or is this not true? I'm not saying it's true. I'm saying that's how it was perceived. Like I'm getting information. This is this is this is what's happening here. Okay. And it's an understanding. It's like a different. If you've never experienced it, it's hard to describe. But what it was telling me was it showed me in the river and it showed me swimming up river. And it showed a bunch of rocks downstream in the river. And what it showed me was the reason that I feel so fucking anxious and angry and frustrated all the time is because I'm denying my true purpose. Okay. And my true purpose, which I'm not going to share, but it's very big. But it showed me if I would just swim with the river, I could avoid all the rocks. And that was the first thing. But the second thing it showed me, which brings me to the point that you just said, was it showed me like two people that were clear. And when I say it showed me the reason I say that is because that's what it was. It was like a revelation. It was like not up for debate. It was like someone saying, this is the way it is. And it showed me two imagine these two water bottles that were both shaped like a human being. Okay. And they're next to each other. And then you know, like a Yin and a Yang, you know, the Yin Yang symbol. Okay. So it showed me one of those. And Yin Yang, like what it showed me is like good and evil. Okay. Like the light and the dark. And so it showed these two silhouettes of these human beings. And the top part was white. The bottom part was black and they both started out like that. Okay. And then it showed the levels kind of go like this. And then the level of black on this one over here, all the way to the top. And it stopped going back and forth. Okay. It stopped going up. And now just turn black. And this was the way it is. And this one continued to go like this. Okay. And what it was telling me was that once someone is consumed like you're talking about, what'd you call it? The mind. Yeah. You went once you've rebelled for so long, God will turn you over to a reprobate mind. A reprobate mind. Yeah. An unsavable human being. Exactly. An actual evil human. Yep. Okay. So what it showed me was when it was telling me or when I came to understand was because I have a big heart for people. And my biggest fucking weakness in my life is that I give people too many fucking chances. And what it showed me was that there are certain people that are consumed by this darkness that are unfucking savable. They are not savable. They will hurt you. They will kill you. They will fucking destroy you. If you allow them in if you allow them to, they will. And that was like an understanding it was like trying to download. So like what it was saying was, hey, dude, some of these people are fucking bad. And you need to recognize them as bad. And you need to deal with them as if they are bad. And that's what it was telling me very strongly. Can't help them. Can't fix them. Can't fix them, bro. And they'll destroy you if you allow them. Andy, what the crap, man? Hold on. The next, the next fucking. Oh, yeah. There were three. There was four. Four. Okay. The next vision that it gave me was imagine a pole vertical like this. Okay. And on the pole, there were discs. All right. At the top, there was a very small disc. The next disc was like this big. The biggest disc was like this big. And then underneath was a smaller disc. Okay. About the size of the second disc. All right. And on the big disc was most people. It showed most people in these. And what it was showing me was levels of awareness. Okay. Most people are not aware. They don't understand what's actually going on. And then it showed me the people who are on the second disc. But it actually identified those people as people that I know. So people, these were famous people that you would all know. But I don't want to say their names. Okay. These are people who are sort of cultural leaders who may not be like the most powerful people. But they are very influential people that understand what's going on. And they are kind of controlling the messaging for these people. Right. And then the top disc was like the people who changed the world, the people who legitimately like are here for a real reason. They're here for a fucking reason. And then on the bottom disc, it showed all those people that were the black, the people that were filled with the black. They were all on the bottom disc. They were like, they were like below everybody else. And it showed me where I fit on that tower, which I'm not going to talk about. But the last thing it showed me, which was the most like reassuring thing that I think helped me the most was that it showed me that there is a there is like when people talk about life and death, there's a very legitimate crossing of over. And it showed me the other side of like what it looks like. And it wasn't like what I thought. This is like, it's going to make me emotional probably because like, I saw, I saw all the people that had passed away that I've known. And there's some people who have passed away in my life who I could have been better to. And the when I went over there, it was, it was, it was like everybody looked like a football, like if you took a football and you turn it on its side, everybody looked like one of these footballs. But they were just like, I couldn't see their face and I couldn't hear their voice. But they were telling me things without audibly hearing it. So like it was like an understanding. Okay. And this was like people, like I said that like, you know, they had passed on and you know how like when someone passes on, you sort of like wish you would have done something different or you know, like for example, you know, my grandpa who passed away called me like a week before he died, asked me to come see him. I was 17 years old and I was too busy to go see him and he fucking died. Shit like that. Okay. And that's something I live with that bothers me. And it was cool because I could hear them talking to me and telling me like, Hey man, it's all good. Like this is this we're good. Everything's good. You're doing a good job. You shouldn't you shouldn't feel that way. And uh, it was just a very like a very good feeling all in all. Um, but it felt super real, dude. And like, I know there's going to be people like a lot of you guys that do this shit all the time. You think you got it all figured out none of what I said means that that's the way it is, but that was the experience I had. And uh, it was very impactful. And I have a fucked with mushrooms a single time since then and I probably never will again because I got everything I needed to know from it. And I believe I believe that I was being shown real things. And um, anyway, the story is right in line with what you're saying. Yeah. Is that once people are consumed with the darkness, they are done. And there's no saving them. And we have to understand in society that there are very evil people out here that will kill you without hesitation and do not care what happens to you or your fucking family or fucking anybody that you care about. And if you continue to pacify and act passively and let these people do this, they will fucking harm you. And and do we as a culture, as a society have to the good people of society have to stand up and draw a line that we are not going to tolerate the shit from these people anymore under the guise of tolerance, under the guise of, uh, you know, that taking the high road, we're not taking the high road by tolerating evil. That's not taking the high road that's being a fucking coward. So anyway, I don't mean to get emotional, but like it was a very impactful real experience. No, man, I want to, I want to honor you, man, for for for, for laying that vision out for people are those four visions because, uh, I mean, when you, when you get visions like that in your life, like those are pretty sacred things. Yeah. And you got to sit on those for a while before you bring them out and you tell people about them. You know what I mean? Yeah. And, um, you know, it's interesting because the, the Lord has given me visions in my life, uh, on a few occasions, very, very powerful that changed the trajectory of my life in the way that I think and the decisions that I'm making. So that is real. That is real. And I've never experienced what you experienced under the, under the influence of the mushroom. I don't understand what's going on there, but something is going on there. I don't understand it, but something is going on there. I would say just as friends, when you, when you receive these visions, the first thing that that I do is I go to the word of God. And I say, is what I learned is the message that was portrayed to me through that vision. Is it in alignment with the literal word of God that has been written in the Holy Bible? And if any part of that vision for me personally is out of alignment with what is written in scripture, I know that that part of the vision was a lie that was being spoken into me. So we can go to the word of God. We can check that message with the word of God. And then we can be confident that it was either true or that it was false. And so it's very interesting, man, because the messages that you received by way of those visions, I know the Bible will. They fit within the context of the word of God. And you identified that. Actually, what I said from the word of God prompted you to share that. Yeah, dude, it was the exact, it was the exact thing. And so, and so, uh, uh, man, that's freaking huge, dude. And I, and I, and I by no means I've never used mushrooms. I've never smoked weed, man. And I don't advocate for it. But, but I cannot discredit what you just said because it fits within the context of wrong telling you to do. It felt so real. Like it felt like the it felt like I was being legitimately told this is the way that it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's how certain it was. Yeah. And I want, I want to encourage the listeners. If, uh, if you, like me, feel opposed to using these substances, I want to encourage the listeners, you can receive those same revelations. You can receive that same knowledge. You can see things clearly by understanding the word of God. Now, that takes years of seeking, intentionally seeking, and submitting yourself to the Lord. But these things and, and also actual visions, you can receive them without the use of these substances and they are real. And they're impactful. So if you're opposed to it, don't think, yeah, I'm not telling you to go do that. I need to go and take mushrooms to receive because what Andy just described to us is right there in, in the, in the word of God, it's put in a very similar manner. So you can come to the same conclusion if you will go and intentionally seek the wisdom of the Lord in his word. And so that's been my path. Mm hmm. That's been my path since 2012. That's been my path. Yeah. And, uh, I just commend you, man. I honor you, brother. Every time I come in here, I just, I'm just blown away. Well, I mean, you know, I was doing drugs. I mean, like, look, dude, I'm not at listen. Don't go do that. Like, I'm telling you, because it made me sit too. I got sick as fuck. It's so hard for me to comment on that, man, because, because you know, I don't understand. I do know this that people who are using these substances are tapping into something that is out of this dimension. I do know that. Here's the danger I see in it. The danger I see in it is when you are tapping into another, you're opening your mind up to another dimension where there are beings. And you interact with these beings and you actually receive messages from these beings. I believe that's really happening. The, the, the, the, the danger is you don't know if this being is good or evil. And evil doesn't mean that this being is going to give you a message that you don't like. Evil is deceptive. So you can be deceived about something that you perceived as good, but you're being deceived. And that's why you have to go to the word of God and bounce it off what is written in scripture. So for me, I believe it's a really, really powerful, real thing. A lot of my buddies do this. A lot of my buddies are using this as treatment. And they come to me and they tell me about their experiences. And again, my only thing is you don't know the intentions of that being that you interacted with. That's the dangerous part for me. So there was two things that happened on top of this. Okay. That like, write it like during after I saw this shit, two, two things happened. One, I wrote something that's smart. Yeah. Well, you get a vision. I had Emily T notes. Emily sat next to me for like three hours and took all these notes. 11 pages actually, which I've never read since then because I don't have to because I remember exactly what happened. But another two things happened to me. And I'm going to find. I'm going to find this picture. This happened like legitimately right after the, the, the vision part of it. So here we go. I'm also going to read you what I wrote. So on my house, those of you that know my house, you know that I live in a house that is a plantation style house. It has a wrap around porch. Yeah. Some history behind it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The property belong to former president of the United States, you list us as grant. And I'm trying to find this picture. DJ, what you think about all this man? Probably it's 100% real. 100% real. I mean, I think the other thing is two man, like, you know, we get told on time we're only using 10% of our brains, right? Oh, yeah. I don't even know that. How did the person that told us that know that? Right? And what's the other 90% for? You know, I did not think that we are all more connected than what we believe or understand we are. Collective conscious consciousness. That's a real thing. That's a real thing. You know, and like, there's just plenty of things that we've yet to understand. And I think that we have examples of collective consciousness in nature actually 100% school of fish. Yeah. School of fish trees themselves. You also have it in business. You know, when you get every single person to believe in the same vision of business, things happen much faster. Yeah. You know, and so I think there's a lot of things that are out there that, you know, we may not understand how they work, but they work. It's real things. And it's been documented throughout the history of mankind. And so I think, you know, and will there be some steps of substances that, you know, could help unlock some of that? For sure. You know, I think it's, I think it's ignorant and irresponsible to say no. So, so I'm going to show you, I will show you this picture. Okay. This is on my porch of my house. I can put it up on the thing. Yeah. And what this is is that I was standing there like being like, what the fuck is going on? And this fucking deer walked up on my porch and walked up to me about me to you away. And just like looked at me and like it stood right there. And I took a picture of it. And I said into my buddy Matt and I'm like, Hey, bro, like check this out. Like this is what. And he's like, that's a sign of good fortune or whatever he had a, he had a reason for it. Well, wouldn't it because like, you know, the deer they eat the mushrooms and shit. So, hold on. So, I took this picture and after I took the picture, you could see in the picture, it's looking right at me. And after I took the picture, it walked up to me about me to you away and looked at me for like 30 seconds and then fucking ran off. Okay. That's the first thing that happened. And then I wrote this thing. I don't even know why I should read this, but I will. This is what I wrote. Said nothing of what I am meant to do here on earth is evident to people yet. Anything of what I've done so far is just the very beginning of what I know I'm here to do and I will do it. I've had many signs pointing me and I've accepted them and I say this in peace. I love everyone. Humanity is at its natural state when it is in harmony. It's the worst parts of humanity that causes to live in a perpetual state of war with one another. We don't deserve what we have been being dealt and I will work to stop this until I'm either dead or it is fixed. That I give you my word I will never stop. And that's what I wrote. So I just want you to know man that uh that what's happening to you. I'm being called like like yeah. Like right now what's happening to you is uh is is not something to be taken lightly. I don't and and and and the the important part of me saying that is is not not that I not I'm not trying to tell you like don't believe this is coincidence. I'm trying to tell you to be very careful in your interpretation of these things that are happening so that you can sift truth from deception. Yeah because there is potentially both things present potentially. Yeah. And so this is so I can tell you for a fact both things are present. It is so important. And and what I want to tell you is um is you should seek the Lord first for the true interpretation of what is happening to you. And a lot of times we want to message the people and get people's opinions like like our friends like uh like your buddy that you texted right we want to met we with this freaking what the crap is happening right now we want we want to do that because we we want to make sense of it right off the bat and we're helping that someone someone's opinion is going to help help us make sense of this but ultimately the Lord God your creator is the one who will reveal the truth of these things to you the pure truth and now sometimes he may use individuals to do that right he we have examples of that in the Bible we have examples of Daniel revealing the meaning of these visions that were being had by King Nebuchadnezzar and Daniel is used by God to reveal the meaning of these visions to the King so God will use people but just understand that the Lord will provide those people to you you don't have to seek them the Lord will provide those people to you crazy story yeah I'm giving my opinion now it's all good man like I get it this is this is my this is my lane man yeah but no means am I telling you what to do I know that I'm not telling you what to do I'm just telling you just you said that and made me think of that story right away yeah like right away and like I could have told that happened in July of 2022 I could have told that story a million times it's actually a pretty funny story like if I tell it in a funny setting it's funny as fuck no it's a but um yeah I definitely was out there but you know I was in spirit world you know it's saying uh but yeah fuck it yeah you see the size of that chicken like you don't even know that joke that's the young guns baby that's OG film anyway they drink peyote and they see a big chicken anyway what's topping number three we got another topic we do we got one more all right well guys Andy our third and final headline at number three has on number three reads federal judge blocks California law that would have banned carrying firearms in most public places a massive win this is a big deal it's good to see so let's dive into this a little bit this is AP news article reading uh a federal judge on Wednesday blocked a California law that would have banned carrying firearms in most public places ruling that it would that it violates the second amendment of the US Constitution and deprives people of their ability to defend themselves and their loved ones on the law signed by governor Gavin Newsom in September was set to take effect January 1st it would have prohibited people from carrying concealed guns in 26 places including public parks and playgrounds churches banks and zoos the exact places that are getting robbed and looted every single day and that convenient now the ban would apply whether that person has a permit to carry a concealed weapon or not one exception would be for privately owned businesses that put up sign saying people are a loud to bring guns on their premises so US district judge Kormack Korni granted a preliminary injunction blocking the law which he wrote was quote sweeping repugnant to the second amendment and openly defiant of the Supreme Court the court case against the law will proceed while the law is blocked the judge wrote that gun rights groups are likely to succeed improving it unconstitutional meaning it would be permanently overturned the decision as a victory for the California rifle and pistol association which suit uh to block the law uh the measure overall the states rules for concealed carry permits in light of the US Supreme Court's decision in New York state rifle and pistol association the brewing uh which set several states scrambling to react with their own laws um so Chuck Michael who is the California Association's president he said California progressive politicians refused to accept as a Supreme Court's mandate from the brewing case and I try and get every creative ploy they can imagine to get around it uh quote the court saw through the state's gambit um so that's a big win um I just thought that was awesome and just on this gun conversation um this year alone we're setting records in America so just in November uh the gun sells top 1.5 million guns were sold in just November um and so far in 2023 there has been 13.57 million guns sold in the US according to NICS figures um look for that number to increase somewhat in 2024 due to an interesting anomaly sells trends show that gun purchases take upward during presidential election years in 2024 promises to be yet another contentious season what we got on this um it's not an anomaly the government's legitimately removing candidates from ballots and removing the principles that this republic stands for and that's that's not an anomaly this is a direct reaction to decisions that are being made by tyrants it's cause and effect they're correct it's not an anomaly okay people are afraid crime is at a very high rate it's being encouraged it's being propagated by the millions and millions and millions of illegal invaders coming across our border that do not belong in America and uh you know it's it's not an anomaly it's the natural reaction to people feeling unsafe and uncertain about the future and uncertain about the intent of a very small minority group of tyrannical people jack give me top three like a fundamental carries every person should have you talking what what you talking when it comes to fire like fundamental pistol i think i think i don't think the equipment as important as being able to use the equipment yeah this is going to go into what i would have first of all what is a freaking concealed carry law that i'm not guess what man i'm an american citizen with the right to keep in their arms i'm going to carry my freaking gun however i want to that's correct you think i need your permit to conceal carry my gun screw you i will disregard any law that goes against my fundamental rights as an american citizen i carry guns everywhere i go across state lines i don't give a crap i don't even look at the law and i may wind up in prison one day i don't freaking know but i don't care because i will not obey a law that violates my right to keep and bear arms all right and here's the second thing for you listeners if you do not carry a gun as an american citizen every single day everywhere you go you are neglecting your duty as an american citizen you are failing to exercise your rights and actually i would go as far as to say one of your most important rights so if you are carrying a gun if you're listening to this look at yourself right now if you are not carrying a gun or you are not within arms reach of a gun you are wrong you are dead wrong here's the third thing the fact that so many americans own guns is not comforting to me because guess what just because you have a gun don't mean jack squat unless you know how to use that gun which requires an investment into training with a legitimate person all right a legitimate instructor it requires a huge investment where will we find such a legitimate instructor Chad well i trained people i had to plug that that's not what this is all about you're welcome yeah i appreciate that work work work what's the website while we're on it three of seven projects all right all right so no this is this is really key guys like you you have before this segment sponsored by the three of seven it was definitely yes yes before you even keep but no not before you buy a gun you can go buy your gun all right but but you have to prioritize getting legitimate training on how to use that firearm effectively and safe and safely or else you are just a hazard to yourself and everyone around you okay um people neglect that if you would if you if you could come and spend a half a day with a seal platoon in a lamb warfare training block it would blow your mind at the level of fitness it actually takes to be combat effective the test we just took this morning that's the combat standards test the whole reason for that test is for me to prove to myself that i am fit enough to be combat effective in a fighting unit it's meant to replicate about a half days work in a lamb warfare training block in the seal platoon all right so I look at these dang rednecks man that live up and down the road did I live that I live on and in the area that I live on and they're talking about the guns they have and and how you know they've been shooting deer with their granddaddy since so and so when and I'm like bro you're 350 fucking pounds you're not even trainable you're not even trainable you carrying a weapon is a hazard to yourself and the people around you so along with with this responsibility that we have as American citizens to keep and bear arms and that means yes you carrying a gun on your body everywhere that you go so that you can defend yourself and you can defend your fellow countrymen besides you that might become a victim right or or a female or a child or whoever it may be part of that responsibility is being it's personal excellence yeah it's being physically fit and it's being skilled they have to come together why the crap aren't you guys willing to freaking do that man it's not that hard make it a priority in your life to do that man well and I think what we're seeing and what we've talked about on this show when you see corrupt disgusting fat weak unequipped tyrants pulling candidates off of a ballot unconstitutionally it's probably time to start that training it's past time yes it's past time you've been waiting for a time this is definitely the time like you get you have to start yes because I mean this is something that takes time I mean if you've if you let yourself go for this long DJ how many how many pounds you lost man almost 80 that didn't happen overnight though right that takes work man this takes time training takes time you it's progressive you have to build upon it right and then it's perishable the most perishable skill that I have ever learned is shooting a handgun if you do not shoot a handgun on a monthly basis you're going to pull that Joker out and you're going to fire a whole magazine at a target or at somebody who wants to kill you and it's very likely that you're going to miss every single one of those shots it is an extremely perishable skill this is our responsibility as American citizens this is our you hear what I'm saying this is our responsibility this is not just something that you have the option to do this is our responsibility obligation yes sir thank you DJ it's becoming more and more of a real obligation to really like legitimately yeah yeah like if you're a grown man and you don't have basic skills you're talking about that's you're failing well that that's that's a big reason why we are in the position that we are in that's a it's a huge contributing factor yeah right and you don't have to go be fucking Rambo you don't have to be command down you're going to move the Georgia and live in the mountains yeah you got to be fucking functional intelligent prepare you have to be able to just use your body in a functional way right and you have to understand how to grip the pistol how to align your sides how to press the trigger you have to understand all those basic fundamentals you're exactly right I don't expect you to to get in a freaking be able to get in a firefight and do a individual movement technique and flank some force on the left and and peel you know I don't expect you to be able to do all that tactical stuff right that takes years and years and years right and I won't even teach people those things unless I really know I'm very well but but yeah man it's a good topic you talk about what guns what what should you purchase if you're gonna refund the minutes if you're gonna dedicate yourself like you talk about fundamental like weapons to carry yeah well I mean so I have no affiliation with any weapons company but Glock is hands down the best handgun that you that you can possibly purchase I can they actually the gun that I carry every day now and I just talked about Glock but in terms of the weapon that I carry concealed is actually called a Springfield Hellcat that's good and the reason that I'm I'm using pistol specifically is because magazine capacity really really matters right and so the Glock 43X we've got a 10-round magazine capacity with my Hellcat I've got 16 rounds that's a big deal magazine capacity is something that you should really look for I know you can buy aftermarket magazines for your Glock they're not as good as factory magazines and they will malfunction we've tested them on the range um so yeah I carry the Hellcat I can hit a silhouette at 80 yards consistently with that Hellcat 80 yards I like that gun that's pretty good yeah that's pretty fun yeah and then the and then the last thing every person should own you should own you should own a AR 15 rifle and you should know how to use it's a very effective weapon system I actually use my AR 15 to hunt that's what I hunt with right and I do that because I believe in the concept of training like you fight so if if I ever have to go fight God forbid that's the rifle that I'm going to be using so I use that rifle to hunt with because it makes me familiar with the rifle makes me comfortable carrying it I get my sling system worked out I have my optics all dialed in I know my holdovers I know all that stuff because I'm using it in a real world application so every American should have one of those rifles and I mean I personally have safe full of those rifles because I want to be able to outfit a up a tune size element but I'm a little overboard I don't know bro you got an APC yet no dude I'm supposed to freaking jealous of your armor you know I have one of only two civilian em wraps I do we need to talk offline yeah yeah yeah the only other one is uh is in a Hollywood facility Hollywood movies yeah when it's going his way to you fucker see my armor happen dude it's nasty it's the baddest shit in the world if shit goes down bro I'm going down with a smile I'm and and and and style and a good ass around that's right bro well guys this gets to our final segment of the show that was a third and final headline guys um it is time for our final segment as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is what we bring a headline up we talk about it to get one of those two options so with that being said I thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads Hulk Hogan declares his total surrender and dedication to Jesus greatest day of my life I thought this was a pretty cool interesse of story that came came out so this should happen a few days ago this is a bright bar article reading uh WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan has declared his total dedication to Jesus Christ and a video posted to social media Hulk Hogan showed himself and family members getting baptized quote total surrender and dedication to Jesus is the greatest day of my life no worries no hate no judgment only love he wrote here's a video there's no audio here's a video so he goes first and he does helps with his wife so Hulk Hogan whose real name is Terry Eugene Belia previously wrote about his faith back in April when he posted a message about accepting Christ as a savior at the age of 14 in 2021 the wrestlers spoke about his relationship to Jesus in an interview quote once you're a Christian you've accepted Christ as your savior you're not gonna perish but you're gonna have everlasting life that belief is pretty much the only thing that is real to me he said uh what we got the Hulk Master well I think he's seen behind the curtain for most of his life so he probably is not lying when he says it's the only thing that's real to him that's a good point you know I'm saying yeah like that guy's been at the highest of highs wealth and fame and he's seen all the shit yeah so I think it's pretty cool yeah man uh so obviously obviously this is really cool for me to see um but I do want to say we have now we have a lot of very influential and famous people now coming out and talking about faith and talking about Jesus and and and can all of you yeah Kat Von D and some some other guys that have big podcasts uh and so it can be it can be a very I don't know it can be a weird situation when you wield a lot of influence and you decide you want to enter into a relationship with Christ because you have so many people that want to come in with their with their opinions and their and their own personal beliefs and you're getting hit from all these angles and it can be hard to really see and comprehend the pure message of the gospel of Christ right uh one of the things the the Hulk said and by the way man praise the Lord when when when somebody comes to Christ man it's not on me to judge is is there salvation a real thing right I can't freaking judge that dude like a lot of people are going to see this and say oh that's freaking fake well I'm not going to say that that's not on me to just salvation is is for the Lord God to judge not me I can't see into this man's into this man's heart and um and so we want to look for what are the okay what are the fruits that are going to come out of this so if you're interested in in in the Hulk's journey with Christ look pay attention what are the fruits of his life right because how do we judge a tree or if we want to know if something's real or not all we have to do is look for what are the fruits of this right one thing that the Hulk said is no what did he say no judgment no hate no hate only yeah no worries no judgment no hate only love I want to go ahead and tell you guys uh since I've been following Christ there's been a lot of worries I want to go ahead and tell you guys since I've been following Christ there's been a lot of righteous anger not hate but righteous anger right um I want to go ahead and tell you guys since I've been following Christ many times when you speak the truth of the gospel because it is exclusive the truth of the gospel is an exclusive message which means you must believe in this Jesus Christ and if you don't believe in this Jesus Christ you are excluded from this thing that we call salvation and so many people when you preach the truth of the gospel will take that as judgment that you are being judgmental right but truth is truth truth is not judgment all right only love yes that's the greatest commandment of all right love the Lord your God with all your heart right and then love your neighbor as you love yourself um but I want to let you guys know that following Christ is not an easy path you know how you know you know the Lord warned us of that the Lord said take up your cross and follow me take up your cross the cross is a symbol of death and anguish and pain and suffering right and so praise the Lord that the hawk has decided to uh to believe in the name of Jesus Christ and uh and man I hope the Lord blesses him and I hope he grows in his faith and I hope that he uh he takes this journey and he submits himself and dies to himself and takes up his cross and and follows Christ right and I just want to preach the gospel real quick and and we can shut this down if you guys don't mind I don't mind the gospel of Christ that we're talking about this exclusive message that leads to salvation that many people sound here as judgmental is the fact that your creator God the creator of all that is he's a perfect God right if you have a perfect being that being cannot tolerate or be in the presence of imperfection right we are imperfect beings because we send in the beginning we wanted to be like God we wanted to have the same knowledge that he had so we send right when we send when we were deceived and we send in the very beginning that severed our connection with our perfect creator okay but our God loves us as his creation so much that he said you know what I am going to provide a sacrifice for the sins of these beings that I created so that they can be reconciled back unto me and see if God would not have provided that sacrifice if he would have given us a pass well then he would no longer be a perfect God because that would be in perfect judgment you guys understand what I'm saying he had to provide some sort of compensation for our mistakes if he just gave us a pass he would be imperfect because he would not have judged us righteously and he loved us so much he said I'm going to come to the earth and I'm going to live as a human being and I'm going to live a perfect life I'm going to be the only human being in flesh whoever lived a perfect life he did that in the man that we call Jesus Christ God in flesh and the sacrifice he made was on the cross he loved us so much he went to the cross he allowed himself to be mocked tortured and ultimately killed in a very horrific way so that he could pay the price for our iniquity and reconcile us back unto him so now we who accept this gift that has been provided to us by our creator we who accept this gift now when our creator looks at us because we are covered in the sacrificial blood that he provided to us when he looks at us he sees us as pure beings he can no longer see your imperfection and so you are reconciled back unto your creator by way of that blood and he didn't stop there he did something that was really really wild that actually is the ultimate thing that proved he was Jesus Christ was who he said he was God in flesh they buried him in a tomb and he did this really wild thing he rose from the dead nobody rose him from the dead nobody went and prayed over him and he rose from the dead he literally rose from the dead by his own power he overcame death no other who wouldn't make a claim like that but there's evidence that this is true he rose from the dead giving us also victory over death and the ability to receive and inheritance that is eternal life where we live in a perfect environment with him as the perfect king and all we have to do is receive that and believe he is who he says he is and repent repent means we turn away from our old selves we take up our cross and we follow him and in doing that you are washed completely pure in the eyes of your creator and you receive an eternal inheritance with him and victory over death hell and the grave which is what you and I all deserve and that's the gospel of Jesus Christ thank you guys for allowing me to share that it's the most important
