What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the real estate about the lies and thickness and illusions of modern society and welcome to mother fucking reality guys I'm just gonna get right into it today we have 75 hard versus all right you saw that on the thumbnail and on the title I don't need to break any surprises but I got my buddy here Connor Cosen who I've been talking to on and off for a long long time on the internet he's here in studio to do a little 75 hard versus what's up brother how are you I'm good man how are you good life's good good man so we keep these episodes pretty short I know you and I could get get on a talking about business and what's going on for hours and hours you guys have pivoted during COVID you know started your own mortgage broker you know business doing very well we could talk about that in its own right but really man I want to get right into the 75 hard program you know you've done a killer job over to over I mean fuck bro what's it been now I'm in years I mean I've been fucking left and ways for 20 years yeah but when you've been doing 75 hard I started the beginning of this year yeah I mean I really always yeah it was January is what I made made the switch and it was really to work with Cody my business partner and my best friend like he was like hey I want to do this I wasn't even really thinking about it I'd already known about it and I was like this could be a better time yeah what was going on in my life so it was January of when I actually started so I have phase three in December that's awesome dude yeah so when you say when you say for what was going on in my life let's let's go let's go there what was the reason that you decided this was going to be something that you wanted to take on yeah I think because like you had like you said bro you've been lifting you stay in shape you know like yeah so why why now and why this I've been thinking about that a lot actually because I think that I'm a completely different maybe spectrum of people that are either thinking about doing 75 hard or have heard about it and thinking's not for them because they're in shape I think there's a different level between like people like you or like be like maybe needed to lose weight and I think that people look at is like the worst thing or as like a challenge to lose weight like it's not what a fucking is like I didn't need to lose anyway I really didn't even need to get in better shape in my mind but it wasn't really the physical part for me you said something a while back and it was you know show me your fucking bank account show me your body show me your business show me your relationships and then I'll take advice from you that's right and I was like Dan that's pretty good yeah I was like I'm in pretty good shape and I was like my relationship suck right now and I'm drinking like more than I know I should be and I kept just messing up relationship after relationship and I was like it's not the people that I'm with it's me and I'm like something's going on here and we always make the joke me and Cody is like if for Silla says that it works it probably fucking works you should probably try it so he had tried to do it a few times and I was like I can do this with you let's do it but for me it was really I was in fairly good shape I knew I would get in better shape and I'll talk about like my fitness journey and whatnot later but I mean I competed in a bodybuilding show and I was like 19 but it was teens and I just wasn't for me but I was always in good shape but I knew that my relationships needed work my business needed work my finances needed work things like that and I think that that was a big problem for me so the reason that I got into it was because I heard you say that and I was like I need to round out some shit like I'm not perfect neither you there's a long way to go but I knew I needed to round out my shit I couldn't just be in shape and use that as a crutch like I think you used your business as a crutch for not being in shape and you realize like this is bullshit yeah absolutely I did bro 100% I you know dude you're running a nine figure business at 350 pounds that's not a fucking win yeah you know I'm saying like I'm drinking every day I'm fat as fuck I have problems with my relationships problems not you know my marriage but yeah you know friendships and just in general I'm fucking angry you know what I mean and I can relate a lot to that I appreciate you understanding very clearly that this is not a fitness program you know I think that's cool to have someone on on the on the show talk about like that because so many people do think that it's a it's a weight loss challenge or I mean bro you see it like some of the shit that I see these people say on the internet is absurd shit you know when you started when you started the program what were you expecting to get was it just the expectation that you were going to sharpen up these other areas I don't know I really don't know if I knew what to expect I knew I was gonna get in some pretty damn good shape because I know my body very well and like I did a macro based direct diet probably a little bit more extreme than anyone probably has on the front of my kind of fucking shredded I treat you I was like 3.6% body fat the end of it it was not maintainable but I got down pretty low but yeah I mean I treated it like I don't know what I'm gonna get out of this but I have a lot of respect for you and I was like all right somebody's where I want to be and a lot of the aspects of where I want to be I'm gonna fucking take advice from them and I'm gonna do it and I looked at it is I'm gonna do it exactly the way I always laugh like not one chocolate chip you fucking chocolate chip you put it back like I'm a psycho like like you and me are very similar when it's like that was I listen to 208 again again again again again again before I did it had my girlfriend listen to it so you understand what I'm doing at my family list is what I'm doing so you know I ask me questions but I didn't know what to get but I knew like I'm gonna get in better shape I know my relationships are gonna benefit I need to fix something I need to stop drinking that was a big part of it because the social drinking so easy like sales talked about it like people come in town you go out and you have drinks and things like that we're mortgages and mortgages like finance you drink on Fridays and Saturdays and Sundays and then growing up and it's part of the business that's what you people don't understand that like it's not like dude when you're running a business like that you know part of the business is the networking aspect that you're gonna have to you're gonna have to do you know we we have people in here every single day that you know want to go to dinner want to do the thing and for you guys it's no different it's just it's it's over the weekend building relationships you know people don't understand that's a cultural norm inside the building of businesses so it's very hard to get away from that when you're so focused on the business because you don't want to be the weirdo who's who's like sitting with the guys that you're potentially gonna do business with and being like yeah I'm not gonna drink and then you're socially rejected because you're not doing the thing yeah but you know what I found out I want I would like to hear your take on this is you know not drinking actually puts yourself in a state of leverage over everybody else you know what I'm saying and makes instead of you feeling like oh you're socially awkward it also it makes them look at you like a leader and like someone who's in a control of their things so I found it to be super beneficial yeah it rises you above people and they're gonna come with you and I've told him like people are either gonna come with you or they're not and that's okay like I'm okay with losing people like I've definitely changed from the people that I hang out with a ton and it doesn't mean that I don't like those people it doesn't mean you can't be friends with those people right I'm just on a different path than they are right now and I'm completely fine with that and even doing 75 hard I had a lot of people were like well you know some of my closest friends were well the second workout like 45 minutes outdoors like I can run pretty damn far in 20 minutes I'm like it's not the time it's not the distance it's what you're doing it for it's to be away from technologists to be outside it's to be alone with your thoughts it's to exercise I just knew like being outside doing different things like that I didn't care if I wasn't drinking with people I knew that people the right people would come with me and it's funny because now your business is doing so much better my business is doing so much better our entire office is so much better off work my office is down 220 pounds this year dude it's unbelievable everybody in that office I've had half the office is on 75 harder completed it Cody completed it with me there's a funny story we're laughing on the plane there's a kid that works with us and the first day he was there one of the first days I was like hey is anybody want Starbucks and I just drink black coffee with ice like I'm drinking it for the content not the taste like I just want the fucking caffeine and that's we all drink black coffee and he goes yeah can I get a vanilla bean frappuccino and I just said no and that was it and no one else asked for a coffee and then I got the office I was like what the fuck is that I knew exactly what it was a drink when I was six and I was like yeah we don't drink that shit in here buddy and he's down like 45 pounds now they changed life and his wife's come up to me and been like I'm so appreciative of what you've done so me debacked of what it was like I got to get out of it I knew that it would help everybody around me but I knew for me I didn't really know what to get out of it but I knew that I could bring people with me and I'm disciplined but I need to try to get closer your level of discipline I respect everything that you do so I was like I'm gonna do this I appreciate it man but I think you're doing just fine how old are you I turned 30 yesterday bro you're fucking I'm 14 years older than you I know you're doing fucking great yeah you're doing fucking great yeah it's awesome appreciate that yeah remember I didn't figure this shit out so I was like 38 I don't you know I mean think where you're gonna be in 14 years I'm coming yeah I know you are I'm gonna come hang out with you yeah let me let me let me in on some little that look dude here's what I love about that the most man is that you guys are bringing your people with you 100% that's the best part about that man like you you guys own a company where people come in and they work and they learn and they're getting exposed to this whole entire different level of development that you're not gonna get at most places like bro you're not getting that at any other mortgage business in the world right no I'm sure there's a couple guys listening they're like well fuck you I own a mortgage business I keep my people okay good for you to but it's rare yeah all right and I'm cool with that I want I hope that other brokerages look at us and they're like you know we need to take some tips and points from those guys like there's tons of business for everybody I want them all to be successful but we're building men inside our office yeah that's what we need in this country and we're building men and the first thing you got to do is get your ass in shape yeah I always tell my guys I told them when we flew out here for my birthday I'm like the only thing I want from you guys I want you to make a shitload of money and I want you to be in shape so your kids inherit those habits that's all I want that's all men in there they can write loans we'll teach and that stuff later but I'm trying to build things and we have younger guys and their brother works for us and he's 24 years old the other day and I'm like dude I've made so many mistakes in the last 10 years and luckily like I was able to make a little bit of money when I was younger spent all of it and I learned that lesson so I'm just trying to teach these guys some of them are a lot older me hey these are the lessons that really fucked me up in saying if I've helped me fix a lot of them and I just fixed them it's not like last 10 years I've been great I've been fixing a lot of stuff but I'm trying to teach these guys hey these are the things that I've done don't make the same mistakes save your money do these things and you have to be in shape like personal excellence like you've been talking about it all the time like you can't be good at work when your relationships are a shit show or your body is out of shape because you're not confident you have no confidence in your stress in your mind is everywhere else I need you focused at work and the first thing is being shaped yeah bro it's everything you know people people real I discounted that for a long time dude I thought I thought as long as I was making money and as long as I was running my business that I could use the excuse and say yeah dude I'm working a hundred hour weeks you know what I'm saying like I thought that was a and real talk I mean okay 98% of people buy that shit right like you're rolling up and a Rolls Royce and you're doing well and and you're fat and people gonna be like yeah he's fat but he's also killing it yeah and and that's acceptable but at the at some point in time you have to be real with yourself and you've got to like analyze the entire package and you know winning in one area of life is not a win you know that means you're that means you're proficient in one little part of the entire puzzle and while that's good because most people aren't proficient in any of the parts yeah it's not a win and you know for me man I think just coming to that realization that happened to me in about 2014-15 and it took me a while to figure it out in terms of what that actually meant but I think just coming to that level of awareness is a massive step forward for most people you know most people never think like man I really need to have my stuff together in order for me to like do what I'm trying to do and because of that what ends up happening bro is these people live their whole lives and a body that they they're not happy with making an income they're not happy with in it with a relationship they're not happy with with friends they're not happy with and they kind of look around and like well fuck this is what I got and it doesn't have to be that way you know and and do what I really appreciate about both of you sitting here right now is the fact that you're so dedicated to bringing the other people with you man because dude that is that is the ultimate that's what we need right now in the world we need especially young leaders like you guys who are understanding what's going on who are saying okay business is business but first off let's get the let's get the vessel right you know let's get your mind right let's get your body right let's get your your character right let's get your integrity right let's get your confidence right let's get yourself and then that unlocks all the potential to go into business and kill it you know and and dude like you know I can't say this without a sound like I'm bragging but you know I thought I was quote unquote rich you know what I'm saying but I had no idea I had no idea how much better it was going to make my life to start taking these things serious and not just from a financial standpoint but from in every direction you know friendships relationship you know how I feel about myself and until we could truly get these things unlocked I mean dude if you really look back to to what you're able to accomplish before that it's almost like you look back and you're like holy shit I can't believe I was able to do that I can't believe I was there yeah yeah like it shows you like like we're actually pretty capable even when we're not trying that hard you know what I mean yeah hard work a good pretty far yeah but it's being in shape is everything I mean it's what you put in your mind right you talked about the other day like what you put in your mind is most important thing yeah I've just completely switched I love music I've tattoos music all over my body like I love music but now when I drive the work I listen to you or I listen to Ed or listen to your deck or somebody on the way in all robots and then I drop that to the guys in the office it code does the same thing and that's what our messages in the morning like all this is really good I'm not coming up with all of it like all tweaks certain things getting it from you guys I thought were you guys that words like Scotts Arizona built our area yeah kind of Phoenix but more word sound number hiking down back were you there not this year I wasn't I didn't think so I went a year before yeah I drive down that road every morning yeah it's funny that you guys ever do it yeah it's hard it's hard bro it is hard it is hard I'm glad you said that I'm a pretty good shame it is hard yes yeah you know Coriapton fitness you follow it yeah yeah so he's my trainer I'll tell you about trainers in a second but he would always be like hey let's go hike we would do it every Tuesday morning but then it got to the point I was telling DJ it's like we're not actually hiking together like you're just fucking running up the mountain and you're just waiting for me to get to the top yeah it is very hard yeah it's not like DJ is just talking like a bullshit mountain the story about it do so we we showed up like a half an hour earlier than everybody else the first time we went out there to do it and we started up the mountain because I was like all right well we're gonna have to start because it was like 250 people that were doing it with us and I'm like we're gonna have to start or we're gonna caught up in the conversation and it's gonna be like way harder so we started and we got like we we went up the part you know where there's the the handrail yeah yeah we went up the part and we got like I don't know I don't know maybe 10 minutes past that yeah and I'm like I'm like pretty gassed and I'm looking at DJ and I'm like we pull off to the side of the trail and I'm like man I'm like we got to be like almost there bro it's just you know there's like these these walls and you're like that's definitely it yeah there's another set of walls another set of walls and so we look up dude and there's like this line of it looks like ants like way up there oh yeah and he's like no man that's it I'm like that's got to be a different trail man that's not the same one he's like no that's it I'm like no fucking way yeah it's so like as I'm like thinking in my head I'm like fuck I'm like I wonder if I could just go down I pretend like I just went up there like I was being a total bitch oh yeah it's hard and fucking right as I started thinking that they got the people pulled up like right behind us from the group and they're like any are you already done and I'm like thinking about it fuck I'm like no I got to stick like I couldn't like I could now do 10 years ago I would have bitched out me like oh yeah I already went and did it but dude I was hard fucking is hard it is I always laughed his Corey's you always talk about the trainer thing I want to bring this up is he was training me during the same five hard yeah and you're always like trainers are going it's bad for you it's hard to drink too much water he was like this is fucking awesome because it's so good for his business too like yeah he was the main person that like posted my stuff I think you may even see it on his story but he was like look at the transformation you know Connor did through 75 hard he was like the greatest thing ever for his business and he's one of the best trainers and he is very well known he's IFBB Pro like you know he's it's the train the train good trainers understand huh they understand yeah here's the difference you got a lot of internet trainers that are like very hungry to like push their way on to you right so like if it's not their way they got to attack it because they think it threatens what their way is yeah but the good trainers the trainers who actually understand what the fuck they're doing they understand that it's an open protocol program where you can program in the diet you can program in the training and it's guaranteed to produce tremendous results and the trainers utilize it to produce those results yes fantastic it's the best thing you can do for your business yeah but like it is it is funny because you know the the personal trainer internet scene is it is what it is I've never understood that whole thing like if you can't go to the gym on your own you're gonna hire somebody online to pick you up if they're not physically there I've just never understood that part yeah I always wise that the biggest pet peeve too is you look in the gym and you're like why is that guy training people like I've just always had a thing like it's kind of why look up to you like if you don't have the things that I want I'm not going to listen to you like taking advice from a trainer is not in good shape doesn't make a lot of sense yeah I you know I think there's way more trainers they understand what we're talking about then don't I agree but it's the it's the newer ones it's the ones trying to make a name for themselves and they always come on and they fucking bash 75 hard and then they get fucking destroyed yeah it's a beautiful thing terrible idea yeah but yeah dude I you know I don't know what that is like what it's it's weird because not just a trainer thing but the online advice thing and you know just like even an entrepreneur ship or anything it's like dude like a lot of you guys just must be a glutton for your own punishment like it makes very very simple sense to me common sense that like I'm not going to listen to someone who hasn't done what it is I'm trying to do and it's like the internet has become this thing where everybody's giving their two cents everybody's giving their advice and nobody stopping to ask has this person ever done this have they ever actually built anything where could I order their products my favorite business do they have where are their employees where is their headquarters what do they look like what's their lifestyle look like it's like all these qualifying questions it's almost like they don't get asked anymore and people are just like oh I like what that guy has to say so I'm gonna follow him yeah it's like well listen dude if you really want to get results you're probably not going to like what most of the people have to say to you because it's going to be hard it's going to be something that you're not that's what a good coach does a good coach tells you truth yes hey motherfucker you're I mean do look I don't coach people directly but if I did I could promise you you probably like what I had to say most of the time you know and I don't understand what that is is that is that just internet culture is that like I mean it's just people don't I mean culture is different now is it dumb motherfuckers people are like is that what we're talking about here like people are just lazy too I mean you always say you can get door dashed to your door in 10 minutes right people want to pros in 10 minutes yeah but bro how can you look at someone who's not done what it is you want to do and then take their advice seriously I don't know like I don't know either I think it's complete comments as opposed by mine yeah I always I've thought about this lately if Instagram turned off right because it's a business and business is close if for some reason Instagram turned off could you survive and pay your bills yeah there's a lot of motherfuckers right now that would just be completely toast yeah if their internet went down in their city if something went wrong like it happens in other countries yeah for a month you'd be toast yeah we'd be fine yeah we do it we do everything by the phone phones are fine yeah I don't need the computer yeah like I don't like we're fine it's Instagram everything we do could be turned over in it could be turned over in in person in 24 hours retail and that's a good thing like we think about that we work off certain types of leads and we're like if these go down if Instagram goes down we're not online coaches like we're good yeah we'll be fine business is still gonna roll yeah I really admire that from your standpoint because you don't have to have retail yeah can do totally well online but still running that yeah so dude what do you think when you think about 75 hard and what what you've gained from it I mean what's been the biggest difference for you I keep coming back to relationships I've been with the same girl for three years like kind of on and off and it's played my fault because I was working on relationships right so I've always been in good shape that was something like fitness for my whole life I felt like I drank too much because of the industry that we're in but I just used as an excuse that everybody does it my relationships were suffering because like didn't want to settle down want to keep drinking want to keep party and doing these certain things but I mean drinking water is easy right you don't gain a lot from that besides being healthy and it's very easy to do if you're committed to it but the biggest things for me is my relationships like I feel so well-rounded in everything right now and I'm not perfect and never gonna be there's a million things yeah this is the whole point of this but I feel like my relationship is better than it's ever been a girlfriend's name is a call is amazing she's extremely supportive she did face to with me like the best that she could like her version of it but and she was like holy hell I can believe can't believe what you're actually I get it now like this shit's hard yeah I'm like yeah it is hard supposed to be hard supposed to be inconvenient yeah my relationships though my relationships are so much better with my family I'm seeing my family more I've made it more of a priority my drinking I rarely ever drink now and I just don't see the point like all the bad things and you've said before like relationships 99% of things that happen in relationships or fights is because of alcohol yeah so why don't I remove it yeah and now that it's removed wow weird it works yeah everything's better so it makes things quite a bit easier yeah and I look at like you and Emily and you guys don't post a ton of stuff on social media and I don't either anymore and that was a big thing was post everything let other people fuck up your relationship and like have their opinions yeah I'm so happy with everything that I'm doing because I was telling these guys I think you and me are like recluse is my favorite words for me for sure it's not that I want to be but that's just kind of how I've learned to stay happy and really see the benefits of what I've done through 75 hours kind of be a recluse and stick to my own thing and work on myself you start to realize you don't need any of this other shit I don't you know happy I don't yeah that's that's what it's been for me to bro I've definitely become more reclusive and less social since I started the whole live hard program but not because of what it takes to do it yeah it's but it's because of the choices that I make you know like you know how like when you first start 75 hard the first time and you're like fuck I'm not gonna have time for any of this stuff I'm so busy already but what you find out you know like three weeks in you're like holy shit I've been wasting all this time on nonsense yeah and so for me dude like it's more so I've just been able to identify where my time is is it's spent wisely and and outside of those things I just don't give it to people anymore no you know and the internet we could go on and on about that but like bro it's really none of your guys fucking business what I do at home you know what I'm saying I come on here every fucking day I give you what I got that's my product and if you don't like it fuck off I could you know yeah like dude all these people on the internet they always asking us personal business like when are you guys gonna have kids will motherfucker I can't have kids it's not in your fucking business yeah you know what I'm saying like yeah that's what I'm saying like these people you you should do this or you should say this or you should say this you know what you should do shut the fuck up and that's where I'm at with it so I just stop posting the shit I'm like saying about right now yeah yeah I'll post fitness stuff keep my guys in the gym rolling like I'm still here every morning like I'm here yeah but that's it it's it's weird dude I've never gotten into the people who who put their marriage for sale on the internet or their their relationship I for some dude I've never seen it and well yeah some people it's just I've learned for me it doesn't work and I shouldn't do it and I'm just happier now yeah I agree to that take that from you for sure yeah I agree man I'm much much happier just keeping my business to me and it is what the fuck it is yeah you've got you Emily and the pups and I've gotten the coal and I have a great day named Wally it's like 140 pounds and he's two and a half yeah I hang out with that dude all day long for hang out with people yeah dogs are the best yeah yeah man so on this you know you've been training your whole life you're obviously in great shape dude out of the things that you think were a challenge with 75 hard what would you say was the most challenging and what would you say was the easiest shut the whole things hard dude yeah and it's not called fucking well depending on you ask yeah I know 75 easy it's hard it's hardest fuck yeah I'm like come from somebody like my dad played professional football was like always working out and we did P90 X together in high school like I was kind of a total yeah Tony Horton remember yeah he got like really sick or something something happened on like that really yeah I think he crushed it dude he was yeah that's all I did like in high school we did P90 X at the house I was a cycle like I'd like run back and forth in the pool with like a weight over my head like I was around like good parents for a long time and they're so together the best Doug and Laurie and I like always was into fitness stuff so for me I was like all right this fitness part of this can't be that hard I think that the easiest part for me was probably the reading in the water because water is just you got to start early and I'm a big believer in like do everything exactly and make sure there's no air do you fuck it up because I don't want to finish this and be like oh those two days I can drink that much water yeah and I always just thought like Andy would know if I cheated on it yeah I would know and I'd be like yeah I wonder if what it would have been like if I really did it so I just carried a gallon of water around with me and I filled it up every single morning and I didn't drink anything else has black coffee and I would just until the gallon was gone every single day I didn't do the like oh I got a drink like 80 or those water bottles or so like no like I'm going to drink a gallon and when it's gone it's gone I know I drink so that was pretty easy um the reading I read Sean Wayland's book was it makes shit happen like you can read that book in two hours I've heard about it five times yeah I read magic power of thinking big and then unreasonable hospitality which those are the books I read so I think the original hospitality is great book it's unbelievable yeah that's literally how we do everything in our business off of that book ever for a business book it's one of the best it's highly underrated it's unbelievable yeah that's gold it gets better as you read it too I've given it a lot of guys bro the best story in that book is the hot dog story where it goes out yes in a hot dog they wish we would add a hot dog before we left that was amazing unbelievable yeah that's how we try to do things here too that's what we're trying to start doing it's on those are the little things dude those are the little things yeah the hardest part though for me was probably beat someone that's in shape like I said or like there's so many people that look at this like I'm already in Gishub I need to do this like that's that's for people that need to lose weight I could drink water if I wanted to I could do two workouts but I don't want to I worked out six days a week for the most part but not like really hard yeah it's the two workouts when you're busy and you're running the company and you're doing shit all day I'm up at five and I go to the gym and then I go straight to work all day and then I come home the last thing I want to do is work out again when you don't need to work out it's hard to be like all right I got to do 45 minutes outside and start to get dark and you're like me running is it really going to make me better shape but knowing you have to I think the second workout for me was really hard and I'm a psycho about it because you'd be like can't do it in your garage you can't do it so I would literally we'd get home from the cold rollerblade and I would run and we'd get home and there'd be like six minutes left in Shbeck over with the school in the backyard and finish she would open the garage and go through the house and I would make sure I went around the side of the house out the gate move I can't have a roof over me yeah because that doesn't count and I was doing push that's how it's supposed to push that is how it's supposed to be down nature sound crazy but it's not it's not no we're not crazy they're fucking crazy like dude this is something that I'm glad you're hitting on because a lot of people really do not understand the program they really think it's some sort of fitness challenge bro this is not a fitness challenge this is about you correcting your mindset so that you can open up a realm of possibilities that you have no idea even exists okay a lot of you guys are living in the fucking dark bro you don't even understand what you're capable of you guys think that you know this is you know overkill you know I got this dude who hit me up a year or two ago and he's pretty well known and he's like Andy I did my my my outdoor workout in my garage is that acceptable and I'm like fuck no it's not acceptable bro like yes go do it again or else you fucking fail like I don't understand what it is about this shit that people you know it's you know what's interesting to me bro is how many people who clearly do not have their shit together whatsoever feel like compelled to make changes to the program or substitutions or compromise when the whole reason that they've come to the program and the whole reason that they've like thought man I should do this is because of the substitutions and compromises that they have made in their lives that they're not even aware of the reason your life is a shit show is because you compromise fucking everything this this what we're trying to do here is recalibrate your mind frame so that you understand and can be aware when you cut these corners when you start to compromise because bro your life doesn't just fall apart and in a day or an hour or a year it falls apart with that one decision that starts like this fuck I know I'm supposed to be working outside but I'm just gonna do it in the garage I'm gonna open up the windows up the garage door and I know it's raining and that's where it starts dude and then it and then it flip yes and then it gets more and more and more and now all of a sudden you're barreling down the slippery slope going right back to where it is that you tried to escape from it's like these people who who celebrate 75 hard right after they get done with the same shit that got them in the place of dissatisfaction like that doesn't make any sense to me now it might have made sense to me in the beginning like when I for the first time I did it like an accomplishment and I was like damn all right this is a big deal but like dude let's be aware like when you reward yourself with the same behavior that puts you in the place of dissatisfaction you're shitty eating you're drinking you're partying okay you're your sloth lifestyle and you reward your your progress for 75 days going right back to that behavior the behavior that made you hate yourself how does that make any fucking sense it doesn't make any sense you said it the other day you're motherfucker you're not qualified to make tweaks to the program because everything that you've done this like I think about this every morning like what's your last thousand days look like yes like I I didn't I don't believe that I was like brought out here to speak to you were like we got in touch because I did 75 hard it's because of the work I've been doing for the last 15 years you just saw 75 days of it yeah and that's really where I buckle down and got my shit together but it's the last thousand days like my last thousand days haven't been good yeah my last 200 and whatever we're out right now have been pretty damn good yeah and our business is doing better than it's ever been doing my relationships are doing better because I'm not making any fucking tweaks because I'm not qualified to make any tweaks I think people that I work with and that I'm friends with are like oh you've been in pretty good shape and like eat pretty well like no like I might look like it on the outside but there's a lot of shit I got to fix I'm not qualified to make the tweaks and if I'm not qualified and you're not qualified to make the tweaks the people that are out here saying like I'm gonna make a tweak that's where it starts and that's the last 999 day yeah dude how how here it confuses me brother because I'm like look around and I'm like bro you you live in a shit hole your bank account looks like shit your body looks like shit the stuff that comes out of your mouth sounds like shit your relationship looks like shit the person your with looks like shit your whole life looks like shit bro but you think it's okay to justify changing something because you like at what point are we where are we fucking malfunctioning here bro like where are you guys not connecting like motherfucker the reason your life looks the way it is is because you have a bad track record of choosing poorly when it comes to making adjustments to the things that you're supposed to do you have been you have become conditioned to telling yourself the easy way every single time something's supposed to be done the right way like your entire life the reason it sucks bro is because it's the your entire life is a compromise it's it's the result of all the things that you knew you were supposed to do that you decided not to do because it felt hard in the moment and then you look around and you're like man I need to change this and then you look at the program that's changed millions of motherfuckers lies and you say well fuck I'm gonna change that like your whole problem is this attitude that you're not aware of of the compromises that you make in every single every single area of your life and to me dude it's like I used to get really mad about it like I'd see these people and I'd be like of course that's the person that thinks they should change this you know and I would get pissed and I go on my Instagram and fucking rant about it but now I'm just like well fuck them dude they're gonna fucking end up exactly where they're gonna end it's the little things to you notice that the people that are out of shade there's a bunch of shit in their car yes you yes trash all over there every time there's shit in their cars dirty bro when I used to hire people myself I would go look in their car before I even fuck it's like they would come in and be sitting in the interview and I would walk out and look what they drove and look inside their car what they what the inside of their car look like and if it had like McDonald's and fucking bullshit in it bro an automatic no automatic no yeah because you know they're banking out looks the same way you know that their brain works the same way and like I can fix that stuff like we've got guys to come to the office and I'll be like camera right with you today and they're like you have a nicer car I'm like god I'm just driving to you it's cool let's go get food real quick yeah and I'm like hey you got clean your car like what is this shit and then I get back in at next time it's spotless I'm like hey this looks good yeah tell him or one of our guys drove a shit box yeah and it was just crap and end up getting a toad and he just left it at the I'm like you don't want you to leave that car there he never even went got it now he's now he's putting a brain rover every time you get in that car it's spotless yeah it's got promoted our company well at some point something switch for him yeah 100% was us doing the same five hard like hey you're either coming to your not yeah I love it dude I love it man so when you when you look at like the benefits you've had outside of the physical benefits and outside of the relationship benefits wherever you notice the biggest benefit probably in our business and me being present more at work and being able to focus on work so I've always said you know if your relationships messed up or like you're out of shape and you're not working out it's really hard to come into work and like focus on work because you got a million other things like you know better than anybody when other shit's going wrong and then something goes wrong in work this month's over forget it like all you're pissing me off like the you know your employees not really pissing off your team members not pissing you off it's because your shit's out of whack yeah so we are say check it out the door but if you got something going on like bring it to us and we'll talk about it we'll fix it but don't bring your shit in here like get your shit together I think for me it's probably been work I've been able to like much you know focus a lot more on work and kind of dial in and people are dying right now and no one's looking for office space and mortgages rates are 7% and we're kicking ass and we're gonna have 20 people next month now our goals have 50 to 100 by the end of next year if the market permits it and the only way we can do that is if we're dialed in and like we both did 75 hard together main Cody and that was the kickstart of this year in our whole office as we've just ignored the noise of like rates and things suck and nobody's working out right now just drink the market sucks we've ignored all of it and work is so much better because of honestly 75 hard I mean beat a dead horse but that's what we're talking about it's the truth I mean it works yeah it I mean look man it wouldn't have billions of hashtags billions of mentions on TikTok if it didn't fucking work yeah you know it's it I I learned something new about what is done for me literally every single day and when I think of the level of operator I am now versus five years ago or even 10 years ago it's not comparable I would not I would not be able to do what I do had I not develop the skill sets that that this program helps you come you know come aware of and then finally tune I think I think one of the biggest things about 75 and live hard is the it's the awareness man you know like a lot of this stuff is like people will understand it once they start to see it but because they're so they're living such a passive life where they're kind of just taking what they can get they never really understand the awareness piece of it and if you really want to break 75 hard down what it does for you is it makes you aware of your own internal dialogue that is constantly fighting back and forth between what you know you're supposed to do and what you feel like doing in the moment and I think that's the biggest benefit that most people get out of it the first time they do it they become aware but then over the course of time what I found is that most people start to understand that there is no permanent solution to these skill sets right it's like taking a shower there's a reason we take a shower every day it's not because we don't need it and when you think about like what this program actually does when you talk about sharpening the skill sets of discipline fortitude grit per surveillance learning how to build confidence learning how to build self esteem you know the ability to endure hard times these things when you don't sharpen them they get rounded off and when they get rounded off you compromise and when you compromise you compromise more and when you compromise more you find yourself at the bottom of the mountain that you've already climbed that ends up being you know demoralizing and when I really you know sit down and talk to people about it one of the things that I hear in common the most is is the awareness aspect you know like most people are not aware of those two voices that we talk about you know the bitch voice and the boss voice they they they know there's like this internal feeling like I'm supposed to do this but they can never really identify what that is and so they're either hyper aware of one voice which is usually the bitch voice and then yeah and then the other voices is is is not they're not able to even hear it you know what I'm saying and then as you get someone who's who's following the program those first three or four times where they like are really sore or really you know worn out or really tired or have to go out at one o'clock in the morning and hit a workout their their boss voice starts to grow and now they become aware yet I think it's interesting here what you think about that well I think people are so unaware of like what it does to be in shape too I mean you can run your business and I think you ran your business for a long time when you weren't in the shape that you wanted to be in and to my partner everybody when you first meet somebody and you say it's all time and I actually like enough Andy Elliott works out the same gym as me I see him every morning workout together but we always talk about like when you see somebody you look at what they look like and how that's the first thing you do that's how you judge people that's how people get it you know yeah I know like he's like hey I just got back I'll see you later yeah yeah but people look at you and they're like what is this person look like and then I either trust you or I don't trust you to follow through it shit so you can you know like when you walk in a room and you're in shape people respect you we talk about like it's the number one thing that nobody else controls nobody else puts it into your brain nobody else lifts the weight for you nobody else puts the food in your mouth and people know that motherfucker to discipline that motherfucker can at least stick to something and looks good for a reason because you can do things I always say my big it what do people people like why do you do what you do and why do you work so hard and what have you and like what do you want nice things I never in my life whether I can have kids or not want my kids to ever be like why don't you look like him why don't we have a house like that that why don't you drive a car like that yeah I don't ever want the answer me because I didn't fucking work hard enough yeah there's no other excuse there's not well I didn't have the right circumstances like people come from nothing like Carlos Reyes from the dirt right yeah it's got nice you guys the rules right I see it all time people come from nothing and can do things I don't ever want my kids or my nephews or nieces to be like why don't we have a house like that why don't you look like that I never want to say oh excited work hard enough yeah and that's what I try to instill the guys in the office is hey I want your kids to inherit these habits from you you control this you control this so the 75 hardest the best thing is because it's completely up to you no one can drag you around the block on your runs no one can lift the weight no one can put the water in your mouth that's my favorite part about it and I think that's why like the fitness industry because your body is a complete reflection of what you've done to it so I think that's a big part of things is people are so unaware that people are looking at them and what they look like you like people try to hide behind their success or they're flashy shit and people are like well I guess so fat yeah people say that dude I think it's a real thing like you know I learned this because you know I was on the internet when I was fat and fucking bro every time I posted it was bro you're fucking fat and I'm at first I'll like fuck you and then I was eventually I was like shit I have fat you know the truth is the yeah the spade right the truth is for a reason people need to hear the truth and being blunt with people is a good thing like we have guys in our office I'm like this guy finished 75 hard on my George Osborne every day asking about George Osborne yeah I did all right good George Osborne hey what are you eating like every day yeah I'm gonna hold you accountable like that so because you're you're habits like people hide it and hide it like I'm gonna hold you accountable I love that dude it makes sense that your friends with Andy Elliott like he I just recently got to know him a little bit and one of the things that I love about you and him is your sense of obligation to the team you know like when you talk to Andy and when I'm sitting here talking to you there's a very hot and it's real it's not bullshit there's a very high sense of urgency and obligation for the people around you and the people coming behind you and and I understand that coming from Andy because he's the same age as me but hearing that from a 30 year old bro that fucking gives me a lot of hope I think that's really fucking cool because at 30 years old most people are worried about their own shit and they don't understand that the way that you're gonna take care of your own shit is by taking care of every single person around you and the fact that you figure that out and that I can sense this is a very real thing bro tons of respect for that that's a big big deal dude it's a big deal we have vision boards all over our office and like I saw one of the guys posted on a story earlier it's vision board by a desk but our office when you come in that's first thing you do is create a vision board and you put some fucking effort into it yeah and we go over and they're all hung up in the office but yeah I mean I've always just looked at things is I had a ran sales seems for a long time and my best teams are the guys that were happy right you take care of your people we always say we just take care of these people you pay them the right way I posted a couple months ago like why I do what I do and why we started the company is I want people to be paid fairly that people their employers not gonna change their pay pull the rug out for a bunter I'm like take care of them take care of their family make sure they can go spend time with their kids things like that they'll make money for you if they're happy and they'll stay forever and in the meantime you'll make money eventually yeah and by the way you get to watch them build their lives which is the best wrong fucking part it's it's it's it's easily the best part it's awesome everybody thinks when they look at business people and there is a lot of business people that don't give a fuck about people but those people flatten out and they eventually fail and I truly believe you know I've been doing January 1st be 25 years for me as an entrepreneur like officially right yeah like not selling lemonade and shit like I have my real business if we go all the way back I've been doing that since I was eight it's been 45 years yeah that's right bro it's a long time so the the thing is is that I could tell you guys this you know I know a lot of you guys you listen to the show and you sort of look up to me for the entrepreneur you know segment of my life but dude it it really is the best thing the best thing is having people around you that that better themselves that let's start it's the bet the very best thing is having people that don't get it all then fucking having it click over and then seeing them transform and then seeing them build success it's so cool yeah to me dude that's where it's at man yeah it's it's awesome it's the best feeling in the world see people like when I ran my sales team I mean I think I'd like six people under 25 by a house yeah it was just the coolest thing yeah we're making money at the meantime like it's a long game I'd always joke you know you're like I did this in 20 years you guys can do it in five now but it's facts I've been working in mortgages for almost a decade yeah I finally start to feel like our company and like it's been only a year and a half for us most years is really starting to work but I've literally been taking phone calls and just calling lead after lead after lead for almost 10 years yeah now it's finally I can't wait seeing 10 years from now that's where I'm looking is it 10 years so I can take care of these people you know if you lose a few along the way that's attrition it happens but I don't want to yeah I want them to be so happy and compensated so fairly and never get greedy like I've seen other people do or we can run this thing for 10 20 30 years and then people can go do whatever they want to do that's completely fine with me but I want them to spend time with their families but also be in shape so they can be around their families yeah have health issues and be able to make money and it sounds so obvious to people like you and me when we say like yeah me too you work for these corporate companies and they want you to do this and that and PTO oh I know it's Christmas it's your daughter's birthday but you're scheduled like that's just never gonna be us but that's why we're selective with who we bring it yeah you know I think when you mentioned about the the not being in shape thing I think a lot of people just never been in shape like ever like they've never ever ever been in shape and I was fortunate enough to you know have been a decent athlete growing up and I was never in shape as an athlete but I was athletic and there were times where I was like close to in shape yeah where I was still good at things right and I think most people have a hard time really grasping what being in tremendous shape will do for them and in the other areas of their life right like most people they when they like if you've never been in shape and you talk about getting a shape they always talk the same things they talk about going to the pool they talk about going on vacation they talk about going to a wedding and I used to think that too like because that's that was how I thought of in shape I thought that that was the main benefit the main benefit was I'm gonna go in this vacation I'm gonna look fucking jack yeah like that's what I thought it was and if you think that's all it is it's gonna be very hard to consistently do the work to maintain that because you're not understanding what it really is and for me when when this all clicked over in 75 hard you know was born I took it from a external validation to an internal validation I took it from okay I want to be in shape because I want to look good at the pool or I want my clothes to fit those are great things by the way they're great things but I I would say they are less than 30% of the benefit that you actually get from from being in good condition yeah and you know the confidence the self-esteem like you said the the way you feel like when you walk into a room and the way that people treat you when you walk into a room you know these are undeniable things that unless you've actually ever experienced them over the course of a significant amount of time you wouldn't really understand the value no you know yeah and I think that's where a lot of people struggle with it yeah I agree and I think I'm blessed to not you know have that problem where I need to lose weight and high school is very skinny like I couldn't put out weight to save my life like a lot of times that's harder bro it was really hard for me and like soon as we got out of the football is like I had not run an ever again like I got to put on weight I think I put on like 25 pounds after high school like from 19 but yeah I had like the skinniest legs ever and I always hurt my back when I was squatting now my legs are the strongest part of my body like I can move some fucking weight yeah legs like I've trained legs for 10 years to make them look like this because I was always so skinny so people are always like you know like allegedly strong I must be not gonna do that I've been doing it for 10 years yeah what's the secret I get people all the time like hey what do you do for legs I'm like 10 years of working out but I think it's being in shape is also for your spouse like you don't think that your wife or your girlfriend or your boyfriend's gonna be happier when you're in good shape you don't think the other spouse would be like why don't you look like him like I think about that should all the time too like your spouse gonna come with you too I think a big part of you know talking about being in shape people have never you know understood it or like well my spouse is also out of shape so I don't want to make them feel bad they don't have to come with you they will or they won't and you're not with the right person yeah I think that people are like I've never really been in shape I you know it's not something I'm used to I don't know really what the benefits would be yeah you do you're just afraid to do it and if you take it for yourself and you get in shape your spouse will come with you the people around you will come with you and they're gonna appreciate it too I think being in shape is not only for you it's for the people around you your family like I know you said your dad is in better shape cells and better shape is everybody's got you did it yeah my my cell is my dad is my mom is everybody in this offices yeah I mean dude we used to have a culture five 10 years not even fucking I mean five six years ago we're like dude we were all drinkers yeah like we all party all the time dude like all the time and ever since I started fixing this in my own life it's almost like people here don't drink anymore it's like isn't it weird yeah it is weird we it's okay it is cool like it's cool because like 98% of the time it's better but like I do kind of miss those fucking two percent of party times yeah everyone's wow I always laugh at the story when you're like you know it's huge party night for my birthday with Keaton oh fuck and I just think of that all time like oh we've had those yeah for sure a couple years ago oh man they're just different people and like those were good times but I I would never trade it like I would neither never I would never go back there's no way I don't know how I even survive at that point I don't even know how people were around me I'm like how was I even efficient at all any people like you guys are crazy like 75 hard it's like so aggressive it's not all about work now you get to have a life too like a pretty fairly good life like yeah I'm a fairly decent house drive fairly nice car like I feel like things are doing okay I'm not even close to where I want to what's the life bro okay fucking drunk that's Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday all day and then you know being hung over on Monday Tuesday Wednesday you get a couple decent days of being clear in and then you know you go right back to that's that's the life you saw what I posted my mom actually said this to me Lori she was like well you gotta think about it you know like you do this for saying five days like you know you really drink from when you're 21 and you're gonna be 30 like you've probably been in a fog for the last 30 years yeah because we think about like you drink on Sunday so that Monday you're kind of yeah you know Tuesday I've got so wine with your wife for whatever your house and then Thursday you drink Friday drinks Saturday and you're always in that fog and you're really clear it's like a decade of being think if you weren't now I look back I'm like damn dude if I didn't drink I maybe I would have missed some things and like learn lessons like absolutely I'm happy that I did drink whatever but it is crazy to look back that's why these younger guys we have that work for us I'm like did I'm telling you don't get a DUI try not to have a kid before you're like 30 and you'll be ahead of a lot of people yeah you know like those are things that I did like try to do that it's just weird but I don't miss drinking and like if we have a holiday party and stuff like I'm not you know I won't drink anything but I just like to be more focused and dialed in and clear headed and you know it's not that I don't drink in like all in this perfect example I drink for a long time I drink last year a lot all the time and I was doing stupid shit but I'm just trying to tell people that are either thinking about doing 75 harder whatnot there's so many more benefits than just like getting in better shape to it I think there's a lot of people on the fence that like you always say oh you've competed or you've done a show not like this you haven't yeah I'm a dieted like this yeah I got a leader doing this then I did my bodybuilding show and I was 19 yeah well that's something that you learn like you you learn that in the you know here's what you really learn you learn that the idea of cheat meals and cheat days is bullshit oh yeah I used to be the cheat day king man I had to have the cheat day and I lived the whole week for the cheat day yeah and when I you know it's funny because you see all these fucking you know people on the internet who are like this is not this is not sustainable this is not this is not that well look man you know the reason why you can't get past your own food addiction and your alcohol addiction is because every seven day you're indulging in that yeah every single seven day you're gorging yourself or you're you're heavily drinking and you think that's going to cure this from your life you're just bridging the gap between the times of abstinence yeah and there's no real cure and you know people will say oh well 21 days makes a new no 21 days is not long enough 21 days was long enough boot camps would be 21 days yeah all culture reprogramming programs would be 21 days that's they're not they're usually about 10 to 12 weeks and for me dude getting through that first weekend of no cheating and no alcohol for me was like the biggest fucking win I've ever had in my life like I had never gone a full you know seven days without cheating or drinking and that first weekend I can remember being like holy shit but that was hard but it wasn't that hard yeah you know man I feel really good yeah I feel great I feel pretty sharp right now yeah it was amazing dude and and I think so many to your point so many people are so caught up in the culture of alcohol and just terrible food decisions that they have a hard time imagining life without without it without it because like dude that becomes your identity right society that's every commercial right is alcohol dude drink like I get same way you know I even like go places I'm like we know the idiots yeah like it's like not to be derogatory because like that was me like bro you know I get on Thursday night to watch the football game like we got a little work tomorrow it's you start to see things and you're like all right I'm happy I did this dude I've had I had one half of one beer the entire 2023 so far I think it was on Emily's birthday so Emily and I went to brunch on her birthday and we were sitting in Billy G's which is my favorite place to go my neighbor actually owns and he's a great fucking dude and they're great people yeah but I'm sitting there and I'm I'm drinking my Stella I like Stella and I'm sitting next to this like group of like brunch moms like they're like about 40 as your favorite oh my god bro that it was so obnoxious they were all they were talking about was the money that they were gonna get from whoever they were dating a bunch of far left political fucking viewpoints and these fucking ladies had no fucking idea what's going on in the world and they were chirp it and they and I heard this one lady say something about her her sugar daddy or some shit and like bro I looked at Emily and I'm like we got to leave I'm like I can't I can't be here like like if I stay here any longer I'm I go to jail yeah like I couldn't do it and I'm looking around it's 11 o'clock and I'm like they're drinking they're drinking they're drinking and then I'm listening to the shit they're talking about and I'm like holy fuck bro like the matrix is here yes like here I'm in the matrix I'm watching everybody just a road oh my god and so like dude we we fucking we fucking left yeah we went and did our we went and did something else and it's just I mean society has been groomed into that yeah that's what you do yeah if you're in business that you drink and it's like and then it's like we said earlier it's like you find out when you don't drink yeah the really good people in business are like damn after a while they're like this is pretty impressive yeah it's weird the people you end up hanging out with you know what's crazy dude is real talk almost every single person I know that's like high level business person they rarely drink yeah very very why yeah exactly yeah exactly they'll now they'll drink like like Ed will have a glass of whiskey right but like I'm not talking about binge drinking now I'm talking about like very few of these people binge drink and when you start to realize that and you start to look around it becomes you know it comes very obvious that you're doing the wrong things and and like dude for me I want to win you know and you guys could judge that shit all you want I don't really give a fuck I want to win and you could say you know the people like to say well who's gamer you playing what you're winning the capital is game my fucking right that's what I'm winning yes you're correct yeah they want you I want to win that game fit they want you drunk be sober yeah I want to win that game and when you need something for me you'll call me you know what I mean and you won't hate the game anymore because you'll realize what the game is producing yeah I love the game I fucking love it I fucking love it and what I found is that people that don't love it it's always this like disingenuine bullshit of an excuse as to why they don't right it's it's uh it's well like you said I want to live my life you know I there's life to be lived well well you're you're automatically assuming that your quality of life is higher than my quality of life and how could you assume that if you never live my quality of life and by the way I've lived your quality of life for a long time you know what I mean yeah it's it's interesting it's a thing to it like even like I think cars I think the biggest thing that I always laugh at is people like I really don't like nice cars I don't really need a nice house what's because you never been around it yeah like I everybody would like a nicer car for their family or like nicer food or to stay at a nicer hood so that's the biggest load of shit bro these people are fucking liars okay it's just that's just call how it is yeah your mother fuckers are fucking liars okay you never experienced any of it you don't know what you're talking about you let your loser friends talk you into having this mentality because it excuses you from actually having to try that's the reality the reality is is that all these people who shit on success are being fit or 75 hard or fucking any of this shit living at a higher standard personal excellence you you guys who shit on it okay you're not fooling anybody who's living it you know like I get these people in the comments section once in a while and they're like oh man you know when you die you're gonna know you have no idea what you have no idea what the fuck I'm trying to do with my life bro you're judging your way of thinking and you're imposing that on me like bro imagine living your whole life and imagine drinking three or four nights a week your entire life all right imagine being fat your entire life imagine being broke your entire life imagine being dependent your entire life imagine never really mastering yourself over the course of the 80 years you're gonna be on this planet all right and then coming to the end of your life and then having to like deal with that that's not something that I'm okay dealing with that's not something that I'm willing to like like I'm already thinking that like I know at some point you know the chances are I'm going to have to like reconcile my whole entire life before I'm dead it's probably gonna happen when I'm sick or something happens right and I'm gonna have to say all right well what did I do and I know the answer is gonna be for me the answer is gonna be I did everything I fucking good yeah right and that ain't gonna be the answer for a lot of you guys the answer is gonna be shit I wasted my life and I was very lucky to have this I had this uh the situation happened to me in 2012 where I thought I had a brain tumor and ended up being a cyst an operable cyst I still have but for two weeks they thought it was a tumor all right so I'm walking around like fuck I got an inoperable tumor in my brain I couldn't really tell anybody because like dude I was like trying to figure out like yeah I thought my life was over so like I had to like reconcile right like I had to say well fuck bro you haven't done shit right and I had to answer all those questions and that was a huge blessing for me because it forced me to understand the kind of situation that we're all going to face at some point in time and I'm just not willing to to to live a life to where at the end of it I'm gonna say well fuck I wish I would have tried harder that's why I don't want my kids to ever be like why don't we have that yeah work hard enough I choose your hard yeah I mean that's I think that that's a little time it's extremely hard to make a payment on a you know 10 million dollar house we don't buy in cash it's also extremely hard to budget every single dime until your kids you can't go do shit yeah it's also extremely hard to wake up every day and work your ass off and feel all the stress and and and carry the burden of all these people yeah on you that's a hard thing but you know what else is hard carrying the burden of your entire family when you cannot provide for them 100% that's hard too yeah I know that all the time is our guys at work like there's another big reason why I don't really feel like I need to be drinking is because I'm responsible for we're gonna have 40 people at our holiday party excluding their children yeah I'm responsible for making sure there's money in the account to pay their payroll and make sure they can pay their bills yeah those 40 people 40 plus people that I'm affecting rely on me to get up and do my job every day yeah there's a lot of responsibility with that I'm never gonna say like I didn't work hard enough that's why you can't get paid yeah for sure dude so as we kind of get to the end of this discussion I mean if you were talking to someone let's say one of your people or just someone off the street who's you know giving you the little the typical run around on 75 hard you know oh seems extreme or oh it does this or oh you know I can get like what would you say to one it's the best fucking thing you'll ever do for yourself your entire life when we got here the about the kid at enterprise give us our rental car he's like hey what are you in town for us like I'm speaking on he's speaking on fucking any's podcast like this young kid probably 90s I got graduated college I'm kind of thinking about doing the same thing I've heard I don't know and I was like dude you should fucking do it is like well I'm afraid like lose my friends like they drink a ton and stuff and I was like dude you should fucking do it I just think if you're thinking about doing it if you're on the fence listen to 208 and maybe listen to it with like a friend or a spouse and be like all right I like to kind of understand this before you do it but coming from somebody that I think everybody when get back to this everybody looks at it like it's to get in shape your brain is the first thing that changes your body in the biggest part of it's gonna change the way that you think it's gonna change your ability I don't want to get up in the morning like my house is warm my girls there the dog sleeping I don't want to give it five o'clock in the morning go to the gym but I know that there's other people that aren't gonna do it and I'm gonna do it so they get up and do it you have to be willing to change your mindset it's not just your body so if you're thinking about do it but do it and go completely all in it's 75 days of your life yeah say five days is nothing yeah you can do a ton of shit the rest of your life but it will be the best thing you ever did dude you know I would say this I would add this to to to that statement you know when you when you stop thinking and this was huge for me this was a huge life pivoting realization that I want to share with you guys when you could stop thinking of it as the physical change like we spoke about a little bit ago you know like I'm gonna go to a wedding or I'm gonna go to the pool or I'm gonna do this and you could start to think of it as a mental game that you're trying to win it makes things way easier dude like it's it's not like like dude for me let's just say this is a beer okay and uh back in the day dude like someone would set this in front of me it didn't matter what time of day it could have been 7 30 in the morning I mean you know how many times the 7 30 in the morning I started drinking probably some of the most fun times yeah for sure usually all the times I got fucking a big trouble too yeah all right and by the way that's another point that you hit on that has absolutely been true for me every single bad thing that's ever happened to me every single thing I look back on every single thing I'm embarrassed about every single thing that I'm like fuck I really shouldn't have fucking done that alcohol was at the source of that every single I've never done anything outside of that I'm like ashamed of outside of alcohol I agree it's never happened you know and and that's a big thing but you know for you guys who are seeing their struggling and you're like you know I don't know if I can go 75 days on a diet and in that drinking and you that sounds you have to understand what we're talking about truly unlocking in your life because it's not just at the end of 75 days you're going to be in a little bit better shape you're going to have a completely different level of awareness around what it takes to operate your life which is your mind your spirit and your body and back for me one of the things I struggle with so much was like if someone set let's say food or or pizza or a beer in front of me right I had zero control over this thing like if someone put it in front of me it was almost it looking back it's been embarrassing it's embarrassing how little control I had if someone would set this beer in front of me I had to drink it dude I was drinking the rest of the day I would just look at my watch I'd be like well fuck it all right well today we're drinking right yeah and I'm sure a lot of you guys can relate to that and when I started seeing this as a mental battle instead of like I'm trying to get in shape but as a battle between myself about doing what I knew was I was supposed to do it changed the game switch flip for me and so I started looking at things like this beer right and I started looking at it I'm like this is a fucking inanimate object like and this thing has power over me like this is this is something that I'm allowing to dictate my life and produce all these negative results in my life and it could be beer could be food it could be wine it could be whatever right it's probably all those things get mine for a lot of you guys but when I started looking at it and I said there's no fucking way I'm allowing this inanimate object that another person made to literally have control over my entire beam that's when the thing that's when the light switch for me personally that's when I started looking at it differently I started seeing it not as how in shape I was but more so how much control I had how much how much I guess you say discipline I had in terms of being able to say no to the things that legitimately have no control over me and I think when you guys who who are struggling with your food and with your body and with your alcohol instead of thinking of it as hey I'm trying to get in shape because I'm fat maybe you should get a little pissed off at the things around you and say dude this fucking beard is not control me this fucking food does not control me I have the power over these things and when you start looking at it like that you develop a new it's a new game it's not the game of my body fat percentage or the game of you know how good I look it's the game of how I feel about myself for being able to control things that should be controllable in my life and I think you know when you guys who haven't done 75 hard when you guys think about the entire thing you're not taking into account the awareness and the cheat code that it's going to unlock for you because once you figure yourself out and once you understand that things like discipline grit fortitude perseverance the ability to build confidence the ability to build self-esteem the ability to build momentum on demand you know all these things that encompass what we would call mental toughness once you start to understand that these things are all fully in our control and we can raise the level of those at any time we want dude that's powerful shit and that's not you're not going to get that from doing you know a beach program to go to your friends wedding that's not what this is about and it does get a little bit frustrating for me when people just straight up like think it's a diet or think it's a fitness program because they're totally discounting the the upper side of the benefits which is you becoming aware of how to operate your life your body minus spirit as needed and when you start to understand the awareness part you know I'm sure you could probably say this like there's probably been times over the last year where you you've caught yourself slipping where you've been like fuck all right I'm slipping right now I need to reel this back in whereas before I didn't have that ability I don't know if you did but I didn't I didn't have the ability to catch myself and if you guys can catch yourself early you stop your this is why I've been able to keep off the the hundred pounds I lost from in 2016 you know it's not like that was the first time I lost weight I lost weight gain weight lost weight gain weight the reason I've been able to keep it off and it's become an actual you know sustainable thing is because I've become aware of when I start to slip that action needs to change immediately and and I think when we talk about what 75 hard really brings I think I think people do it a massive disservice by talking about it in terms of fitness you know exclusively yeah I think I mean just from me to you like I'm super proud of you too I mean that's hard to lose weight like that and to keep it off especially that curtain shoulder yeah and coming back like is that was a big win for me to pretty fucking impressive yeah being I appreciate that but like being able to go through that shoulder injury not be able to train any upper body for basically a year and a half yeah and not get fat again that was a huge fucking deal for me now did I stay as hard as I wanted to stay no but I didn't mean not going back to three bills which would have been very easy huge win dude huge win because in my in the past my mentality would have been like this fuck it I'm hurt I can't do shit when I get back I'll attack it all but what that does is that creates this this mountain that's Matt yeah dude it just cycles up the fucking program again yeah I think people don't realize too like you don't have to do any of this shit yeah like you found something that worked for you and you're like all right this really works like this helped me a lot yeah I'm gonna give this to everybody for free yeah that's why I'm trying to get back like our guys and everybody listening like this worked for me like people thought we were doing well before and we're doing so well now this is what it was like this really worked yeah this why we're trying to give people advice if you should do it exactly the way it's designed because it's helped us so much I want to help other people and bring other people with us because you me can't do everything like you me can't fix this fucking problem country but if individual people do this like individual personal excellence we can fix this shit yeah but people got to get the shit yeah I fucking love it dude and and a big big like you said you're proud of me dude I appreciate that but I'm very very very proud of you as well and and what I'm proud of you is not that you walk around looking like Zeus okay because you do you look amazing dude um it's the fact that you recognize the obligation to lead that's a big big deal right now and to have a young man such as yourself sitting here telling me both of you guys this is for you too telling me what you guys are doing for the people in your office and how you take it as a responsibility and taking that seriously that makes me feel like what I'm doing matters and like bro it's it's you know sometimes it gets pretty lonely and dark for me in terms of that you know I feel like a lot of times what I'm doing is it's fucking waste of time so um if you take nothing else from that from your visit here just understand bro like what you're doing is important and it's highly needed we need people that are willing to lead by example and to hold the people coming behind them to a standard and you guys are doing that and it makes me super fucking proud dude appreciate it real talk they never know who's watching yeah I really don't shit that we're gonna we're gonna everybody find you on the internet uh really just I mean
