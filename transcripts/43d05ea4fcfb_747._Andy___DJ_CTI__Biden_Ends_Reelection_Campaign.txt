So what we got going on here. We got a lot of interesting stuff We got we got a new little segment we tried. Yeah, we'll check out here in a little bit See how it works see what you guys think about it see if you guys like it, but Got a lot of interesting stuff to go over and talk about there's been some interesting developments over the weekend So as always we like to try to connect some of these dots for you guys with that being said man We talk about you know, this is a you know, we're Americans. I'm American you're American and you know We talk about how important it is to be proud of this country And represent this country and so we know the Olympics are going on right now And did they start already? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it started And I saw this and I'm like, you know, it's just I don't know if I can if I can say you know the tides turning and you know I don't know I would like to see your thoughts, but LeBron James Just got unveiled as team USA's flag bear for Paris Olympic opening ceremony So and and he's been in the Olympics playing for a team USA for quite a bit now You know when he was I mean shit when he first got in the NBA. I mean, yeah, 2004 20 years Damn he's been playing for 20 years Three that's crazy that's crazy, but yeah, so he they just named him here's a little clip of them announcing it on behalf of the entire Men's Olympic basketball team we would like to nominate LeBron James to be the flag bear for all a team USA He got that honor so you get the way to flag in Paris, my man It's a special in the fight that you know to get an opportunity to No represent your country, you know and in another fashion, you know to be able to understand how prestigious, you know this moment is and for someone to have you know the flag bear and the way the flag for Not only for us as a man's national team before all the Olympians I hold up with the utmost honor and There was definitely something that My family and my community and my friends or something they were living on forever and super appreciative and super humble Yeah, so Apparently is the third basketball player that has received this honor First men's Player to carry the flag Now we've covered LeBron a few times You know and he's never really like struck me as this like you know super happy American like I remember when the Brittany Griner stuff was going on And you know there was some some issues there Saying that like you know she would be justified and I wanted to return to America and like America turned their back and you know all of this stuff Obviously, he's a great player that's undeniable like don't care what you think about him or not put politics and stuff aside He's a great fucking phenomenal basketball player He's definitely getting some great hairs, but I mean I thought this was kind of cool to see. What's your thoughts on this? I Mean look dude LeBron James is one of the best basketball players probably one the best athletes had ever played I mean I wish he would just play basketball from being honest. You know over the years He's said some really divisive things and done some things that I think are divisive and irresponsible of his position as a figure in the public eye I don't know him personally. I'm sure he's a cool dude. I don't know He I mean I'll say this when he got that when they announced that he get a big smile I think that's first time I ever seen a smile like that ever We look good on him, you know, but You know hopefully he's figured a couple things out. I don't know if he has or he hasn't I'm sure it's a pretty cool opportunity to carry the flag, but you know personally I think he's done a poor job as a leader in terms of You know really teaching the things that have made him so great, you know hard work relentless execution practice You know all these things that he's put in over the years You know and then he talks about privileges and things that you know certain people have and certain people don't have And it's just not relevant to where why he is where he is and so I don't understand why he ever got off on that in the first place I'm all four second chances and I appreciate when people come around But nothing of what I saw of that indicated that he's coming around. I mean We'll see what happens the next big, you know Social justice crisis and we'll see where he stands. Yeah, man. I mean look dude these and then the other thing is you know You got to remember these guys are pushed to do these things and say these things It seems like he's out of his Malcolm X phase, you know You know where he's got the long Longer beard and he wears the thick glasses and he's got you know He's on the first page of a Malcolm X book every time we see him You know it seems I mean dude. That's just that's reality You can yeah, you can pull up multiple pictures of him reading the book where he's got the book open to the first page Let me tell you something if you're gonna pretend to read fucking just open a halfway man Yeah, like yeah dude like so you know I look dude I don't really hate people man like you know what I'm saying like I I Think LeBron You know is a young guy. I don't I don't think there's any manual to someone Becoming insanely famous and insanely wealthy And I think people are gonna make mistakes in that regard and that's how I feel about it dude. I'm not a hateful person And I believe ultimately for us to really get this country on track. It's gonna take people like him Realizing the hey man. I got kind of fucked with and lied to and standing up and having the courage to voice what what the truth is You know so you know we need we need people like LeBron to come around and You know maybe he is maybe he's not I don't know, but you know I think everybody in general is realizing how ridiculous all of this stuff is and how insane it is In terms of the division and the contention and the judgment over you know socio-economic standings or race standings or politics standings I think everybody's tired of it. I think he's probably tired of it. He's probably tired of being asked about it and You know we'll see what happens And that's what I think I'm really indifferent about LeBron You know, I just don't like when people pander and You know he has pandered quite a bit, you know what I'm saying with his pander Well, and I'm just saying this with his pro black stances and pro black stances are Wrong it should be pro-America stances and just like a pro white stance is not what the America Should be it shouldn't be pro black either should be pro-American if we're gonna actually have the country that we all you know Say we believe in and then we all want which is equal opportunity equal treatment These divisive conversations and these divisive stances that a lot of these people take on one side or the other prevent us from having that And and that's unfortunate because the those are the things we're gonna have to have to really get our country on track Yeah, that's real shit. And I got sells what you guys think that's what down in the comments the LeBron turn to page Or is he still on page one Let us know what you guys think man 20 years. That's a long. I mean that's a long time. No, it isn't you're just young 20 years as a snap the finger. That's what you young bucks don't understand bro I'm telling you anybody who's at 40 years old will tell you yeah I was 20 yesterday. You know get it. You don't get it. It wasn't a long time ago I remember when he got drafted. I remember very clearly. I remember I remember when Kobe got drafted That's crazy. Yeah, bro. Like I remember it very clearly and in a lot of young guys don't you guys think that was a long time ago It's not a long time in the scheme of things it goes by super fast Ask him if it goes by fast. Yeah, I almost wonder if he's starting to realize that he's in the twilight of his career And he's starting to like be like damn dude I you know, wish I would have done some things differently and maybe he's maybe he's starting that I don't know me Yeah, I don't know him personally and honestly I don't really know anybody that knows him personally which is Kind of weird. Yeah, so Yeah, that is interesting think about like because you do you do know a lot of people and like he's not in any of those circles Yeah, that's weird. Yeah, all right cool. Well, let's get into some of these headlines guys remember if you want to see any of these headlines These articles pictures links videos go to Andy for sell it. I'll link all of that stuff there for you With that being said headline Number one talk of the town today Obviously, Biden's out of the race. So that that became official. He completely officially Or maybe officially ended his reelection campaign He announced it His intentions some day after noon promising to reveal more about this decision soon now Just with that real quick. That was some weird stuff because I remember Friday that was talks about it and Like we both have people and all over you know, they're in these places and I was told Friday They yes, it was absolutely absolutely happened to no doubt And then I remember like Friday night and then Saturday was like no, there's no way I'm in this thing and then Sunday It's back out. So it seemed like there was always this like back and forth battle I'm not really sure who the two parties were you know what I'm saying like if it was Biden's family trying to force them to stay in When everybody else is selling them to get out It was just weird because it was it was it really was it's like back and forth. Yeah, we're in it's like this hoki poky dance It was weird, but he but he put this out in the statement and and The first one came out in the form of a tweet right and then he attached a subsequent letter to this But the tweet read my fellow Democrats I have decided not to accept the nomination and to focus all my energies on my duties as president for the remainder of my term my very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my vice president and it has been the best decision I've made today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of a party this year Democrats it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this And then he Sub tweeted this under it Saying quoted and if you're with us donates a her campaign here Which is still linked as Biden Harris campaign. It was interesting I told you don't you notice how you know like go go back to the tweet Just want to point something out. It's time to come together and beat Trump Isn't it time to come together and make our country amazing? Isn't it time to come together and make our country what it's supposed to be? Isn't it time to come together and Unify so that people like this can't continue to rape and pillage our citizens financially and and all different kinds of ways Isn't it time that we built this country back into you know a superpower a undeniable great Country isn't isn't it isn't it time for that? I mean should we be saying that as opposed to let's go beat this guy They're so fixated on no bro. They're so fixated on them because he's not part of their team I'm gonna have I'm gonna have more to say about that in a minute Yeah, I mean it's it's it's interesting now. I know that it's been you know there's there's still some some questions happening because you know We have not seen Or officially heard from Biden in six days now um, and you know there was talks about you know the the letter that was posted with this signature and it's like is that His original signature. It's like I mean there's a lot of weird stuff happening there There's also some interesting Narratives that are coming out that when he was in Las Vegas the triple court cut short due to the medical emergency We don't really know and like it's hard to say you know I mean there's there's people questioning that he's actually still alive right now, right? And they're like it's a fair question. I don't know the answer to that But um it is weird we have not seen this man who's supposed to be our leader of this country in five six days now Now talk about Harris talk about uh chamomile um She's still trellin you like she she's not doing any better than than Biden was And very very key states especially with women and non-black minorities Which would be the Latino vote Asian-American vote. She's not doing well at all Um, and it's super interesting now. I think it's funny because a lot of people tends to forget This woman's past right like She was an attorney general In the state of California where her policies the three strike rule and other policies that she put in and Implimented as the head prosecutor They disproportionately locked up a shit ton of black men. Mm-hmm. There was also tampering with evidence and witnesses Um of people who were completely innocent that she completely threw out and denied and then lied about Um, and there's also talks that she basically kind of fucked her way up to the top Mm-hmm Now Joe Brown judge Joe Brown um who I like a person who like him um he did a statement on this in this video Well, you know before you get into that you know Kamala was on The breakfast club bragging about how she smoked weed and what music she listened to and then she said they asked her When and it was during the time when she was locking up all these black men for marijuana. It's insane So just so we understand the kind of person she is it's insane Oh, she was laughing about it. It's insane. Yeah, yeah Smoked a little Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, because dude and then she said it was in college, but she graduated college in 89 Okay, and then she asked her what music she listened to and she said oh I listen to biggie and two-pock when I'm smoking Well biggie and two-pock weren't making music till fucking mid 90s bitch. So somebody line. Yeah, you're lying Yeah Yeah, but joe judge joe brown man He did this interview a while ago And now it's resurfacing right because again people are for some reason they forget all of these yeah fucked up things I'll let's check in with judge joe brown and see what he had to say and you got come queen love M-hawp in there You know M-hawp in no Yes you do Who? Mrs. M-hawp by his president of the United States who goes by her maiden name. That's come on. Oh Miller Harris Comella She's got two Jewish children she adopted married Jewish I'm scared to talk about her mother Harris only to you how that one She's a witch and she is a corrupt witch She's been corrupt the whole life and she fucked away to the top They used to detail this witch in the early time with a sexual escapades She fucked him there everybody trying to get up. She used to be a frat. Oh, which he was it out Is she ain't black You know, I guess you do it this, Miss Garrett I mean well She definitely ain't black no, she's not yeah, in fact, there's a bunch of uh There's a bunch of propaganda I guess I'll call it or claims that she made you know back earlier in her career where she was you know the first Indian woman Elected to the office of attorney general or whatever right and now because she's got a panor to black people She's the first black woman right it just depends on who the crowds you saw into at the time. Yeah, bro. Whatever. Yeah I just know I just listen Well, here's you think I actually met her father Mm-hmm in Jamaica. I was the guest Said it a gum. Yeah, so I mean you got come queen love come queen Bro, she has no business being there. No zero. Yeah, zero now Here's the thing she's been getting some unwavering support from from pretty much a lot of interest in people Pelosi obviously one of the first ones to jump in on that You got people like you know, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. Gavin Newsom of California Andy Bashar of Kentucky AOC the squad everybody's jumping in But there's been one party in particular that I think it's pretty interesting that has not jumped in on the comola Come train the Obama's you're bombers have not officially a doester And everybody's throwing out their endorsements, you know, you got the you know the Gavin Newsom's of the world I think they're trying to I don't know if they're trying to push for a VP spot on the ticket. I don't know But I did think that was pretty interesting the Obama's have not come out to endorse Down to endorse here There's also some talks that The war chest of the campaign funds because Biden is no longer on the ticket may have to get forfeited and return back to all the donors Which is interesting that's something we're gonna be definitely keeping an eye out. They sit up right now about 90 I think it's 93 96 million dollars right now and if that's the case Um That money will have to get returned Which is interesting because they just ran a 24 hour campaign where they allegedly rate rose Raised like 50 million. Yes, all that so you know, it's interesting last little tidbit on this man I think it's interesting to you know as now there's this talk Well if you're not strong enough to run for president. You're not strong enough to be president Um, and there's people that that are saying and calling this move that the Dems have been playing as an actual coup It is a coup a double coup. It is it. It is a fucking coup, right? 100% and I think that's interesting here. Here is Trump and JD Vance Talking about this. Let's let's watch this clip You'd investigate the people that hid Joe Biden's condition. Well, I think somebody has to look at it You had people that lied to the American public and I tell you what you ought to take a look at his doctors Because his doctors keep giving him this wonderful report. I'm not a doctor But I saw him the other day was unable to get up the children's stairs going into Air Force one. Is it a coup against Joe Biden? It sort of yeah, I think it is. I mean look There's a constitutional process the 25th amendment if Joe Biden can't run for president He can't service president And if they want to take him down because he's mentally incapable of serving invoke the 25th amendment You don't get to sort of do this in the most politically beneficial way for Democrats If it's an actual problem, they should take care of it the appropriate way And and you know There's a bunch of names in the flow and they don't know if commoners for sure it But the hill just put this article out Ready for round two Why we need Hillary more than ever? Talks as you might be coming back in any what do you got on all of this? I mean look dude, you know, it is a coup. That's that's what's going on These people like I've said many many times over the last number of years That a lot of people who are quote unquote influencers have stolen for me and said oh, I called it I called it I called it now you fucking did it I fucking called it and you mother fuckers listen to the show and then you pretend you called it This mother fucker was a plant Joe Biden he was put into power illegally with a stolen election He was then utilized To be the figurehead that was perceived to be incompetent To destroy our country if you look at what he's done over the last four and a half years And you look at the damage that he's created This man was put in power to do that damage and then for all of us they recognize what's happening To say oh look he's so dumb. He doesn't know what he's doing. There's nothing dumb about what these people are doing The dumb mother fucker is Joe Biden because he can't understand You know, he wanted to be president so much and it was such a big thing for him That he couldn't see that they were setting him up So they put this old man in power To appear to be incompetent when they know what they're doing intentionally Is destroying culture they know that the American people only way that they would allow this to happen Is if they could look at someone and say that guy's so dumb look at what he's doing when in reality Have they had a competent leader in there. Let's say they had a Barack Obama You know, hypothetically that type of character someone who who you knew was smart enough to understand They would look at that guy and they would say dude that guy's a fucking traitor He's destroying our country. We've been called out of me correct So they needed someone who looked incompetent to do what they've done And that's another reason why they're pushing Kamala now because the job isn't done Coincidentally is their slogan. Let's finish the job. Okay, so That's what's going on and what happened here is This dude got so bad and he was appeared to be so incompetent that even his own voters have realized holy shit This guy's a A little man We've all known this the entire time the media knew this the entire time Kamala's known this the entire time KJP's known this the entire time Everybody around him knows that he's been this way this entire time and everybody who's critical of him knows that too And the people who who voted for him have dug their heels in and tried to say no, he's fine It's the greatest he's the greatest president of all time Isn't it interesting how they went from he's one of the most effective presidents of all time to We got to get him the fuck out because he's gonna lose Well, if he was the greatest president all time why was why is he losing right? Why is he losing with his own base Right these people are professional liars and they have no Issue lying to your face. So you should ask yourself if Joe Biden is incapable of leading Well, doesn't that mean that Kamala Harris has been leading so don't we already know what the fuck we're gonna get with her and more of right so We break this down and we look at it from an aspect of what is actually going on What's actually going on is we have an establishment machine that is Not representing the interests of this country not represent the interests of this people And now they have legitimately run a coup because they totally threw away all of the votes that voted for Joe Biden To become the president and because his own people were Disapproving of him. They're okay with it. Okay, so they they don't understand what legally has actually happened here but imagine that they had Let's imagine the Joe Biden was a decent candidate and they had this other candidate that they wanted to run And everybody actually thought Joe Biden was a good decent enough candidate to run And then they just replaced him because they wanted to this exact same way Well, those people would say dude they just did this that's not fair That's a coup but because he's so bad These people don't realize what they just did which was subvert our entire democratic process All right, so they're right it is a fucking coup and even if you're a Democrat of reasonable mind and I'm not talking about a leftist because those people are not safeable But a Democrat of reasonable mind maybe a moderate Democrat a left-leaning moderate Someone who voted Democrat 20 years ago and still thinks that's the party that you're voting for those people Can see what happened and they're like realizing holy shit This these people are out of control. So When we break down what's actually going on here we we don't really know we know it was forced because he didn't want to leave But because at the time of this recording we haven't heard from him. We haven't seen him He hasn't done anything except setting that letter out and that letter Doesn't even have his own signature on it. Okay, so think about this We had a president of the United States quit On social media Think about that bro people don't even quit their fucking minimum wage jobs on social media We had the president of the United States quit on social media the White House found out his staffers found out from that tweet that was sent out Okay, so we don't even know if he Wanted to do that or if they just did it and said hey now it's too late and now they're keeping him away from the cameras Right, we don't know we don't know anything. We don't know where he is We don't know what's going on. We don't know if he's alive or if he's not alive Bro, this is insanity and if this were happening in a third-world country NATO troops would be flowing in there to restore order Okay, this is a legitimate third-world fucking coup and they're doing it To pull another coup All right, which is to steal another election here because they realize that they're not going to be able to fool people So in my opinion what we have going on here and I'm fairly certain of this is that There go last week. I said what didn't I say this the last week? Didn't I say there would be a double switch? Okay, this is what the plan is the plan is to fucking put Kamala out right now Everybody's like fuck like even Biden voters are like fuck this isn't any better. This is not better than Joe She's a moron because she is a moron all right Everybody's seen her for years and years and years be a total moron And she's a moron because she thinks she's actually going to be present which she isn't okay Here's what's going to happen. They're putting her out there right now for to take the That a little bit of the air out of out of the party their party Okay, meaning like their parties like fuck all right. We got to get Joe out. We got to get Joe out We got Kamala okay, and they're gonna run Kamala up until the DNC convention All right, which I think is like four weeks from now and then at the DNC convention They're gonna bring in a Michelle Obama. They're gonna bring in someone that has so much Fanfare and so much upward hype in the beginning and then they're gonna hope that that hype stays high until the election and that they can somehow Get a push of people To to vote for her to make the election close enough for them to steal you have to understand They they can't fudge The massive gap okay, but they can fudge a smaller or medium gap This is why it's important for you to vote for who you think the best option is Regardless if you think they control the shit or not control the shit I keep seeing all these people to say uh fucking voting's bullshit vote harder blah blah blah You're the fucking problem in this country because you're too stupid to understand that they can actually cover a small gap or a meeting gap But not a large gap and the most important thing is is that we have the evidence to show that they cheated If you don't vote because you think that it's pointless then we can't prove that they cheated and they can win And then things could get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse Oh, well, I don't want to buy into the the concept of me consenting to vote dude you're a fucking idiot Okay, this is reality. Yes, I agree the country has a long way to go Yes, I agree that Donald Trump is not going to come in and make the country Exactly how it should be but I do think he will come in and fix a whole bunch of shit to get us moving the right way And then we can talk about where we need to take it and 28 and in 32 and beyond that okay We need some change right now or we're gonna fucking sink and it needs People need to realize that they need to vote and participate in that process so My thing is is they're gonna bring in Michelle Obama So that the perception is She has a chance to beat Trump and they can cheat you see what I'm saying So I still stand has a lot of social horsepower. I know bro. I still stand with what I'm saying And it's absurd to think that a spouse is qualified to be present just because they're a spouse Are we not tired of the same mother fuckers running this country? It's been like 50 years with a bush and a Clinton and a Biden in the fucking election It's been like 48 years. Okay, we haven't had an election in 48 years without one of those three people in it Why? Because they're all in the fucking family and this lady Kamala is not So what's happening here is a big setup in my opinion. It's a it's a big setup To like kind of bridge the gap between now and the DNC and then when the DNC comes out They're gonna roll out of Michelle Obama They're gonna have all this fucking fanfare. It's in fucking Chicago like I said two years ago Okay, and it's gonna be this huge thing to get all this gas behind the Democrats and then they're gonna steal the election again and everybody and all the Republicans in Washington DC and everybody on the streets gonna be like How the fuck do they do this again? How do they do this again? Well, we did this again because you guys don't understand That you have to get every single motherfucker that you know to go vote every single one every single one of you listen to show I'm not gonna tell you how to vote, but you need to get everybody you know to go vote period Okay, I know how I'm voting you guys could probably guess, okay, but the reality is is that um This is a coup. This is illegal what they just did too. It's illegal and if our Republican congress and senators had any fucking guts or courage or backbone at all They would do something about it right now these people should be arrested. They should be put in jail and that's what's going on But yeah, dude, we have to understand these people are all in a family, okay, Kamala's not in that family. All right Brothers talks that they don't even know if she's like even eligible to be President Like with the like I mean like it's crazy, but like I mean it's these are serious questions that should be asked how her parents were not American citizens They don't have to be as long as she had born here But the the president has to be I understand that advice president She was born here But her parents that's what matter Like they they caught there's a term for that they called it um that may Make her not eligible Well, here's the problem. This is another thing people aren't talking about There are a few states that will only allow the ballot to be changed right now If Joe Biden were to be removed for the 25th amendment or he will die, okay? Those are the only two things that can change the ballot so If they don't if one of those two things doesn't happen Then Kamala won't even be on the ballot for those electoral votes in some of those states Nevada's wonderful no shit. Yeah, I don't know that yeah, so that's that's something How do you think about all those people that printed out all this fucking mail and ballots already? How do you think they feel? Listen to you. Listen to you. I wouldn't be real. I think I think Trump fans are highly overestimating where they are I think they think they have in one. I think they think America is back And that is a very dangerous thing to believe at this point in time because it is not true This is not over at least people will do anything to maintain power and uh that includes Clearly uh assassination attempts that includes coups that includes putting their political opponents in jail It It includes instigating terrorist attacks. It includes wars It includes instigating pandemics and we've seen all this with our own eyes over the last however many years And there's still a bunch of people that think this is just random. Have you ever seen a more chaotic time than from 2016 now.

Uh, this is uh, this is an interesting one This is one that has been going on all day to day when the show was being recorded So let's jump in let's talk about it headline number two reads Head of house committee on homeland security calls on Cheetle to resign So the director of the secret service Kimberly Cheetle she is getting blasted. She's she she was got blasted all day today Um, so let's dive into let's talk about it. So uh, today Monday when the show was recorded house committee on Homeland Security Chairman Mark E green I'm out of Tennessee called on uh called for the resignation of US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheetle After the nearest assassination of former president Donald Trump Saying she had uh misled the committee by claiming Trump's team had not requested additional security prior to the assassination attempt That is false they absolutely did um Cheetle's uh she's she's been testifying all day today She's expected to say quote the secret services solemn mission is to protect our nation's leaders on July 13th We failed as the director of the United States Secret Service I take full responsibility for any security laps the Washington Post reported Adding that she will add quote we must learn what happened And I will move heaven and earth to ensure an accident like July 13th does not happen again thinking about what We should have done differently is never far from my thoughts Um, so there was a couple of big updates one of the biggest ones that came out during her questioning today Was that it was discovered That right after the assassination attempt Kimberly she called Donald Trump personally um and apologized Almost immediately after today. Oh no, no the went on July 13th. Okay, right And I'm not like the timeline wasn't specific, but it was shortly after the assassination attempt She called Donald Trump personally um and apologized She said that she spoke over the phone with former president Trump I mean that she apologized to him for the events that took place at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania That was one of the big was a big big You know things that came out. I thought was pretty interesting But my thing is if you can apologize if you know you fucked up literally an hour or two hours after that that fuck up But here we are, you know What a week and a half later and you still have not resigned like Step down right like step down. It's very very simple um, how about this How about the people who know what she did like I saw Marjorie Taylor green hammer in her. I saw a number of these guys hammer in her. I saw her getting hammered by people in her own Well on the other party. Yeah, okay um And uh, why don't you guys arrest her? Why don't you do what you're supposed to do? Yeah, what point does it cross? Well, it's very listen to these people bring these people in for these congressional hearings How many times have we seen this how many times have we seen people marched into an congressional hearing Fauci Zuckerberg fucking all all the people I'm in lawy with Afghanistan and they don't give any real answers At least Zuckerberg is some decent shit, okay Maybe it's unfair to stick him in there But dude these people march these people in there they They don't answer any questions and then they don't do anything about it at all they do nothing So like they can get up there and say oh, I let them have it all they want but dude. I'm sick of that I'm sick of these people walking out being like I grilled them No, we don't care about you grilling them Marjorie Taylor green or Ted Cruz or fucking anybody Josh howley who I like From Missouri we don't care about you grilling people anymore. We want to see some fucking accountability Okay, that's the reality these people come in they don't answer a goddamn thing And then they walk the fuck out and nothing happens. When is that gonna change? When's that gonna change because that's what people want they're tired of this shit and quite honestly I think every single fucking politician should be voted to fuck out that is an operating on that standard We had COVID happen. It was very clearly a fucking setup. It was three four years ago It fucked our country in an unbelievable way people fucking died people lost their businesses Topped the bottom the greatest transfer of wealth in American history. They shut everybody shit down Hundred-year-old companies the families have built the American dream. They shut that down They left all the big companies who had the money to pay these people They left those open they were essential right they did all this shit with Ukraine They sent over all this money when our economy is totally screwed They did all this shit with Israel and and uh Fucking Palestine they're they're doing they let all these illegals in they did all of these things and nobody's answered for anything Okay, it's very hard for me to believe that these people are not all the same team Considering the fact that nobody's held responsible for anything And if we're being honest about this this situation with Cheeto It's very clear that they allowed this kid to become the fall guy for an attempt of assassination Because they cannot control the momentum behind Donald Trump Period, okay? Anybody with the brain knows that Anna Polina Luna said that today she said after listening to her Testimony today. I am very very very convinced that he was not acting alone Meaning that he was getting help from whom That's what we need to know and clearly this lady knows and she won't fucking answer because she's probably been threatened Her families probably been threatened and I bet she's been threatened by the same old mother fuckers that have been running in elections For 50 fucking years the same three or four families that run this entire country and that we somehow Part of the country has been brainwashing to thinking these people Care about us. They don't care about you. They don't care about anything about you If they did this country would look like fucking Dubai right now. Yeah, so your appointment that's literally pretty much all she did She just you know Escape escaped around fucking questions and didn't want to answer some stuff is a video clip of course not But here you guy got a guy scampering up the side of a building on top of a roof It's identified to you and you said you sent a team there and and You can't answer that and this gets to my one of my finer points mr Chairman if I can make it and that is we can have these kind of interview sessions five minutes You know everybody gets a kiss at the pig Five minutes and and she gets to stone walless not deliver answers So we say okay, we're gonna put together a congressional committee of blue ribbon committee same crap will happen I am calling and and I'll support that but I will tell you this I am calling on the speaker to give us and and put together a truly independent commission of qualified former secret service agencies presidential and VIP protect protective services people who can actually conduct this kind of Investigation and give us real answers because I don't think you can you're gonna give us those answers You should have come today ready to give us answers. I call upon you to resign today today Yeah, even that she makes got on it listen, bro. She should be put in jail today Okay, you come in front of the congress and you don't answer the fucking questions at all It's come to you. It's come to fucking jail until you feel like answer them And if you still don't feel like answer them then fuck you some more and start fucking water torturing the bitch until she answers who the fuck Actually set up the fucking assassination because I guarantee you she knows who did it. Oh, she knows exactly who She knows exactly here. Here is nessie mace check this one out I would have to get back to you that is a no your full of shit today. You're just being completely dishonest Mr. Chairman mr. Chairman Mr. Come on. We have to maintain decorum in this committee any no matter how That we get any no memos to this committee that we've asked you on July 15th have you provided all memorandums within the secret service? I would have to get back to you on that is a no you are being dishonest or lying I just you're being dishonest here with this committee these are important questions that the American people want answers to And you're just you're just dodging and and talking around it in generalities And we had to subpoena you to be here and you won't even answer the questions We have asked you repeatedly to answer our questions. This isn't hard. These are not hard questions um No shit. That's what she's doing like what is it about these people bro? Where they sit in here and they're like Yeah, you like that girl's gonna go around and be like I'm the one that says she's full of shit You still didn't get anything done right You see what i'm saying? We need to stop allowing these people to plant their fucking flags on a couple harsh words and no results Okay, when are we gonna see accountability for fucking coven? when We're gonna see accountability for a fucking stolen election 81 million mother fucking votes the most popular president of all time Can't make it through a fucking full term. You know why you can't make it through Because everything he touches is gone to shit and even the people who voted for him knowing All right, so when are we gonna have some real accountability in this country? When are we gonna start calling for it? When are we gonna stop saying oh look at marjorie Taylor Gleene? She let her have it or this woman I don't know what a fucking name is oh she said she's full of shit. She's really giving it to her Bullshit These people are the ones that are full of shit that lady should be in fucking jail right now Not only president i think out of that cuz i'm gonna treat us like third world country and do a fucking assassination attempt on our fucking president Then fuck you will treat you like third world will waterboard your ass until you tell us what the fuck is going on? You know You know, I watched I watched quite a bit of like uh of the hearing man and i could promise you do that I mean this dude if i was running shit none of this shit would happen It would never happen no it would never happen bro No, there's no accountability with any of the shit, you know now I will say this like I will like I said I watched the hearing Um I watch I was watching it for about an hour. I was putting the outline together the only person in there that I thought You know that that even you know Signal that they will be willing to do any type of accountability was Luna Who she's she's actually pushing for Persuade charges. I thought she said I believe you purge it yourself Yeah, I'm pulling the transcript. You know, I'm saying it's like you know that actually That's why I haven't been critical for her because I think she's the only one that called for anything the only person in there She also called to subpoena her cell phone her personal stuff. I don't know if you saw that part either But you know you mean how she was uh using encrypted data streaming services and data services to communicate with her colleagues inside the secret service regarding This fucking issue Why would you do that? Shouldn't happen that shouldn't happen You know only crypt shit like she got something to hide Yeah, because that's all you can't you know I'm saying that like that. It's not foilable This is the term you know I'm saying they can't pull those records like she has a government phone That's all official communication should be going through right But no you're using your personal phone on the crypt at apps like that doesn't make sense Now last little weird thing about this whole topic, you know, this is some stuff that came out That I don't really know what to make sense of I would like to see your thoughts on this But representative Sheila Jackson she just passed away. She was heavily involved In the oversight of the secret service specifically And she was just confirmed at six days after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump So is that adjust another coincidence? I don't know man. What it where it? Any thoughts on it's weird. Well, you don't think it's weird that you know right after the assassination attempt that You know all of this information comes out Uh, you know around multiple shooters meaning there's if you haven't seen the video of the audio breakdown of all three weapons uh, you know, it's you should probably go find that and track that down. It's pretty interesting video uh But then right afterwards Sheila Jackson who is basically heavily involved in the secret service she dies Okay, you got the lead the head of the secret service now refusing to answer anything Okay, then you have uh Crowdstrike dropped the largest cyber outage in the history of earth Uh, where apparently a bunch of government servers got wiped And it all happened days after he was assassinated. You don't think that's a coincidence You know, then we have the stocks being shorted then we have the stocks being shorted that dude listen They tried to kill this dude and he didn't die and now they're panicking. They're panicking had That attempt been successful. They wouldn't have had Joe Biden come out of the race They would have kept him in because he's the perfect fall guy for the destruction that they're trying to create He's the perfect guy Bro, look how stupid look how seen how this guy is so he falls up stuff. Yeah, like dude That's all people think they don't understand there is an entire team behind this dude Making the decisions and their decisions are based along the lines of true fasted fascism and communism Okay, so like dude we we we have an occupied United States who has taken money from foreign interests to make decisions That are outside the interests of Americans and inside the interest of foreign countries That is fucking treason and we have an entire team of people Up there in Washington who all fall into that fucking category all of them. Yeah, okay, so like dude We have a scenario here where they counting on one thing happening It got fucked up and now they're panicking and I bet that some really incredible Unbelievable shits about to happen and they're not gonna do shit about it Because we're not gonna do shit about it Um, that's real man guys jumping on this conversation Let us know down in the comments what you guys think about all of this bro I think for real dude. I think they're gonna bring it I think there's gonna be a major terrorist attack that they had I think instead of trying to shoot this guy They're gonna blame a major terrorist attack on Iran and then they're gonna get their fucking war They're gonna get rid of Trump and they think they're gonna turn all of Maga crowd quote-unquote on to let's go get Iran Because they killed our guy like that's what they think is gonna happen and I I will bet that there's gonna be an attempt that way It'd be fun between now and then it wouldn't surprise no listen dude I got listen and what I said about Obama and all this shit that I believe that's gonna happen And if it's not Michelle Obama, it will be somebody else who they can hype up for the 30 to 60 days Between that and the election to ride that in and give them as much power as they can to fudge to fudge the election again Yeah, you know Yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think man with that being said Let's get to our third and final headline headline number three you alluded to it a little bit Um, and there is some interesting shit with this. So let's talk about this headline number three reads crowd strike outages highlight inequalities between big businesses and mom and pop shop so This is a New York post article reading an owner of a consumer insights research firm couldn't pay our employees McFaraday's deadline to sign a contract for a new business or send key research to a key client A psychiatrist who runs a virtual mental health practice in Maryland So on his business hobbled as some of his virtual assistants and therapists couldn't either make phone calls or log on to their computers And a restaurant owner in New York City was worried about how he was going to pay his vendors and his workers There was Apparently there's a woman who had her As cancer as brain cancer was supposed to have brain surgery and she couldn't have a surgery because of this um Everybody knows about it. There was this massive outage. So see a crowd strike CEO George Kurtz Said the outage was the result of a flubbed software update And that a fix has been deployed separately Microsoft blamed the outage on a Quote third party software provider and said it was being addressed Quote crowd strike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for windows host Kurtz said in a lengthy ex post Mac and Linux host are not in practice. So this this massive outage we're talking about I mean, I looked I remember pulling up the the tracking data for planes And it was the most empty. I think I've seen you know since like 2001 right when that happened and They had a lot of days from no flights right days. It was pretty. I mean, it was eerily similarly. I mean, you know I'm a Mac guy most most of us use Mac. I think everybody here in the office uses Mac for the most part But it was a massive thing And it's still messed up You know, there's still a lot of planes that are delayed or canceled with flights You know that have been stranded. It is interesting But there's always just this weird airman. It's like there's these crumbs And he's like just our follow in these crumbs is weird shit about it Like this guy This guy came in his name is Sean Henry And he's the chief security officer at crowd strike But before he joined crowd strike he was in the FBI And worked he wasn't just in the FBI He go ahead no, no, no, no, no, you go ahead. He wasn't just in the FBI. He was a fucking huge part of the FBI a massive part Yeah of the FBI And Is the It just doesn't it makes too much sense to not make sense You know and it's also interesting because at the same exact time And by the way mr. Henry oversees all security aspects of crowd strike Including the company's information security business continuity and resiliency risk reduction programs Um like he's he's playing a massive part in crowd strike Um, and it's weird because you know our good friends at the world economic form They are also Somehow tied into this Because they predicted this just like they predicted COVID and just like they predicted berth And just like they predicted a bunch of other stuff Where they predicted a catastrophic catastrophic event just like this Where they said that uh cyber security failures Uh, it was a top global threat Um, and uh, that was back in 2021. Guess who was a part of that meeting Sean Henry mr. Sean Henry Right Like he was one of the board members that were there that talked about all of this stuff And so you have the world's biggest supplier when it comes um to operating services security industry You got crowd strike right and uh everybody relies on them a lot of companies rely on them Um, and everybody's getting fucked right now and it what What do you got on this? I mean it This ain't no coincidence. No, not only that. I think it serves two purposes one I think they I think we're gonna find out that that outage somehow Removed information that helps them connect the dots based upon the attempted assassination Okay, I think that's the first thing that's gonna happen. We're gonna we're gonna find out. Oh You know that that's cyber outage, you know, we would know but You know there's no evidence Uh, and then I think the second thing was is they were running a test to see what exactly would happen If they decide you know it gets between now and uh, November Something happens where they get even more out of control Which I think that they're going to because they don't know how to Work off contingencies these people make plans their plans almost always work And then when they're this is the first time I can think in the last number of years where something big Didn't go their way speaking of the Trump assassination attempt. So From my perspective, I think it's very obvious that this was a way for them to Get rid of evidence now obviously. I'm speculating there. I don't know, but this is what I've been hearing Um, and then secondly to run a test and if shit gets too hot bro, they could shut it down And there's nothing anybody can do and when we wake up when the power comes back on uh Trump was killed by a run with a drone strike. They took advantage of the cyber outage and they blew up moral auto or some crazy shit. Yeah Yeah, I mean uh, I I can say what this was 100% of test broke it was 100% it happened right after the fucking assassination attempt dude 100% of test right and like you know, it's very rare like I said, I mean crowd strike I mean, they're one of the biggest uh biggest players in this game There's checks and balances. There's no way you accidentally or you know, erroneously Push out this update that literally shuts down shit globally that does not that does not happen Right now I would have believed if it wasn't like if they you know pushed it off to be a cyber attack I would have rather believe that but you're telling me this was an intentional update that you guys Developed and pushed out they fucked up all of this stuff Doesn't make sense it makes 0 0 0 0. No, it does make sense. It does make sense We listen it makes sense How would you get rid of the evidence of what you just tried to do How would you do that? Yeah, you know you got to pull on you know you have to have to otherwise people are good and get They're getting executed So what do you do you can't walk in there and say hey give me that fucking hard drive because it's probably stored on a bunch of different hard drives So what do you do? Oh? You call your homie who used to be a part of the crew and you say dude You got to do this or we're all fucked and what happens See it makes perfect sense if you think about it right all of this shit makes sense We have a group of evil people who are doing everything they can to avoid accountability maintain power control maintain authority over our citizenship And they are willing to do anything that they have to do to maintain that power control including assassinating someone including terrorism including wars including pandemics including all kinds of global crisis that make this country suffer Because they want to stay in power and they want to continue to rape and pillage this country citizenship economically and make our lives miserable remember we serve them They don't serve us in their minds. They are above us They they are the royalty and we are the peasantry and that's how these people think you can see it on that dude's fucking face Okay, what does his face say his face says I'm bad ass FBI agent you can't fuck with me That's how these people think okay and until We the people start to understand that we are all in the same team And we stop blaming each other for all this shit and we stop saying I'm Democrat I'm Republican fuck you no fuck you until we stop all that shit and we realize holy shit We're in the same boat and these motherfuckers are drilling holes in the boat What do you do if you're in the same boat with someone who's drilling holes in the bottom of it You throw them the fuck overboard Which is what all of the people of the world should do all of the people of the world should unite Against these tyrannical elite fucks and make a change in order so that we could all live peaceful lives Because the last four years we've all had our peace stolen from us. We've all had our fucking lives Messed with and irritated and intentionally divided and propagated and pissed off for the sake of what So these fuckers can make some more money and maintain control Fuck all these people and that's the fucking reality all of us people out here black white left right gay straight fucking USA Mexico Europe Fucking all the countries in Europe eight, you know all the countries in Asia everybody Should say fuck this we're done with these people and every if this is mainly a western culture problem Everybody in the western culture should come together and say us Them there's more of us than there is of them and fucking run these people out of fucking town Bro, these people hate you They despise you when you step up and you say hey, what the fuck you do? They get pissed you're even asking a question and the only thing that can solve any of this is all of us Unifying against tyranny not against Republicans not against Democrats against tyranny We have to ask ourselves some very serious questions about freedom. What is freedom? What is freedom? Is freedom working your entire year and not getting to keep any of the money until August? Is that freedom because that sounds like tax slavery to me? That's not free Okay, aren't we taught our entire lives here in the United States? Uh, that we live in a free society. What does that mean? What does that actually mean because I don't think working until August Means that you're free. I don't think that uh having to answer to these elite fuckers and let them make our route I don't think that equals freedom I think we need to all be having the conversation about how what is freedom and how free are we and what do we need to do to actually create freedom So that these people quit Building and stealing off of our backs. It's ridiculous, dude And I don't understand how people can't have that conversation like this left right Democrat Republican gay straight this black white they want us to argue with each other while they fucking steal everything that we work our Fucking asses off for explain to me how that's free and until we the people And until the people of earth come together and say do we're not doing this anymore? Fuck you Okay, nothing's gonna change They're gonna continue to drive us into the dirt until there is nothing left and what gives me is how to fucking anybody support this shit Like how is there a single person on the earth that supports what the world economic forum is about or that supports this communist idea or Marxism The only way that you could support that is if you don't understand what it actually is and you think it's just some like You know, it's always the same people. It's these hipster weirdo far left people that think they're hyper intelligent and their literal dumbasses Okay, those people are not coming back onto the onto the range bro. It's not happening So we can't sit here and think about that but the rest of us have to come together and be like dude This is wrong and we need to do something about it and dude They can't do anything about it if we all were on the same team And that's gonna require us looking past someone skin color Are looking past someone's sexual orientation or looking past someone's political preferences in the past It's going to require us looking at each other and saying bro, you're not the enemy and the other guy saying yeah, you know I know you're not Let's go fucking actually handle what the real enemy is which is these people just like Thousand years ago who are quote-unquote ruling over us and Ruining our lots and it's not cool, bro It's something needs to be done And I don't know what that is but it starts with unity and until we understand that unity is required Nothing's going to happen and we have all these people who say I'm not unifying with that person Well then you're a fucking idiot and you don't understand what's going on We have to give we have to give room to people who want to join and be unified We don't get to you know like that's one thing about like the Trump movement that I can't stand You know you have people who were like original Trump supporters and they like shame everybody else They're like, oh, I've been here since the beginning.
