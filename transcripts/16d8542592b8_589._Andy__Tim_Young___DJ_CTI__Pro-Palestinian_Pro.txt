Andy for Sell it out com or you can go on YouTube in the comments of the Q & A episodes which air on Monday's and you can drop your question right there in the comment section will pick some from there as well other times we have real talk real talk is five to twenty minutes of pages giving you some real talk then we have full length full length is where you know know, we have a guest come in and we have a discussion just like pretty much every other podcast you've ever heard of or seen. And then we have 75 hard versus and 75 hard versus is where we take someone who has completed 75 hard or the live hard program and we tell their story. We talk about how they were before. We talk about what it's done for them and how they are now and why you should take getting your shit together seriously as well. So if you want to know what the 75 hard program is, it is the world's most famous mental transformation program and it is free and you can get an episode 208 on the audio feeds of the podcast. We weren't on YouTube when that episode was posted so it's not on YouTube. You can also go on my website, indificello.com and you can get the book 75 hard but it is not necessary. All the information is available for free on episode 208. So for all of that that we give you. Now one thing you're going to notice is I don't run ads on the show. I don't stop every five minutes and read a bunch of bullshit that somebody is paying me to read. I pass up on quite a bit of income to do that and I make a deal with you guys. You guys who follow the show, there's like a little deal here and the deal is if I do this show and I don't get paid to do this show, help you help me build the show. So we have this little thing it's called pay the fee and don't be a hoe. Show the show. All right. So that is what we got going on. Now today we have a very special CTI because we are joined by my good friend Tim and you guys might recognize Tim from the internet under the name Tim runs his mouth, which means that you are going to be an excellent guest. I am by the way, I don't like that you brought me into a building where I'm the least in shape person. I don't know about that. I don't know about that. I haven't seen anybody in worse shape than me in this building. Hey bro, we got people maybe DJ. Yeah, I just saw that comment. I'm like, if you saw the suit over five, yeah, dude goes DJ doesn't look like he's been doing 75 hard and the guy goes DJ rights back. Neither does your mom. Dude, hey look, here's the reality. You know, don't feel bad because here's the thing. Everybody in this building for the most part has made an actual transformation. They all came here and some of these people are in the middle of it and I know you're joking but the reality is is when it comes to fitness a lot of times people do get uncomfortable around people but the reality is they didn't get fit by just born. They had to go through the transformation and everybody here has done that. Well, I dropped one 30 at one point in my life. Yeah. And also I was 320 pounds. There you go. And went through it. And by the way, the picture of me there, the one of me earlier there, that one, I had an ulcer and I had to, they took me off of fried food, booze and coffee and I dropped 40 pounds and I looked like I had AIDS in that picture. That was the very bottom. That was the very bottom and I was like, maybe I should put a couple back on. I looked a little too thin and a little, there we go. That's me after I got Rob to gunpoint. These are good. These are all, I was Rob to gunpoint in DC. No shit. And because I was doing, is that where you became like anti woke? Is that what converted you? No, I got, I became anti woke when I watched my parents working for a living. But that was right after, it's really fun when you're a local TV person and you get Rob to gunpoint in the town. Everybody wants you to talk about getting Rob to gunpoint. It's really fun. Now, dude, now I don't know much about your background. We just know each other from the internet. We like each other shit. We fuck a talk shit back and forth. Tell me a little bit about your background. Tell the people. Grip and Baltimore. Yeah. I went to law school. I went to, I almost got a doctorate in public policy, dropped out of that program. But I've worked in policy and politics for 23 years now. Okay. The more you get involved, the more you realize how stupid those people are and how they really shouldn't be governing anything. That's really kind of the gist of it. I mean, I've done stand up forever, but when all the other stuff getting into politics paid way better money for less work, I started getting into that more. So I host, I'm a, I'm a, Phil and host for a serious exam, Patriot. I used to work for Fox five in DC until COVID hit and then they cut everybody back. They cut all the non reporters off basically is what happened there. And I've just kind of been around in media for a while. I don't know what all I do. It's just a bunch of stuff. Yeah. That's cool, man. Well, I love what you post. And I love what I love viewpoints. I always love to have people that, you know, have their strong opinions on the show. Well, I'm suspended, I'm suspended right now basically on, I sent this to you because I didn't want to get cut off from you on Instagram because we talking DMs all the time there, but they, they fried my account for a bit because I shared the picture of Hunter with the scarf and the, the underwear on. And they said that was pornography. So yeah. And pornography was the rest of the computer. Yeah. And human trafficking. But, but no, I have been like 30 days or something because I shared that. That's pornography. And I asked for a review and they conveniently haven't gotten around to a review. Dude, isn't it crazy, the double standard? Like, it is so crazy. Like you could post all day long about gender affirming care or minors being read to by pedophiles or, you know, hormones that block puberty or mutilation of genitals, you could post that shit all day. But you post a picture of a dude in a scarf looking like a goofball. They'll knock you the fuck off the internet. Hey, let's, let's go fact checks. They'll fact check my memes all day long, right? But what was it? Just yesterday they, they posted the Hamas, Hamas PR team said that Israel bombed a hospital and everybody ran with it. They didn't bother to check it. Yeah. Yeah, that was crazy. Yeah. Dude, I posted this thing last night, you know, basically saying like, dude, you know, you guys, notice how hard it is to know what's actually going on and understand that that's intentional. That's intentional to confuse all of us and demoralize all of us and get us into not caring about anything. I mean, I was, we were, DJ and I were talking about this yesterday, like it is on this particular situation out of all the, the, the things, right? The new things that have happened over the last four years, you know, starting with COVID and beyond. It's been, this has been the hardest to know what's true and not true. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think the next intentional too. Yeah. Like that's the whole point. Like fog of war used to be just this like, you know, thing that only happens in military operations until you realize, I mean, we're in operation. Yeah. There is definitely a fog of war going on and that's intentional, right? Like to keep the, the real truth, they will, they will cloud it with, with conspiracies on both sides and like just massive amounts of information. I think what they've actually started to do, what we've talked about it before was like, you know, the speed of information, the flow of information is so fast. I think they're starting to kind of use that on us now with the speed of information. They know that it's so fast. So just put more, more rich stuff out there to fog it, to clog it up. Yeah. That's how I see it. I don't know. That makes a lot of sense. I mean, we're definitely, we're definitely on that stupid. No, no, no. We're definitely on the receiving end of all of their psychological manipulation at the end point. I mean, all of it, like all the guns right at our faces, full blast. And it's, it's frustrating because you can tell people are feeling it. You know, a lot of people feel demoralized, a lot of people are depressed, a lot of people are like angry. They don't want to talk to anybody. They don't want to be friendly to anybody. And I would like to remind everybody while, while we're on this topic that like, you know, in these scenarios where you're at the limit of your ability to handle other humans, is when it's necessary for you to show grace and kindness and be a cool human being in general, because this is what they want. They want you to be upset, to be angry, to look at your fellow man and say, fuck them. This isn't worth it. That's what they want. And so it's very important for everybody to realize that not to fall into the pitfall that they're trying to get us to fall into, which is complete and utter, disdain and demoralization for, you know, everybody around us. Yeah. And so, everybody's a pretty cool people by the way. When you go and talk to people in your neighborhood, they're all real chill and like, they're all, everybody kind of thinks the same too. I mean, it really is when you realize the extremes and it's probably what, like, 3% of people are the ones that are getting the most attraction and make the most noise on the internet. Everybody else kind of just agrees and wants to be left alone. Yeah. It's very easy to do. By the way, my favorite piece of propaganda so far over the past, like, a couple of months, because I mean, there's so much that like you said, it's been thrown at you, was when the dementia patient from the White House went over to Ukraine and they were walking outside and they played the air raid siren. Yeah. And they just casually kept walking like nothing was happening. Like they were like, oh, look how strong these two are out there, you know. Yeah. Yeah. You can't, you cannot make that man look the way that they want him to look. No. Like, that's, that's like saying, hey, we're going to take this color, well, this is my work in the art world. But, you know, let's take this coloring book by your two-year-old and let's, let's frame it up like it's actual art, right? Sell it for $500,000. That's what I said. I might be a bad teacher. I'm sorry. That's what I was saying. That's true. His stuff sells for more than Picasso. Yeah. And you get appointments in the Biden administration as just, just, yeah, but when you, when you, when you, yeah, but when you sell a Picasso, you know, or when you buy a Picasso, you, you don't get, you know, the ability to make the rules for the world, right? Yeah. So that's why you're paying. Mm-hmm. You know what I mean? Are you telling, are you saying that Hunter Biden sells influence in the White House? No, definitely not. No, definitely not. That would, that would, definitely not. But if one were to, you know, that's how you would do it though. If I, yeah, if I were to do it, I'd do that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think they have like a tangible item in the middle of it. At least they're doing that. You know, at least they go through that. Do you think he even paints the paintings or somebody does it for you? No, he doesn't paint those. I think he does. I think he does. I think he does. I think he does. Or just how they look. I think he does paint them himself. What do you think of them? Yeah, I think their share of the art is made better. Really? Yeah, for sure. I think they're making some that were shit and some that I was like, hmm, he didn't do that. Yeah, he didn't do that. How much did they want for that one? Yeah, right. Exactly. Just be a real man. I'm not going to hate just the paint. No, that's real. But I mean, if I buy one, do I get to make some decisions? That's what I'm worried about. Were you in an appointment? What was the one where they appointed in a state department or something? Some woman was appointed? I forget. I should know all this stuff. But like, there was definitely, they busted one person who bought a painting and got an appointment. Yeah, that's crazy. It is funny. They're throwing actual hard goods into it now. Well, you got to cover for it because obviously we're so stupid we can't see through that. Yeah. And nobody got it. He's a legitimate artist. Of course. I mean, even though... Why wouldn't he be? And then the media goes along with it, right? Yeah. So I think it was like CBS Sunday Morning or something like that. One of those shows did like the waking up. Oh, look, he's an artist now. Oh, yeah. And they play the propaganda game and you're like, come on. Yeah. Well, they want you to believe it. Yeah. They're setting the table. Yeah. So I wanted to bring something up before we get to our headlines. We got three comedians in the room. Right? Well, we definitely got two. At least two for sure. Yeah. Yeah, that's for sure. Two white dudes. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Wait. You're Sicilian. So you talk about us. Oh, you're right now. This is the land of opposites. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. So, no, but so you're comedian, right? We don't want it according to the trolls. We're who? The trolls. And New York Post probably, right? Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's post. That's what this intro topics about trolls, right? So I mean, it is. Yeah. I mean, we weren't we're used to it. I'm sure you're used to it. I love my trolls. I wish they would get better though. You just got to have a guy wish they were funnier. The necessary. You know what I like better than my trolls though? Is my followers that destroy the trolls? Like, that's the best part. God bless those people. Yeah. Dude, my followers are the best, bro. Like, they didn't even have fuck around. Like if someone comes in with some bullshit, they get fucking dealt with. Yeah. Quick. Yeah. Tim, what's your most recent like, heckle troll? Like, you're your, your, your most like your number one on your list. Number one on your list. Off of your. I mean, there's, I always like it when there's an article written about me with, Oh, there we go. Rolling stone. Hmm. Oh, that's a good one. I got an article written. It was when Nancy Mace came out and talked about how she had to pass up sex with her, her fiance, to get to the prayer breakfast. Do you guys see this? Oh, I remember that. Yeah. She shows up and she goes, he wanted to do it or whatever. And I had to, you know, get here to the prayer breakfast. So, you know, like a place where you don't want to bring up banging, right? Like, it's like a thing. And this, this reporter said, like, what was it? The headline was like conservative in cells are upset that Nancy Mace has sex. That was like the headline. I was something very similar to that. And so I tweeted at the person and I said, I want a correction. I'm upset that she was talking about, talking about fucking her fiance at the prayer breakfast. Not that she has sex. And they took that and they updated the article with it. No, that's great. Yeah. And so that was probably my favorite right now. That's great. Yeah. Yeah. So, so this comedian, I want to... My favorite troll, because I'm going to end up in the office. Oh, sorry. We were doing that. Andy, which horse? Yeah. My favorite troll is the New York Post. Yeah. Trolling me for killing people, for making them drink water. Yeah. Like, I've seen a lot of creative shit. But that was the most creative. Like, think of how absurd that is. I'm actually thankful it happened because it totally exposed all the points that we make on this show all the time about the media. Well, drinking water is terrible for you. It's racist. Yeah. It is racist. No shit. It is the most racist. Yeah. But I wanted to bring this up because I thought this was kind of interesting on topic with our guest, especially. This headline reads, comedian travels 150 miles to confront serial heckler 10 years later. So this comedian was getting trolled for 10 years straight by this guy. And finally, they decided to confront him. So let's dive into this a little bit. New York Post, actually, surprisingly. Internet hecklers beware. Keyboard warriors are apparently no longer safe hiding behind a string. Canadian comedian gave an internet troll the ultimate. What the fuck is that? Come up it's. Come up it's. Is that it? Come up it's. Come up it. The fuck does that mean? I fucking know. I'm not fucking yours. He's getting his payback. Yeah. Why don't they just say fucking payback? Because they have to use big words because they're smarter. Oh, this is the post. Yeah, this is. Oh, no shit. Yeah, this is all right. Got it. They're smarter than us. They are smarter than us. They're journalists. Listen, that's what they're doing. They're exposing our, our neanderthaleness. They're definitely exposed mine. Yeah. I'm with you. I'm not going to say your pretend. I knew what the fuck was either. Come up it's. After traveling 150 miles across the UK to confront him where he worked, a scene in an X video with over 1.7 million views, quote, revenge is a dish best served cold 10 years later. The vengeful, funny man named Bobby mayor, caption, the clip, the first reported by local media in Birmingham. So let's dive into it. Here's the video from Bobby. 10 years ago, it was on stage in Birmingham. Guys shouted out chicken wire. I got to stage and I assumed that was the end of it. But no, every time I posted my Facebook fan page for the last 10 years, he comments and he writes chicken wire. But he made a mistake. He used his real name. I found a bum link did. I know where he works now. So today I'm driving 150 miles to E.E. in Dudley to pay him a little visit. He's an assistant manager. Working there for 10 years, he should be more than assistant manager, you **** loser. What even is chicken wire? I guess it's the wire. They put on chicken cages. I'm not a chicken. Why are you shouting chicken wire at me for the last 10 years? Chicken wire, chicken wire, chicken wire. I win. You lose. Chicken wire, chicken wire, chicken wire. This is yours in the making. He's been trolling me for 10 years. And now I win 10 years. He has been trolling me. Chicken wire, chicken wire. I win. I love it. Yeah, I mean, I love it. I love that the guy who's guilty of it laughed. And they're both laughing. Yeah. I thought it was going to be crazy. I thought he was going to like show a house and like be a real sad situation. Yeah, I love that. No, I love that too. It shows the good nature of people. It's good stuff. Dude, people just need to like, I think we, bro, people get too personal. Like I think it's uncomfortable. Yeah, no, it's not just too comfortable. It's like, cool, man. You want to talk some shit? Like, keep it cool. What does chicken wire mean? Yeah, I don't. I don't clearly like, I mean, I wonder. He knows. Yeah. Is that the end of the video? Yeah. So we still don't know. Yeah, we all know what is chicken. You know what I would do? The very first thing I would do after that comedian left, go to his Facebook page and type chicken wire. V2. Yeah. I feel like you can make a company, right, where people would pay you to go do this to your trolls. It'd be like a, at least a eight-figure company for sure. Bro, I had this dude on the internet recently. He said, I love your video. You need a quick-skip and leg day. Did you see that fucking guy? Yeah. Like, I fucking, I was going to like take the photo and put the caption that he wrote on his photo and put on my Instagram until I looked at this photo and then I was like, I can't even do it. Like it made me feel so bad. I couldn't even do it. Like, all right. Cool. Yeah. I'm going to hit the legs. Yeah. You know, two-hour trolls. Yeah. Cheers. Yeah. He's up. Guys, let's get into the show though. So remember, if you want to see any of these pictures articles, you're quite the internet troll yourself. Oh, yeah. I fucking like that. You're probably the hardest core internet troll I know of. But is it, but I don't go first, right? Like, well, I do sometimes. Yeah, you do, bro. Yeah, you do. It's true. Yeah. DJ has an inability to look the other way. Like, if you say some fucked up shit, bro, like we've been working together for years and every time I'm like, bro, just not. I'm like, hey, it's so big. I look back an hour later. Boom. He's got him, bro. I'm like, fuck. Don't fuck with DJ, man. Hey. I'm just telling you. One of my favorite, by the way, because I used to troll people a lot more when I had more time on my hands. Obviously, you do. But my favorite block of all time was Jim Comet. So the fact that he was the head of the FBI, you can't handle any kind of, I should just type delete your account after every one of his posts. No, yeah. And it was like once in a while, you know, I wouldn't think it was a big deal. But it was like picking up steam and picking up steam and he finally blocked me one day. And I did like a big like, I think I played like a Celine Dion song or a Shania Twain song and did a big video of him blocking me after all of it. That's great. Yeah. That's great. Are you a, are you a, are you a, do you block people? Not anymore. Really? No. I'm not people. Do you? No. I don't like, I don't do any comments anymore. So I don't know. I'm just like, I don't know. Anyway, I just like, I like the, when they do it, because I like our fans just killing them, destroying them. Yeah, I love it. Like I see, I see these videos of me on the, on tip, top and Instagram and I go in there, you know, they'll be good comments and somebody's an asshole and then there's like 50 comments below it, like just destroying this person. I fucking love it. It's my, my favorite is on Instagram when somebody spends clearly a very long time writing a massive thing. That's when I hit the delete button. I'm just like, but don't block them. Yeah. So they got to rewrite it. Yeah. This should have copied them. But that's one of my favorite memes. Have you seen that meme where it's like the, it's like the, I don't know what they call it, but it's like the cartoon version of, and it's like the do with the blonde beard. And then I fucking have it right here, bro. This is one of my favorite fucking memes because it's so exactly the truth. All right. Yeah, this meme right here. That's them. That's all of them. That's all of them. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. What's his name again? Yes, Chad. Yes, Chad. I love it. I love it. Well, guys, let's get into the show, man. We got some good stuff out there. Remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to anyfacela.com and you can find them link there. Or if you're watching on YouTube, check down in the description below. You can find them link there as well. So with that being said, head on number one. Head on number one, reach. Watch pro-Palestinian protesters stage insurrection in United States Capitol office building. Yeah. Yeah, let's dive into this. So pro-Palestinian protesters who want a ceasefire that would benefit the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza, stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday and staged a protest inside the cannon rotunda that one observer likened to an insurrection. The cannon rotunda is part of the Cannon House office building. It is separate from the iconic Capitol building, but it is considered part of the Capitol complex. It is actually the oldest congressional office building on Capitol Hill. Here's a quick video. Now, according to Fox who news, there was thousands of demonstrators swarmed the area in and around the Cannon House office building on Wednesday, many wearing black t-shirts, reading quote, Jews say ceasefire now. Now about 300 of those protesters were arrested, including at least three who faced charges of assault on the police officer. US Capitol police told Fox News. Police also confirmed Fox News that demonstrators inside the cannon rotunda will be charged with illegally protesting inside of the House office building. Here's one of those clips of the protests being arrested. Right. So the article continues. It reads it says quote, Civil disobedience is part of how we get messages across. And we need the Congress to hear. We need the president to hear Louisa said while her hands were bound with zip tie handcuffs, quote, I feel that Biden needs to stand up and help facilitate a ceasefire so no more people die. One member of Jewish voice for peace set the demonstration was planned about three days ahead of time. He flew into DC from Kansas City to participate. Now, I got a question. We all see the J6 stuff, right? And how these people were being sentenced like this guy, Stuart Rose, 18 years, you got Thomas Webster, 10 years, right? Richard Barnett who put his feet up on Nancy Pelosi's desk. It's four and a half years. Is this the same as J6? Is it on the same level? Right. You got two extremes in their quotes. Is it the same? You got Major Telegreen. Nancy Pelosi's officially request that the US Capitol police preserve all video surveillance, right? Like that's one of the questions. How did they get in? Right? How is it not the same? And you don't see those same people that were pushing the J6 narrative commenting anything on this? Of course. Because that's the double standard that we were just talking about that permeates government, media, social media, and society. I mean, it's very clear. There's things that certain people can do. And there's things that if other people do similar things, they're kind of sure. Yeah. I mean, that's what we're living in. We're living in a very biased, one-sided country right now where if you are part of the progressive left, you can do anything you fucking want. If you are a part of conservative land in any way, shape, or form, or like me, someone who is more libertarian, who people identify as conservative, you can't do shit. And that's it. And it's also along racial lines, too. You can commit any crime you want if you're a black person. If you're a white person, you commit the same crime. You're going to fucking prison. All right? That's real shit. And people don't like to hear that, but it's truth. So, there's a lot of double standards in the legal system. And we could point to them in many different examples. But the truth of the matter is, is we've got a big problem. Yeah. I mean, look, there are assaulting police officers, just the same as the J6 people. The difference is the arrest that they have and what's going to turn out and what happens with a lot of these liberal people, they get put in jail, they get processed, they get a $25 fine and they're released immediately. That's, I believe, unless it's gone up, it's $25. They put them in the zip cuffs. And most of the time, too, when you have like, because when they have the crazy climate people go up there, was it Jane Fonda was arrested, I think, a bunch on the steps, like every week she'd show up on like Friday, and the cops show up and they go, come on, do you want to, do you want to go to jail or do you want to weave or how do you want to do this? And she goes, oh no, take me to jail and then they put her in the crappy zip cuffs, they take her in, she pays $25, she gets back out. It's, it's, it's the actress. Yeah, at that point. Yeah. And that's all this is. I mean, although when the guy got taken out the little weaning guy, I wonder who took his, his job as assistant manager at Starbucks that day, like call out. But like, I mean, the, and like, the fact, think of like, when you're printing these shirts, who are the printers that like are on? Do they have people like, is it like a union? They're on, yeah. They're on, yeah. I don't know, man. And three days these shirts were made. Yeah. If I'm being real though, like if we're, we're being real, real, I don't really think either groups should be arrested. Yeah. I don't think either groups should be arrested. Also, again, what happened on January 6th where people were in the actual capital building. So this is my big complaint about all of that on top of all of the like imprisonment and the insanity there. I worked in the capital and I know that you can't go into the capital building unless you have official business and you need to get special tags to go in there. If you're a regular person who flew in for that January 6th protest, the doors are open and they're held open by cops because they were held open by cops. You don't know. You can, you just walk in. Yeah. Like, I know that like you actually can't go up on the steps a certain amount without it being illegal. There's usually signs on the steps and I was on the other side of the capital for a couple of minutes that day. FBI called me really fun time. And I, I filmed the whole thing and it was like totally peaceful, nothing on the other side. Oh, you were there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got it. Yeah. I actually, the FBI guy who called me wanted to do lunch and I'm like, I'm not doing lunch with you. I'll answer your questions, you know, whatever. And I was like, you know, I was there for like eight minutes. He goes, yeah, we know. And I go, you know, I went and bought groceries like after those eight minutes, like down the street at the whole food. He goes, yeah, we know. I'm like, what the fuck? He's like, do you see anything? I was like, yeah, I saw a guy like stab a tire. He goes, we got that guy. And there are people doing brunch literally. So this is one side of the capital. They want the media wants you to believe that they're this, like the capital. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The other side was so fucking chill that like the cops were just strolling around. Yeah. And like nothing happened and I walked straight up to the building. There were people up on the steps jumping around or whatever. I, I know the rules. You can't go up past. I think it's like 10 steps or something like that. I didn't even touch the steps that day and walked away. But if I'm somebody from out of town who comes in for this protest, I think it's the people's house that's open to the public. Also they have the COVID restrictions and then too. The doors are open. I'm going to walk in. And then they're all getting arrested and fined and thrown away in jail and I mean, it's such a crazy double standard. But also it's a setup on these poor people who really don't know the rules for the capital. Might be their first time in DC because they're so upset about this and they have a right to protest. I'm with you. I think anybody who wants to protest there, I don't care. Like you, these people are supposed to be serving the people who serve in this building. That's how I feel. You get what you get as long as there's not violence and attacking and threats on them. You can yell as much as you want. Yeah. Yeah. But on the same thing though, right? So like, well, all of this is going around. And a more serious note, you know, the stuff that's going on across the world. You know, did you guys see that, you know, the US military intercepts two attack drones targeting Iraq air base where American troops are located? And apparently about two hours ago or so, the US Navy ship that's in the Red Sea right now intercepted a couple of missiles that came out of Yemen. So you got two of these are in hot man. Yeah. It's getting real hot. But yeah, I mean, so that's, you know, you also have, uh, where are the people that protest for America? Like where are our protest at? You know, I'm saying, well, that was the point to jump on this. No, no, for everybody else. That was the point of J6. Yeah. The point of J6 was into intimidate people. The reason it happened January 6th is that they made an example and set a precedent for the next four years or potentially, hopefully for them, for them the next eight years that scared everybody like you and me and us into not protesting or not going out and do these things. So that's what the purpose of January 6 was. It was an intimidation. Hey, look what happens if you come and do these things. That's what this is about. Yes. That's what that's about. Yeah. The next thing, the next time things pop off and like a town like Minneapolis or whatever the way it did after George Floyd, I really think I'm going to switch to liberal. You know, I click bourbon and nobody ever goes after the fancy bourbon when there's looting liquor stores. Yeah. I think that's going to be my section when the next thing comes up. Yeah, everybody else to get the Hennessy and I'm going to go right for the expensive bourbon. Because you've got to smash a second case to get to the Hennessy. That's systemic racism. The sex to work. Yeah, yeah. That's a sex to work. I'm just going to walk up. They leave $200 bottles of bourbon just sitting on the shelf. Yeah. And just I'll just get, I'll bring like some nice bum wrap and no one will say shit. No, no one said no. That's real. And then on top of this, did you guys also see the State Department just urged a worldwide caution for all you? Travels. Yeah, this is a big deal. And Biden's supposed to address the country about this today. Yeah. Yeah. At some point this afternoon, I think APM Central is what the schedule time is. I think we're very, I think we're within days of what I've been telling everybody for the last three years was going to happen actually happening, which is the kickoff of a major conflict that will eventually be the reason as to why elections are disrupted or suspended in some way, shape or form. That would justify. I don't think that they can stop the momentum behind Trump at this point because everything they're trying to do is making him more loved because as the exposure of their bullshit comes to the surface, and I think we're at very high levels of noticing the bullshit right now. He gets more powerful. Like we're having situations now where these San Francisco tech billionaires are coming out on TV and in public and saying, yeah, man, I totally fell for the Trump derangement syndrome. I fell for it. And now like, you know, I can see the effects and, you know, they're being very delicate about it. They're saying, well, you know, his policies, they did a great job because our, you know, what's happening is they're losing a fuck ton of money and they're like, holy shit. This is actually going to cost us our shit and they're freaking out. And so now they're even those guys who like three years ago, bro, were like, execute him. You know what I mean? Like these were aggressive anti anyone but Trumpers who are now saying, well, you know, maybe I was wrong because their bank accounts have gone down by 50%. And they don't like it. So, you know, we're in a weird situation where the more disruption that happens right now, the more support he gets. So if they're, if their asses are on the line, so to speak, which I believe they are with Trump, I believe Trump will come in and hold these people accountable at the highest level. I don't think there's going to be any forgiveness at this point in time. Now I could be wrong, but that's what I think. Like I said many of times, what are they not willing to do to keep their lives? What would you? Okay. Let's say you guys were them and you knew that if I got in power, I was going to fucking throw your asses in jail forever or execute you. What would you be willing to do to prevent that from happening? Yeah. What would you be willing to do to keep me out of office? Anything. Including burning the fucking world down. Yeah. And that's where we're at. And so like I've been predicting and if you guys listen to show on a regular basis, I said this a number of times, I mean probably way too many times over the last many years, I said they were either going to try to run the same pandemic play, which they tried. If you remember a month ago, a month and a half ago, they tried it and it didn't work. Okay. So I was correct on both fronts. They actually tried to go with the pandemic first and now they're going with the world war. Nobody bought it. Yeah. And so, you know, we're in for some shit and this is why I've told you guys to speak up three and a half years ago. This is why I told you to not go with the mask. This is why I told you to resist and stand up and say no. And how have we done that and people still don't understand this because there's a lot of people waking up now who are not connecting the dots through the journey. They don't when I say, hey, you shouldn't have wore the mask, they can't connect the dots that the mask is actually the thing that's led to all of these things, right? And it's frustrating. I'm happy people are waking up, but you guys who are waking up and noticing that shit's happening. We're going to have to have a much more open mind to understand how much wrong, how much you were actually wrong about because this started with the manipulation of COVID and has them been parlayed into black lives matter and then been parlayed into the vaccine and then been parlayed into Ukraine and now been parlayed into the Middle Eastern conflict, which is going to lead to a world war. I mean, it's just gunna. So these, you know, I try to tell you, you know, I'm not even upset about it because I'm just like, well, fuck, I did everything I could do. What else could I have done? You guys didn't listen to him. So what was it taken COVID? Oh, my take on COVID. I traveled the country as soon as COVID hit. I mean, I was like the ultimate anti-COVID person. And I realized that you could get a flight from it all started. So I actually did 35 states and 80 cities during COVID. I reported on the effective COVID on small business for the Washington Times. I think I was working for at the time. But I started traveling. I realized flights were $19 to go basically anywhere you wanted to go. But I have a free open plane for yourself when it all started. And so I literally did plane strains and automobiles all over the country and gain 25 solid pounds that I earned at the best point of the year of my life. Like I mean, I took the coastal train from LA to Vancouver for $89. And like, I was the only person on the train other than convicts and a couple of like homeless people that they gave tickets to to get out of California and move them up north. But I literally was like the one person and I couldn't believe it because, you know, I sat down one day and like the logic hit me and like, you're ahead of the game, Andy. And all you guys are really ahead of the game mentally. But I sat down and I go, they say we should stay here. But are they doing anything about it? No. So I can just go and I just went and nobody ever said anything to me about anything. Yeah. And I enjoyed my, I probably had the best 2020 of almost anybody. I mean, I'm sure you had a great one too. But like I had the best 2020 out of anyone that I knew. Just traveled did the whole country saw everything. I went to Mount Rushmore, pulled up because the national parks were closed, right? And the cops were still there. Police were like, oh, you can just pull up in our spaces by Mount Rushmore. So I'm out there at Mount Rushmore with like three other people, like just walking up just seeing and like I'm out in national parks by myself. I'm out like just in, I enjoy life. It was, it was eerie. It was that time. I loved it. I liked it too. It was almost like if you're from the Midwest, when you have like a snow storm and you go outside during the snow storm and there's nobody, it was like that all the time. Yeah. Yeah, let's get to half inch of snow. Yeah. Yeah, it happens here too. One of my most, one of my favorite times to do the outdoor workouts is during that time at night when it's snowing and there's nobody out. It's like the most quiet, peaceful thing ever. But for me, 2020 was like, I didn't have any fun, bro. Like, like, you know, I try to explain to you guys over and over and over again on the show, but like I was, I was at the height of my business career where I had worked 20 years to get to. And like in my mind, I'm like, all right, well, fuck, I can at least start enjoying my life. And then that shit started, right? And that's what I, that's, I feel obligated to do this show. I don't do this show because I enjoy it. And it's been frustrating for me the last few years, but it's weird because now everybody's freaking out. And I'm like, calm. Like, I'm like, well, I tried to tell you, man, like I was beating that drum as loud as I could fucking beat it. And you guys thought I was crazy. Now here we are. You know, so like, I've expected this to happen. Like, so I'm not surprised. And I'm actually more calm now on the brink of World War than I've been the whole entire time because I've been urgent about trying to warn people. And now it's just like, okay, well, it's clear to me that these people are going to do what they're going to do. And we're going to have to fucking figure it out. I feel safer here than a year ago I did a stand up show in London. And I went over and my opening joke was I've never performed in a Muslim country before. If I violate the sharia, let me know. And the crowd, it was like, so I'd been there and I'd watched a bunch of British comics go before me. And the crowd had this like release of laughter that was like, I've never felt it before. And I couldn't quite figure out why. Later on, I looked at it and I technically violated their free speech rules because I insulted a religion. And like it could have caused some sort of like, right, it could have caused violence or something. They have very, very bizarre, generally written speech laws over there that they can lock you up for if you offend the wrong people. Yeah. But that country's been invaded. 100% has. All of Europe has. Yeah. But the most popular boys name in England right now is Muhammad. Of course. Well, there was a restaurant and I brought this up. I said I was staying in like a little Pakistan or something where they had me like, where the hotel was. It was a really nice marry out. I forget what part of town it was. But they had a restaurant. It was a bunch of like Islamic restaurants. One of them was named Iran. And I'm like, who's going to a restaurant called Iran anywhere in the world? Yeah, you get your fucking hand cut off or even a fucking extra roll. But I'm like, who in the hell? These are literally enemies of the West that you named a restaurant after after in one of the, you know, probably most, I don't know, like one of the benchmark towns for Western civilization. Yeah. The fact that they can do that is insane. But like, it's crazy. And it didn't matter. Thank God. My jokes weren't that great. But it didn't matter what I said past that first opening line about performing in a Muslim country because these people were just looking for any kind of freedom. Yeah. Because they feel so locked up. Luckily, we can still say what we want to an extent in this country. I mean, they'll try to still come after you. Yeah. But luckily, we still have that freedom. They don't have that over there. They can't even fight back when there were. You're touching on an important point that I think everybody should understand is that if we don't exercise our freedom of speech right now, we will eventually be backed into the corner that they've been backed into. And so, you know, this goes into the concept that I talk about a lot here, which is that freedom is something that you must actually live for it to exist. And a lot of people across the globe have made the mistake of thinking that freedom comes from their leaders when it actually comes from your ability to live a free and autonomous life. And this is what we think about when we think of free speech. If we don't exercise free speech now, and we keep withholding our opinions and our viewpoints because we're afraid, eventually, they will just make those laws happen. Because so many people are afraid to speak against them. And then we are literally losing free speech. Well, it's we're lucky to have it right now. So, oh, yeah. No, we very much so hard. But this is a key time for people to legitimately speak up, man. Like, it's a very important time. What's crazy, too, is so both the right and the left try to limit free speech. It's both sides. Yes. The right is more free speech, technically, than the left right now, but because the left is louder about it. But there's two different angles. And I brought this up. Actually, oddly, I spoke at Yale a couple of weeks ago, the political union brought me in, which was a blast because the trans kids hate me, by the way. It turns out it's really great when you... Well, they hate everybody. They do. Yeah. They really... They just love your stuff. They fucking hate everybody, dude. They hate themselves. That's why they think that... Listen, bro, those people hate themselves. So they assume that everybody else hates them, which is why they fucking act the way they do. The truth of the matter is... This makes people hate... Transvestite culture. That's correct. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. This vestite culture has existed for thousands of years. Okay? It's been an accepted norm of society that a small percentage of people will cross-dress or live their life as the opposite sex. That's a... You could go back to fucking ancient history and that existed. It's only become a problem when the communists have decided to make that the weapon that they have now used to infiltrate our culture to get us to argue, right? So we have all these people who are trans who like fucking ten years ago, I'm like, cool, man. Definitely a dude. Yeah, I love care. Yeah. But now it's like... It's become this thing where if you don't accept it and you don't like embrace it and you don't celebrate it and you don't let your kids be indoctrinated by it, it's... You're a bigot and you're a piece of shit. And bro, this is actually great that they've been doing this because people are sick of it. And then you have to have sex with a trans black person if you're a white person or you're a bigot. Yeah, or you're racist. And if you didn't do it today, if you did it yesterday and you did it today, well, then you became racist. And then you have to go through the checklist of what you have to do while you're having sex. Correct. I'm in order to get past them. Yeah. Got to take it to balls. That's right. The right way. DJI don't want that. You got to jump in on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think. I'm going to tell you what. I'm going to tell you what. I'm going to tell you what. I'm going to tell you what. I'm going to tell you what. I'm going to tell you what. Down in the comments, hashtag speak now or let us know what you got. That's a good hashtag. You like that? Yeah. Yeah. So let's keep this show moving, man. I think that's a real accurate hashtag right now. Speaking out or I think I think you guys should come to the realization that if you do not speak now, you will lose the ability to stand up for yourself in a very real way. And that you can no longer allow, you know, people like myself or people with big platforms or Tim or fucking these people you follow on the internet to do your speaking for you. You have to join in. Yeah. You have to join in. Absolutely, man. So guys, let's keep this cruise moving. But before we get to our second headline, it's time as always. Let's cruise some comments. I got two of them for you this morning. Oh, good. I saw a couple of interesting ones on the day and the life yesterday. I mean, most of them were awesome. By the way, I appreciate all the love on that video. That was cool as fuck. Yeah. For you, I don't know if you know, but we started this new thing where we watched the product. Oh, you did? Yeah. We started this new thing where we're DJ and I are working on this little show concept day in the life. And a lot of people were like, well, is that just one up? No, it's a series. And we have a whole bunch of shit planned. A lot of shit. Yeah. So it's going to be cool. The first few episodes are mainly focused on my life because people have never seen it. And then we're going to move into some really bad ass shit. So we're excited about it. Well, this is, I'll say this and it's not just because I'm here because I told you this privately. You're one of the very few people who I see as an actual influencer and a successful businessman who's legitimate and not grifting. Yeah. Well, I mean, that's like the, there are so many people who are like, what do you think? What do you think? And I was talking to my buddy John Burke about this. In your mind, I appreciate that, by the way, very much. I do care about this. Like this would be, that was part of the reason why I wanted to show my life because I come on here all the time. But I'm like, guys, I don't know if you know this, but I don't have to do this shit. And so now you can clearly see, I don't have to do this shit. I do it because I love this country, man. I do it because I grew up in a country that allowed me to achieve that. You know, like I started my business with $12,000 that I got painting the fucking stripes on a parking lot with my business partner. We started with nothing. We lived in the back of our store, our first retail store in 1999. We lived in the back of it. We lived in it. Okay. Like, and that went on and off for a few years. For the first 10 years, I was in business, bro. I made $58,000 total. I made $0 the first three years. I made $695 per month the next seven years. Okay. Like, dude, I know what can be done in this country when it's when it's at least somewhat free. And if we were actually really free, meaning like we didn't have the overbearing tax burdens that we have and we actually paid a reasonable tax like 10% and it was allocated properly. Bro, every single one of you guys listening now has the capacity to build a legit and incredible life. And so like I care about that, man. Like I look at it as like I'm, I've benefited from this country. And now I see that being taken away for people that are 19, 20 years old, like I was when I started. And that really bothers me. And I feel like I'm not being a good steward or a good American of the opportunity if I don't stand up and defend it. You know, and that's where it comes from for me. Yeah, that's where it comes from for me. But anyway, we did get some assholes. Yeah, we got few assholes. Yeah, I mean everybody's got one. Yeah, that's right. Someone nice to the others just saying, leech. Yeah, but everybody got to do it. Yeah, so let's cruise these comments. I got two of them for you. Well, apparently the Budae helps a lot. For what? The Budae. Yeah, isn't that right, Joe? Yeah, see, Joe just built himself a new house. And he put a Budae in. All right. Now I've had a Budae in my house. You got a Budae? Yeah. So I had one in my old house too. The paper's not going to like this. But listen, bro, I've never used it. Like ever not once. Like I've never got on the Budae. Ever. Like I felt a little weird, man. Like I felt like I might like it a little bit too much. You know what I'm saying? I think we went to a have one. I was afraid to use it too. Yeah. So I come in here the other day. And Joe is explaining to one of the guys. He's like, yeah, man, it's fucking amazing. And so apparently like I'm missing out. Yeah, see, I'm always afraid of him. Cause like I don't know what's like bro, I feel like toilet water is cold, right? Like that's a cold water hookup. How is it, Joe? Give Joe the mic. I don't want cold water. I don't want cold water on my butt. Is it good? So it is. They do have a cold water hookup. So but you pay a little extra you get the one that hooks up with the electric and have some hot water spray down there. You know what I mean? Well, I don't want hot water. I just need like warm. It's warm, bro. It's warm, bro. It's consistent temperature with the butthole. That's what I'm saying. Sorry, I'm saying Joe. That's facts. Okay. So like for real, real talk like no bullshit. No bullshit. No bullshit. Is it good? It's like almost two years to convince me to like go in there and just use it one time. I'm like, all right. Oh fuck around go use it. I'm like, man, it's just life changing. You smoke cigarette afterwards? Yeah. Two of them. I might have to give it a try. We might have to we might have to film this. We might have to make that we might have to make this a short. Yeah. Just blur it. Yeah. Kimberly Clark right now really upset with this conversation about the days being great. Why is that? It's a paper company. Oh really? They're the ones that do all of the hand the paper towels and the toilet paper and stuff like that. All the corporates. That's my other thing. Like don't you got a dry like you just drip dry like how does that work? Yeah, how does it work? Oh yeah. I mean, you feel like if you use toilet paper, you're going to get like pieces in there. I think the best possible one could be like like what I what I think they should know. Yes, like a bidet car wash almost like like you get in there. It's worth some water. Then it's like foams it up. Right. Then it shoots some foam on there. Back you in the on lights. Yeah, right. Like we got it. We got it during the last time. They waxed the tires. Oh, you did. Yeah, that's when we got it. Hey, do you ever drink out of it? No, bro. I'm good. You think about it. Everybody's fight for toilet paper. I'm like, what do you, bro? I got a free car wash. That's crazy. Dude, dude, if they made one that had like water, then like foam, then like water. Then like dry. I mean, I might get into that. So not to get too personal here, guys. But when I take my morning shit, I take a shower afterwards. Oh, it's just how it's a thing. It's kind of like a buddy. Shit shower. It's the same thing. Yeah, that's the routine. Shit shower shave. For us pours that can't afford it. On the shower. On the shower. I got this cruise comments, man. I got some go with for you. So this, this first comment. Yeah. This first comment is from Steve 6603. He says, my aunt has candy corn from two years ago. They've been on her coffee table since 2019. I bet they're still good, bro. Candy corn doesn't have any expiration, man. The profile picture. Yeah. That's you. That's a common thing, man. I know those aunts. I have them. Yeah. You guys got those aunts? Were all those shit expired in the house? Not so much anymore. But when I was growing up, my grandma had stuff like that. Right? Like there was shit that you would go over there. And you saw it. And you would go over there on Easter. You know, it was there. You go over there on Thanksgiving. It's still there. Like, no. Yeah. You know what else? My grandma always had, which never made sense to me, was those bowls of fake grapes. You know what I'm talking about? Yes. Bro, yeah. Go ahead. I'm trying to eat one. Yes. It's like this. Dude, I used to like, when I was a kid, bro, I was like kind of weird. And like I would chew on weird shit. Like, like, I used to chew on Legos, all right? Like it's a fucking weird thing. Like, you know, what it is. And fake grapes. Yeah, fake grapes, man. Oh, fuck, man. Yeah, I used to get yelled at because then we were going to choke on that. That's probably why teeth were so fucked up. I had to get fake teeth because I chewed on all kinds of weird shit. It was like a depression thing that people were like, we can't afford real fruits. So we're going to have fake fruit down on the table. I don't know. I mean, I think it just, I don't know. I don't know. I don't see it anymore though. Do you see it anymore? I never see it. It's like fake lemons and shit now. Really? Like, fake lemons is the thing. Hmm. The 90s and early 2000s, they made all those candles that were like fake pies and fake fruit that you would win my mom with their face. I remember that. Between that and Thomas, Concaid Painter of Light, everybody had those things. And Bini babies. Oh yeah. Bini babies. Thomas Concaid. I forgot about that. That was all of you. I'm 43. Oh yeah. All right. So we're in the same era. Yeah. Yeah. All right. DJ has no idea. Nope. Sure don't. Thomas Concaid Painter of Light. Everyone collected his stuff obsessively. Yeah. It was like, that was like, there were like, you're going to be a millionaire if you get one of these lithographs. Nope. Nope. Yeah. You got to go well. Goes the garage sale. So the second comment. This is from the day and the life episode actually. This comment is from G code TX. They say. For a man that would rather be left alone, we appreciate you showing us how good life can be. All right, man. You know. I had a good conversation with some good friends, man. They convinced me that I was holding back and it was hurting people. And so I fucking decided to go ahead and do it. That's pretty much it. Yeah. You know, I was talking to Alex Ramose and Layla Ramose and Layla was telling me how she used to watch my content back in the day. And it would make her feel not good about herself because she felt like all I did was high intensity, work, work, work, blah, blah, blah. And because she couldn't do that, you know, she assumed that's what I did all day long 24 hours a day. And I never really thought about it like that. I never thought like damn dude, people are only picking up this one little snapshot of me, not understanding that like there's a reason that I do this. And so it made me feel obligated to do it. And you know, the cool thing is it was uncomfortable to start doing because I was just like, you know, I don't like having my life out there bro. That's not that's not really my style, but the reception that you guys gave on it has been awesome. And so it's been cool. So I'm excited to I'm excited to push this show down down the line a little bit further. Thank you guys are going to fucking really love what we have coming. Yeah, especially after the reaction from the first one. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So as always guys, we appreciate you. Thank you for liking, commenting, sharing. But make sure you guys are subscribed also so keep being real ass fans. Let's keep this show moving. We got a headline number two. Title number two reads. Sydney Powell pleads guilty and Georgia election case. Donald Trump's cracking lawyer and plea deltox. So will she turn? Daily Mail article guys reading. Sydney Powell, one of Donald Trump's former lawyers has suddenly pleaded guilty to conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 US presidential election. The so called cracking lawyer who 68. Amid it, six criminal counts and avoided jail as she was sentenced to six years probation during a surprise appearance at the Fulton County Court in Georgia on Thursday. Eventually devastating blow to Trump, she agreed to testify truthfully against her co-defendants, including the former president at future trials. The shock moves sparked speculation that she had flipped and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors turning on her little boss. Powell pleaded guilty to six charges of conspiracy to commit intentional interference with the performance of electoral duties. Her acceptance of a plea del is a remarkable you turn for a lawyer who at strenuously push for push conspiracy theories about the election being stolen. Powell earned her crack in nickname in 2020 when she described the case she was mounting against Joe Biden's election victory as the crack in. Now in addition to probation, Fulton County Superior Court judge Scott McAfee ordered her to pay $6,000 fine. She was also ordered to write a letter of apology to the state of Georgia and its residents. Powell was accused alongside Trump and 17 others of involvement in a wide ranging scheme to keep the Republican president in power after he lost the election to Biden. Specifically, they have been accused of conspiring to overturn the results in Georgia where Biden won a narrow victory by 12,000 votes. Doing so, the defendant's violated Georgia's anti-racatiring law or Rico prosecutors alleged Trump, the front runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination has pleaded not guilty to 13 charges. Andy Tim, what do we got on this? I'm going to get called a lib tart. Ready? I have a nuance depending on this. This entire case is garbage. This whole case is total garbage. You know what else is garbage? Sydney Powell is garbage. Both of them. Both can be true. When she was out, cash in in on the crack and then the biblical crack and she always had the next thing was coming just send me more money. Just said and that was the whole thing was just send me more money. We got a comment. It's coming and we kept hearing the crack and it's coming. We got nothing. She had nothing the entire time. And that's why he separated himself from her eventually there. And also in the back, you got Jenna Ellis who has flipped a desantis now who was also part of that team. They're behind behind her arm there is another one who just used to Trump to get ahead. One of Trump's probably one of Trump's only weaknesses is that he has a propensity to surround himself with gripters. I think he's a good guy. I think he's a nice guy. I think he's too nice of a guy. And I think if somebody says, hey, that's a good guy, you should hire him. He does it. And then it ends up being a trash person. Paul Manafort was one of those trash people who was inside. Right previous and Sean Spicer who were old school swamp who he hired in the White House immediately coming out. Shit. Yeah, like like there's just so many garbage people that have been around him. She was there only to cash in. She never had anything. But this entire case is garbage and is trying to keep Trump out of the 2024 election. And Rico is insane that they charged them with. I mean, some of the things that was at Mark Meadows was charged because he asked for a phone number at some point. I mean, this whole case is insane. But Sidney Powell is not a good person. And it's it's. That is a savior own ass move. How long since? I mean, I'm not saying this is this is you've been paying lawyer fees. You don't have the money to pay them or you're now you're going to go to jail or you're going to flip. And she said, well, I'm not going to jail. That's what this is. Oh, yeah. So I also think there's more to this too. And I don't disagree with anything that you said. Here's a big problem that I have. Do you know what operation truth was? No. Do you? Pull up operation truth. Operation trust. Trust. That's it. Here's what happened. The Bolshevik set up an operation to make people believe that the good guys were in control. And what this did was this quelled the revolution, the potential revolution of people who were anti Bolshevik and helped them identify who was anti Bolshevik. And then when they actually got in power, I guess what happened to these people? They were killed. All right. And what does that sound like to you? That sounds a lot like this thing called QAnon. All right. Who, Sydney Powell and Lin Wood and fucking a whole bunch of other people pushed out into the public as a real thing. Okay. Now, what was the effect of the QAnon narrative? The effect was people were pissed and they said, don't worry. The white hats are in control. It's a movie. The Trump is still president. It's a movie. He's in charge. The military is in charge. Blah blah blah. And what this created was an opportunity to quell the resistance and identify the people who were on the side of the resistance. Now, all of you who are out there that believed in this shit bet that you were on a list of somewhere and some way, shape, or form, eventually, you will be dealt with that these people continue to maintain power. And you have been fooled and you have been lied to and you have been misinformed intentionally so that you would not revolt against this shit over the course of time. And these people that they're talking about were part of pushing this sort of phenomenon into the culture. All right. And that is real shit. What was Mike Flynn just came out like two days ago and wrote this long post about how QAnon's fake and you guys quit believing this shit. Well, bro, you were one of those guys who was pushing that shit out. Okay. So what the fuck team are you on? All right. And you guys who are sitting here thinking, oh, well, Trump's in control and everything is going to work out. Know the fuck he isn't and know the fuck it isn't unless you stand up and speak up right now. Okay. So all of you thinking this is a movie or this is, you know, theater or this is an operation to show you the truth. No. This is actually happening and all of that is being fed to you so that you believe someone else will ride in and handle it and no one is coming. No one is coming. And so the damage that these people did was not just grift. The damage they did was they lied and what's happened because of their lies is that a whole bunch of people that would have stood up three, four years ago didn't and haven't. And now we're here and that's a big fucking problem. So if we talk about like real shit like who's a traitor to the people of this country, the people that push this conspiracy into reality knowingly knowing that it wasn't true are the biggest traders of them all. The biggest traders of them all. They are more of a trader than the actual people perpetrating the crimes because they knew that it was bullshit and they put it out because they were paid or somehow compensated or promised some. They were installed there and knew what actually going to happen. So that makes a lot of sense. So there's a couple things here that people need to understand. One, QAnon is bullshit. Okay. It may align with what is going on and you may say, oh, but it's all happening. Okay. Well, yeah. If the other team knows what's going to happen and then they put it out and say, this is what's going to happen. The evidence actually should be this. They've known here. Here's how you should look at Q. They've known, meaning the fucking enemy of our country has known that they were going to do this step by step by step by step all the way along the way, including the names of the people who are going to execute the plays that they ran for the last four years because how Q came about was it came about on a chat forum called for Chan where they were posting what was going to happen back in 2017, 2018. All right. So how do they know this was going to happen? And you got these people out here thinking, well, there's time machines and they know and this like no for real. That's part of the conspiracies. Okay. And that's wrong. What you're dealing with is an operation by communist and by Bolsheviks who have done this before in history. And we've talked about this on the show before this exact thing I call it operation truth by accident, but operation trust we talked about it years ago. Okay. And I tried to warn you guys years ago. The first arrest will shock you. Yeah. Right. How do they know that? Yeah. The first direct. It's fucking Trump. Right. Like bro. Listen, man. This is a communist insurgency that's been happening for years. They have planted out step by step by step by step. They are intentionally dismantling the country right in front of your fucking face. And they have convinced you that somebody is going to write in on a white horse and save the day. And nobody is coming. And so the people who perpetrated that lie. I'm not talking about the people who fell for it. I'm not talking about the pages who, you know, the regular people who. But those pages that push this shit. They are part of that operation. Understand that. So it's a big problem because now we've sunken down into this point where if we don't take action, at least with our voices and at least with standing with our fellow Americans, they are going to continue to destroy this country. So what's happening here is very real. It's happening day by day by day. And they have convinced you to stay silent just like they've convinced you to stay silent with political correctness, with cancel culture, with silent majority. They have now used this operation trust that they now call Q to keep you silent while they took everything from you. So at what point in time are we all going to wake up and say, fuck. Nobody's coming. It's us for real. I'm here to tell you that that is right now. So I don't know what else to say to that. You have Mike Flynn out here saying it that it's fake. So but you're right, but he was also one of the people who pushed it. I know. So like it's like there's so much horseshit. By the way, I have to like there's so many points that I want to make from. Yeah. And a lot of them were goofy. One of them, the time machine thing. Have you seen the thing where they're like Baron Trump was in a book in the 1800s? Yeah. That is such a goof thing that people believe. Yeah. I can't fall. Well, that book is on Amazon. If you go on Amazon and look for that book, it is fucking on there. But that doesn't mean that they didn't planted on there. Oh, yeah, no, no. Yeah, they could have. There's no different from the wildfires and Maui how the book was published like a day or two before. Oh, this is going to get hot. Right. All these fires get set everywhere. Like bro, they know what they're doing and they're doing it. This is a massive operation that comes from the world government fucking NWO communist. They've known this has been planned for years. It's just scare the fucking shit out of you. Yeah. Well, I'm on a lighter note, even though you're 100% correct, by the way. I can only hate Q99.99% because they used to put me in Q drops all the time, whoever was running it. Yeah. Like it was super weird because so in 2016, I was invited to talk at a free speech convention in Moscow. They invited like at random. I got an invitation from the Russian Federation. I'm like, what the hell? No, I'm going to pass on that. But Q used to put me in whoever was running it would put my tweets in there. And I'd have like 2000 new followers, 3000 new followers overnight. All these people like worshipping this. Yeah. And saying like Q sent me to your profile and I'm like, what the hell is this? Dude, these people, these people will not listen. Like what I just said is going to make them extremely angry. But the reality is is like bro, you guys got played. Yeah. And if you really care about this country, you got to realize that you got played. It's not your fault you got lied to. You got to be patient and believe things and we're all looking for hope. We're all looking for something to happen. But nothing's going to happen. Well, when I was hosting conservative radio calling Sidney Powell, Gryfftter and you shouldn't be trusting or like when that was happening, like live. Oh boy, you really, you would have thought I was like saying. Well, that's because she was inserting the ultimate hope for us. Yeah. So like dude, do you think there's, do you think that this is a coincidence that these people push Q getting off of their sentence? This is this is what was supposed to happen the whole time. She was supposed to fucking testify against Trump. Right. The whole time she's known this. These people are the biggest traders of them all because they've sold us all down the fucking river. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My only thing is how did Trump miss this? Very easy. Very easy. You're under a, just like Tim said, bro, you're getting told by your advisors. These people are credible. These people do this. These people do that. Ultimately, he's a nice guy that trusts people. I think that's the problem. And that's that it's such a weird thing to be like, well, I've been saying this for years about him, dude. I'm like, Trump, you need some fucking real people around you that are understanding what's going on at the street level. Like he's got the wrong fucking people advising him, dude. Yeah. Yeah, I was jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. Hashtag Operation Truth. Let us know. Drop it down there. So let's keep this cruise on the move, man. Can I interrupt you real quick? Yeah. I was at a conference once I hosted it at Trump D'Areal. And Mike Flynn was one of the speakers there. And he came out on stage. This is what lost, I mean, I didn't like him to begin with, but this is what totally lost him for me. And it's very minor, but kind of he came out to, we're not going to take it, right? His walkout music. He just walked out to the music, dude. He stood on stage and danced around for the full fucking six minutes of that song before he started talking. And he was so awkward. I don't know how people were like cheering it on. I'm like, what is wrong with you people? Number one, this guy loves himself so much and he's on top of it. When I'm there to talk and when you speak it, events, you're not coming out and having a full five minute intro and blah, you're there to talk. You're there to actually, this dude was just there to just soak it in. And I'm like, what the hell is this? But six minutes, I hate we're not going to take it now because of him. That's actually a good song. Or it's frustrating for me to really think about because like over the years, we've had trouble deciding deciphering like what it was going on here. Like, what is happening here? And what's actually happened is the communist people who have infiltrated our government and our media and who are destroying our country put this operation in play intentionally to keep us subdued to keep us quiet and it worked. And people, yeah. Now we got to dig out of this fucking hole because dude had people stood up back then, where will we be? And then ask yourself, why did they push that QAnon so hard during the time between November of 2020 and January of inauguration day of 2021? Why did they push that Q thing so hard during that time? Because that's when it was pushed to the forefront. It was right after the actual election day in 2020 up through the inauguration day of 2021, why did they do that? Because they knew there were so many people. That's correct. And they knew that people were going to want to fight in the race. They knew that they stole the election and they knew that people would revolt and kill them. So they needed to show a more peaceful option and they placed these credible people in front of you to tell you, don't worry. The cracking is coming. Don't worry. Trump's still the president. Don't worry. The police is going to arrest them. I fucking believe that the police were going to arrest those people in inauguration. Like I believe them. Yeah. You wanted to believe it. So why would they need Q if they didn't steal the election? Why would they push it out between that time? The election day of 2020 and inauguration day of 2021, that six or eight weeks or whatever the fuck that is. Why would they put, they pushed it out because that was when they thought the revolt might happen. Why would they think a revolt would happen during that time? Because they knew what the fuck they did. Yeah. And then get mainstream media all on their same accord. Yeah, bro. And then Trump wants to believe it. Trump comes out and says, well, Q, is that a bad thing? So that makes me wonder like does he know about this? No. Here's the thing about Trump. I think he's just one of those guys. He's like a, again, nice guy. The first time he's presented with anything or anything that could be something. Well, why didn't he come along at any time to him and say, because the people are still around him. Bro, no, no, no, what I'm saying is, why didn't he come out in public and say, listen, this is it, bro, they stole the election. This is the end of our country. And if you fuckers don't do something about it, because people would have done something. Or absolutely would have done something. It's fucking scary, dude. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, man. Let's keep this cruise moving though, guys. We got a third and final headline. headline number three. And number three reads, well, hold on. Before we get into this, there's a topic that should be in here that's not in here. Do you see what happened to Harvard, which piece? What the Palestinian protests, and then them getting blacklisted? Yeah, we talked about that in the last episode. No, no. Did you see what happened though, as a result of that? Did you see that they're biggest donor with drew their funds from Harvard? No, I didn't see that. Okay, their biggest donor is a group called the Wexner group. Are you familiar with the Wexner group? No. Okay, well, the Wexner group is headed up by a guy and a family named Les Wexner. Now, do you know what Les Wexner founded? He founded Victoria's Secret, all right? Now, Les Wexner, guess what? Who his fucking best buddy was? Yes. He had an island. Epstein? Yes. Okay. Oh, shit. So Wexner's best friend is Epstein, all right? Epstein's traveling to his properties. Part of these properties that he was living in, you know, apparently had ties to Les Wexner. Now, now let's break this down real quick. Let's just break this down. So billionaire, former Victoria's Secret CEO, pulls funding from Harvard, accusing the school of dismal failure to take a stand for Israel, all right? So he, he yanks his funding from Harvard, okay? In the very next day, type in Victoria's Secret into Google, the very next day, and nobody's talked about this. He's talked, not a single mother fuckers. A hot topic, Victoria's Secret Les Wexner. Throw it up there. The very next day after he put, now Harvard, for those of you that don't know, has one of the biggest endowments, if not the biggest endowment of any school in the history of academics. And how are they pushing down these progressive ideologies? They're pushing them down through the academic institutions. And I think we would all agree that when it comes to academic institutions, Harvard is the king, all right? You can say Yale's better or Cambridge or fucking, or I'm sorry, Cornell or whatever, Brown, you could fucking argue this shit. But at the end of the day, Harvard's got the biggest brand. When you say, hey, I went to fucking Harvard, it means something to people. Now we have this man who, his foundation is funding this institution, which is notorious for pushing down the most far left progressive ideologies in the woke, quote unquote, woke shit of all the academic universities. He gets pissed off because these people in his institutions are protesting on the side of Palestinians, okay, which they are reporting that they are protesting on the side of Hamas. There is a difference between Hamas and Palestinians. The different, it would be like saying the KKK in Americans, it's different, okay? So he gets pissed off, he pulls this funding the very next day, the very next day, Victoria's secret is ditching its feminist makeover, lingerie brand returning to its hypersexualized roots after scrapping catwalk angels for plus size and transgender models. Amid reports, sales have punished 5%. Now this motherfucker is a multi billionaire. He doesn't give two fucks about sales being down 5% in my opinion, okay? So what is this actually about? Well, I don't know, could it be about that this man got so upset that people were protesting against what he believed, which is clearly pro-Israel, okay? Which I'm not here to have that argument right now, I'm pro-America. I really don't give two fucks what these people do to each other. I'm also anti-slotter innocent civilians, yeah. Regardless of what country they belong to, okay? The America people in the American government, two different things. Israel government and Israeli people, two different things. Hamas, Palestinians, two different things. Russian, Russian government, two different things. So understand, I am pro-human. I am pro- you know, life when it comes to human beings not being fucked with for the agenda of elite fucks, okay? But apparently this guy gets so pissed off about what happens over there that he decides to pull his funding from Harvard and then abandon the narrative of woke, ESG, D.I., C.I., bullshit that is being pushed down by the biggest corporations in the world. And since this man who is so influential that he is literally the biggest, where else is he donating money? And where else is that money potentially being pulled from? And how does this tie together? It's a weird thing, isn't it? Isn't it a weird thing? So who is driving the culture of this woke stuff? Well clearly it's guys like this. All right? This guy takes the most famous clothing brand of all time and destroys it with fucking dudes wearing lingerie. Whoever way, okay? So why did he do that? He didn't do that because he's stupid. He built the biggest fucking company in women's lingerie. They're known for nearly being a monopoly in women's lingerie, okay? They're huge dude. So what's the reason here? Something to think about. It's something to think about. It's something, do you think that those moves are unrelated when they happen one day and then the next day? Hmm. Do we think that is it a coincidence that this man had so many ties with Jeff Reppstein? Is it a coincidence that his trigger point is what's going on with Israel? Like what are the, what is it? What are we dealing with here? You know, maybe it's something for you guys to wrap your brains around and roll around in your brains a little bit because no one's talking about this and this is clearly connected in some way, shape or form. There's no coincidence that this man who's supported Harvard and by the way, when you give money, large amounts of money to schools, you're proud of that. You walk at the events and you're like, I'm the man, okay? And this is clearly part of his identity. So he gets so mad about this. So what are the implications of this? So is he giving up on all the woke? It sounds like he is. All right, so what's the implications of that in culture? I actually think this is promising news. I see this as promising news. I see this as that we are in a situation where potentially woke culture is going to die because woke culture has now turned against the people who have created woke culture. All right, so maybe you guys should look into that and let me know what you think because I'm curious about it. Let us know down in the comments. Got hashtag connections. Yeah, let us know what you guys. I hope I pray that it's the beginning of the first one of the first six. I think it is. I think it is. I think it is. I think we're going to see more and more of it because a lot of these people are pissed off. Okay, here's the fucking truth and people get so pissed off when you say this. A lot of these companies, these big fucking huge companies are run by Zionist people. All right, you have evil people at the top of the food chain who say, oh, we're good people who aren't who are using the label of anti-semitism to protect their actions. So if I point out and say, hey, Klaus Schwab, you shouldn't be doing that or hey, George Soros, you shouldn't be doing that. I'm automatically an anti-semit and I get bashed on the internet and I get called all these names. Well, that's not actually true because if I point at a white dude who commits a crime, I'm just pointing at a criminal. If I point out a black dude who commits a crime, I'm just pointing at a black man who commits a crime. And so in this culture, we have a scenario where a lot of these guys at the very tap are pro, very, very much so pro Israel before they're pro anything else. All right. And then the people that they've now in their mind have rewarded with all this equity and all these advantages and all these social initiatives are now turning on them and they're like, well, fuck you then. And that's clearly what he thinks because that's why he did that. No more tuck friendly underwear for you. Exactly. Exactly, bro. So like now we're in a situation where this man is kind of like showing the minute, if you pay attention here, you could see the manipulation and how it's worked, right? But you know, what do I know? It's about people who use social constructs to hide behind in the name of actual good people, right? Like, we have to be able to criticize people who are doing bad things. Do we all agree? No matter they're identical. Right. So, so when we want to know who's actually in control of things, let's pay attention to who we can't say the shit about. So it's going to be interesting to what this does. And I believe this actually could end up working itself into a place where people kind of wake up to what's going on because like, dude, a lot of the minority culture, they're not, they're, they're rallying for Palestinian civilians. Yeah. You know, and then they're being portrayed in the media as pro-Hamas. Pro-terrorist. Yeah. So like, dude, what, the things sort of, things are starting to get weird. They're starting to fall apart. Yep. So. But it's, I want to go back to what we said at the very beginning of the podcast is getting to know your neighbors being kind to other people because so many people, I think, all get along and all agree on all of this stuff. And they see one of my, like, glimmers of hope in a very, very dark couple of years, oddly, again, and why I brought up Disney. The last movie I went to see, I think, from the Marvel garbage was the Dr. Strange one with the girl that was named America that traveled through borders and so it was really, like, it was so over the top when, like, people are so sick of the woke stuff. And in the middle of the movie, it came out that she had two moms, right? They, because they're just pushing this in there, shoe-horning it in. The audience, it was a pack theater in Unison. Oh, you could hear it from the, like, literally physically reacting to it. They're so sick of it. They're sick of it. The thing is, everybody accepts everybody. Like, if you want to call yourself, nobody cares. No, but when you tell me what I have to say, that's what it's over. We're tired of having a shove down our throats. And that's why it's so important in the middle of everything. Like, they keep us separated and we're not talking to our neighbors and we're not being kind to everybody else. I think we realize how good America is and how we're all on the same page. If we're not talking to other people, we don't know that everybody's on the same page and we don't feel part of that community. Same reason they closed the bars and restaurants during COVID. The seeds of revolution were sewn in taverns. That's one of my favorite bits that I do everywhere. They don't want you talking people in a bar because we're going to be like, hey, what the fuck you think of this? Fucked up in your right. Yeah. And this is, I don't want to go into like a stand up routine or whatever they do here. But my favorite part, how you know they were drunks that came up with a revolution. What was the first thing they did that Boston Tea Party? Let's dress up like Native American Indians and Throatian. That's a drunk idea. That's not a sober idea. Yeah, for sure. That sounds like a skit we do on YouTube. Let's do it. Let's do it. Well, guys, that was our third hit line. Let's close the show out. We've got a final segment of the show. As always, we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck. But I got something interesting here. I couldn't settle on just one. Okay. So I'm going to throw both the headlines up and let you guys choose which one we want to do. So this is this or that. This or that. Yeah. And then we'll dive into that article, whatever which one we choose. So the first headline option, freeze, Polish crook, pretend it to be a mannequin to get locked in mall for an all night crime spree or or mortuary worker in hot water after he ends up with dead man sex doll. What we got here pick one. They're both mannequin related. Very good. You saw that. I'm picking the second one because the first one is self explanatory. That's a pretty good move. I can read to the bottom of that right away. That's pretty smart. All right. I want to see the second one. You want to see the sex doll? Why? You think the first one's better? They're both equally fucking good. I'll say that though. I'll go second one. All right. So let's do the second one. Guys, our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads mortuary worker in hot water after he ends up with dead man sex doll. An Nebraska mortuary employee lost his job and landed himself behind bars after returning to a dead man's home for a trist with a life size sex doll. According to the Sarpie County Sheriff's office, Ryan Smith, 41, was arrested and faces charges for attempted burglary, criminal trespassing and tampering with physical evidence. He was incarcerated at Sarpie County jail, but has since posted $500 bail, his public defender Thomas Strinch, Strygens, told Fox News. Smith was one of two employees from mid-America First Call, a company with which the sheriff's office contracts to retrieve and process dead bodies to respond to a 51 year old man's natural death, their 144th street and Gilles Road in the town of Chalco on October 6th. Later that day, Smith contacted the property manager of the residence, claiming that the sheriff's office had asked him to collect a life size sex doll so it could be swabbed for a biopsy. He swobbed it. He swobbed it. Captain Tory Bolt told Fox News Digital that the department would never do such a thing, quote, unless it had something to do directly with some sort of nefarious crime where we think it's evidence like a murder or had some sort of trace evidence that would be something we would want to process. We would not take anyone's property from the scene of death like that. The property manager refused Smith's request, but upon investigating a noise coming from the now vacant apartment, the property manager found Smith inside with the dead bolt locked and the chain secured. When the manager let himself inside, Smith's clothing was disheveled. He told police, quote, the landlord called to report this suspicious activity. The court said they noticed that there were no officers with this person claiming to pick up the doll for us. So we called and said that was strange. Smith had left the location, but we knew who he was. So we caught up with him to make the arrest. Investigators who returned to the scene after the Smith's second visit noted that items were positioned differently from how they have been in photography photographs, taken earlier that day. Property including a survival kit had been moved. Douglas County Crime Lab was called to process the new crime scene and collect fingerprints according to WOWT. Investigators also intended to take DNA samples from the doll, which remained in the apartment. Here's Smith here. Of course. Guys, we got on this. Is this it? I should have picked the first. Can you be charged with burglary for something that no one wants to steal? That's a good question. Good question. Well, how are you going to fuck a sex doll? When some other dude's been fucking the sex doll? No, not this. I don't know if this was the actual one. It could have been like, brother, you know, there's some out there that are like super realistic. Yeah, and that's probably what it was. It's probably one of them like $10,000 ones, right? But that one, did you get your choice? How was? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Good one. Like dude, it probably was one of them luxury ones. You know, like, and this dude just couldn't resist it, right? Yeah, fuck. But here's the thing. Like this other dude has been shooting his shit up in there. And like, he's dead. And he's probably how we die. It was fucking heart attack from bro. It's just disgusting shit, man. It had to be beautiful to like have the idea that like, okay, all right, I'm going to get this dead guy out of here, but I want that sex doll. Like it had to be real nice. Yeah. You know, like damn dude, that's a nice sex doll. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like that would have to be the conversation, right? He's head. That's the end result of doing 75 soft. You look like that guy and you're bangin' a dead guy sex out. That's correct, actually. That's absolutely correct. Which, I'm sure prize at the end. Okay, what's the conversation in jail though, right? Like, what do you, what you in for? You gotta make something up. You gotta make something up, dude. I killed a whole family. I killed them all. I pulled their teeth out one by one. And they're gonna look it up and be like, bro, it says you fuck the sex doll. And then you gotta be like, yeah, that's what they put into paper. So it was too gruesome for anybody to hear. Exactly. You know what I'm saying? Like, you gotta make up a fucking story, bro. Here's the thing, when they're investigating this and they're like, what were you doing in there, man? And they just kind of look at them. And then they go in, where they find like, was it dripping? Oh my God. That's what I'm saying. Like, shit has, like what the fuck, nasty. It's nasty shit. It's on his shirt. Hold on, I just know what's on his shirt. What is that? That sure as fucking toothpaste, bro. I didn't say the sex of the sex doll. I don't think it matters. It doesn't matter.
