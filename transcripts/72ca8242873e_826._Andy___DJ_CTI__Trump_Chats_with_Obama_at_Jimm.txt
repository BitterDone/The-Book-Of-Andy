Let's get to our first set of headlines Headline number one So Jimmy Carter died. Yeah, I saw that right finally I'll say it finally. Yeah, I'm 100. I wouldn't want to live that out. Fuck bro. Did you see him? How would you want like bro? You look dude? This is something I don't understand about people. Yeah, it's like people make all these sacrifices to try and do like like If you ever seen that documentary on that dude that spends all that shit trying to like live longer What's been brand brand is Brandon Johnson's like that? It's like a legit 120 pills in a day. Yeah, but he also does like Like his whole day is consumed with it right there's a whole house to set up for it Yeah, and that's fine. I get you're into it and whatever you're into whatever makes you happy I'm not gonna fucking doggy out on it, but here's the thing that I think about when I see that is like pro Why would you put in all this work? I mean, it's one thing to like putting all this work and be healthy as long as you can right but then after there's a point of like Return like you get to be like 80 and shit just gets fucked up You know, maybe it's 90 and then you spend like you like you're doing all this shit so you get extra 20 years of laying in a fucking you know Being in a decrepit breaking body. Yeah, but I don't that's not for me. It's not for me. Yeah, like I don't I don't I Want to hit the sweet spot. I want to have like the good 40 years of fucking badass shit and maybe 50 Yeah, and then you know, I just go away. Yeah, you know saying Enough everybody shit by then. Yeah, I don't I don't I don't I do think I do think that we are drastically Limited in our lifespan be intentionally. Yeah by the powers that be in terms of This food and all the other shit food chemicals airborne fucking Shit they put in the air like I think I think our true lifespan is much longer than what we've been told Well, but here's another thing though. I mean with that being said, you know with all the new advancements in technology and medicine stuff That was this crazy factor saw the other day they said, you know the part the next human that will live to like 150 has already been born. Oh, yeah I mean like that you know I'm saying like do we were talking about that with with with Zoltan from five finger about how Like right now you just want to stay as healthy as you can because technology's Increasing so fast right now that as long as you're healthy now for like the next 10 years You're gonna live for a much longer time now you might need a couple of hip replacements and even placements and yeah some shit like that But I mean, it's definitely possible. Yeah, well fuck dude. I have my shoulder replaced. It's better than the other one Is it No doubt. Yeah, but so yeah Jimmy Carter died and you know that was obviously they just did a state funeral and a lot of people were there Al Gore Obama But I mean pretty much a lot of people that should always even there. I mean a lot of heads of state That's a typical thing to do for when the head of state passes away like that whether they're in office or out of office The governor of North North Dakota Governor New Canada. Yeah, yeah, I mean they were all there Biden of course was there But I think I think Biden may have thought it was his funeral because I wrote he was lost He was lost for a minute and then in typical Joe Biden is that fucking slick Willie behind him there. Yeah, that's like Willie Yeah, yeah, he's still likable dude It's hard to not like I know cuz he's so slick cuz he was just that dude. Yeah, he was that dude like I mean I mean he's definitely he's definitely a piece of shit his wife sucks Yeah, with the fuck bro. He knows that more than anybody Think what he's got to deal with he's got to look at that little fucking twerp walking around her fucking house with a little emperor outfits on Probably barking orders of shit. Oh, yes, I help her pick them out. Oh, there's no way. There's no way they have a function relationship No, it's not there's no way they there's no way. There's no fucking way. She's an intolerable human and he's got mad game You know I'm saying there's no way. It's Mrs. Steele your girl. Yeah, he's a Yeah, and then typical Joe Biden fashion fell asleep Why do they keep bringing them out Joe? Yeah, man Like at one point. All right at one point like I'm just glad we're not seeing KJP every fucking five minutes True stupid ass fucking face. That's I mean her weird suits. She got some weird stuff too But yeah, I mean, let's do went to sleep for for legitimately five minutes really? Yeah, I mean here's a quick video I will just go through it a little bit That Jesus is talking about In the time of Jesus the yolk was a piece of wood used to link two animals together and Together they would share the load So no one of them had all the work to do and all the pain to bear bro come on Using this image Jesus invites us all right dude for real. We're just gonna I'm just gonna call it how it is. Yeah, all right nobody wants to be a fucking funeral. Okay, that's okay Nobody wants to be anybody's fucking funeral. That's been they all suck Okay, sitting there for a full mass funeral is the worst fucking thing in the world It's not like they're gonna wake the fuck up It doesn't matter what the fuck we do. They're dead. They're in a fucking box. Yeah, let's have a party and get the fuck out of here You know what I'm saying like everybody's waiting to leave that's true like I take a little nappy now listen, I get it I'm for real dude, bro. I feel the sleep. I don't go to weddings or females. Yeah, unless it's like Real like if it's a tragedy or something or if it's like somebody that's really close other than that dude I don't do it. No, I get it. I felt it's been to enough. Yeah, I've had enough. I get it I get I felt asleep in church once when I was little my grandma slapped the shit out of me. Yeah, yeah Couldn't do it. You just sit further away But but yeah, man, you know, he fell asleep now while he was sleeping though. There was something interesting happening you got Trump and Obama Chattin it up and It looked like it was a little bit more than just chat. I don't know. Do you see the video? Do you want you able to see it? I mean and like it was weird, right? Let's just show the video first his video You know, but here's the thing like I mean it was weird like I don't know how they do it right because like you know Like just a couple of weeks ago or months I guess at this point, but I mean not long ago Obama was up on the stage calling Trump literally Hitler. Yeah, you know, and then like they're sitting there so close I don't know how I don't know how you I don't know how You know that like you do that like like Sidnex will person chat it up with him knowing that yeah after you win After you after you're the winner. It doesn't fucking matter You know what I'm saying like what am I gonna do waste my energy hating this person the reality is he's probably getting Trump in Office and perp prosecute all these flux. Yeah, so what the fuck does he care? He's like dude, I listen to you Trump in his book is there's a bookie wrote. It's called think big and kick ass. All right There's a chapter. There's a section in there about revenge that he like this guy is like dude If you read any of his shit if you study him at all He is huge on Revenge if people his exact quote in the book was something like you know If someone Fucks with you you fuck with them 10 times harder. So if you think that He's not going to do whatever he needs to do I I don't believe that unless he's part of their cabal. Yeah, okay Fucking Obama Knows that he's in deep shit potentially so he has an interest in being cool and laughing at this dude's jokes And be like that Trump it's all good bro. You know what I'm saying? So it's interesting. What do you what do you think they were talking about? Hmm, I don't know probably how fucking stupid Hillary is Yeah, I hate her too. God dude. I'm just glad fucking Hillary never won fucking bitch Like I guarantee you that's what the fuck they're saying and no Obama's like yeah dog Prosecuting me all you want the fuck her. Yeah, right. I can see him being like Trump's like I tell you what my line He ain't fucking around look at her face. She's not she's like I fucking slit all your throats What have you saying like you know when I send you to prison? I'll let you still share the room with Michelle No, I think he's saying I saw a mean today. It was pretty funny. It said it said hey I searched I searched the internet for Michelle's pregnancy photos and Obama saying good luck That's I mean listen. I don't know But you know they all the rest of them all look scared they do yeah, they do like like Mike Pence wife She didn't even want to say cans they look scared they do they did No, they had a you know the internet goes all these people are fucking professionals and experts There was they they tried to Decept what was being said between Trump and Obama Cryptocomstations between Obama and Trump revealed as pair plan meeting after Jimmy Carter's funeral So no, he said let's get the fuck out of here. Just like I was saying Trump said hey, let's get out here get a big Mac. Yeah, right. I got that cook's waiting. Yeah, that's right Fuck man, I love diet coke. I got I got a big Mac some diet cooks at a pack of marbles You know, Obama's a smoker. Yeah, he smokes new ports. Yeah, yeah, he's a new boy. Sure fitting I wouldn't have I fucked up by saying Marble. I don't know what I was thinking. Yeah, that's that's uh, he never smoked a new port. Oh, yeah Yeah, yeah me too. I smoked a marble too. Yeah, what's better? Well, I felt safer with the marbles I felt the inner rage to steal shit on the new board me too. Yeah, that was I Think I actually did steal some shit Yeah, I don't know but And in one art, you smoked a fucking like one of them, you know those mince they put on your pillow The TV at the fucking hotel. It's heavy like an Andes, you know It's like you just lit one of them on fire. It's heavy I'm not a menthol on those all right, so what do they say? But yeah, so in one interaction Trump leaned over towards Obama's ear and said quote This is skeptical here, right? This is a expert lip reader. This is speculation right But they're they're alleging that he possibly could have said quote I've pulled out of that It's the conditions can you imagine that Obama laughed and Trump carried on saying after and after I will At another moment of I'ma said to Trump are you going back to the foyer after the Trump responded called me at the foyer after yep The word foyer was unclear to the lip reader, but it could have been that they were arranging a later meeting in the foyer Obama also said to Trump quote can you just it should be good Then Trump responded quote I can't talk we have to find a quiet place sometimes this is a matter of importance And we need to do this outside so that we can deal with it certainly today Obama then nod and both men said right and okay So I don't know it's interesting Again, that's a expert allegedly expert lip reader But I know who wasn't happy watching that happen Come queen. Oh, she was pissed. What she oh bro. She was So this is the same this is the same angle. This is just zoomed out, but this is Kamala Watching this interaction check this out Hmm Oh She is seething You see that face I mean she always looks like that. That's true. She does that She has a little bit of a where they call it always got a scowl. Isn't it RBF? Yeah, she does Well, I would too if I was just a bearist like that like mother fuck you had no chance of winning Everybody hated you before you were even in the race and then they faked your popularity And you still couldn't fucking do it Like you still got your ass beat a billion dollars. Yes, you are the worst candidate that's ever existed And everybody there knows it everybody here knows it and everybody listening knows it Okay, there was not a single person that actually believed that you were neck and neck with Trump the entire time You Spent a billion dollars ended up 20 million dollars in debt and you want to talk about how you're gonna be good for the fucking economy Like dude, you're a dumbass Then you were chosen you weren't even voted in you weren't voted in you were chosen because you're supposedly a black woman which you are not And then you spices and then you come in and you are a fucking shitty VP You can't publicly speak you can't do anything without a teleprompter everybody doesn't like you And then you run for president because of the color of your skin Like fuck dude you lost in life nothing you've done in your life is because of the quality of the merit of how smart you are or how good you are Or how effective you are could you imagine how empty that would feel imagine how empty that would feel like you You have risen to the top quote-unquote Almost to the very top vice president of the United States and you You Literally didn't earn a single fucking bit of it Think about that she knows that man. She knows that dude. She knows that. I mean she can lie and try to steal us And you still lose yes, she's a fucking terrible worthless Fucking human that shouldn't even be in that room So she could scowl all she wants you're lucky even fucking be there Everybody else out here has to work for their position in life that's sucked dicks for it. Yeah, no some some suck base Well, I'm just saying real talk like how would you feel if your entire Life was based upon being chosen For other reasons than your skill or your ability to do something you know I'm saying actual She's a blot. She's got Dude, she's got darkness inside of her bro. She'll never it'll never change because dude You can't change that yeah, what's already happened like this is What can she do from here? Can she go up from here? No, okay, okay, so the pinnacle of her life is that is that and it was all based around the color of her skin and not the skill at which She earned or displayed or how effective she was she's a fucking joke she her whole life is a fucking joke Oh, it's even worse too, bro. She couldn't run she couldn't run a company. No, she couldn't run my company She couldn't run a single one of them for a day No, and what what's it makes it even worse too is like this the the way that society is moving into To wear like you know that type of mentality was even popular three years ago like there's gonna be no place for it Like no place not broke because we're getting back to merit-based There's no place achievement. She's where I know I'll be homeless like not like I mean Well her brother-in-law's worth like no, that's what I'm saying Billions a dollar. I'm just saying like in society she will be home. Yeah But dude, we're getting back to the things that matter. This is why we're launching the msco project again So I could teach all these young people what it takes to actually fucking win because it's gonna matter Okay, it's not gonna matter anymore Where you were born or what skin color you were Or if you're a minority what's gonna matter is if you fucking do a job So we got to prepare people to do the fucking job regardless of where they come from or what they look like.

You got anything else on this though Sayonara Like fuck these people jimmy Carter is the worst president in the United States besides fucking jobiden Yeah, he's unremarkable. Okay, they they cause people to lose their fucking homes They cause people to go Bankrupt they change the course of people's lives in a negative way. I have zero sympathy for him fucking pass in a way I'm not gonna pretend like we lost some American hero that motherfucker was responsible for more economic destruction Than almost anybody except Joe bride and those people don't deserve to be celebrated I'll give a fuck at their president. I don't care if they were nice people They weren't because they ruined mother fuckers lives That's how I feel about real man guys you jumping on this conversation I don't think we should be celebrating any fucking person In this country that has harmed the people of this country in the interest of self You know what I'm saying? Yeah, bro like dude. I think jimmy Carter should have been cremated just thrown in a fucking paper bag and Throwing the river. That's what I think I think you say fucking piece out bitch. You shouldn't have fucked around That's that's what I think I'm with it I'm with it. Yeah, I don't think that we should celebrate people just because they earned a position in life Yeah, we should celebrate them based upon how good they were at it Were they great at it did they make the country better President Grant made the country better This motherfucker wrote in on horseback during the civil war and killed the motherfucking slave owners His party the radical Republicans which is interesting because they were the ones that freed the fucking slaves they wrote in legitimately physically freed the fucking slaves then he becomes president What when are we talking about that guy? You see I'm saying oh they want to tear a statue down right exactly. Yeah, okay, so I don't think we should celebrate people that don't do good things And I think that if we only celebrated presidents that did good things these motherfuckers because they're so ego driven They would do good things like if they knew that their president presidency was rated a fucking C Or below that they were gonna be putting a paper bag and throwing the river and laughed at they'd fucking do a better job Because that's what these people care about they care about their fucking legacy They care about their stupid picture in a fucking collage of other people they care about their library They care about that shit, bro. That's what they care about So like we should leverage what they care about against them to make them do a good job. Yeah You know, well, here's another thing too that I saw this pop up Um, I don't know if you've seen this or not, but uh Apparently and I didn't know this actually, but when a when a former president dies There's 30 days of national morning that happens where all flags are like lowered to half-staff Right, um, and because of when he died The inauguration is Encompassing that 30 days right now. I was seeing some stuff online. You know people try to obviously conspiracy theorists The real ones hop on that shit and try to elevate it and make it crazy um But most people are getting on my fucking nerves. Well my question is though Yeah, they're annoying. It's like bro like Like when I agree with him, I like them But then they just go to crazy. No, bro. It's not not everything. It's a fucking conspiracy. Just most things most things Yeah, yeah, but it did maybe think though like I it didn't make me think because like listen like let's be real again like He should have been You know across the the life line there, right months ago Probably years ago. It is interesting that like the timing of it like I'm not saying anything about the flags like that's typical right But like I mean maybe I don't you see what I'm saying like like I mean or these people are disgusting That's what I'm saying like so like I mean if we know they're evil and and fucked up who should say they didn't just like Crink his fucking oxygen line You know, I'm saying to make it happen to where you don't say yeah, I'm just listening Pro saying here's what I'm just saying Imagine sitting imagine working your whole life and kissing ass and fucking working your chain up and doing all this shit to sit in the fucking room with those motherfuckers I'd rather pull every single fucking fingernail and toenail Off of me with a pair of pliers and then every single tooth yeah for real Then to sit in a room with these fucks the only one I'd want to sit in there with his trunk.

It's crazy I was up last night watching it on TV for like Four or five hours dude crazy. Well, it's crazy was it that new ones just kept popping up. Yeah, isn't that weird Dude, listen, it is weird. It's weird. I get a week. I didn't want to make a post about it or anything But like I am getting like super fucking weird like Well, I think there's some spiritual shit going on, bro. I don't know. It does sort of feel like that It also feels like I don't know like where's gonna be the evidence of all this Hollywood pedophilia now? You know what I'm saying? The rooms got burned with the cameras and I'm got burned. I'm just saying like These people are not against burning down an entire fucking city and doing Well, the same damage to protect themselves. That's how cover ups happen all the fucking time Like all the time. I'm like, it's always this look man I hate to say that like I know because people are gonna get upset because it's a tragedy and and but they don't But that's the thing they don't care about the extra excess loss or damage. They don't care to achieve one small little goal Yeah, they will fucking burn it all day. Yeah, yeah, and people don't understand that bro But we do that shit to other countries on a daily. That's what people don't get we do it They just think oh, it never happened here. No, it absolutely does. Yeah, absolutely I don't know what to think but I know this I know tons of people that live in LA. We used to have an office in LA um A lot of friends in LA and it's it's heartbreaking to see Like places that I've been and gone spent real time at just gone. Yeah, it's fucking crazy. Yeah I mean, even the last time we went out there like uh, because I saw one of the videos was like right on the man I know we joke a lot about it. Yeah, right like I fucking I'm not a big shit on common. Yeah for sure, bro But like that that's this is terrible. No, it's a it's a fucked up loss I mean like I mean people real people are being affected. Yeah, some people are being affected Yeah, bro, and you know people don't understand that like when you lose your house in a fire bro You lose all your memories you lose your animals you lose your like it's like getting your life erased You lose a computer you lose all your fucking photographs like and there's some fucked up Bro listen to the insurance hold on real talk Yeah, do you know why that happened with the state farmage? Do you have that in here? I couldn't find you so do you know why they did that? No because they use an AI algorithm the actuaries of the insurance company Use an AI algorithm to determine how risky it is and so the AI algorithm knew that they didn't have the resources and they didn't they just cut the budget And yes, and they had problems with getting water and the AI algorithm knew that they were like set up for this To happen and so they fucking cancel all their insurances Days before the pull on Now I read that yeah, I didn't vet it, but I read that that could be That could be false, but It Sounded good. I mean fuck it makes sense. Yeah, I mean, and we know however how much everybody loves you say I Cuz I mean, that's the thing that elects lacks that human you know, I'm saying like touch You know some little dude. It's fucking hard. It's wild man But let's dive into this because you got some stuff to talk about here, but people don't realize like What you actually lose one of my best friends when sounds best friends um his house burnt down a number of years ago and The girl he was dating. I think I think I've never remember right she flipped the cigarette on his deck He started a fire burnt house down wrote His dad had just passed away and he had like all these photographs listen The only thing he was able to fucking salvage from the house was a fuck his dad's casket flag and like all his pictures all his fuck All of his shit gone everything Like dude people don't think of it like that like think of Think of someone came through your life and just erased all all the memories you had that's what a fire dust bro jeez it's it's not it's really bad fuck man All right, it's terrible, bro. I mean so far as of right now there's been at least five uh five deaths Um as of right now Um, I'm sure that number I mean Chris brought the the amount of destruction. I mean it's 27,000 acres so far 50 billion dollars. Yeah, 57 Yeah, is what they're with their estimate right now Um, obviously celebrities are pretty mad because that's a lot of the areas a lot of the homes have been these these big mansions and Um, a lot of celebrities should have been on the fucker you get what you vote for I hate to say that I hate to say that Okay, nobody deserves what's happening out there But when you vote for the first fucking, you know, anything this or or or pronouns or fucking all this this this is the argument of the last 15 years You guys you celebrities were on TV advocating for these people who then made these decisions to cut resources steal the money And let these situations manifest, okay, so it's just as much you as it is the people that you are now blaming you were on TV Saying vote for Gavin Newsom vote for this far leftist vote for this progressive and those people Historically do the same thing that they do to the black communities for the last fucking 60 years Hey, we're gonna come in we're gonna do all this shit. We're gonna get all this funding And then they steal it and nothing happens and the and so this has happened on a wide scale in California And now these people are pissed because it affects them, you know like I I'm not saying they deserved it because nobody deserves it, but you fucking vote for stupid shit This is what you get you get unpreparedness you get lack of resources you get And then when things happen what happens when there's a fucking major earthquake out there now You know what I'm saying bro They just cut $17 million off the fucking fire department's budget. Yeah weeks ago Yeah, just and like then it's so much into this man and like obviously like when The goal is not to politicize this there's real people that are that are being like their lives are being destroyed by this right? You know, but we have to address the truth and the reality of the situation and call a spade a spade You know and when you look and you just start to unpeel this mess bro. It's fucking discussed it. Yeah, it's discussed it You know, they get what they pay in tax in California bro to get this bro. This is what you get This is what the fuck you voted for bro. People have pushed and you know, I'm saying like they cut $17 million from the fire But yeah, let's fund this you know, listen, this is why this is why We have to return to meritocracy. We have to return to voting not because someone has a skin color or someone came from somewhere Or what their gender is we have to put people in positions That are competent skilled people that can execute the job and I feel fucking stupid saying that like it feels so common sense it is But you know people get so comfortable They think that those things don't matter and then they vote for you know fucking whoever make some feel good or that they can brag about Well, I voted for her because that's the first female male Trans fucking you know what I'm saying right like dude, okay, and now your house burnt out right Right so let's unpill this a little bit right because you know one of the first things that came out was you got the mayor most of this is happening in City of Los Angeles um the mayor She's a Democrat mayor LA mayor Karen bass She was in Africa when this was going on Los Angeles mayor Karen bass spent Tuesday in Africa as part of a taxpayer funded delegation Attending the inauguration of John Dramani, Mahama has gone as president the Democrat Was there as her city battled wildfires and thousands of residents fled for their lives now Here's the thing. It's important to know all right. It's not like you know, I mean It's not like she just you know happened to be there And then this fire broke out here's the thing all right she knew She was well aware that that was a potential for this fire to break out before she even went on that fucking trip Okay, and we have the timeline to prove it all right on Thursday January 2nd the national weather service Explicitly warned Los Angeles about extreme fire conditions over the next week, okay Multiple reports were coming out on January 2nd um on January 4th That's when she decided to leave to go attend this inauguration of another country's president and you're a city mayor Okay, and that and taxpayers paid for her to do that be very very clear on that all right Now that next day emergency preparations for expected fire danger that was put out by the governor all right on January 6th she remained in Ghana Okay January 6 later that evening to the national weather service they start pushing out stuff saying heads up There's a life threatening destructive widespread windstorm as expected Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday Across much of Ventura and LA County But she remained in Africa Then the next day that's when the fire that actually started to hit She remained in Africa And then finally on January 8th is when she you know finally showed up now they were able to catch her coming off this plane All right, and I want to show this video for those of you guys who have not seen this Um, this is literally her she's on the jet bridge while this is happening. Let's check this clip out Do you set us on apology for being absent while their homes were burning? And do you regret cutting the fire department budget by millions of dollars madam mayor? Have you nothing to say today? Have you absolutely nothing to say to the citizens today? Elon Musk says that you're utterly incompetent. Are you considering your position? Madam Mayor, have you absolutely nothing to say to the citizens today? We're dealing with this disaster I Know apology for them Do you think you should have been visiting Ghana while this was unfolding back home? Oh She's running Madam mayor let me ask you just again. Have you anything to say to the citizens today as you return? How long she been there just recently a few months. Yeah, okay, so first of all You know, let's be real about that. It's not like she fucking did this, okay Garçon who was the fucking mayor forever is the one that did most of this shit. All right, secondly She's clearly not good at public relations because all she had to say was hey, this is horrible This is why I'm on my way back nobody could have predicted this I'm gonna get back and have navigate this the best that we can and Hopefully we can get through it with the least amount of damage as possible. That's all you had to say That's it. You know, I'm saying or something to the effect of this weak leadership Has nothing done but dude what my point is is why did she get voted in? Why did she get voted in she did not get voted in because she's competent She did not get voted in because she's skilled she did not get voted in because she's experienced She got voted in because California is of progressive mindset And who knows what they do with the elections out there, okay And people vote for things so that they can brag to their friends and say they're not racist Instead of saying no, we need the most effective person now they had Entrepreneurs and billionaires people who have built things people have done things running for mayor And those people didn't win and you know why they didn't win because they were white fucking men That's it So until we get over this insane shit of we're gonna put the first person of this or the first woman this or the first gender this and by the way I don't give a fuck if they happen to be those things as long as they're the most skilled right Right, that's all that matters. Yes, I don't look at it like oh like no, this is just if she was a fucking trans man Fucking zezer Fucking whatever and she had the most skill. I'd be like cool. Yeah cool. Okay cool your personal life is your personal life You want to do what you want to do But that ain't the case and that's not the case across the country We looked at this shit. Hey, we had this shit here with Kim Gardner who let our fucking city burn Okay, we have this in in cities across the fucking country Were these people who are not qualified to do the job have no history of qualifications have no attributes have no Alcalades have or in these positions of power and they are literally fucking the entire country up Okay, it doesn't matter if they're white or they're black or they're gay or they're straight or they're tri- I don't care But we have to get back to meritocracy. Are you qualified? Are you skilled? Are you the best person for the job or is your head up your own ass With all these social issues Because dude when the fucking rubber hits the road people die right Right So you know all you mother fuckers which they don't listen to this show But that vote on these fucking issues so you could go to brunch and feel like you know you're doing something Noble realized that you're putting your fellow citizens at risk in your self-at-risk. Yes Yeah, cuz all these celebrities all they're mad cuz their house burned out Well mother fucker what the fuck have you been preaching for the last 20 years? That's my question You know, but I mean it's a it's a real issue, bro It's like you know like you said, bro It doesn't matter what what where you come from what you claim to be it doesn't we can you do the job And that's not been the focus of Los Angeles That's technically the focus across the country and most parts of the country 100 percent In 2023 Los Angeles created the DEI Bureau and promoted black lesbian to weed out bigoted fire fighters on the forest Let's talk about it. Let's dive into it. It's being a lesbian and being black has something to do with putting out fucking fires And do you really care if your firefighter is bigoted as long as he comes to your house and squirts the fucking fire out right Fuck Like oh, man. Are you are you a gay firefighter? I don't want you like I've ever told racist show Well, fuck dude. Don't squirt the fucking hose on my house. Let the shit burn. Yeah, what do we do in man? Check this clip out. So this is Kristen Larson All right, she's the first black battalion chief in Los Angeles check this video out So I want to reach down and bring you up and that's kind of something that stuck with me to this day Part of that work means speaking up for those who can't over the last few years L.A.F.D. is dealt with a fair share of controversy and Larson not afraid to soundly alarm. I chose to speak out Pretty much by myself about the issues of sexism and racism within my department um, and and the need for change. I don't think there's any question that our department is the best at fighting fires We do it better than anybody in the world Yeah, it comes to the personnel side. We have some issues And they're not insurmountable But they need to be addressed and and and fix Um to the best of everybody's ability Make sure you don't say anything offensive when you're putting out that fire right make sure you use someone's right pronouns when you're putting out that fire Make sure you never you know You never said anything off color or told a weird joke or you know, I don't know We're heterosexual. We put out that fire. Right. You better not be straight You're not Fuck dude This dude listen we're seeing look at the headline on there black excellence see that's the kind of shit that is fucking up the world bro It's man. It's just excellence Are you an excellent person or are you not it's not white excellence? It's not black excellence Stop fucking gay excellence. It's fucking are you excellent or are you not and this fucking bullshit This identity politics Nonsense has fucked the entire world up and now LA is fucking ashes because of it bro And you know, it's even what's even crazier is that you go to pride.com They put this article out amid palisades fire lost angel is first LGBTQ plus fire chief is proving lesbians get it done Yeah, they burn it shit down The whole fucking town is fucked Shit come on man Dude Let's go. They don't want you to fucking like I'm a walk outside. I see the whole city on fucking fire But you know what they're doing a good job. Mm-hmm Yeah, great job. Well, I feel bad for like the fucking real firefighters like how many real fire have you ever seen that clip? Adam Corolla talking about how when he was broke he He joined he wanted to join the fire department. Yeah, it took him seven years to get a fucking interview And while he was there there was a black woman who was in the interview and he asked to he said how long have you been waiting for and she sets his Wednesday? Okay, that's a problem That's a problem. It's crazy man. It's crazy. We got we cannot we have to lose this fucking shit, dude This this we're Americans man. It doesn't matter if you're black or white or gay or straight. We're fucking Americans And are you good or are you capable of doing this job or not? And if you're not You're still a good person, but go over here and do this job You know what I mean? Yeah, bro. Let's go to CNN real quick though Because this was an interesting exchange that happened on CNN You got Jasmine Crockett. She's a crowd favorite She's uh, I think she's in she's a congresswoman. I think I'm pretty sure She likes to get in these race debates and then talk about this. Let's check this clip out You might have recall a new story from last year there was some interest in the fire departments and the firefighters in California And the interest was because there were too many white men who were firefighters and we need to have a program in California to make sure we don't have enough white men as fire fighters So so I'm wondering now if your house was burning down. How much do you care what color the firefighters are? You can respond and I'm listening. I am so tired You know what there was an article that just came out that said that actually the most educated demographic in this country right now is black women So let let me be clear Because you are woman or because because I know that some of the right has been sharing these photos of the fact that I believe that the fire chief may be a woman or something that has nothing to do with it We are looking at qualifications what diversity equity and inclusion has always been about is saying you know what Open this up don't just look at the white men open it up and recognize that other people can be qualified Oh, it's not that we want to at a time when people are dying. Okay lady, but here's the fucking problem The white man don't even get a chance anymore So I can understand the 60 years ago when it was the boys club and it was all white dudes doing fucking everything But now we've we've created this scenario where white men don't even get an opportunity anymore because they're white Which is racist by definition? Okay, so Fucking that argument is 40 years too late. Yep. No, that now you got it and um, you know, I'm so tired of hearing this shit like dude. What are we talking about the only demographic in the history in the Fucking country that that has been able to be discriminated against for the last fucking 20 years is white men There are the only ones that can legally not get a job because they're a white man So we're gonna fucking still beat this drum about this fucking shit of opportunity what the fuck are we talking about? Why are we talking about that and fucking sports? Why are we talking about that in the NFL or fucking basketball or fucking I remember they were talking about it and hockey a couple years ago But how come it's exclusively to white things and that fucking everything right like dude I'm just done with this shit. We're Americans. We're fucking all we should all be judged on the content of our character and what skills we have Maritocracy that is it man and anything else is fucking racist By default well bro, you know the other thing too that that's that's crazy is like they put these people in these positions And then they pay them exorbitant amounts of money the so the the the person that's responsible Because like I mean here's one of the things too. Oh this woman's fucking insane. Oh, yeah, bro Put her on a fucking fire crew No, for real let her go see what it's about Dude the things insane though, but like the thing where hold on there's like there's more to this clip right What else does she say? I'm sure some decide that a country of immigrants is failing or people are dying because The same very people that built this country because the last time I check y'all didn't say that anything was wrong with the white house And I can promise you it was my ancestors that built the white house so listen if we have been good enough to build this country We are good enough to serve and die overseas We are good enough to serve in other ways and the fact that people actually decide that they want to public service. What are we not where where are you not serving? Where are you blocked where are you blocked out of Where where Fucking 50 years ago. Okay 60 years ago. Okay, 70 years ago. Okay. Yeah, what the fuck are you talking about And not only that just because you want to do something doesn't mean you can that's the bottom line bro. It doesn't matter Doesn't matter bro. Listen. We got to get back to being judged on the quality of our character And the skill set that we have and we need to apply that skill set To the things that we are capable of doing and when you be judged on our fucking performance. That is it Not the color of your skin not what your ancestors built. Okay I see people like her saying that black people built fucking Europe Okay, so what do white people build right what do we do? Oh, we did nothing. Yeah My fuck out of here my people built wrong. Well listen. I'm not gonna fucking hear this shit anymore. I'm tired of hearing it I'm tired of hearing it Okay, so so we don't get any history. We don't get any history Like bro and listen that's not racist to stand up and say what the fuck yeah, right No, that's the thing man like but they that's how they disguise this shit man That's racist shit. It's what she's fucking saying. It's racist. Yes. It's racist man You know, it's crazy and then but then they put these people in these positions But when they give them exorbitant amounts of money. So like one of the things. It's also happening in LA right now Is that you know there's a water shortage right and the fire hydrants have been run out Right, you know who did that and the person that's responsible for that. Yeah, he was white I think it was it was a chick actually. That's Gavin Newsom did it. Well, yeah, he started it. Yeah, it's fucking smelt the the fucking Sam and date danger fish. Yeah, right But like we protect this fucking endangered fish and let your entire country your entire city burn down That bro and the person that's in LA county that's responsible that help with that decision. How much of that person makes a year Three quarters of a million dollars, bro 750 grand of fucking year cost of living That's insane man It's insane taxpayer money bro It's insane bro now There's been a lot of other crazy stuff going on one thing that I know you feel what I'm saying though about that race shit Oh, but it's done. No, I'm just saying like Shut the fuck up. It's done. Tell me an example of where the fuck you where can you where are you blocked out of Where doesn't it's like a name of buncher places up until fucking six months ago when they stopped affirmative action the white people are blocked out of Mm-hmm nothing happened bro But let's let's throw some more BS here because uh, it was going on Twitter. I found this guy Morgan tin Tingly Tingly Let's read his tweet read his tweet. You want to read it? The insanity of being a fire ecologist in the epicenter of a major fire event Vags packed ready to evacuate watching active fire from my window while taking media requests and explaining to the public For the 100th Thousand-time how climate change is largely responsible for this You sir are a fucking idiot They got no water they got no staff they got no resources they got fucking but but it's climate change right Climate change People want it to be climate change to per push they would love their city to burn to push their religion which is climate That is sane dude. Not the 17 million dollars. It was cut out the budget that had nothing to do with fucking the way they spend it What's that gonna be one fire truck? They're right you know what I'm saying like 17 million these fuckers in California Been milking their citizens look dude. Here's the reality people in California or go with the flow people That's why they fucking live there no one really gives a fuck they're like fucking out If you go to California to talk to someone about the taxes you know what they say they all say the same shit look around dude Look at the weather.

Yeah, I'm going to talk about it. I'm going to talk about it. I'm going to talk about it. I'm going to talk about it. I'm going to talk about it. I'm going to talk about it. Now let's check this article out. You can take this article out. So in the final weeks before Donald Trump returns to the White House the focus of his public remarks has not been about the Confirmations of his cabinet picks or on key parts of his campaign to agenda like Mas Ste. Portation of Owing Prices instead Trump, who has criticized US military involvement in other countries, is advocating for Americans to gain more global territory, including by force, if necessary. recent days Trump has repeatedly pushed the idea that he will take over Greenland from Denmark, reclaim the Panama Canal after the United States returned it to the Panamanian government decades ago and absorb Canada into the United States. Trump said he is keeping the option of using the military to gain control of Greenland and the Panama Canal on the table while saying he will exert economic force to pressure Canada to join the United States. He also said he wants to rename the Gulf of Mexico and the Danali North America's from Greenland. Do you like America? I love America. But people all too far over there. People are way. What do you say? People are way. But people all too far over there. Too fat? Too friendly over there? I think he said too fat. Too fat. But people all too far over there. He said fat. I'm a fucking fat too. You said right in bro. Fuck you fat ass. He said Donald Trump Jr. Now he said Donald Jr. up there. But people, we had a very good reception. I love them. Yeah. Look man, this is about setting up our side of the world, not Canada, not Greenland, but our side of the world, humans to keep from becoming their side of the world. That's what this is about. Look dude, he's uniting the West. Well fuck we pay for it already. Bro, no shit. I mean shit. But I do like that he's straight up like, did you see the fucking tweet that Elon said to fucking true now? He's like girl. He said girl. You're not even the governor of America anymore. Bro, oh man. That's great. This is what a time to be alive. It's weird times. Yeah. It's weird and interesting times. I just want to throw that in and see what you thought about that. Guys, there's no down in the comments. I think Trump knows exactly what the fuck he's doing. And I do, I should let him do it. I think there's going to be, I'm just going to say this on the show because I do want to say this. But I think there's going to be a major announcement about Ukraine in the next year or so that people are going to get fucking pissed about. I know what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. There's no be there. Yeah. That's right. They'll have no choice. And that was the plan all along. I agree. And people, when it happens, people are going to be like, what the fuck? And we should say it. I mean, marketing history. You know, I think they're going to name it the new Israel. Israel will be the new Ukraine. That's what I personally think. Speculation show. It is speculation. You heard it here first. Yeah. Guys, we'll see. We'll see. Yeah. We'll see. Yeah. Guys, let me set us. Get to our final segment of the show as always. Guys, we got thumbs up or dumb as fuck. Let's bring a headline in. We talk about it. We get one of those two options. So that being said, our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads, we're in love. So we implant it in magnets under our skin that connect when we touch. The fuck is wrong with you guys. There should be a natural sort of like purge that people do stuff like this. They're just gone.
