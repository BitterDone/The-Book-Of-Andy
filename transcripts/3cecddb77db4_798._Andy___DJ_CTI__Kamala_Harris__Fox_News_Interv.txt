move that's seen the first time I saw it if you haven't seen Django and Shane and the scene that we're talking about I can't I think I laughed harder at that scene than probably any scene in modern movie yeah it's so it's not your other scene I laughed at I don't know if you guys will remember this because it's kind of an older movie but I laughed that hard at the what's that ace Finchura movie where he like gets in the rhino and fucking crawls out the rhinos ass that pet detective or something like that anyway that's that was a funny scene was that a who's that Jim Kerry Jim Kerry yeah back when he was like super funny funny yeah actually funny yeah that's sweet man well yeah great way to get into this we when nature calls when nature you know what other movie was good at his what's that movie me myself and I mean that movie's fucking funny that's a great movie you know we haven't done this segment in a while so you know why not let's do it oh we got new segment what's this new one just when we have done breaking news no dumbass of the day oh okay it's been a minute since we've had one all right and uh let's get into it uh watch humiliation ensues for pro Hamas idiot when she tears down what she believes are Israeli flags from restaurant all right I saw this you saw this yeah this has to be literally the dumbest shit I've ever seen in my life but please continue to embarrass this person because that's what they deserve bro oh my goodness uh let's dive into this so no one has ever accused the protesters advocating for Hamas against Israel of having actual brain cells still one incident that has gone viral this week demonstrates that there is no bottom to their level of stupidity a pro Hamas agitator posted a sense deleted video on tiktok Tuesday showing herself tearing down what she thought were Israeli flags outside of fays giro uh in Montclair New Jersey gyro gyro gyro gyro gyro gyro gyro gyro gyro that's uh that's that's money so also the kabobs that eat anyway bak lava who would have no no korek lava who would have who would have thought that outside of a restaurant that serves kabobs and euros that you would find in this really flag she's uh let's watch this clip man let's let's watch this clip uh here it is uh she captioned this with the time I mistakenly thought the flag of Greek was for Israel and took the restaurant flag down oh mg oh mg here's a clip is how you do it you know shit and I'm about to come back and put three pounds fine too if repal assignment look what she looking at you know there's a genocide nice stop it you're taking I'm taking this right now I believe this one take this one down right here what are you going to they can't do night oh I don't stand for it I don't stand for it I don't stand for this this there's genocide and I don't stand for Zionism I'm not clear I don't support it there's a genocide you know that right they're killing children what's the purpose be proud of your heritage y'all understand there's a genocide right in Greece why you understand right it's nothing against people who are Jewish but this is this is not okay this is gricky who's this this is gricky what really gricky oh shit my look it looked like it looked like Israel okay you want it back okay first of all you're a dumbass okay definitely dumbass of the day but dude even if it wasn't a raised Israeli flag the fuck are you doing tearing out the people's property up okay this is America man people but you don't think that I would like to tear out some of the signs I see in people's yards and shit okay like like they do yeah that's what they do these people believe that their views and their positions somehow superspeed see everybody else's okay and this is why these same people think it's okay to cheat and voting or you know I'm going to vote 20 times so that my way wins even though it's not what people want that's called fucking treason okay and these these people's entitlement and their cultural indoctrination to believe that their viewpoints supersede everybody else's viewpoints are going to eventually land these people in jail because what's happening in America right now is really unprecedented in terms of how many people think they can just do things like this like destroy people I would have called the police and had that person arrested well that's the thing and so I thought this you know at first from I saw that somebody there's no way this can be fucking real I thought it was some type of fucking skit and spoof or something you know and it was absolutely real yeah absolutely happened and the police were called um FTV Maya who is the owner of the restaurant revealed to the Montclair local that she reported the incidents the police when it occurred back on March 11th but they did nothing uh she said quote all I want to say is that it was not a skit and that it happened eight months ago she explained to the paper I filed a report eight months ago and nothing happened the Montclair local reported that police chief Todd Comforty and another officer visited the eatery Wednesday morning the outlet noted that no flags were there um and in a response they said that uh we're in an email Comforty told the Montclair local that an investigation into the incident is ongoing uh quote a bias notification report was also completed and since the prosecutor's office and the division of criminal justice this is an active investigation um that has lasted eight plus months look dude I know this is the grease flag by the way yeah and more there's the Israel yeah we're we're we're so so the thing is guys is like these people will never learn unless they're held somewhat accountable right and I know that there's a lot of things going on in the world and I know there's a lot of more important issues quote unquote but is there a lot of more important issues because what we have is an entire culture of a certain level of uh you know age who has been brought up to believe that their opinions their views matter more than everybody else's and then they bring it to destroying property uh causing scenes and these people are only going to learn by being hauled off to jail and been like hey sit in the corner for a minute while you know you think about what the fuck you did right right right like we you know by the way here's a fucking global map yeah like dude I if that were me I would put that person in jail uh you know at least 30 days at least well I don't know if it's 30 days but it's it should be it should be enough to look I think for most people to get arrested the the process of just getting arrested and getting out is enough to get him to stop yeah you know but uh you know this is bullshit yeah and stupid clearly that's my favorite thing it's like you know the people who and then like it doesn't I don't give a fuck about either side honestly I care about America I think that's very clear but it always interests me like the people who are so pro this side and pro this side you you'll pull out of map and my guard show me where that side is yeah they can't do it they can't fucking do it I don't know that where where's your pro-American like why can't you fight for America why don't you get so pissed off about America why don't you agree about what's going on in America you know why do you take these causes from halfway around the world where you know you fucking bend to these places and act like you actually give a fuck okay let's be real the things that actually affect you are happening here right okay and if we all got pissed off about what's happening here and stop falling for the propaganda of this is going on over here or this human rights violations we have fucking bad things happening here absolutely yeah we have crime happening here we have poverty happening here other countries look at us and they say what the fuck is going on in America and and all these spoiled little brats are like oh I stand for the I don't she kept saying I don't stand for it well you know what it doesn't really matter if you stand for that those people stand for that and that's their fucking place of business you see what I'm saying it really doesn't matter what they fly if they want to fly a fucking Nazi flag outside of their place of business it's their property dude and like do I agree with it no do I think it's a good idea probably not are they asking for trouble probably but at the same time you're breaking the law by going and ripping the shit now and we need to enforce the laws so do they have good food that's what that's what I would be concerned about you know the rest the rest of the restaurant oh that had to what I don't know if they do or not I'm saying I know many I think that's an important like that would go into my weight of like whether or not I'm gonna support them well we know that it would go on to your weight you know I'm saying like yeah good food always goes to your weight you gotta you know I'm saying you gotta list these things out like yeah I mean yeah but like is it good is a food get them you've been a Greek place I fucking love Greek me too you know what the best fucking Greek place St. Louis is it's all also happens to be an Italian place no Anthony knows on the hill Anthony knows I don't think I'll bro it's the four have been there we've been that no you and I haven't been no we have I went there with Emily and the girls for the meeting uh well that places I think that's where we that's that's the fucking spot in St. Louis bro in my opinion

the best okay I just go on you got a big me you know bro I am I used to be 350 pounds my ability to judge food is pretty high it's it's pristine okay I gotta get palette yes they have the best I think the best pizza I think I've ever had I don't think it's even in St. Louis yeah yeah I love them too they're good my favorite met like Mediterranean restaurant is the vine another good place is Bartolinos Bartolinos South well any of them because they're all the same thing yeah but you're ever going to the wild south I think I've been you an Alice go there yeah I think we should go there the food's fucking incredible I think we went there before I love those people too yeah great say both great St. Louis families we got do St. Louis is a great food coach yeah they're nothing else do now you might get robbed leaving these places we eat good food we drink we fight yeah man well yeah guys don't cast don't mess of the day yeah good job on that one but that's why the league is open a brand new spot wear it uh twin oaks I think it was the notes I think that's where it was oh sweet yeah well let's get to this cruise guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them all link there for you that being started man let's get to our first headlines headline number one and number one reads train wreck comola trends number one on Twitter after disastrous Fox News interview oh man this was bad this was bad this is this was pretty bad let's dive into these we got plenty of outtakes from this interview let's let's dive into them hashtag train wreck comola trend it at the top spot on Twitter after vice president comola Harris's disastrous interview on Wednesday evening with Fox News's Brett Bayer during the course of the discussion Harris dodged multiple questions surrounding her record at the border and immigration and reportedly had to end the interview early the topic was trending at the top spot on Twitter by early Thursday morning with over 30,000 posts on the platform using the hashtag commentator Brendan Dilly posted a clip of Bayer asking about the murders of Lake and Riley Rachel Moran and Jocelyn Nagare at the hands of illegal immigrants who came and under soft border policies of the Biden Harris administration Dilly wrote quote there is no recovering from this answer less than three weeks before an election hashtag train wreck comola now there was a lot of very interesting things that happened throughout this interview I thought one that Brett Bayer did a great job for the most part I don't think he chats a handle and redirect as best as he possibly could but he talked about just even getting to the interview and the start of the interview and how that was a little kind of funky he said quote so we were supposed to start at 5 p.m. this was the time they gave us originally we're going to do 25 or 30 minutes the host explained they came in and said well maybe 20 minutes so it was already getting rid of down Bayer added quote and then the vice president showed up at about 515 p.m. so a little bit late maybe she is black I don't know we'll see or maybe she just wanted to cut down her time and make it so that they couldn't ask as much stuff well not only that but they were also trying to you know their hopes was that they could do a quick turnaround on the production for 6 p.m. yeah and so I mean maybe I think that you know could have been more sinister maybe you know what they knew was they were trying to get it on for 6 p.m. they knew if they stayed that they showed up late that they wouldn't get to ask much shit and it would be less damaging because she's a more on you know limit limit limit the exposure right 100 percent um but there was some very interesting clips let's check out this first one why do you think more people say they trust him on the economy than they trust you I think that when you look at an analysis of our plans for what we would do is president of the United States it has been clear to those who study and understand how economic policy works that moving forward because I do believe the American people are ready to turn the page on the divisiveness and the the type of rhetoric that has come out of Donald Trump people are ready to chart a new way forward and they want a president who has a plan for the future and a plan that is sound and will strengthen our country my plan for the economy does exactly that good mayor okay let me tell you something uh America doesn't give a fuck who the president is if uh they can't eat right and they can't afford gas and they can't pay their bills and they know that in the last three and a half years in the last four years that those things have gotten much harder that's what they know they don't really give a shit if it's Ronald McDonnell be in the president as long as they can afford to buy big Macs right like they don't care so this idea that you think that people are ready to turn the page okay which is another one of their talking points because you have Tim Waltz doing it Tim Walsh's wife doing it and they always do the same motion when they do it whatever turn what do you guys think that we don't have the internet or we can't see you all coordinating the same disingenuous moves we all see the shit like these people assume that every single regular person every single regular American citizen is a fucking moron they cannot see all the coordinated stuff that they do okay you don't see that over there on the right you might hear some dumb shit sometimes but at least all the different viewpoints are like not coordinated down to the hand motion yeah exactly right exactly so people don't care they don't care if it's right now dude look a lot of people love Donald Trump a lot of people don't like Donald Trump some people are indifferent to Donald Trump but here's what they know they know that when Donald Trump was in office business was going well their careers were going better they were able to afford more shit period that's it okay times were better under Donald Trump economically so when she gets up here and mumbles on and mumbles on about you know they're ready for a new leader and turn the page on Donald Trump's red no one gives a fuck about Donald Trump's rhetoric in fact people have started to realize that all the jokes and all the shit that he does is actually true okay so there's not going to be this feed this pushback on his Twitter personality that we had for the first four years he was president because now we've had four more years of that and we understand that he's right okay and you guys are wrong and that's that that's what's going on yeah then they got on the topic of the border let's talk about that part uh... but bear questions rattled com la Harris on deadly consequences of her overboarded policies and fox news interview so uh... this is how it started let's check this first this first clip out this is how it started on that conversation how many illegal immigrants would you estimate your administration has released into the country over the last three and a half years well i'm glad you raised the issue of immigration because i agree with you it is it is a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have and you know what i'm going to talk about yeah but you're just a number do you think it's one million three million right let's just get to the point okay the point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired so you're home and security secretary said that eighty five percent of apprehensions we have a we have to have a estimate of six million people have been released into the country and let me just finish i'll get to the question i promise you i was beginning to answer and when when you came into office your administration immediately reversed a number of trump border policies most significantly the policy that required illegal immigrants to be detained through deportation either in the u.s. or in mexico and you switched that policy they were released from custody awaiting trial so instead included in those were a large number of single men adult men who went on to commit heinous crimes so looking back do you regret the decision to terminate remain in mexico at the beginning of your administration at the beginning of our administration within practically hours of taking the oath the first bill that we offered congress before we worked on infrastructure before the inflation reduction act before the chips and science act before any before the bipartisan safety communities act the first bill practically within hours of taking the oath was a bill to fix our immigration system yes man it was called the u.s. citizenship act of two thousand exactly and so but i've laid a citizenship for the you i finished i finished responding please but you have to let me finish you had the white house and the house and the senate and they didn't bring up responding to the point you're raising and i'd like to finish this man we recognized from day one that to the point of this being your first question it is a priority for us as a nation and for the american people and our focus has been on fixing a problem and from day one then we have done a number of things yeah complete bullshit and then you press there even harder check this one out joslyn mingarry Rachel moron laken riley they are young women who were brutally assaulted and killed by some of the men who were released at the beginning of the administration well before a negotiated bipartisan bill former president clinton actually referred to laken riley sunday campaigning for you in georgia saying if those men had been properly vetted laken riley probably would not have been killed so if it wouldn't have happened this is well before any negotiation this is well before donald trump got involved in the politics this is a specific policy decision by your administration to release these men into the country so what i'm saying to you do you know the family is an apology let me just say first of all those are tragic cases there's no question about that there is no question about that and i can't imagine the pain that the families of those victims have experienced for a loss that should not have occurred so that is true it is also true that if a border security had actually been passed nine months ago it would be nine months that we would have had more border agents of the border more support for the folks who are working around the clock trying to hold it all together madden voice press to ensure that no future harm would occur and this election in twenty days will determine whether we have a president of the united states who actually cares more about fixing a problem even if it is not to their political advantage in an election because there was a solution brat madden voice president it was a policy decision in the early part of your administration i will yeah yeah so uh i love how they continue to blame this on trump for not voting for the border security bill or whatever it was called when that border security bill was to send sixty billion dollars to you crane right and to had nothing in there about deportation it had more money to the migrants less money to americans the reason that that and a whole bunch of other stuff too the reason that that bill was encouraged to vote against because like most of the bills that they've proposed it's not actually for border security it was for a whole bunch of other stuff it's a two thousand page fucking document yeah same thing with um with the inflation reduction act it wasn't about reduce it you don't have inflation reduction then in print trillions of dollars for the money right like anybody who knows anything about what's going on knows that's that's not how a fucking works um it's it's disturbing to watch her try and pretend like she's being genuine that she cares about those families sick of it it i mean that was pretty disgustingly disingenuous uh and then how she pivots right to you know we've passed this this law could have been passed in the last nine months and these that happened before that three years before yeah like you guys came in and going back to the first clip that was said you guys came in just like Brett Bayer says and you undo all the policies that trump had put in place which weren't even the policies that he really wanted because you all wouldn't fund the border wall because it was too expensive at five billion dollars it was racist yeah and then was racist but you were okay sending another sixty billion and you know a hundred and whatever billion over there and another how much you know billions to you crane or to israel and all these different causes but um you know let's be real we all know that she wants the border open and we know that the democrats want the border open and we know why they want it open they want it open for the main reason of being able to uh reallocate the voting districts and then also increase population uh that are willing to vote for them because the the minority communities the black community specifically has seen through the facade and now they're not going to vote that way guaranteed anymore so they need a new voter base so that's what this is about it's about voting it's about maintaining power we all know it but they're not going to say it just like she's not going to come in and say hey i'm going to be a communist dictator when i get into power and uh you know a lot of people think oh well she's just stupid or she's just dumb or she know she's intentionally being deceptive so that when she gets into power they can literally crank the hammer down of communism into this country that is what's going on it's not about stupidity it's not about she's a moron it's not she's playing a part they have a strategy they can't tell the truth and win the election so they're pandering every which way we go which is why she says you know i wouldn't change anything that Biden did that we did because we made a lot of amazing progress the next place the next day she says we're going to change all of these things from day one right which one isn't we all know why you know why she's doing it and she's doing it because she has to hide her true intent because none of you would vote for her and you'd all be like holy this woman's actually crazy and it worked with Biden because Biden was old and he was he can play off being senile and he's a puppet and they can run all this stuff in the background but it's not working with her because she's younger and she's not senile and now people are seeing holy shit these people have bad intentions for us right um did you see the part where she got all pissed off yeah so she starts getting flustered and i think this is pretty much where it kind of starts let's check this clip out uh when Brett Bayer starts pressing her own Biden's mental health fitness he's unstable he is unstable but he's not well you say he's mentally not stable i he's not stable and you told many interviewers that joe biden was on his game that ran around circles on his staff when did you first notice that president Biden's mental faculties appeared diminished joe biden i have watched in from the oval office to the situation room and he has the judgment and the experiment and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the american people joe biden concerns right joe biden is not on ballot i understand but don't trump don't trump but you talked about it and don't and did you include me so within a few minutes of talking to president Biden at a fundraiser that he thought this was not the same joe biden that we saw on the debate stage is on the ballot i understand you met with him at least once a week for three and a half years you didn't have any concerns i think the american people have a concern about donald trump which is why the people who know him best including leaders of our national security community have all spoken out even people who worked for him in the oval office worked with him in the situation room and i've said he is unfit and dangerous and should never be president of the united states again including his former vice president which is why the job was open for him to choose another running mate so that is a fact that is a fact you know what that turned into her losing her shit check this out this last clip man check this out we talked about locking people up because they disagree with him this is a democracy and in a democracy the president of the united states in the united states of america should be willing to be able to handle criticism without saying he'd lock people up for doing it well i don't know should he handle a bunch of treasonous activity she he handled collusion between the government the media the three letter agencies is that is that just some criticism or is that weaponized law fair and uh... and tyranny from your opposition i don't think donald trump's putting his opposition in jail but i do think that there are a number of janeuary six protesters who have been held for four years without due process uh... rotting in jail right now i also think that there's been a number of people who have been put on this quote unquote domestic terrorism list for being patriots and be threatened with jail time i also believe that a lot of people were threatened with big fines in jail time during the pandemic when they said if you don't make your company vaccinate themselves you're going to be fine this amount of money and if you don't do it it could lead up further consequences so who's the actual tyrant here is it the person who's never put any opposition in prison or is it the people who continue to try and prosecute their opposition and not just limited to down the truck but any citizen that disagrees or descents that they call misinformation disinformation conspiracy theorists well i don't know conspiracy guys are doing pretty good with their fucking win count here i think they're about a hundred forty seven and zero yeah all right so look it's projecting man what do you think i mean i think i think anybody who watched clips watch the entire interview they can obviously say that she fucking did terribly oh my god they know she lied uh... the part that pisses me off the most though is how they protect this woman no matter what uh... CNN Brian Steltzer or step stettler or the fuck you say this cuck's name another leftist try to put positive spin on commoners disaster interview right and they're like literally like what did you see her get mad at the end okay that's her yeah that's the that's the mass coming off that is who she is when you ask anybody who works inside of that building that's been around her that's how she acts that's how she treats people and word on the street is she had a fucking meltdown last night after that interview and freak the fuck out on everybody for the whole night yeah brother were fucking yelling like they were like you know when you have those interviews yeah there's a team of people sitting behind them yeah and they're like fucking like doing the fucking like they cut that shit you know i'm saying like a piss yeah and you can hear do out a couple of those clips who you can even hear their staff shuffling around yeah behind the fucking yeah she's freaking the fuck out here freaking out man well you know what you can't lie your way uh eventually with this much information and this much ability to see and transparency and technology you're not gonna fool people bro like this this this this nineteen 90s political theater that these people try to play where they go in and they sit and they do all these interviews and try to play like they're look dude there's too much information there's too much transparency one slip like her getting mad there shows everybody what she's all about because everybody suspected it anyway everybody's like I bet she's a total bitch you know what i'm saying like her losing her cool and not being able to answer it's not like she lost her cool making a point it's not like she lost her cool saying you're lying here's what happened this is that this is what we did this is the result and you're full of shit she had no points she's just mad because she had no point because she knows she's lying that's how I read it I read it as her getting cornered by someone who has finally asked her some very direct questions and you know she lost her shit yeah guys what do you guys think I don't mind if someone gets mad I don't mind if they get mad if they're making points mm-hmm this this this this and it went to this yeah but that's not what she's doing she's saying Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump's on the ticket Trump did this Trump didn't do this nine months ago when she's asked about these three young women who were killed by her policies directly right like that's insane dude and she showed no remorse no care no empathy for any of that loss her sitting there thinking that she can look someone in the eye and lie to them that does not work when you can see this on a thousand different media outlets you see what I'm saying absolutely man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments she should have done in the towel for sure yeah and well dude people don't remember how used to be like they're used to only be three or four networks dude now there's the internet yeah right so you can individual if you go on ABC and you go on Fox and you go on NBC and you go on CBS and then you go on CNN okay that used to be it so you only had to crush like four interviews or five interviews now you got to give interviews everywhere so like all these little holes and mishaps and omissions and wise they come out in the wash because there's too much information so I mean bro she's not fooling anybody even her own voters are mortified at her behavior so it's uh yeah it's it is what it is yeah man we guys let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's go cruise some of these uh cruise comments oh yeah yeah as far as we're coming from that silence sir he says oh my god Andy 2024 that should be the slogan that should be the slogan yeah oh mg Andy 2024 uh yeah there's not too little too late for 2024 bro I think we're gonna make it yeah we're gonna lose right to the right you know they can write you and do that don't waste your vote hey that's another thing I want to say before we get too far into this and every one of you needs to understand that they are intentionally trying to make you think this is gonna be a landslide okay yeah oh all the media outlets realize that they're behind and they realize that their only chance is to get the Trump voter base to not vote comfortable all right so what are they gonna do they're gonna threaten people with quote unquote potential terrorism on voting day they're also going to feed you a narrative that says Trump is so far ahead there's no way he can lose hoping that you will stay home and every single person in this audience needs to understand very clearly you have to vote all your friends have to vote all their friends have to vote and your job is to organize that your job is to call every single person that you know that is of like mine that wants to get this country back on track and get them to vote and make sure they vote okay I don't know what you gotta do have a party your house afterwards for everybody to vote get a get a get a team together take them all together and go out to eat make it a thing whatever you gotta do everybody has to vote because the next step besides the end of the world which I still think they might try to push through major disaster black swan event is going to be to instill overconfidence in the Trump base so that people don't vote they did the same exact thing in 2020 yeah the same thing well so it's the same play I mean it doesn't matter people have to be smart enough to understand what's being thrown at when they show you these Vegas betting lines that show Trump at 60 and you know come on at 38 yeah right shit like that do not believe that shit okay you didn't even know if that's real and if it is it still doesn't mean it's real if nobody votes okay so you have to vote and don't listen to these clowns out here saying oh I'm unsubscribing from the system and I'm not going to vote all right bro go live your life but shut the fuck up and quit trying to convince everybody not to vote the whole reason we're in this is because good Americans who believe in America have taken their eye off the ball productive Americans people who are contributing to society they're running businesses they're they're running careers they're building families they've taken their eye off the ball and it's been good in America for a long time and the reason it's got bad is because everybody was so busy living their lives so we need people to engage now and we need people to make sure that they go vote do not think that this is just going to happen because other people are going to do it that's how you fucking lose yeah 100 percent man this this next comment let's check this next comment from at John Barnes 43 72 he says as a white guy for Harris not only did I vote today but I drove my wife's boyfriend to

played Texas chase on ask her to huh headline number two hello number two reads Joe Biden and Barack Obama share tense exchange at Ethel Kennedy's funeral did you see this no so Bill Clinton Barack Obama and Joe Biden attended the service and delivered remarks Robert Kennedy Jr.'s mother Ethel Kennedy passed away last week she was 96 years old the memorial service was held in Washington DC at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle of Barack Obama and Joe Biden shared a tense exchange before the memorial service began now I have the clip here okay there's some church music going on in the background and you can kind of you know it's difficult to tell what was being said so let's watch the original clip because you know thanks to the the hope of AI we now have amazing technology so I'm going to show the the first clip this is the raw clip that was captured of the heated exchange let's watch this we can Joe Biden's face looks pissed perhaps some back we're actually the camera turns away very cryptic you Bill Clinton's like what the fuck you guys talking about Joe I Joe Biden promised to keep that bitch Pelosi away from me bro bro Joe Biden saying our brocks pissed because he realizes his 12 year reign about the end about the end and he's probably going to get held accountable for all the fucking bullshadys Brock this country yeah so let's check this let's check this clip out now this has some words over it to help us you know gather yeah we have we have special technology that we were able to use AI to extract the actual audio from this conversation yeah good jobs I had I know you brought that technology straight from 7-Eleven so we're gonna play that for you guys so it's Kamala doing okay nope she's down Joe I I think they found out that she's retarded now we're basically Trump is killing us up the polls so yes we're gonna lose Joe dammit wait wait what if I come back to run again as candidate yeah well uh let me put it this way Joe the only person in this world who is even more retarded than Kamala Harris he's basically you so no Joe you're not going back let's let it all play out okay let's just we'll talk later Joe okay women looking fine up in here you're clinton coming in clutch man say this thing women looking fine up in here now that is the actual audio now allegedly by say it the good job Z-Shine you the man got that technology straight out of India now I mean now listen now now there was how'd you get that how'd you get that no we have a billion people some people are talented you know they figured it out yeah they figured it out yeah good job India landed on the moon yeah this is our second accomplished second biggest three you guys land on the moon uh-huh you opened up the first 7-Eleven on the moon okay it's a huge deal yeah we keep forgetting our big deals you know that's because you're humble yeah very very humble people yeah this is what three step carry punch yeah now they extracted the true audio um what was that from this conversation just saying uh now in all actuality uh professional expert lip reader uh waited on this conversation according to the lip reader early in the conversation Biden said to Obama quote she's not as strong as me to which Obama replied I know that's true we have time Obama then said to Biden quote no that's not on to which Biden responded hmm from president added I think it's important that we can have some time together we'll take it at value Biden appeared to back his predecessor up saying yeah we'll get there in time Obama then turned his back to the camera again um it said something else to Biden to which the president responded uh-huh uh the conversation at the funeral was then interrupted by Bill Clinton who looked over at them and jesha toward the front of the cathedral um so that was definitely an interest in exchange okay now that was an expert lip reader who you know reviewed the he's really looking fine he raises everything um you know so that's interesting now there's some interesting things that is coming out the left uh do you see big mics back in uh big mics back in uh Obama uh are you not gonna be proving right after all I mean we got time listen if they read just listen listen listen bro if they fucking put her in right now they will win and this this could go on to the play that I said what did I say you said but did I not say that they will get super close and plug her in to pump the popularity and hopefully swing the fucking election I just thought it would be like 30 days now fucking fine you're right yeah no shit um yeah Michelle Obama she agrees to campaign for Kamala Harris after previously planning to stay away what are you gonna do get up there and fucking yell at everybody like she always does and shame everybody for being white and tell everybody the fucking racist that's all these people do it's pretty much it uh but yes she uh she plans uh we're all racist but you were the first lady and your husband was the president and you're so fucking oppressed and then we have uh uh uh Oprah sitting there right next to her who's worth like five billion dollars talking about how fucking oppressed they are right the fuck out of here it's bullshit um so that will be something to definitely keep on the uh the horizon um because she's supposed to be headlining uh rally in Atlanta on October 29th uh for the Kamala Harris campaign um so uh we'll be watching they fucked up by not putting her in I mean if they really wanted to stay in power they fucked up let her run the power eyebrow listen yeah she'll definitely fucking get there she'll get that ball across the go line she's all pro pro bowler hall fave listen man I try not I'm not gonna go there okay I'm just not I'm proud of you she has a dick allegedly this shows for educational purposes only that's a ledges speculation speculation sort of speculation on the testicles you know what expect it obviously I'm joking bro you really think so like for real I do bro no you really I genuinely do I genuinely do I don't know man I genuinely do I don't know I do you you think so absolutely you think that's a trans person yes miss miss when you were talking earlier about what her strategy would be swing that dick one thing I know you could old dick twist one thing from indian one thing that I know that is true of the black community dick twist in indian ah we actually haven't not developed that term yet we're in the process okay I'd say dick what you know my parents might listen but whatever the word is she has one oh yeah absolutely I don't know man she got a ban joke you think bro you guys I want I'm curious of what our audience thinks for real like no talking shit just say yes or no no no no talking shit no jokes because this is like a a joke everybody likes to say but like I know some people aren't really joking I'm just curious like do you actually think that that is a a man listen one thing that I know is true of the black community right is that every black woman when they are pregnant they take pictures there's now one picture of a pregnant Michelle Obama not one that is a mic drop statement is that true that is fucking I never like looked it is true well can soons my hands soons dig into this oh bro you know mark on markones wife is definitely a dude oh for sure over there in France for sure that's a fucking dude that's a man yeah I mean I think did you see the picture them on a boat they're on sailboat we had to buck break over I'm a bro buck break them buck breaking but oh have you ever heard of this actor Laverne Cox no this is from a movie recently she's been in different movies and stuff but oh that's a dude then you look at this do you say that that's a dude yeah I mean if you look closely you have suspicion but in general if I was passing on the street probably not and she sounds like that's a that's a dude looking chick though more masculine look at yeah and she sounds like a woman too so when you see this and you see her in pictures and videos and then you look at Michelle Obama your suspicion will go up like 200% that's a dude that is a dude okay so so Laverne Cox has a cock that's probably why she's called that probably bigger nearest dude probably probably nine inches bro how'd you like to get an argument with like a chick like that and then all of a sudden she whips it out and it's like fucking way bigger fuck yeah I'd have to kill myself you fold I have to yeah yeah I'd have to move the the other part on this though that was interesting that it just came out because obviously we got you know we're less than 20 days out we got what we're at 17 I think now you know or maybe plus or minus some days I'm not sure I'm at a meteorologist or I drank one of these yesterday and I was fucking right the rest of the day I'm not gonna lie and I slept good too you didn't keep me up I don't know why I need to say that that's good I'm starting to feel it that's why I was getting yeah yeah it's getting me kicking in but I want to bring this up man because I don't know if you saw this this is a start to make a big deal we know the elections you know we're a few weeks out from it now and it's very interesting things that are happening this thing that just came out James O'Keefe a meta engineer admits Facebook the modes anti-comal hair is post shadow bands conservatives now this is something we've all known this you know but it's interesting because you know Mark Zuckerberg has come out in recent months and you know try to make this stance of being this anti-bias person however this shit's still happening I I can tell you for sure it's happening on my account I got ding for Sharon Wilbates' video which was which was true did you see that video he posted no which one uh fuck I can't remember now but we all got ding for Sharon it and the track my traffic has been severely in the last like week severely fucking shut down yeah it's fucking bullshit man but yes the James O'Keefe claims that a meta engineer admitted in a candid interview with an undercover journalist with O'Keefe media group that Facebook demotes anti-comal hair is post oh well that's why because I make those every day yeah jivon uh guia wally a senior software engineer with meta appeared to reveal and a hidden camera interview uh that accounts uh posting anti-comal hair is content could be shadow band while the post gets demoted so i'm a titan the clip that he's uploaded I think he's actually not enough he's listened or heard he's trying to include more of like the the actual scene itself and not just clip certain stuff out um it's gotten better okay if yeah it's gotten better um but it is a tim in the clip we'll post it uh we'll link it on the website for you guys we'll just watch the first couple of seconds of this um for reference so your uncle in like for how you said something about like commoner hair is this uh anti-like you know is an outfit to be a president because he doesn't have a child okay that kind of city is automatic we can vote in that meet jivon guali a senior software engineer at meta are they doing a good job protecting our democracy because i can see these like right wing groups like setting up face uh instagram accounts or Facebook accounts for that matter right and just start posting this information be like oh like heiris is like blah blah blah that's all gonna be demoted 100% the city class is very strong the senior software engineer also goes on to say that quote the person would not be notified unquote if they were demoted because of their anti-kamala Harris post on meta and red listed that's a new term we just learned red listed meaning according to columnist dictionary things that are not permitted with the person who with the person who posted that be made would be not would he be notified that the person would not be notified but there's these things that we what you collect is like if a bunch of items that like if at least a couple of items that a person has created has violated civic pacifier and they're also registered our OMG American swiper so it's a response this gentleman who works at meta um he's in their communications department meta by the name of Andy stone he tweeted this out um in a response to another tweet saying meta has been public about the fact that we show less political content of all content to be points because users have told us they want to see less of that content in their feeds into uh Andy Stone replying again as a representative of meta saying quote exactly an undercover sting a.k.a. a date in which an engineer explains something meta has been public about for years we show less political content of all kinds and viewpoints because users have told us they want to see less of it now I don't think that's exactly what's happening here it's it appears to be a lot more sinister than that um and so it's very interesting at this time of recording uh you know there has been no official response from meta an official statement or anything like that or from Mark Zuckerberg um but you dive in just two seconds into Andy Stone's twitter um he list right in his bio everything that you know he uh all of his his interesting uh affiliations he has meta listed he says that he's an alumni of the house major pack senator boxer the D triple C and representative of McNerney um which the house majority pack their bio says working to win the democratic house majority by investing in races from coast to where the D triple C is committed to electing democrats to the US House representatives to mean it just doesn't seem very you know very bipartisan doesn't seem very you know that that for sure that's very you know that that's very fair and right in the middle well that's fine you got the communications director you know with those obvious uh attachments in his in his own bio it's insane now the last thing I want to point to you and again you actually mentioned this in cruiser comments section um but this you know potential black swan event and things like that you know we got the election coming it's very important and I want to uh push our attention to this article that I found um this article from politico magazine uh it's titled the unpredictable but entirely possible events that could throw 2024 into turmoil they say it's a collection of futurist uh political analyst and other progn progn progn prognosticators on the possible black swans of the presidential campaign all right and they list out a couple of things um they have a bunch of this is like one big collective article where all these different people chime in on what they think can happen um uh as a black swan within a month of the election all right now uh one of the things they they listed out here was a death at the Trump rally okay we had that right um and you know while they listed as a guy that you know potentially would suffer a heart attack or you know something like that you know from a protest that happened or something like that they also you know brought out uh mother nature wreaks havoc on the election um talking about a category five heritane that tears through the country just weeks before the election creating a climate versus christ binary in the electorate uh they talk about uh receiving some type of weird message from out of space and being contacted by aliens they talk about a digital apocalypse and so much more um how a massive black swan event could just be a digital outage they also talked about a violent attack on a candidate uh talking about whether it be illness or some type of injury happening to uh one of the uh the candidates um and what i thought was the most interesting thing about this article is that this article was written back in January of this year and a vast majority of those things that they have put out yeah have actually happened yeah but not as planned not as plan remember they weren't supposed to miss right trumps assassination right trumps supposed to die okay what would that have done to the country that would have been a to the world that would have been a massive black swan event that happened and it would have thrown the world into world war three immediately mm-hmm and that's into fucking civil war yeah with the weakest part of the population who can't defend themselves who just twitter and scream and pal and throw tantrums who have been calling for violence for years okay so cool um there's still potential for this and in my mind you know the things that we've talked about over the years um the things i've mentioned that you and i have mentioned would be another pandemic which they tried they if you remember they tried that early in september of last year they tried to get everybody to go back to mask mandates and shit and everybody said no we're not doing that so that didn't work war which we do have two major fronts happening right now we've got one in the middle east we've got one in Ukraine and although we aren't technically in the middle east war or technically in the Ukraine war to ask other people we are heavily involved mm-hmm so we got that but in my opinion um the most likely things that could happen between now and then to disrupt everything would be the digital apocalypse part where they just turn the power off and everybody's on their own for two weeks we wake up trumps been killed by Iran and fucking world war okay that would be very easy for them to pull off uh they would turn the power off they would drone strike trump or whatever they're gonna do and then they would blame it on around and they would we would be in war they would get what they want they got rid of trump and they have a war or they could come down to an actual uh terrorist attack that could happen a couple different ways one it could be a massive you know explosion at one of these events that eliminates trump and a whole bunch of trump supporters and a whole bunch of key people in his magaparty and then they say oh well around it it and they try to turn magabase into pro war to Iran they get rid of trump they get rid of trump's leadership and they get their war and distracting us all that that listen that is a real thing that is a rick if these people are who I think they are they are talking about that right now um um it could also be uh door to door style terror attack that is engaged by some sort of you know outside force or inside agency force that we see like 10 seven that happened in the misery is real last year where terrorists are going door to door and they're shooting people in their beds they're shooting people in their homes and there's enough military age males here that have been allowed across the border for that to be an option for these people and shipped across the country yeah so they're distributed right and so like dude you know I think that the people of this country need to be very aware the next few weeks and up until uh you know the inauguration of some major shit happening because these things don't necessarily have to happen before the election they can happen after the election too and um when you consider how Biden goes on TV just I think yesterday or the day before and says if Trump is killed by Iran we will consider that an act of war that's sort of reading the the quiet part out loud to what I'm saying right so I personally think that Donald Trump needs to be super fucking careful his people need to be super careful and I don't actually think him doing major rallies after the point of what we're doing is in my opinion is a good idea and is the best answer now do I think he's going to stop that no I don't because I think he's saying hey fuck you we're not going to bow down to you which is an admirable quality of a leader it shows fearlessness and it's great stuff what would it say to him if he said oh I'm nervous and I got to stay at my house he's not safe anywhere if we break it down to breaking it down right um but I just think they need to be really careful dude because I think these people are evil I think these people are committed and I think these people will stop at nothing from not having to give up power and that's just my personal belief yeah man guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that being said let's get to our third and final headline just quickly um the covering what's actually happening over there in the middle of the east because there's some bullshit happening um apparently allegedly the Hamas terror leader Yahya Sinwar was killed in Gaza um israel was saying through a strike that had happened um now Sinwar is allegedly the guy that was responsible for coordinating the 10-7 attack on israel um he was killed yeah he was killed um yinwar planned an execute of the October 7th massacre promoted his murderous ideology both before and during the war and was was responsible for the murder and abduction of many Israelis the statement added uh Yahya Sinwar was eliminated after hiding for the past year behind the civilian population of Gaza both the above and below grounds and Hamas tunnels in the Gaza strip um so you have that happen okay now um that just happened today at the time of the recording um you have Biden apparently is telling israel they have 30 days to address the humanitarian aid crisis that's happening in Gaza um you know he says that before they just bomb even more civilians to get this one guy um so that's fine um but i want to really turn our attention and focus to this portion here um US bombers just striked Yemen uh weapon facility um because again it's easy to say yeah the US is not really involved but this this happened today this happened today okay um our own bombers be two bombers um just made some very precise strikes against multiple weapon storage locations in Yemen um apparently attacking huti forces um US forces quote US forces targeted several of the huti's underground facilities housing various weapons uh components of types that the huti's have used the targets of villain and military vessels throughout the region secretary of defense Lloyd Austin the third said in a statement um he continues saying quote this was a unique demonstration of the United States ability not to target facilities that are adversary seek to keep out of reach no matter how deeply buried underground hardened or fortified um and he also went on to say that uh the attack was approved by president joe biden saying quote at the direction of the president Biden i authorize these targeted strikes to further degrade the huti's capability to continue the destabilizing behavior and to protect and defend us forces and personnel in one of the world's most critical waterways okay now that that sounds okay cool yeah i mean our ships have been getting you know attacked by drones and all these things that allegedly been coming out of uh you know this terrorist sale and group um and that's cool but one thing i really i thought was interesting in this out of all this noise and fog um you know it reminded me a week ago today actually um when israel uh they bombed the shot of bayrou right and the shrapnel that was pulled confirmed that it was our own ammunition that did it right this headline reads us made ammunition used in israeli strike on central bayrou shrapnel set uh shows um it killed 22 people and it's the first time that us made munition confirmed uh to have been used in a in a attack on central bayrou since 2006 um and i saw that and bayrou everybody knows that's in lebanon um i said man that's so interesting that that would happen to lebanon and we think along the same lines you know we know what their plans are their plans is to put us into chaos and you know demoralize us as a country and i and i saw this i'm like man that's so weird that they would do that to that country because we all know it creates more hostility towards americans right like those puking people hate us so if they hate us and we know that why the fuck would they let a thousands of them get tps status to come to this country well not all lebanese nationals hate the us i mean lebanese are pretty good people man yeah agreed yeah so i mean not all of they could discop vetting these people well i mean probably not and i'm just saying a statement okay we have to understand just like we as americans do not most americans do not feel represented by the united states government like when when they say over there in other countries we hate america they think it's all of us they think all of us are like the government all right and that's not true we all know that's not true most people are like hey our government sucks we're cool we like everybody else and that's the case with most countries dude most countries are just normal people like you and i and everybody else we know who we're trying to fucking make it man and we have a problem with tyrants globally all right it's not just here in america it's everywhere we as humans are highly oppressed people by the governments that quote unquote represent us and so when we talk about uh citizens of other countries i think it's super important for everybody to remember that their people just like us and just because they live in aron doesn't mean they hate americans just because they live in uh you know lebanon does not mean they hate americans it can mean that but it doesn't necessarily mean that and yes uh my point here is very simple we need to stop generalizing entire countries and and thinking of separately you know like there's people in the government and the government and you know it's the same here and so like dude i think everybody needs to remember that like we have this shit going on in the world where everybody's mad at everybody and everybody's killing everybody and like who's killing who are the people killing each other or is it the government's killing innocent people that's what's happening all right so you know is our government probably bringing in the worst people yeah they probably aren't it's not the americans that's our fucking government yeah it's fucking i think it's it's a hundred people at the top that are fucking it for everybody and that's how it is in every country dude like that's how it is yeah yeah i just made me nervous man because again there's no one on track record and who they've been given tps status is two it's just it's not very it just doesn't make me feel good to know that like i get no they're for sure listen you know i'm saying probably for sure according to their track record bringing in the worst possible people they can bring in so i don't disagree with you there i mean that's it's a speculation you know we don't know but yeah why are our weapons being used there why are why why are our weapons being used anywhere but to defend america right why is our bombers fucking bombing country well that's because it's financially good for all of these government officials not just in america but everywhere else to go to war yeah and they don't have to lose anything because their kids don't go and they make a lot of money and that's what we need to start understanding the let's let's just make it simple terms the kings of the countries because that's what the fuck they are they call them anything they want we're all living under a class system in this everywhere the kings of the countries all know each other and when they need to make money and they need shit to happen they call each other on the phone they say i'm i'm gonna send some rockets towards you and you're gonna send them back and then we're gonna do this it's coordinate effort these people are lawyers we have to break it down to how lawyers do business if you've never been involved in a legal conflict then you don't understand how lawyers do business so i'll explain it they all know each other and when you decide you're gonna have a conflict with another party the two lawyers call each other and generally they know of each other or know each other and they have a conversation the conversation goes like this hey my guy is really mad about this and then the opposing council says well my guy is really mad about this well how do you think we should do this well i think if we did it this step this step this step this step we can resolve the case and we can make the most money for us and that's what they do okay and that these people who run the governments are all lawyers and let's say all lawyers do that but that's a common practice that nobody talks about so when we look at like what's going on here these look at what's going on with israel and aron aron shoots a gazillion rockets right israel shoots back rockets but they go to like the desert right it's all theatrical posturing so that these motherfuckers can start a war where our kids and our families and our brothers and our dads and our moms and our sisters get fucking killed while they get rich and that's what's going on because hey we need more rockets now correct and that's what the deal is and that that's why these motherfuckers love war because it doesn't affect them and it makes them rich and if that were you you'd probably love it too if you were if you were a piece of shit like them okay these people don't have any empathy for us to think that these governments of any sort to think that israeli government cares about the israeli citizens is ludicrous okay and you say that for any government and it's people the united states government does not care about you the israeli government does not care about people that live in israel all right the people who live in england do you think that their government cares about you look at your fucking country you guys in irland do you think that they care about you look at your country they don't care all right and we continue to be told that there's something wrong with us that we need to be more tolerant that we need to be you know accepting of all of the shit that they know fuck them they tell us that because that's what they're trying to do but we all know we don't like it and we don't say shit because they use cancel culture and social shaming and all of these things now they're putting people in jail and you're up for fucking saying shit about anti trans think about this for a second a person who says that that is a man and not a woman when you have a man dressed up and women's clothes and they simply say that they say you are not a woman you are a man which is the provable factual truth they're being put in jail bro that's where we are as a as a as humanity right and this this idea that these people care about us at all has to be replaced with the truth and the truth is these people hate us and they use us and they use us to line their pockets and and they make us miserable for their benefit and that is the fucking truth for every single mother fucking government and the entire world man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with the exception of maybe El Salvador with this new guy and El Salvador I really like that guy amila no El Salvador he's Argentina yeah I know he's a man the young guy with the he's only 42 or 43 yeah that guy cares about his fucking people yeah outside of that I haven't seen anybody okay yeah man guys jump in on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck now this we're bringing headline and talk about it get one of those two options and speaking of love and equality and acceptance and dude's dressed in women's clothing our thumbs up or dumb as fuck out on reads bachelor at star Josh cedar says he faked transgenderism to expose gullible and delusional woke left do you see this yeah I told you this guy was fake and we were watching his videos in here and I was like that guy's full of shit bro he's fake he's trolling did we really yeah I mean you guys great yeah he's fucking awesome uh Josh cedar a farmer contestant on the bachelor at as claimed he faked being a transgender to expose how gullible and delusional the left is cedar made a shocking and bizarre revelation while speaking on Alex Stein on his blaze TV podcast he came out as transgender in may of this year and claims he did it to highlight how quote gullible and delusional the left is says quote I think a lot of trans women are turned on at the thought of themselves being women guess what it doesn't magically make them women cedar said we live in a free country you can do whatever you want but don't make your fetish my truth I don't have to accept it so here's the clip of cedar on that interview let's check this out the thought of themselves being women and I think a lot of trans women are turned on at the thought of themselves being women guess what it doesn't magically make them women it doesn't mean we have to accept that they're women they are simply men turned on at the thought of themselves being women that's great we live in a free country you can do whatever you want but don't make your fetish my truth I don't have to accept it to go to the second part of your question how did I come up with this I was talking with some friends and we said this is patently false men do not magically become women I said let's look at the medical literature and what it says it says that trans people don't have to transition don't have to have gender dysphoria don't have to get surgery and don't have to get hormones if they feel they are a different gender than their biosex then they are trans and they are valid and I said understandably this is ridiculous then I can present exactly how I am and I can be trans and valid if I say that's my gender identity and so I said let me prove how ridiculous this is using Reduxio ad absurdum by being trans for five six months and hopefully people will understand then how ridiculous this is I definitely understand how ridiculous it is but so so those were same chairs I got my office yeah that's sweet you see that they are recognizing same exact chair I know where you got them from where mate neither oh yeah yeah I love this guy who Alex I know they're both they should both come on the show at the same time I got Alex's number yeah text them and say what the fuck yeah get your fucking ass on here yeah yeah I done it's a good looking jacket too everybody it looks pretty good but here it's here it's here it's in big booty latinas and I'm checking up for these his success rate is high I think he does all right yeah but so here's a video that Josh first posted when this happened let's check this out hey everyone I just wanted to jump on here and show my appreciation for everyone that has been supported with me loving kindness goes such a long ways I wanted to play softball this year I wasn't sure if that was a reality if that was something that was gonna happen given my transition so I went to my park district wasn't sure how they're gonna react but I was able to sign up for the women's softball team no problem no questions asked the women were super nice chatted it was it just made me feel so warm so accepting and it just filled me up with joy um that people can be like that um and I just wanted to say a little bit of kindness goes such a long ways so to everyone that's been kind that's been loving um thank you um and I look forward to a long summer of games and hopefully some home runs and some fun with the girls so anyways thank you all for those who have supported me I love you so much bye everyone now beyond is like the like these fucking crazy but they ate that shit up too oh yeah they were all in there you're so brave you're so brave yeah that's the tagline you're so strong you know what's funny dude all those women that say that shit they they don't even believe the shit they're just saying it because it's politically correct anyway hey I got dude if you're not watching this on the fucking YouTube you got to go watch this on YouTube yeah look at that guy that guy's like a masculine dude I mean that was him on the bachelor yeah bro he just became way more famous yeah oh for sure maybe I should do this this is a good idea Andrea yeah Andrea Andrea yeah hey listen man um you know hey it's pretty funny and it's true it does expose all the hypocrisy look dude this motherfucker is the trans ideology is a communist tactic okay this has happened before in history this happened in 1930s Vimer Republic it's a communist tactic communist did it then too okay they want you they want to demoralize and destabilize society so much so that nothing is true and nothing is real and everything is up for argument and what that does is that creates a scenario where people don't know what's true don't know what's not true they can't decide it creates chaos and what that does is that allows a new set of standards a new set of cultural values to be installed that is how they put communism into place and then they kill all the dissenters that is what fucking communism does so this trans ideology is a communist tactic that's been installed intentionally into our culture over the last 20 years to demoralizing destabilize our country other countries make fun of us and laugh at us about this shit and we should be you know realizing what this actually is the reason that the United States of America can't understand what this actually is bros because we haven't experienced this ever in America before other countries have experienced this in many different ways before they recognize it that's in their history but correct yeah so you know we're over here because dude you gotta be real dude if they could convince someone to question whether what makes a man and what makes a woman what can they not get them to question right like that's a fundamental base truth probably the most fundamental basic truth of humans that's a man that's a little kids know it right so they can pull that out and replace it with something that is you up to your discretion they can remove and change anything then get you to believe anything then get you to to to think anything is true or go along with anything and that's what that trans ideology about it's not about it's not even about kindness or love or respect or all these other shit it's not about people feel uncomfortable in their skin or none of that shit it's a man-made cultural phenomenon that is done to destabilize this country and it and it's worked pretty well and so you know I think it's important for people to understand what that actually is versus what they think it is and you know I think it's good to expose the hypocrisy and the ludicrous mentality of the people who just fall over this shit like it's you know oh my god you're so brave it's what Aaron Elmore said when she came on the show that virtual they're out virtue signaling each other yeah you know and I mean I I actually think like as funny as this is and it's as comical as it is and we all had a fun time watching it I actually think it's super important work like it's it's super important to expose the hypocrisy and the lies that are being put into the culture and society I'm sorry dude you were born one of two genders and that's that that is that that is the end of the story and if you are a feminine man that doesn't make you a woman if you are a masculine woman that doesn't make you a man you're still a woman you're still a man and that's that you know and you're confused you're also a compliment you listen it's do I have empathy for these people because they're you know they think they're this or that yeah for sure bro but like real talk that is a mental problem it just is yeah it's a mental problem and I know that probably hurts some people's feelings or whatever but like dude at the end of the day like he said we cannot compromise our own integrity and our own truth to appease someone else because when we do that we are violating our own core beliefs and when you violate your own core beliefs and your own core truths the feeling and the respect that you have for yourself goes down all right so when people say well just go along with it because it's not hurting you know it actually is hurting me to go along with it because you're forcing me to say and believe and act in a way that goes the opposite direction of what I know to be true and when I do that when I lie to myself and I make compromises to myself my self belief myself esteem my confidence in myself my integrity everything that I see myself to be goes down and that's intentional that's intentional they want people to think less of themselves just like they want people to be fat so that they'll be sick so they could sell them more medicine they could sell them they put chemicals in the food and make you addicted to the food like this is all I know people have a hard time connecting the dots guys but this is all related yeah yeah so shout out to Josh yeah bro come on the show tell us about your yeah experience I want to hear like did he actually go out and public and do this or did he just make videos no he he I think he actually went and signed up for the softball team well I don't I want to know how committed he was to the to that role you know what's and yeah all right man well guys Andy I mean he certainly makes a better dude than a oh no that yeah for sure um yeah he got the gay boys down it does have that down he must have read that article that we read yesterday he sounds smart as shit too yeah of course he is we're using big words yeah um well guys Andy that is all I got guys last thing I want to say okay it is very very important that we understand that we are on one team and those people are on another meaning the the tyrants at the top and they want us to be mad at each other they want us to be angry at each other they want us to hate each other the the opposite is what we need to be doing we need to be unifying we need to be working together we need to be the antithesis of what they promote that we should be when they show you that you should be this average fat hot dog eating dude you need to be fit bro okay when they show you that pounding alcohol seven days a week is how you should be you need to understand that you need to do the opposite all right they're trying to make us weaker they are trying to make us hate each other they want you fat so that you'll buy the food and you'll you'll have to be served by the medicine they want you stupid so they can give it to you a shit you got to work to educate yourself they want you broke you got to make money they want you all all the things that they promote you to be you need to work to be the opposite and the number one thing that we need to work on right now is coming together as Americans and saying we're not following further shit anymore and I see that happening more and more but remember this is up to you on a personal level this is about treating other people respect it's about being kind to each other it's about helping each other when they need help it's about picking each other up when we're down it's about helping each other win this comes down to how well we are going to work together and those people that live up the street that you think are your enemy are not your enemy okay that neighbor of yours who you know maybe does a little bit different than you do that's not your enemy bro we are all on the same team here we have to be ambassadors of that because they are going to turn the volume up on the division they are going to turn the volume up on the cast and it's going to be very important that we are unified and that we do not comply with whatever they have coming towards us all right and the other thing is we have to vote we have to get out and vote we have to not buy into the idea that this is going to be a landslide victory we should be voting like we're 30 points behind okay that's how we have to play the game so when they say oh Trump's going to win in the landslide that only happens if people vote so make sure you are voting make sure your family is voting make sure your friends are voting make sure that everybody you know votes because if they don't we are in deep shit all right so that's my message be cool be kind be a good example and make sure you vote on bank road can't vote there's a note here shot case closed closed
