it yeah super glue your hands yeah yeah where you know I this is a road legit question though why don't like why isn't there more of a call for like meteorologist so you're fucking fired bro and strung up by their fucking feet they're always wrong I don't even know like do they serve a purpose anymore that's what I'm saying bro like I'm in the wrong line of work for that be wrong and still get paid I can't look what I mean you that far off that happens yeah I just use that I just use that yeah you you are your own meteorologist yeah yeah I'm digging to that there you are yeah then you pay like fucking you got the five thousand dollar level rate on I just get the premium weather apps I like to know what's going on man yeah that's right there's nothing wrong with that man I think in the Midwest dude it's pretty smart we gotta have it yeah you gotta like dude there could be a tornado 300 yards away you don't know what's going on no not at all not at all yeah no we get we get weird weather here man yeah don't move here definitely no anyway what's happening yeah not much man guys don't forget pay the fee yeah as always don't be a whole chair the show but yeah no it's a dark day dark the man I see I was born it's gone man dude we were just talking about just talking about this last week or week before yeah it was like recently like two weeks ago because you did a show yeah did that last last rights is what he called it literally was just last right I think like I mean I don't know this might be too far like where do you think he went do you think he would ever down I don't know as you see like pretty good dude bro I mean if you ask like traditional Christians they're gonna start to have yeah they're straight you know if you ask if you ask new Christians that just discovered the Bible within the last year you know those are the most judgmental kind because they take the word very literally which you know um it teach their own yeah I think you got it I think ultimately you're judged on how well you treat people what your intent is you know are you a good person or are you not and do you live it you know I think there's a lot of people that fucking you know I guess what I'm trying to say is we're in dark makeup and going on stage and singing about things doesn't necessarily disqualify you from doesn't make you a bad human no yeah yeah sure a lot of people looked up to them too yeah family guys it's not just that dude it's it's but like the religious the religious zealotry that's happening right now in the world it's like it's it's off-putting you know what I mean um you know one of the things about Christianity that bothers me is how the new the people that are new to it take it upon themselves to preach so heavily and so aggressively to everybody else and all of a sudden you know they were out doing all kinds of fucked up shit snort and coke off boners and you know what I'm saying like doing all this wild-ass shit yeah stealing shit fucking half-ass in their whole life which by the way half-ass in your job is stealing just so you know um and then all of a sudden they're you know yeah they're they're they're newly discovered and washed away of all their sins and now they're better than you but they're gonna tell you about it yeah I would be funny look because like I can imagine like you know obviously I hope he's fine I'm sure he is but it's just imagine he does go down there you know you called him the Prince of Darkness like having that combo with Satan he's like oh really they did a South Park episode with it with him didn't they we're like he's down there like Saddam Hussein or some shit I think some like that yeah I don't think hell is like what people think it is bro I think we're actually in it like this this is yeah I think we're in it right now yeah yeah I think we're in it right now I think the struggle the fucking pain the hardship the lessons in terms of the way people treat each other like dude it's hard to believe you're not in it when you see it okay for governments to kill a hundred thousand fucking children and nobody do anything you know like it's hard to believe that that you know that's not where we are yeah when we look around a lot of times not saying there's not good parts of it but for sure you know it's when you really look at what's going on you know in my opinion dude like you really look at what's going on dude you know it's easy to look past all the evil but there's a fucking lot of it and and it's easy to like put the blinders on and pretend it's not there I'm just not able to do that yeah and it makes it uh not fun a lot of times you know what I mean I wish I wish I could I almost which I could be ignorant to everything going on but yeah dude I that's what I think I think we're in it yeah yeah well he's gone man 76 yeah crazy train I think that's the only song I know of his no you know a lot of this songs you just don't know what they're called is that what it is yeah what's like top three crazy trains like what he's most known for though right yeah yeah well I don't know Iron Man's pretty famous I've never heard of it's the song pretty much everybody who plays guitar starts playing when they start oh you know a lot of a shit bro also you probably don't know he was the head the lead singer black Sabbath I don't know that yeah so like all the black Sabbath songs are fucking Aussie too really yeah huh bro he's an icon yeah not real talk I remember his just you know I know he did yeah bro he's I don't know that was cool yeah I always liked him dude I thought he I thought he was a wild dude he's a rock star fucking entertainer bro like it's what it is you you entertain you know you're a character yeah fucking entertainment you know like Nickelback yeah yeah me's wearing a cross bro yeah I mean I mean I mean you're definitely holy it's right there you know it's like those the only fans chicks were the fucking cross while they're doing their videos and shit it's like what are you doing stop it if you think about that yeah man well RIP to the man himself man how's the Osborne man that's crazy yeah um well yeah let's get into some uh some coverages let's do it let's let's take a stroll um cruise yeah a lot a lot of a lot of things to cover yeah um let's do it guys remember if you would like to see any of these articles pictures links videos go to Andy for sale.com we link them all there for you guys do your own research um that being said it's gonna to our first set of headlines and um because there's been some interesting updates with this uh we covered this on the CTI plus a few days ago Tulsi Gabbard coming out um and she had a pretty big statement to make I think to the world it was it was a big statement um calling the you know basically Obama administration Obama single handedly accusing him of treasonous conspiracy um and saying that you know the implications of this are frankly nothing short of historic and she released about a hundred documents of this they've all been declassified um I'm sure by now everybody has seen the stuff she posted them all on a Twitter um and uh you know she kind of finished it up saying you know she's uh you know these documents detail a treasonous conspiracy by officials at the highest levels of the Obama White House to subvert the will of the American people and try to usurp the president from fulfilling his mandate this betrayal concerns every American the integrity of our democratic republic demands that every person involved be investigated and brought to justice to prevent this from ever happening again um and then finishes by saying that she uh quote I am providing all documents to the department of justice to deliver the accountability the president trump is family and the american people deserve um which has been confirmed at this time the oj did receive uh Tulsi Gabbard's criminal referral um for all of that um and you know it's so interesting to see you know when these things happen I know a lot of people line the call and it's just uh you know a smoke screen look here not there don't worry about the Epstein stuff let's talk about this right you guys want to rest here some you know let's talk about that right um but it is interesting because I think you know and this has been a trend you always watch um who's not talking who's not saying anything right um and like typical none of the legacy media outlets are are covering um you know this this development this bombshell that's coming out that's accusing their main man of committing treason you know I'm saying like they're not covering at all and when they do to cut when they do cover it um of course they point fingers and put it on anybody else um and so that's interesting you know but then things got spicy okay it got spicy because today at the white house trump is meeting with the president of the Philippines um and while they were talking in the oval office journalist asking some questions um and trump says Obama is guilty of treason uh for ordering the 2016 Russian investigation saying they tried to steal the election let's check this clip out from your perspective who should the DOJ target as part of their investigation what specific figures in the Obama administration? well based on what I read and I read pretty much what you read uh it would be president Obama he started and Biden was there with him and Komi was there and Clapper the whole group was there Brandon they were all there in a room right here this was the room this is much more beautiful than it was then but that's okay I have nice pictures up they came out of the vaults they were there for hundred years this is much more beautiful we have the declaration of independence now in the room which wasn't here I guess people didn't feel too good about putting it here but I do but you know what if you look at that those papers they have a stone cold and it was president Obama it wasn't lots of people all over the place it was them too but the leader of the gang was president Obama Barack Hussein Obama have you heard of him and except for the fact that he gets shielded by the press present our life that's the one they look he's guilty it's not a question you know I like to say uh let's give it time it's there he's guilty they this was treason this was every word you can think of they tried to steal the election they tried to obfuscate the election they did things that nobody's ever even imagined even in other countries you've seen some pretty rough countries this man has seen some pretty rough countries but you've never seen anything like it that's pretty heavy coming from the man again like I mean I talked to me to immediately my knee jerk you know I'm not my knee jerk I think most people's knee jerk reaction this is bread crumbs it's not meeting anything I would like to point out this is the first time whoa whoa whoa what do you mean bread crumbs meaning like this is you know like it's a smokes ring it's just them just throwing some bones you know trying to cover up all the other stuff but I think the biggest difference in this though is like this is the first time that specific names are being called out in the same sentence as treason by people who are high up like this coming from the president coming from the d and I like to put Barack in the same sentence as committing treason in the same sentence that's a big deal to me that's not a little bitie brick it's how I look at and now whether they follow through on that we could talk about that but to me this is not a small thing by no means no I totally agree dude I think as always there's a lot of possibilities that could be going on here all right and the knee jerk responsibility for everybody is that he didn't release the Epstein list and so now he's throwing all this shit out there to try and like distract people right like the MLK file just came out got that later okay um you know Tulsi comes out with this I know Tulsi I actually talked to Tulsi somewhat regularly she's a wonderful human being a good human being this is not breadcrumb this is real and I do not think that if it's up to her she's going to stop this all the way to the end that's my personal opinion she's a true patriot she's running this she understands what the fuck is going on she understands what's been going on so I don't see it as you know a breadcrumb thing I think people we have to get smarter dude and we have to be able to zoom out to look at the whole picture of what's going on and the Epstein list is already out there if you want to know who's on the Epstein list you could find that on the internet the flight logs are out there the pictures of people together are out there the there's tons and tons and tons of information that will give you the list you're asking the wrong question okay the list doesn't matter what matters is the exposure of the blackmail right why were they on the list why were they on the list what were they directed to do what was their role how did it become that those are the things that people should be asking for not what's on the list or these are just petafiles that like these are general arguments that are easy to deflect from these people okay when they say when Trump says oh there's nothing on the Epstein list that you don't know that's because it's been out for a long time and you could find it and those of us who have been watching this story for the last 10 years have seen the flight logs and we know who the fuck is involved and it's all out there all right what people should be asking is what I said what does this mean who was blackmailed what intelligence agencies were involved and what is the purpose and that's what they're not going to release at least right now at least right now and the reason they're not going to release it which I completely fucking disagree with is that it will crumble the entire power structure of almost every western government in the world okay because this isn't just the United States this is all of the European countries it's all of the countries in NATO it's all the countries that belong to the world economic forum it's all the countries that belong to the World Health Organization it's all the countries that you know the readers go to fucking Davos and build a bird and all this shit okay that's correct but hold on I'm gonna get there all right I'm gonna get there about the Mossad thing so there's a couple possibilities here one Trump is directing the arrest and release of all this treasonous information that we all knew was going on we all knew was going on oh I was 20 years old when Obama got elected I wanted him to do well so I did I vote for him but I thought about it I did I mean I'm cool I did I did I also like Bill Clinton was an office okay they were relatable guys at that time we were we could reasonably discuss a little bit looser social standards that made sense right like I didn't give I don't I still don't I don't give a fuck if gay people get married I think they should be able to get married etc etc etc um and these are the policies that he kind of ran on so it was like it was it was more like be cool yeah you know what I'm saying like that was his vibe and I wanted him to do well but the minute he got in dude he changed he didn't do his big campaign of hope and change um he started giving away a bunch of free shit okay he started implementing practices of socialism he started intentionally racially dividing people which we saw very clearly front row here in St. Louis Missouri during Michael Brown okay Michael Brown was a fucking criminal Obama made him sound like he was Jesus and it divided the country it started this racial tension that we got to deal with for the last decade yeah he lit that fire 100% intentionally and he also did it he also when those six Dallas police officers got killed he also did it then too people don't remember that there was a big shootout uh with with the Dallas police officers and he made it racial when it shouldn't have been racial at all and uh anyway I watched all this happened and a lot of people don't remember this but I do and when we started to see Trump kind of come along and start to campaign for president these people got very confident they were laughing there's clips all over the internet of all these people laughing when they say Donald Trump they're Donald Trump's never gonna be president he's not gonna be president time hangs was saying it Clooney was saying it um it were popping champagne bottles at Hillary Clinton they were making fun of them dude like they they roast them in public and now looking back it's very easy to see what happened what happened was they were in control of the election they missed judge the amount of votes they needed to fucking pull off the win and Trump won yeah and they couldn't fucking hide it so it fucked up their whole plan for the next 10 years have had Hillary won that election we'd already be in the great uh the the project project 2030 now it would already been happening yep okay um so when we look at it and start to break this down when Trump started to come into office you know and then he won the election a month later they're coming out saying Russia rigged the election and then they ran that narrative and then Hillary Clinton has been proven to have created the steel dossier which made it look like Trump was colluding with Russia this entire time and doing all this treasonous shit and then you know in 2020 they did another they said oh well it was found that that was not false and then that it was false and then they ran with it for another four fucking years after they already said it was false so for eight years they ran this fake narrative that that Trump was a Russian asset that peached the dude over dude they in the times where they tried to impeach them three times yeah like dude we have you know this coordination with the media and the celebrities and you know the music influencers and pretty much everybody saying the same things and then we're starting to look at and be like why are they all saying the same things why are we seeing videos of news anchors and media personalities and actors and famous people saying the same lie how are they doing that and then this Epstein shit starts to come about okay so in my mind what's happening here is still what I think is happening I think that we're dealing with a very real threat against the United States to not allow this blackmail ring to come to the top of the surface and I think the people calling the shots which isn't Donald Trump are going to throw Obama and Hillary and all those people under the bus for treason to get the focus off of this bigger this bigger blackmail ring right so that's how that's the possibility that I'm seeing right now that I think is most likely based off what I'm seeing I think the blackmail thing is because it's bigger than trafficking it's bigger than these you know prostitutes it's bigger it's bigger than any of this shit it's the way the world is fucking controlled and they aren't willing to let that be known okay and I don't think it's a coincidence that Netanyahu comes to Washington DC and the next day Trump saying the Epstein list is bullshit right right right and so I think first of all people need to start asking the right questions instead of talking about the Epstein list or the child trafficking because we don't even really know about child trafficking that speculation there's not a lot of proof of that people say oh there's 800,000 kids yes I'm talking about proof tied in through this exact operation regarding children it's not there there's more proof that shows this hey we got girls on the island that might have been borderline or you know a year or two underage who we got on video a couple guys we control their shit you know I'm saying but like it's not there's no proof of these eight year old kids being sacrificed to fucking Jeffrey Epstein's whatever these stories right right so it's an easy thing to dismiss those things not saying it didn't happen I'm saying it's easy to dismiss so when I see all of this bro what I see is yeah I mean I guess it would be a breadcrumb but I think it's a real thing I think they intend on doing it but we'll find out we'll see it could be total bullshit it could be fucking it could be they are legitimately just saying this shit and do we'll never do anything about it what we need to watch is what they do what Obama does what Hillary does like if they start fucking flying to some other country non-next yeah probably not a good idea yeah probably not good but I saw well Obama just released a statement I saw that yeah he's I got the statement here he released it I think Newsweek was the first to cover it but Obama's office said in the statement quote out of respect for the office of the presidency our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this white house with a response but these claims are outrageous enough to merit one these bizarre allegations are ridiculous and they weak attempt at distraction quote nothing in the document issued last traction from what yeah right right Obama right all right quote nothing in the document issued issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes these findings were affirmed in a 2020 report by the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee led by then chairman Marco Rubio that was a statement that was a statement and so you know but but again he's like that's not even that's not really addressing what was actually released because one you're totally lying one because the actual proof completely goes against everything he just said yeah they manufactured it at his direction yes at no direction yeah so you're saying that here's what is well affirmed in the report yet you made fucking exist here here's what happened he said go find some shit they couldn't find it they came back and he said go find some shit and make sure you come back with some shit right and they did and that's what happened it happened it happened over the course of two or three days yeah and and by find some shit what that means is Hillary Clinton making up his stuff pays somebody to fucking create something that was also Christopher steel not fucking true and that's what they found yeah you know and so I mean dude and let's let's be let's just remember what they've done okay they there's no trust in the election process anymore zero okay there's no trust in the government anymore there's no trust in any of these people anymore at all and it's by design that's what demoralization destabilization is about it is about removing nationalism removing identity removing personal pride and then destabilize in the government by removing trust and there's no question in my mind that Obama is a 100% treasonous snake that's and I don't think any of those people that Trump mentioned could defend themselves against the things that they've done yeah and they've done it all for their own ego bro like what what do you guys think what would it take for you to believe that you get to make the decisions for the entire country even if that means not following the processes that have been operating and in place for 250 years what what kind of ego what kind of elitist are you to even think that so Hillary Clinton Obama and this group of people sit around and they believe we know better than them we're gonna make these decisions for our benefit fuck those peasants that's what's going on but and now on top of that too and you're also gonna look at like you know this came out this was 2016 this was this first term how much shit was held up all of it prevent it yeah could have been better could have been accomplished that wasn't simply because of this bullshit all of it so I mean that alone you know I'm saying dude we went through fucking hell for those four years yeah how much better could this country have been had this shit not going on not only that bro they they divided us every which way every possible change yeah you know I'm saying it's like that alone by itself warrants bro they fucking let covid loose on the world to try and stop this shit bro people people lost their entire lives work people lost their family they lost their friends they had to watch loved ones die on fucking zoom to hide these people's lives these people this is this isn't like oh you know they they we have whistleblowers from the White House which we covered on this show before who straight up said that the people running the Biden administration believed that they had a moral and ethical obligation to make the decisions they felt were the best regardless of what the America people thought about it regardless if it was within the lines of the law or the constitution or anything so yeah dude these people are traders 100% and typically through history traders are dealt with very specifically very painfully very brutally to set a example so that these things don't happen again and that's what needs to happen here bro yeah that's what needs to happen and needs to happen to the whole group they all need to be dealt with they all need to be you know handled publicly painfully impermanently and and to set a an example for people not to do this shit again you know I mean you think about the hardship and the chaos and the frustration and the the division and the arguments and the the financial loss and all of these things that have happened over the last 10 years or so because very simply these people didn't want to give up their power that's fucking terrible bro you know what I mean these people are bad people they're not good people yeah so you know when we look at the whole thing yeah it could be a breadcrumb it could be it could be they'd rather give that up than give this up but the the risk they run giving that up is those people squealing now so like this whole situation is very volatile and it's going to be interesting to see what happens 100% man guys we want to know what your thoughts is on this situation let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that being said man it's a gruesome comment shall we I'm not even sure if this is a real person princess big kitty princess big kitty yep okay your beef sticks make my mouth water thank you I don't know how to respond to that all right yeah 10 bucks it was quiet no I don't think so that does look like Keith's cat actually that might be that's Keith's cat the let's get this Keith princess big kitty yeah all right cool thank you yeah this next one jersey chick USA you got to love these clowns who act like they know what it's like to be the fucking president of the United States they sit there doing podcasts and their fucking basement critiquing him it fucking kills me oh yeah this is a nice basement I'm in my basement I'm actually in this this is not in the basement it's a nice basement this is in one of three buildings that we have here in St. Louis Missouri total of around 800,000 square feet you know from a business that I built from scratch uh starting with zero dollars on day one and uh you know now we employ thousands of people and I'm rich bitch so I don't I actually do know what it's like to run a whole bunch of shit and not just talk shit out of my mouth's basement now I could appreciate that most of the people that you watch are probably unqualified to speak on such things but I would say I'm more qualified the most and probably more qualified the most of the people in Washington because I've run much bigger shit than fucking any of them with the exception of a couple so jersey chick USA uh yeah I don't know what to tell you is this do we when do we ask for the hot pockets like when do we give it to the fuck yeah I don't know yeah like they know what it's like to be president of the United States uh I'm like real talk bro I know what it's like more than I know what it's like more than fucking Obama new when he got elected and more than fucking Biden knew when he got elected and uh more than probably almost any of these motherfuckers know Trump's the only one I could think of out of the last fucking however many that's run something bigger than I ran it yeah George Bush did but he inherited this shit so uh I think I'm a lot more qualified than most lady maybe you should do your homework for you smout off your stupid shit yeah I agree to another cap person why do we have a lot of cap people it's probably because we we probably she probably doesn't like that we are actually holding Trump to the fucking account you know I'm saying like people because we get both that's

right here for you guys so buckle up by the cups admin Trump admin releases over 200,000 mok junior assassination files so another to see Gabard uh disclose your here she post she tweeted this out on Twitter uh to see Gabard reveal in a post then included 230,000 mok assassination files were um that were documents that were included uh included details regarding the FBI's investigation into the assassination of mok um as well as internal FBI MMO's detailing the process progress of the case along with other information um this was her tweet posted it out now here's the thing so I took some time uh to to scroll through these and you know I put I do have some interesting things from it um but uh you know it was so funny because I can immediately came out that like oh uh he released it despite mok's family's opposition to it right which was so interesting because you know aji bondy she actually tweeted this out with the one of now this is uh doctor Alvita king um and uh they had like a little lunch and spent some time before it was released and so it's like you know I wonder who who exactly they were talking about that were pissed off at this um but nevertheless we have it they have a whole website on the national archives set up for you here's my issue okay because and then this is this is truly what bothers me like does this meet the requirements of transparency yeah well you could you could argue yes sure it's all released right very very little summarized it or anything it's what the fuck it is my issue it's not categorized it's poorly labeled you don't know like bro 230 thousand fuck like I had my head my head should be pretty easy to do now because you just uploaded into fucking AI and it was fucking summarized it yeah for sure um you know but it's like 230 thousand fucking documents you know I'm saying like that's a lot and there's no system like where I have the tap set to like you know 200 pages per fucking thing there was still like 30 something fucking pages of this stuff like it's a lot man it's a lot um but there was some interest in stuff that I was able to skim through I was kind of just going through and uh and I did find some stuff that I thought was pretty interesting um and the first thing being this document here I won't link this stuff for you guys again on the website um St. Louis is actually tied into this quite a bit too uh our city actually um but this was uh this was an FBI member memo that was put in um where they are disclosing how one of uh MLK's confidants blatantly started to call out and say directly that not only was MLK assassinated by what he believed was a CIA uh CIA operation I'm in conjunction with the FBI but also JFK in president Kennedy um and he called it out um he did so at an address at a conference um his name is FS uh fair uh it's about FERRE he's a prominent theologian in publicist um but he expressed uh concern with the growing power of the CIA in the US um as an example he said uh and he put in here specifically I tried to look it up he was alluding to the um the deep state is essentially what they were what he was referring to um and said that they were clearly responsible for the assassination of martyluth the king and senator robert kennedy and have been involved in the death of president john f kennedy um and this is the FBI's memorandum because they had people at all of these conferences um and all of these speeches following king and all of that stuff before and after his death by the way um and uh and they you know they're in there's been more they're saying that because of this guy's prominence he's listed as a who's who his remarks apparently were not challenged by the Baptist students and he was growing um getting a lot of people on board with his his his theories of what he believed has happened and now he was on a list of people to watch right um there was a lot of documents like 230,000 I pulled out just a couple um this was another memo on the same guy he did it again they they they every time this guy spoke about it it was documented um when he was calling these people out and then something why do you think that is you think it's because it was bullshit right right you think the CIA would keep records on somebody that was just full of shit right right well this final one this was the most interesting there's a guy his name is victor marchetti um he was actually a CIA agent uh who handled and clandestine operations um he uh left the CIA and became basically a public whistleblower if you will um and he wrote this document um he wrote a couple of these like blogs on those um on the JFK assassinations new developments um because there was a lot of intertwining between JFK and mok's assassination um but he wrote this um which was basically outlining what he believed that this was the CIA um a full blown CIA operation and how the CIA even threw under the bus a couple of their agents to cover up all of this shit um him being almost one the crazy thing about this um is that this guy after he released maybe five of these some how some reason completely decided to out of nowhere we can't everything and say none of it happened it was all bullshit it was all made up um just out of the blue after he was you know pretty hard i mean these are multiple pages of of these uh blogs that he put out um but saying that uh they yeah it was all the CIA the CIA did it now it was interesting because you know like you know that's been and there's some files on mok that are still out there for sure that you guys can find um you know but it's it is important to note here you know and again was mok a great guy sure did he say some great things of course right but we have to be very very clear these are for these are faxas is not DJ's opinion or theory the FBI saw mok jr as a communist threat okay that was there that's the reason that they were following him okay that's why they had 200 000 pages and documents and memos on this guy um they saw him as a communist threat um and he was does he explain why why they thought he was a communist threat um it was because of his socialist tradition he had he had a relationship with socialist politics he sympathized with but ultimately rejected Marxism technically um and uh but they viewed him as basically a wolf and sheep's clothing hiding under Christianity and western um ideals to put income now bro he was now i don't believe that i have a hard time believing it too i don't believe that you know what i believe i believe that when black people and white people finally start getting along they lose their power they lose their power structure their power structure completely collapses and martin luther king has been the most influential figure in bringing races to the closest that they could be so far yep and we also have to remember that what is called socialism and communism 60 years ago is not the exact same socialism and communism that we have today 60 years ago the over-to-window was far far far to the right all right when we think of socialist that communist today you know we totally think of like um you know Karl Marx type shit we think of Mao we think of uh you know Salilinsky we think yeah we fucking it's a different thing it's much closer to that and what i think is that with the over-to-window being so far to the right him being accused of being a communist and a socialist really just meant that he was moving the window a little bit to the left which would be center now like if if he was alive today he'd be moving it to the center right not to the fucking left right and my i think he was killed for the very simple reason of these people can't have black people and white people get along which is the same thing that they've been doing since then so you know if black people and white people black Americans and white Americans get along the manipulation and the bullshit stops and fucking stops stops immediately which is why they work so hard to do it so my opinion regardless of what it says is that he was killed because he was causing an issue at the very heart of their ability to maintain power control yeah that is interesting i read that another one of the documents too it was like because you know when they assassinated him he was gone that he was planning to do another big march on dc like i think three three weeks before uh or three weeks after he was actually killed there was a plan to be another big march and that march happened anyway um you know but that that was clear laid out do they wiretap this house yeah the wiretap this house he was followed every fucking way he went everywhere he went all of his people were followed anybody that spoke highly of them they put cases on i mean it would make it would make sense that would make sense you know he's a threat to the control mechanism and anybody that's that's a threat to the control mechanism has to be removed um you know people make those same arguments about jfk bro you know i'm saying like i'm in a unity figure trying to get america back to where it's supposed to be gold sand and i mean you talk about all those things but it's like he was a he was a he was a he was an obstacle to the control mechanism had to get rid of him um you know it does it does bother me how in inner twine these federal agencies really were in right like i mean you got CIA implicated in this you got FBI implicated in this they're doing clan desks down operations on united states soil to follow a guy who's just saying hey we want to be equal like that doesn't sit well with me right doesn't sit well with me at all man um it is it is weird it is weird um yeah i don't know man i don't know you know it uh 200 thousand 230 thousand pages that's that's a lot it's uh it's uh it's a it's a it's a it's an amount that is intentionally released in a manner to confuse people make a hard to figure out what's going on mm-hmm i mean that's it well because a lot of them too like they're you and you guys will see them if you guys go to the website you guys will see them a lot of them like there's just handwriting and scribble yeah like you know you you know you can't even really read you know i'm saying i'll go like like oh photos right you open it up and it's just like fucking uh scan copies of pictures that like in black and white you can't even see who the fuck it is like you know so a lot of it is just wash to be real um but you know you go through there you find some some important stuff i'd say the the stuff on uh the stuff from victor marchetti is is a very interesting read um to to dive into man um so yeah so guys let us know down in the comments what you guys think uh with that being said let's get to our final and third headline headline number three we got a boy back in the news the america's favorite son underbiting underbiting's back in yeah um and uh he's on like a little tour right now he's doing doing a lot of talking a lot of weird talking it's kind of weird it's super weird like you would think he would kind of shut the fuck up and go away it's just disappeared just go eat some more parmesan cheese but no he's making it trying to make another name for himself uh hunter-biden lashes out at george cluny other democrats over joe biden's 2024 campaign um so this is an interesting one um joe biden's son hunter uh seen by some as the problem child of the democratic party for legal and drug related woes that brought negative attention to his father is lashing out against democratic elites and others over the way he says his father was treated during last years presidential campaign um hunter-biden spoke publicly in recent interviews about lasher's election when joe biden ultimately dropped his bid and Donald Trump won the white house in a three-hour explicit uh expletive field online interview with andrew calligan of channel five he directed iron towards actor uh democratic party donor george cluny for his decision to call on the elder biden to abandon uh his 2024 uh re-election bill he called a couple of people out too i got a couple of clips here let's check this first one out and you would have the speaker emeritus that would say well you know i'm gonna leave it up to but um i don't know and uh and um and they had already made a decision they had clearly made a decision um uh and when i say they i mean the speaker and you know i i heard elisabeth Pelosi say something call my my my my my my my put your big girl pants on to my mom or something and i kind of want to feel like saying who the fuck do you think you are i would never speak about your mom that way yeah i would never speak about your father that way i would never insult your parents that way even to this day i would never who do you think you are that's interesting yeah that's an interesting statement from you bro you know who the fuck do you think you are you know i'm saying you think you could sell your fucking influence by selling bullshit paintings and go into barisma and your family getting rich and everybody you know uh suffering because of the decisions you and your family made you're the biggest fucking fraud and the whole fucking girl bro you're on the internet with a crack pipe hanging out of your mouth and m&m's on your dick like who the fuck are you yeah you don't represent americans right you represent the Biden crime syndicate that is it he goes on and on and on to i watched this other interview with him out of the one on immigration with channel five yeah he goes on and on and on about how people are insulting his dad and making his dad look bad your dad's a piece of shit you're a piece of shit and everybody in the country fucking thinks that bro like dude quit why are we allowing people like this to even be the the representatives of america this is fucking bullshit and it goes back to the first topic that we had bro these people do not represent us and whether or not obama and Hillary and all of them get arrested and dealt with and fucking wiped off the planet that's still not good enough because we're still going to be running with this two class system of elites up here and peasants down here which is the complete opposite of what this country supposed to be this country is for the people by the people and most importantly of the people and those are not of the people especially this guy but you know it's really telling too because he also went on he went on a few rates like he's been doing these podcasts and reviews and news and reviews but speaking on that point of like being of the people he really let his elitism mindset come out and show full force let's check this next clip out for someone in my business like all these democrats say you have to talk about and realize that people are really upset about a legal immigration fuck you how do you think your hotel room gets cleaned how do you think you got boot on your fucking table who do you think washes your dishes who do you think does your fucking garden who do you think is here by the fucking chair fucking just grit and will that they figured out a way to get here because they thought that they could give themselves in a family better chance and he's somehow convinced all of us that these people are the fucking criminals yeah that's what I'm talking about yeah yeah they they are the criminals call me and you're racist yeah well that sounds a little bit like if they're here illegally yeah they're criminals yeah I don't understand why that's hard to understand it's very hard if you're here illegally you're breaking the law which by definition makes you a criminal okay and then those criminals continue to break the law while you're not only are they causing all kinds of violent crime they're reporting the crime as white people doing it or black people doing it they're not reporting it as illegals doing it and then they're trying to pretend as if all of these people are families seeking asylum and all this shit motherfucker how many families came across out of that 22 million people that came how many because what I saw and what you saw what everybody saw was military age males that's what we saw yep yeah and it's so fun like I'm gonna go to Twitter here real quick lips of tiktok they've been posting like a immigration tracker but like this guy here you Janu wrong Chinese national who's in our country illegally he was previously arrested for murder now they just got this guy or this other guy in Maryland Abraham Burrano to DC he's a criminal illegal alien from Ethiopia who was convicted of rape and is currently charged with first and second degree rape assault in indiesin exposure or this guy Rigo Burdo Azuzu Alvarez he was arrested and charged with rape in South Carolina he's also an ice detainer hold but this is who they want you know are the guys in New York City who just shot an off duty board a patrol agent right like that's that's who the problem is that's who we're talking about yeah that's right now I do think one thing that that you know a lot of people do like I don't know because I mean listen we're all tired of it yeah okay black people in the cities are tired of these migrants getting dumped in their cities and getting their fucking resources absorbed up dude people don't even think about this okay these people come in here they get welfare they get government assistance they take up your fucking they clog your emergency rooms your doctors they they fuck everything up because they're not part of what the infrastructure is designed to operate with the reason that you have all of this degradation and shit happening throughout our country has to do with the 50 million mother fuckers that are here that shouldn't be here that's it okay they use our gas they use our water they use our electric they use our resources they fucking take and they don't contribute and that's the truth and is does some people contribute yes are there people who work hard absolutely are some of the immigrants here the hardest working people I've ever fucking seen yes those people should still come here under the proper guidance and restrictions that are laid out for all immigrants and if they don't they should go home and come back the right way so that everything is on the record so that they have to abide by the same rules that all of us have to abide by okay do you think it's right that these motherfuckers don't pay taxes but somehow collect government assistance no nobody does the only people that do are people that don't have to handle money in their lives meaning they're supported by somebody okay which is why you get all of these white women from upper middle class who advocate for this shit up until Jose from fucking you know South America who's come from some third world fucking shit hole punches you in the fucking face it takes your shit and then all of a sudden it's like why didn't you help me well maybe you shouldn't advocate for things that you don't know maybe you shouldn't talk about things and posture and post about things that you have no idea about because eventually these things are gonna come to your front door and you're not gonna know how to deal with them and that's happening over and over and over again to the point where everybody's tired and it is creating a lot of racism for people that look like these third world people i'm not talking about black Americans i'm not talking about white people i'm talking about brown people i'm talking about people who look like they come from fucking some other place in the middle east or africa and they don't speak our language and they don't adopt their culture i'm not talking about the fucking black dude who's walking up and down the street in the fucking cardinals jersey and it gives you a high five and it's like that i'm not talking about yeah do we used to have an accepting society here where we would see someone in like middle eastern uh address and we would be respectful and that's not happening anymore because and it's it's wrong it's not happening anymore because do we do have Americans that are from other places that have other customs and that's okay but we're not able to fucking see the difference between them so now people are starting to like fucking hate all those they're starting to look at all the brown people who dress different talk different you know act different speak a different language and be like get the fuck out yeah and that's the sediment in america bro and it's creating real hate that's right and the data fucking shows it and it sure is fuck doesn't help when they start protesting and marching uh talking about jihad like they didn't Michigan last week and talking about if you don't convert to islam you'll die bro get the fuck out of here yeah i'm all four people being able to practice their religion i have no problem with islamic people or this is a freedom of religion country but when you start doing that shit here the fuck out of here yeah that's not good i i like to take this in a different look too like just from the shirt number because i this one quick math i know i'm not you know probably the most trustworthy person when it comes to numbers and math um you know but i like it in a sense like this okay let's say there was 20 million people here we got 320 million americans right give a take we're talking about a 15% increase on the the countries infrastructure that's 15% people more more people are not in in our daily drives yeah in our grocery stores um in our hospitals you know imagine just for a second in your own home if everything that you had to to handle and take take care of increase by 15% out of nowhere with with no warning and you're just supposed to deal with it that's basically what's happened to this country it's not sustainable man yeah like 15% doesn't sound like a lot but it does when it's in all areas of your fucking life it becomes a lot and i don't think people look at it like that man it's not it's not cool um it's not cool not cool yeah um hunter Biden used to go back to painting paintings with his uh penis yeah i agree yeah guys let us know down in the comments what you guys think uh with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck um you know i thought we'd take this opportunity we we've we've done some polls in the past right we've had fries and a few other things um in the spirit of uh big backs let's do some ice cream ratings of what big backs yeah what's that that's fat people i know that's a new term i seen that going around yeah big bags bro it's a real thing all right uh so yeah let's let's rate some ice cream Andy um let's see how we do here we have uh ice cream brands ranked cheer list people like our rankings i think people trust our opinions on these things okay so we got uh uh man most of those i you know you don't tell me you've never had these i mean i mean i could speak to maybe half of them okay where's the choco taco no these are brands like ice cream brands okay yeah so you got so where's the choco taco i didn't make it well then this is the list is irrelevant it's not even fucking available as an option well the wait hold on here's another thing um the andy throws and custard's not on here neither is Ted Drew's these aren't locals though these are doesn't matter if we're talking about the best well there there was one hold on we'll do that you want you want the ice cream truck no let's just fucking go through that i'm saying they have these with the popsicles no that's why I figured yeah chocolate tacos in the popsicle yeah these are the bomb pop truck options okay so this is like i know all of these yeah i know these two okay yeah let's do this one all right okay choco taco goes to the top i i don't disagree ice cream sandwich goes to the fucking top oh hold on there i think that's a little basic where is the choco taco there yeah okay so choco tacos for sure for sure like superior right yeah yeah i have no doubts with that one okay now let let's go to the what the worst one would be um that would be the sonic the hedgehog or the little the ones that look like a face like the batman but see i think those are pretty good no they're terrible people buy them because they look like something because they have the gum drops in there yeah but they're terrible they break fucking teeth out man that's like the biggest scam ever the biggest scam uh-huh on the ice cream truck is the sonic the sponge by the spider man and the
