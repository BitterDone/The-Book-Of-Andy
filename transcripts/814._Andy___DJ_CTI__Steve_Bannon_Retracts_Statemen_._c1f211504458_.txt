couldn't see it well I mean real talk bro it was uneventful I mean I think that was most most people's reactions yeah it was it was another exhibition sort of like yeah what was that Roger and Tyson you know it was I watched it I thought I had fun watching it I get you would have told me that I tell you what I really liked was the fight before that the yeah the two girls oh dang man yeah they were going that holy shit yeah I'm starting to become a fan of women's boxing and MMA more than the men brother be going after yeah they do they go hard as fuck it started when we when we had Macy signed and I started watching her because I love watching Macy bad ass she's awesome and uh fuck dude like I started watching her and then I started watching all and like you know I don't know man like I just think the women fighters go harder yeah like I've never seen a shoulder shoulder punch it's like watching college football versus the NFL that's what I think I think it's like they they care more like yeah dude that's what I'm saying yeah they're I don't know there's it's there's a look there's a level of intensity with the women that is different and fun to watch and I never really realized that until I start watching Macy yeah bro she I will not start fucking shoulder punch I've never seen a shoulder punch before and she was fucking shoulder punch ring yeah I like it what did did you see uh did you see you didn't get to see the fuck a boxing fight none of it holy fuck yeah none of it they beat the shit out of each oh my god that's all I kept saying the whole fight I'm like bro these girls are beating the fuck out of each other yeah did you see that cut on her fucking eye holy shit man it is bro and it was like hanging like like like you could see like the tissue in there yeah yeah I mean a lot of people have been been kind of you know split decisions on the the Paul Tyson thing you know I saw somebody said something like you know if you were to tell me this was like a charity event for cancer or something I would have believed you because it just seemed like a nice you know like a you know I mean you know look dude you guys 60 years old I don't know what people you know I actually I don't know Tyson didn't look like the Tyson that that bro that I saw training bro what was that he looked he looked tired he looked wobbly he looked old and 58 you know and Jake fucking put it on him you know he could have went harder at some points in the fight but I think the fact that he you know and I think Tyson could have went harder there's a couple times where he pulled back so you know look it is what it fucking is yeah you know one thing you know you would have thought that this was like on Friday to 13th though why because there was a full moon Tyson haha bro that was so what was that bro that was so funny he comes over he's doing an interview I think it was his son and he just fucking walks off dude like with his ass hanging out the clip took this out what's your prediction vicious one vicious one thank you done love you too haha bro I don't know what to think about that I don't feel like you can say I don't think you can say that I don't think you could say shit it's my Tyson it's true you do whatever the fuck he wants and you know what I even think is better as he hasn't said anything about it and said one word he showed up at the UFC fight the next night he doesn't give two fucks you check out his ass all you want yeah I mean listen I mean it's not bad I mean I mean that's it that's a real ass no hair yeah I mean it seems

that being said let's coos some headlines man cool yeah headline number one this is a new update you know Trump's been putting in his cabinet list uh going around uh been feeling spots here and there uh this was an interesting one uh Steve bandin on the war room uh president elect Trump names cash patelle as FBI director um so this is big this is probably I mean I think this is a big deal um you know I think with Matt gates at ag and cash now at FBI I think you can definitely get some shit done with that uh you yeah cash though yeah some weird fucking eyes man what he does like what is that he's thinking he's in a tense dude and I think he's super smart oh he's and I think he is gonna do the job very well oh he's brilliant there's no doubt about that fuck me yeah I'm excited I'm excited for that one yeah yeah fuck man there's just some weird eyes man yeah I don't care just fucking do your job you know I'm saying yeah I feel that man his cocaine was that in the white house yeah that's what I do that listen I know cut listen cash is a great guy I'm sure of it the fuck you can see the white around his pupils I don't know man I think he's just ready to do the job he's very excited he's very ready uh for sure now there's been interesting shit happening uh all around DC um and well I think we got some final little death rattles going um this one is interesting Adam Schiff uh Trump wants to use the military against me right against you against him okay um now he went on CNN all right and this is actually very very funny uh he went on CNN um and uh was was doing an interview on CNN and this is the exchange I want you guys to check this out people from within we have some very bad people we have some sick people radical left lunatics and I think they're the and and it should be very easily handled by if necessary by national god or if really necessary by the military uh because they can't let that happen do you think that he was talking about using the military against you and how concerned are you about retribution uh clearly that's what he was talking about would he go to that link with the military uh essentially fulfill some kind of a unconstitutional order I would hope the military would have more independence than that historically the military has stood up to civilian authority uh where civilian authority has suggested as in his first administration uh unconstitutional acts um look I'm not going to be intimidated by anything he says by anything he does if I was I wouldn't be on your show oh he's shit his pants he's shitting his pants yeah now Trump's gonna use the military against me yeah for sure that's what he meant well why maybe is it possibly is it possible because not even 30 seconds after he says that Trump's gonna use the military on him he brings up the bullshit about the Russia Trump collusion again and doubles down on it no way check this out obviously he is bringing a group of people to real quick look at the time stamp okay this is at six twenty six he made that first one uh was at six twenty four so I mean okay which some minutes Trump's gonna use the military on me yeah yeah and Russia collusion like look at this shit yeah obviously he is bringing a group of people to disrupt I mean that is what speaker Johnson said um and I'm wondering about how much anybody in Washington is is being introspective at all about why there is this kind of opening for disruptors if not necessarily these individuals you were censured in the house last year for in their view holding positions of power during the Trump presidency has chairman of House Intelligence Committee and according to them quote abusing this trust by saying there was evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia and I wonder if you are feeling at all introspective at all about that that was according to your according to the Mueller report and according to your your Republican colleagues and overstatement and I wonder if you think in any way you you uh helps at the table for these sort of disruptors you know for sure it wasn't an overstatement there is evidence of collusion the Trump campaign manager was meeting with Russian intelligence and giving them eternal polling data just to give you one example uh and the Mueller report sets all this out it does say quote the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities which doesn't mean that he didn't you know that there weren't meetings but they didn't find evidence that too he says the fact that we didn't find proof beyond a reasonable doubt doesn't mean there wasn't evidence of conspiracy or coordination so but look that's not what people were voting on people were voting on is this guy going to improve the economies are going to address inflation no I'm voting on you going to jail yeah and I want the middle there to do it yeah 100% and and by the way they already proved that you made this up and lied about it and they also proved that uh there were other people that were involved who made this up and lied about it this Russia collusion story ruined the country divided the country for eight fucking years okay these people put their own interests above the interests of the people which is now what they're supposed to do they broke numerous laws they violated the constitution they are traders to this country there is not a question about that they are taking foreign influence money making decisions that are in the interest of other countries and not in the interest of the United States that's being a traitor okay uh there's all kinds of different things that they've done as well and here you have the sky on CNN who is clearly shitting his pants uh you know saying he's not going to be intimidated by Donald Trump um I don't really think it matters if you're intimidated or not I think you're going to fucking prison where you belong and you should never ever get out and that's being very lenient in my opinion because when we think about the lives that the small group of people have ruined the accountability has to be harsh so that a small group of people doesn't get together in the future and try to do these same things so when we say oh jail time I mean yeah okay like cool yeah that's not what I would do well I think most people too like you know we remember it's 2016 to 2020 great fucking four years right people were making the most money and employment low all these great things but people tend to forget how much better could those four years have been had these fucking people not been doing this yeah you know shit that's what comes in my mind no shit they're putting a fucking anchor in the boat every chance they get every single fucking turn man yeah and so it's like you know not only are these people shitting their pants they know it's fucking coming yeah um and it's well they know what they did they know what they know what they did and they know what the consequences that's why we that's why they've been fighting so hard for so long keep this dude out yeah yeah they know it and like you know you want to see a tell tell sign you look at how mainstream media writes it we go to NBC news hello reads DOJ and FBI officials reach out to lawyers as potential Trump revenge prosecutions loom how would they be worried about that apparently multiple current and former senior justice department and FBI officials have begun reaching out to lawyers and anticipation of being criminally investigated by the Trump administration according to three people with knowledge of their deliberations um quote everything we did was above board us set us former senior FBI official we started contacting lawyers because he expects to be prosecuted himself quote but this is a different world um now you spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of becoming even more of a target doesn't believe any attempt to prosecute him will be successful judges and juries have the power to throw out cases and find a pent up defendants innocent if they deemed prosecutions to be baseless um and it's not just you know him like so there there's other agents other people that were in the DOJ that are still in the DOJ are apparently trying to find criminal defense attorneys right now because they know what the fuck is coming and I don't think that's gonna be Justin I don't think that's gonna be enough um now other things that are interesting too uh you're starting to see this other flip with uh mainstream media uh morning Joe coho who likened Trump to Hitler open dialogue with him in my logo so Joe Scribrow and mika brazinski uh they both apparently are down silver yeah dillbert yeah um they're both down with uh with trump they were they met with him this morning um quote that's i've said for years on the air and imprint 90% of what you see on networks like this is all performance art Joe contra posted on x quote because why else would Joe and miko want to reset their relationship with someone they repeatedly called a fascist for eight years totally phony people um so yeah so they went down there in uh brazinski viewers you said quote uh what we did agree was to restart communications and for those asking why we would go speak to the president elect during such frought times especially between us I guess I would ask back why wouldn't we so I mean you see this like flip happening man and I I mean I feel like some of it is like rats trying to jump the that's what that is that's what this is what those okay just to clarify why they went there here's what's happening all of these media personalities are dead in the water nobody trusts them nobody believes them nobody's gonna listen to them this is why you're seeing them get fired for many different networks the only way to preserve their credibility is to potentially do something like what they just did where they go down there they say oh we're gonna sit with them it's all good we blah blah blah they're those two are trying to salvage their own personal credibility after what they've done for the last set you know eight nine years with Trump so that's all that is about there this is not about they actually think different this is not about they want to start a new page this is not about anything other than this they are unemployable after the amount of lies in the amount of deceit in the amount of bullshit that they shove down the American people throat and they're trying to salvage their well-paying careers to become credible again by trying to make up with Trump and if I were Trump I tell them to eat a fucking dick and fucking enjoy your food stamps pitch to of yeah because that's what they fucking deserve yeah bro so you see rats jumping ships or you see what you know shifts doing and they double down on the ship man it's just weird to see yeah it's weird to see um does anybody else you uh I mean Trump has a pretty good cabinet going right now are you happy with the names that have been up me yeah I mean look dude there's something I don't like like there's some that I like a lot there's some that I don't like you know some of these guys getting up and talking about you know you know Israel in front of when we're talking about America that's not a good sign to me yeah you know what I'm saying like when they get up there and they say oh Israel America blah blah blah motherfucker this is America this is not Israel America is in shambles okay we're not voting for Israel we're voting for America and Americans and so while I like a lot of the picks I really like the the new uh uh department of government efficiency with Vivek and Elon um I really like the FBI with cash per tell uh you know I really liked the Pete Hegseth pick until he went up there and he fucking said America and Israel it's like bro this ain't the time to fucking pander to this other fucking country and um you know like I I feel okay about some of them and some of them I don't but at the end of the day dude you know these people uh need to do a job they they need to do the job they have been uh voted into positions of power appointed into positions of power by Trump to do a job I am hopeful that they will do that job to the degree and the depth that which they promised to do that job but when we look at the history of politics and the history of politicians that hardly ever happens so you know uh if they don't do the job I'm gonna be all over them just like I've been all over the other people for the last four years because do we need major reform in America and it's not a little bit it's fucking major and um I hope Trump let's them do their job I hope Trump pushes them do their job I hope they don't fucking take their foot off the next of people that are that will get look a big problem I see with Trump dude and I don't know why he's like this all right I think he has a big heart and I think he forgives people too easily and I think he forgets that these people were fucking rating his home they were you know these people would have executed him had they have the chance to try it yeah I know dude and like for him to come out I mean look he's a chess player dude and he wrote a whole chapter on revenge and you know in his book think big and kick ass you know I think I think he might be playing nice right now to get in and and and just fucking bring the hammer when he gets in there but uh which is what's required man like we need a major reset we need a major fitting of the herd in terms of bureaucracy and government and these lifetime politicians and these corrupt traders they all need to be dealt with and they need to be pulled out of forced out of government and held accountable for the things that they've done and unless he does that and unless we end up with a completely different government four years from now in terms of tax code size positive cash flow you know like it's just another fucking president dude you know what I mean and I understand that everybody's hyped and but we can't let the fucking enemy off the mat bro because the minute you let them up they will kill you and if we don't have the killer instinct and by the killer instinct I mean to remove the corrupt players from this system and put America truly first not American israel america truly first and less that happens it's a fucking it's just another fucking four years of bullshit and when we write back in the shit four years from now with a whole nother version of what we just went through you know and and dude like the other thing is trump could be being genuine recognizing that certain people and it do need accountability and certain people should get a pass and I don't know where he's drawing that line you know maybe he's drawing that line with members of the media but honestly like some of the media maybe not the people on the screens but the people who are driving the narrative that are like dude that's that's not okay to go on tv and lie to people look at the amount of people that we have on the internet that are genuinely terrified of trump being in office that's not because trump did anything to terrified anything that's because they've been watching these people lie about trump for the last eight years and they're legitimately scared I have empathy for those people you know it's the same people who wear masks still in fact there was a person I don't know if you saw that works here that has worn a mask the entire fucking time this has happened that she doesn't work here she's a contractor you know I'm talking about exactly did you see what she was doing today no mask finally you know what I said to her I said hey it's really nice to see your face you know she smiled she said thank you you know but like that's someone who is not at a core aligned with what you and I believe and what I think our listenership for the main part believes she is someone who I mean dude I you could tell from the stickers on her car right I'm being nice but like the stickers on her car all the things that we fucking don't like and that's probably someone who has been heavily manipulated by the media to the point where they feel in danger four years later to come out like that's not okay dude the amount of manipulation the amount of brainwashing the amount of mental abuse that the media put on Americans is not okay it's fucking not okay well me until that point too that's why I feel like drawn that line from like you know the people we see on TV versus the people who wrote the teleprompter script I see no difference because I have a fundamental issue with somebody who you know is reading the teleprompter knowing what they're reading is bullshit yeah but reading it anyway so they can get a fucking down yeah I have a massive problem with that and you know like I do I don't care about any of them I don't think any of them should be safe well I mean look dude there's an argument to be made for that I you know where does the line there has to be responsibility there has to be accountability where that line is drawn is not my decision or your decision it's Trump's decision so I don't know where he's drawing that line but the people who did all the trade or shit taking money from foreign interests making decisions that are anti-American that have hurt this country that have allowed 18 to 20 million people into this country that's going to cost billions of dollars to undo and be emotionally traumatizing probably for a lot of people to watch um you know the the depletion of the oil reserves the stopping of domestic energy production the the inflation the printing of money the the leaving of weapons in Ukraine the war in Ukraine the fucking covid scandal all this shit they did intentionally and it has to be fucking held accountable uh or we're going to face those same challenges again so there has to be a standard set for what happens to people who run completely wild and decide to do anything they can to keep a man from being president this is the land of opportunity you and I and everybody else grew up being told one day maybe you could be president well clearly that's not the case because these people have created a little caste system within the government that they are the elite people and we are the peasants and shift is a perfect example of someone who believes that Hillary Clinton believes that Barack Obama believes that the whole entire little group of don't they think they're special and they think we're shit and they've said this out loud I don't even know how many times so how many times do we got to hear them say that out loud before we fucking believe that's what they actually think they're not coming to our house to fucking eat a steak they're not fucking they're not going to hang out with us bro that like they're not us and the people should be in control of the government that's the whole point of the United States of America and that these people need to be fucking excommunicated from the government and and held accountable and all these 51 intelligence officials that signed this letter knowing it was bullshit about Hunter Biden's laptop and all those people should go to fucking jail for the rest of their lives all of them yeah 100 percent man 100 percent guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments I think they think they're gonna go

it's not true you better start reading your comments all right um that's not a but two let's keep this the cruise moving footage of Biden wandering off into the amazon explodes online but is everything as it seems good old gramps I didn't see this you can see this this is great so footage of president Joe Biden wandering off into the amazon rainforest has gone viral but it's not what it seems on Sunday Biden became the first sitting president to visit the amazon first taking an aerial tour of the region before walking through a portion of the rainforest with daughter Ashley and granddaughter Natalie at the museo day Arizona and Amazonian that's Amazonia Amazonia you said Arizona yeah that's the Arizona you said something else I thought that's okay when you said Arizona yeah I did I did say Arizona it was the MMR they kind of look alike in Manaus Brazil uh check this clip up so let's preserve the secret place for our time and forever for the benefit of all humanity thank you very very much that looks like a fucking green screen well I'll see you guys later well so so so that's the clip that's going around everybody was like you know uh tripping out but here's the thing all right gay those remarks and all that good stuff that was the same pathway that he entered from all right so there is like a little cut off there and reporters on the scene confirmed todaylymail.com that Biden did not get lost in the abyss of the rainforest now that did not stop the internet uh because you know shit started going out like this legend says he's still lurking there is that him behind the tree or this one here Biden wondering in that rainforest now that is a fucking accurate depiction of Joe Biden oh for sure uh Vincent Vegas character or John John Travolta of Vincent Vega and fucking pulp fiction when he's over at Mia Wallace's house and she starts talking through the intercom and he's like that's Biden dude what a great movie yeah first of all I mean the dude looks like he's about to go colonize some shit yeah colonizer yeah he looks like he's like he just got cut from auditioning for Indiana Jones and and he's about to tell he's about to tell everybody you know unfortunately guys I didn't make the cut yeah didn't get the gold made it I should have put a khaki shirt on and bro and like a like at this point it's just fuck with Joe Biden just a moment put him in like a in like a steve urwin outfit you know what I'm saying they're walking to the rainforests yeah what does that show in practical joker yeah well that's how this film I think we should just put that put that Biden should go on that show yeah if Biden went on that show dude he become a national treasure like you want it you want to reverse your negative viewpoint you know besides being a literal traitor yeah right go on that show yeah and uh you know do some funny shit that's not the kids yeah kids yeah he do that for fucking free yeah yeah yeah now so you know I'll notice he ain't ever sniffing no Indian kids what what that's fuck man have you ever seen him do it all right all right get serious put your fucking face on all jokes aside man all jokes aside this is uh this is interesting uh we got to keep this on the horizon for people um have you seen this huh Pentagon fails seventh audit in a row unable to fully account for eight hundred and twenty four billion dollar budget oh yeah man yeah seven times yeah now listen to this shit though what about that three trillion one right before uh you know what what what day was that was that nine it was like September 10th uh-huh 2001 2001 September 10 2001 they lost three trillion dollars geez wow and then geez and not that that's a relevant date or anything yeah no no um yeah man and and and here we are again um but it's okay because officials they're confident that the DOD has turned a corner and understanding its budgetary challenges going forward this is such bullshit okay these motherfuckers make us work our fucking balls off take half our money spending on whatever they want steal most of it you know like they've paid seven hundred dollars for a fucking hammer right steal six hundred and fucking ninety five of it and then tell us oh we don't know what happened what would you do what what would the government do to you if they were to come to you as a business owner or as an individual and say let me see your records let me let me I'm coming you mr. businessman you're being audited let me see your shit fuck I don't know what happened to it you know what happens to you straight to jail that's right straight to fucking jail bro but these people can do whatever they want with with note with immunity from any consequences fuck that it's not like it's a little money bro that's a shit ton and see I feel like that's part of the the issue here too bro like we got to talk about this because I think most of the reason why more people are not upset is because they can't even conceptualize how much fucking money that is I think they're so used to it just going away don't care yeah like bro we're born into this fucking system yes okay we're born into it's if you took the okay if you were to stop and separate yourself from being born into the system and what you know what you've always known the way it always has been which very few people have the ability to do if you just stopped and said how should it be instead of how is it you would come up with okay most most Americans would come up with the idea of well we should pay some tax enough tax to you know maintain protection maintain you know certain certain you know pillars of a functioning society we all contribute and we all benefit that would be a natural you know conclusion we'd all probably come to what we wouldn't come to is it should be half of your money and if you don't pay it you go to fucking jail and if we can't account for where we spend it nothing happens to us and we could do whatever we want we could buy whatever we want we could approve whatever contracts we want we could send the contracts to our friends they're allowed to take that inflated contract that you know should be a thousand dollars and make it a hundred thousand and then you know they split the money on the back deal right like I'll give you half of what's left over that's how these kick back deals work or they work like well we'll donate you know the half of the money back to your political pack or whatever your charity or whatever right and that's the way this game works and if we were all to sit down and say is that an ideal system we would all say no all of us but because we're born into it and because it's quote unquote just the way it is we all accept it and we just go along with it which is ridiculous bro we we should be held at the same standard that they're held at like if they can't fucking provide an audit that shows where the money went and they didn't do it responsibly or within the rules of the law then who should go to jail if we're gonna go to jail for mismanaging some a fucking fraction you know they're hitting people for six hundred fucking dollars right on fucking PayPal right if we're gonna get in trouble for that then shouldn't they be fucking held to the same standard where they should go to fucking prison for mismanaging fucking a trillion fucking dollars and then they have the I mean yes or no yeah right bro they have the nerve to call that then say that to our faces that even with all that it's not a failure he wouldn't call it a failure oh not only that we're short of money and by the way we're gonna need some more tax money more actually yeah right so we can lose lose some more it's insane now so you have this right Biden's in the rainforest DOD's fucking in air quotes losing money and then we got it we got to be careful because you know we've talked about this we got we've took out some time before Trump's actually in office right and a lot of things can happen before that I don't believe Biden's necessarily pulling the strings at this point I don't think he has been in the wild but we have to see what's happening on the global scale of things the Ukraine Russia war being one of those things you see this White House's message for Putin after the Kremlin accused Biden of trying to start World War III so this just came down the pipe the White House hit back on hit back at the Kremlin Monday after it claimed the United States authorization for Ukraine to strike deep inside Russia was quote fueling the fire with Putin allies even claiming it would lead to World War III the incendiary rhetoric comes as Ukraine prepares to use the green light to potentially launch powerful long range weapons provided by Washington to strike Russia and North Korean troops trying to claw back territory seized in the Ukrainian counter offensive they said quote with regard to the comments that came out of Russia the fire was lit by Russia's invasion of Ukraine White House deputy national security adviser John Finer told reporters in Rio where President Biden is attending the G20 summit quote so I think that this notion of fuel on the fire is simply a side issue to the main issue which is Russia waging a war of aggression across the sovereign border and to Ukraine and continuing to do so so now what was the the the the the Kremlin's response or comments initial ones at least Dmitry Peskov he said quote it is clear that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps to continue to add fuel to the fire and to further inflamed tensions around this conflict so yeah so Russia like bomb the shut out of Ukraine sent like 200 bombs and something like that bomb the fuck out of this looks specific region and then Biden authorizes Ukraine to use it US supplied long range missiles they have not used one yet not sure what that's going to do does not seem to be a good thing man Andy what do you got on this man all right you know it's what I've been saying for a long time I think they're gonna look these people are not going quietly they're not gonna just peacefully transition power they're going to do everything they can to put Trump in a very unfavorable position to create chaos to create distractions who knows how far they're willing to go I don't you don't but I think they're willing to go pretty fucking far and I see a lot we're not even out of November we're halfway through November okay there are plenty of options for them to screw up this country and create division chaos frustration these people are still in control Trump is not in control yet and uh you know I think chaos is on the horizon you know these people these are communist people these are not these are not just American politicians these are communist insurgents that are posing as American politicians communism does not just go away it might take a step back they might take a step back whenever they feel like they're about to get punished or held accountable or outed but I think they've been outed too far to take a step back and um we're gonna see what happens dude I think they're in all the way and I think part of the reason now actually now that I'm talking this out it makes sense as to why Trump is trying to play peaceful because he's trying to preserve some sort of order between now and then you know that makes sense you know now that we're talking that out that makes more sense he's not gonna be saying hey I'm doing this and this and this and this and this and this right now because that's gonna give them the opportunity to create as much destruction between now and then it justifies it that's correct so he's gonna play cool that makes sense that makes sense now I'm talking to you so that's that's that's what I'm thinking right now yeah also one point that I want to point out I want to ask you something uh last time you talked about that budget thing happened around the September date this budget failure coincidentally do you think happens on the on Friday where this fight happens with the whole world is looking at that fight and nobody's being intention to that thing for sure big fight weekend lots entertainment bread and circuses you know this is what this is what failing civilizations do you know uh now I don't think the U.S. sees involved they're not involved I don't think Jake Paul's involved no I've used these as correct they was a big weekend everybody was watching both these things for sure for sure divided attention 100% by the way we lost three quarters of a trillion dollar yeah right guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments uh that big I think that's what's going on with Trump I mean it do to make sense man like you know you got a wildcat over there no that's what I do yeah you don't want to you get me all right patience yeah you know yeah I can see it yeah that makes sense to me now that I'm talking about it yeah guys let us know what you guys think uh with that being said let's get to our third and final headline um it's also interesting that as you know time progresses more and more things are starting to come out um this is a bombshell revelation that just dropped love to hear your thoughts on it this is something we talk about all the time guys like it's important that we don't forget all of the bullshit that was done right Trump's former CDC director makes bombshell COVID claim that there is a real possibility the virus was born in North Carolina holy shit what do you mean holy shit holy shit what do you mean now didn't we just it was a big natural disaster that was man we said I said this on the show in 2020 that it came from fucking here to Wuhan don't we have that audio because COVID has contributed to what we're experiencing now very significantly for a lot of reasons and I don't think that many people are even seeing the two as related at all and so what we want to do is we want to work through the timeline of how we got to today and then we'll start talking about how to fix some other fucking problem all right so here's the thing COVID the first thing that's important to understand is that COVID was developed here in the United States it was then moved to China because American sanctions made it too dangerous to develop here and guess who it was moved by it was moved by Anthony Fauci his team and Barack Obama to Wuhan these are all things you can go fucking verify on your own second point dr. Fauci said in 2017 for no apparent reason not provoked it wasn't relevant that this president will face a pandemic that he's not prepared for why would he say that why would he offer that's me what date was that June 11 2020 that was me in June 11th of 2020 telling people that this shit came from here and was sent there and I got fucking destroyed for it misinformation in fact that particular episode got fucking censored because of that that statement right there here we are in 2024 and guess what motherfuckers I was right again it's just wild man listen now this is Trump do you remember when I said that do yeah now I do remember that man and like fuck man I mean do there's so much here man like there's just so much going on and I think it's it's it's it's putting us into a position us meaning the people of this country that like it's all out now it's it's out yeah it's out there's not a real possibility it was made here it was made here man like and this guy calls it out man like so this is this is Trump's former CDC director yeah okay his name is Robert Redfield okay this guy right here yep okay he's a former director of the CDC under Donald Trump's administration he was pushed out by Fauci because he was criticizing what what we're talking about right now exactly what we're talking about he was a proponent of the lap leak theory right now Redfield he's a critic of Anthony Fauci he says that the disease has origins and we may have origins in the Tar Hill state appearing on the third opinion podcast Redfield flat out stated that COVID-19 was quote intentionally engineered as a part of a bio defense program I mean I'll use it China did not necessarily create the virus and did the best that they could once they realized they had a problem however he calls United States role in the development of the virus substantial he claims that the American government holds responsibility for funding research into the NIH USA USAID and the Department of Defense he then calls out a researcher Dr. Ralph Bark from the University of North Carolina who he calls the scientific mastermind behind all of it that's this guy checkers hard drive and apparently his lab as well now he says quote I think you probably helped create some of the original viral lines but I can't prove that but he was very involved when pressed on whether the virus was actually developed here and that the Chinese may have wrongfully accused us because bro that's what China said originally they put it on us I know they put it on us it was on us man but when he was pushed on that Redfield doubles down he says quote well I don't know if they were framed but I think there is a real possibility that the virus's birthplace was Chapel Hill Redfield said name in the hometown of the University of North Carolina they reached out to Dr. Berrick for comment of course there was no response there and he's big he said in the past that Fauci was holding on tightly to the theory that the virus evolved naturally before likening the White House COVID-19 to a dog with the bone so I mean do this is this is interesting man it's all out it's crimes against humanity dude these people these people should be tried they should be tried for crimes against humanity there's people all over the earth that suffered and lost everything because of this whether it be family members whether it be economically or their business or you know who knows what I mean the world suffered because of the draconian lockdowns the tyranny the intentional angst and division that was propagated by this fucking little weasel who was on the cover of GQ and vanity fair and his sunglasses sitting next to a pool like he's some kind of sex symbol like this guy's a fucking piece of shit all these people that did this or pieces of shit and they should all be held to trial and to a court under crimes against humanity for what it did and nothing in the world has ever happened like this it's never ever happened it's never happened dude like that was this was the first huge sia that technology was used and we think about the collateral damage the the irreparable family bonds broken the iconic family businesses lost the american dreams lost the families who can't even talk to each other anymore the people who won't go in public without a mask the all of these things these are incredibly destructive to society and culture and for us to truly heal we're gonna have to fucking see some accountability for us to have trust again there's going to have to be accountability the other piece to that that that you know it never fails you know I'm saying but like people forget like you know there's a bunch of people like I feel like we know if I was this be legit we probably know maybe 80% of these fucks that are like complicit in this shit the 20% of fucks like this dude you know I'm saying like these no name you know nobody really super anonymous yeah yeah you know I'm saying that help ring this shit I know I'm saying like I need I need I want those those names I agree you'd all of them yeah I agree because you have a a PhD bro and you fucking get to wear a white suit and you get to be around does not make these people have god complex that's what it is they think they're fucking god they think they can do anything create anything make these cool little viruses they're listen anybody who creates an intentional bio weapon virus anywhere on earth should be executed period no matter what government that should be a universal government policy for humanity with whatever they create it yeah if you're that's it you know I'm saying I don't care with the method I think the method should be extremely violent so that people don't have to do it yeah violence uh seems to work where people fucking they see violence and they're like I don't want that to happen to me yeah I won't do that I don't want this one okay there's no there's no consequences in society right now which is why these people feel okay doing these things yeah man guys so while one let us know what you guys think down in the comments uh check it out man that being said let's get to our final segment of
