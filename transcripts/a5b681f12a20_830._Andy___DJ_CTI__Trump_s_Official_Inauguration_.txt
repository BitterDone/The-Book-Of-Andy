guys can find them all link there um you want to do this cruise yeah all right see belts on I'm ready we're rolling let's go headline number one obviously it's Trump's inauguration day also known apparently as liberation day as he coined it aka yeah a lot of stuff happened and want to cover firstly uh what you get to take on this before we even dive really into any of that his uh official inaugural poichert portrait got released uh and uh it was it was definitely interesting a lot of people obviously picked up on it saying that it drew some comparisons to his 2023 mug shot photo um so this is his official uh presidential photo right obviously this is the mug shot um anything I thought I mean does this I don't know I saw this I'm like yeah I mean this dude means business yeah is that okay that's okay okay yeah I mean that's gonna hang in every federal office across the country bro I think there's a very specific message being sent here um especially when you compare it to his 2016 uh portrait where he's smiling real big there's a 16 one yeah and now he's like you know you know hey fuck around I'm gonna fucking rip your balls off bro that's that's what that says to me and dude his whole inauguration today the way he walked the way he talked the way Melania was dressed like I think they mean business I think they mean some business could you imagine being one of these like one of those far left people that participated in all the shit that somehow it's still weasel themselves into you know federal agencies right and then this gets hung up and you know all the shit you've done and you gotta look at that I mean look dude I think the amount of corruption and crime that has happened is inexcusable I think if he doesn't clean it up regardless of what it takes to clean it up regardless of the pardon's issued regardless of whatever formality look he's not even speaking on those we got those in there he's not even talking about it not yet not yet yeah which tells me there's something still playing yeah we'll talk about it you know but anyway yeah it says fuck around find out no doubt 100 percent I got the same vibe from that I like JD Vance is to though his was nice JD Vance is a cool dude he just seems like a regular guy and he's pretty sharp you know he's smart a shit pretty sharp do you smart yeah he just seems like I mean you can't be mad at this guy you know not only that he makes logical arguments to everything that people presented with like I've yet to see him get stumped or you know words Alex yeah or even even slow you know slow down in his in his dialogue by anybody yeah yeah yeah he knows what's up that's nice VP pick yeah that's nice plus by picking a guy who's 40 years old you know and if he does a good job you're ensuring the future of your particular area of the movement which is you know we're gonna have to wait and see how good that is are they gonna do what they say they're gonna do are they gonna follow through are they gonna hold people accountable are we gonna room remove the corruption in this country that all needs to happen and if that happens then you do have a young person in JD Vance that can pick up the torching you know carry it from there on keep moving it yeah which is I think this was necessary we need younger people of course running the country brother this country was not built by fucking 80 year olds it just wasn't no you know if I think 40 that 40 year age that's a good start yeah you know 40 60 yeah for sure but yeah so you got president Donald Trump he's back in man the Don is back yeah so they got officially sworn in today at noon eastern time now we know his cabinet picks got a bunch of them we've covered a lot of their selections here on the show in the past couple of months Pete hexeth he got the defense secretary position Tulsi Gabbard she's gonna be over D&I Cash Patel FBI director John Ratcliffe for CIA I mean a lot of good picks on here a lot of good names on here Pat Bondy she killed it we cover her we'll cover her a little bit later in the show as well you know but it's been a it's been a very eventful day so far so you know part of the ceremonies and you know kind of you know charades it happens during these days you know the Donald Trump he arrives at the White House gets greeted by the outgoing president Joe Biden had two words for him I don't know if you saw this little interaction this was interesting let's check this clip out drop calls out Trixie falls up Well, I m home Fuck the piece of shit. Who's the truck? Who Milani looked like she was standing on business today too. Bro, she looked like fucking Darth Vader. Like for real. Like she's terrifying today. And she's beautiful. Beautiful woman. Dude, look at the dip look man, got to pause this here. Okay, look at the difference between Jill Biden and Milani at Trump. Jill Biden looks like she came from fucking trucking clams. Dude, I don't know where she is. I don't know where she comes from. Like she looks like the wish first lady. And then you got Milani at Trump who looks like she's like a fucking icon. You know what I mean? It's a big difference. Yeah, it's a huge difference. It's a difference the way they carry themselves, how they dress, how they stand. I mean, it's like we're getting rid of a couple white trash fucking people occupying our, you know, highest office and replacing with some, you know, truly classy people in my opinion. No, 100%. I mean, decent seas back, right? I mean, that would be decent. The adults for buck and George. Yeah, right. Right. Fuck out here. Yeah, I'm glad we don't have to see KJP anymore. Oh my goodness. Stupid little fucking raggedy and looking ass. Now you mentioned a couple of people's outfits, which I thought was interesting. Look at them. Like look at them like Joe Biden don't even know how to walk and fucking heels. Well, she's probably still hung over from last. Yeah. There's no doubt about that. It's just gross. Yeah. Now, you brought up Milani's fit. There was some definitely some interesting outfits. People been, you know, hearing there on her fit. We can't get in there. We're going to do the fashion. We're going to talk about fashion. No, no, we're not going to go deep. I did just want to bring this up because I mean, you do talk about this. I know we got a lot of young men, young men listeners. And you do talk about, you know, presence and how you carry yourself. And, you know, but you can get snazzy. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? It's important. Did you see Senator John Federman? Yeah. Bro. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like it's just like it's, you're grown as man, bro. Yeah. And you're walking up with fucking shorts and fucking on clouds. Yeah. To a presidential inauguration. Yeah. And you said front fucking row. Yeah. Like he's at a fucking high school basketball game. Bro. Yeah. Like where are we at? Not where we should be. I don't know if this dude like does he think it's like that's not. I don't know. I don't know much about him. I mean, I know that he yet the little health scare situation or whatever that don't matter. I mean, look dude. There's not there. Yeah. It's not it's not good. It's not representative of the position that he's holding. It's a joke. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look dude, I wear work out clothes to work but I own a fucking workout company. It makes sense. You know what I'm saying? When I leave the house to go to dinner, I dress up. You know what I mean? Like, guys just a fucking, I don't know. Well, read the room, bro. I think that's really what it comes down to. Like you're like it just didn't I don't know. That's all the fashion I got for you on that. Now, we all, I do want to bring this up to because we, we have talked about this man many times. And, you know, we've been talking about his kind of turn, not this man, another guy. How about to show you? We've been talking about his like his kind of turn around. You know, he's like coming around the corner a little bit. You know, he's been doing some, some BJJ. We'll tell my Mark Zuckerberg. Yeah. I think he's finally went over that. He's definitely taking some test, osteoarthritis. He's getting something in because he was checking out. Stare at teeth. Yeah. Bro. Zuckerberg staring at Jeff Bezos fiance Lauren Sanchez during Trump's inauguration goes viral. Yeah, it's hilarious. He's full of flits bro. It's not the photo. It's the video. You got to watch the video. The video of it's so funny because he like looks and then he smiles real big. Dude, it's so good. See if you can find the video. No, he wouldn't have done that two years ago. You know what I'm saying? This is a different stuff. I don't, I look ready to fuck. That's where it is. It's a testosterone flow. Yeah, I don't, uh, who's got more money? Bezos or Zuck? Oh, I think Bezos is richer than Zuck. I think Bezos, yeah, by a lot, by a lot. Yeah, I think because of Facebook, most of the inventory, I mean, most of their like, uh, their money is just like add money. You know, I'm saying Bezos. I mean, he's got, I bet, I bet he's going to yell that when he gets home. Who is up? Oh, for sure. Yeah. I mean, but listen, I mean, you know, it's hard to not look at stuff you don't got, you know? I mean, it's just what they're definitely on display. Well, that's the other piece. I mean, I think that was a little trashy on her end. Yeah, well, you know, you're going to a fucking presidential inauguration, got lace front. And I got your titties out. Yeah, I like, come on. Yeah, here's the video. Oh, bro, the guy behind him is getting wrapped into the photograph. He didn't do anything. He was just getting a scratch on his eyebrow. Bro, that is great. Yeah, that's funny, dude. The video is funny. That's great. Yeah. I don't know. You mad in the middle. Hey, have a look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then you know, it's time to go up. It's time to go up, son. Let me talk to you about the birds and the bees. Yeah, man. Oh, that was cool. You know, it just shows you, bro. No matter how much money you got, people still like boobies. You know what I'm saying? And like it doesn't matter. Yeah. Yeah. I thought that was funny, though, but other things were going on. So you got the inauguration, right? A bunch of people there. Bados was there, Zuck's obviously there. Obviously there, a lot of celebrities, heads of states from other countries were there. You got a mad dog Hillary Clinton. I was shocked to see her there. I was shocked to see her. When they brought her out. Well, she knows you got booed. Oh, she did? Yeah, did you see that? No. Yeah, Hillary Clinton got booed. You know, they tied them both in, saying Bill and Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence got booed by mega fans as they entered the capital wrote to him. So the event was being streamed. They moved it indoors because of the temperature and the wind and all that stuff outside. I have people telling me it was all actually for other reasons. Yeah, I was told the same. Okay. Yeah. It wasn't just because of the weather. But they moved it inside. And so what they did was they set up a bunch of different locations that were kind of just live stream in the event going on. And so yeah, so there was a shits on a fans who were in one of the viewing locations. And when they announced their economy, they was fucking insane. Check this video out. I mean, right for me so, right? I'm going to grab it to you. Well, I mean, they've done nothing but destroy America's culture and intentionally for years and years and years since 2008. We've had nearly 20 years of destruction from these same group of people. I mean, I think booing is very polite considering what they actually deserve in my opinion. For sure. Well, the only part that I didn't like was the fact that I mean, it wasn't like they were piping the music in from the audience. So it's like they don't know they were getting fucking boo. They're walking like they're the shit still doesn't stink. But I don't think they were booing Bill. I think he's fine. But I mean, Hillary definitely got it. Did you see that the fucking one of the sources for the Epstein, who was it? Someone involved in the Epstein case said that it's going to come out here any day in the D class that Bill Clinton was the number one pedophile at Epstein Island. No shit. Oh man. Not my words. That's what they said. I mean, I'm not going to be a retract my statement there. Yeah. We'll see when I mean, we'll see. I mean, the inauguration with smooth, I tried to deliver to a great speech. I thought, I mean, it was actually one of the shorter ones, but I mean, I thought he did really, really well in the speech. A lot of stuff still on the agenda while the show's going on. Apparently he's set to sign over 200 executive orders on day one, which is, it's a lot. I mean, I'm honest. And I think here's my fear is that like my personal issue. Like, yeah, I have no problem giving some criticism on Trump. Okay. Well, we're going to have to. That's what we do. I mean, that's what we do. What we do. If we want the country to actually be free, we're going to have to call it as we see it no matter what. 100%. But my only issue, I mean, 200 executive orders, stuff gets lost in the sauce. You know what I'm saying? So it's like, you know, we can plan about Biden doing 48. Yeah. Okay. You know what I'm saying? And like, you have like, we got to be careful, man. There's a lot of hypocrisy going on with that. You know, so we'll see what those 200s are. We know a couple of them so far that he's talking about. Well, I think there's a lot of things that need to be corrected. Yeah. For sure. You know, I don't know what they all are. I don't know what all the 200 executive orders are. But I think there's at least that many things that need to be fixed. Yeah, for sure. But that's what I'm saying. But what is it? Yeah. We don't know all of it. But we do know a couple of those things. He's valuing to release and declassify the JFK, RFK and Mok assassination files in a massive transparency push. What do you think? What's your thoughts on that? Well, I think it makes him a huge target for the CIA. Yeah. And I also think that that is not enough transparency to regain the trust of me and the government. You know, maybe the average person who doesn't really pay attention, but I feel like it could go one of two ways. I think if you're going to have the trust be restored in our country, you're going to have to have a massive declassification of all the shit they've lied to us about, which is right. Okay. We fund the government. It's our money. It's our country. You represent us is not them that should be able to decide what we get to know and not know. You get to know everything and then decide what's important and what's not important. Okay. And I feel like this could be, you know, throwing up a bone, you know, like, hey, we told you this. It was really. But what about all this, too? Right. You know, well, you don't need to know that. And I just don't think that that's the way it should be handled. I think, you know, I think we need a massive declassification. We need to go across many different situations and, you know, centuries of time so that we can know the truth about things that have been going on. Because otherwise, we're not going to believe the government no matter how many executive orders he signs. And what I'm afraid of is he comes in and, you know, makes the economy better. Everybody starts making more money and people kind of forget about what's out there in terms of resistance to our country, meaning the communist insurgency that we just had a deal with for fucking 15 years, 16, almost 20 years. And then we get back in place. Yeah. And, and part of me wonders if that's his job to do. Like is that what he's here to do? Is he here to rally it? Rally everybody up and then drive us into a situation, you know, that is a technocratic surveillance state. You know, that's what a lot of people think. A lot of people think that he is part of the cabal and that he is going to come in. His job was to rally and get everybody hyped up behind him and he's going to come in and basically, you know, allow the economy to heal and things to get better and then use this, you know, connection of Bezos Zuckerberg, Elon to usher in new technology that is just going to create a more of a surveillance state, take away more freedoms, digitize everything. And that's the case. This isn't good for us, you know what I mean? But I don't believe that's the case. I don't think the pretty thing is not. I hope it's not either, but I'm just saying there's a lot of people to think of that. Yeah, for sure. And I think that if he comes in and he does what he's supposed to do, he declassifies, he deports, he creates, you know, a better education system, a better accountability for crime, makes our city safer, fixes the economy. I think those are things that have to happen regardless. And I think it's our responsibility during this next four years to resist the pushing of a technocratic surveillance state. If that's the direction that it goes towards, even more. So, no matter who's enough. Yeah, and we're going to have to wait and see. We're going to have to wait and see what happens. You know, AI is a big point of contention for a lot of different reasons. I mean, dude, look, man, just in the last two years that AI has really been around, I mean, there's videos on the internet, well, been around to us. There's videos on the internet. You can't fucking tell their AI. Like it's getting really good. Wait, wait until two years from now. You know, there'll be no actors. There'll be no influencers anymore because all the influencers would be fucking fake people because they make these people more perfect than the people that exist in reality. So it's going to be a really interesting four years. But here's something that people need to keep in mind. Is that nothing is going to change unless culture changes? And that means the individual has to change. And that's a message that we've echoed on this show since the existence of this show is that personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion. And if individuals don't take the responsibility seriously to make money, be fit, be healthy, be unified, you know, be educated, be intelligent, know what's going on, get involved in your community, be a good example for the people around you, for your own family, your neighbors, your peers at work. All of these things have to happen on an individual level for this country to get back on track. I, you know, the way that the country has been indoctrinated for the last 20 years or so has really been like, let's wait for my person to get in office and then things will get good for me. Well, you know, four years from now, my guy, I'll be back and then things will get good for me. And we have all these people who are putting themselves in this like wait state, you know, like let's wait and see or let's wait and push through. And that's only creating more of what these people want. They want inaction, they want poverty, they want sickness, they want people not paying attention, they want people drunk on the comforts of life that are inexpensive, right? The shitty food, alcohol, you know, drugs, they consistently wanted that for a long time. And I think there's a lot of good things happening. I'm definitely not doom and glooming. I think there's great things happening. However, it's still going to come down to the individual taking up the responsibility of being an American citizen and living that standard day in and day out. And if that doesn't happen, nothing's going to change anyway, no matter what executive orders he passes, no matter what he discloses. So the health of this country is in our hands. And I see the next four years as an opportunity for all of us to capitalize and put our culture in a place where they can't push us back to this communist shit again, right down the road. So, you know, I don't know. There's a lot to be said for everybody's part in this, but, you know, we have to understand that as citizens, there's a responsibility that we have and we have to take responsibility for our own lives in order for this country to be great. That's the truth. And that hasn't happened in a long time. I think the other thing too that like it does give me hope in that, you know, Trump's going to do some necessary shit that needs to be done. And the, you know, what I use as a sign on this is like to see the reaction of the people who have been committing these things, right? And so the first thing I want to point you to, and I sure if you saw this, a federal employees quietly edit job descriptions to protect roles from Dodge scrutiny. This just came out from CNN a few days ago, but apparently people are going in the database. Federal employees are going in and they're changing their description of their jobs, changing the names of their jobs to kind of shield them from any type of, you know, scrutiny that's going to come from the new Department of government efficiency. So I mean, you see stuff like this and like people are definitely freaking out because they know the fucking whips coming, you know what I'm saying? They know it's coming. You can see it through actions like this or more recently. And I know this is on everybody's, you know, they got to cover this. We're going to cover it. President Biden preemptively partens General Mealy, Anthony Fauci in January 6th Committee members. This came out this morning, okay, hours before the inauguration. Twenty minutes. That was like seven a.m. This was ours. His family was twenty minutes. But he pardoned these people at seven a.m. this morning, okay, several hours before the inauguration where he completely pardoned these people. And it was a full sweeping preemptive pardon. This was the memorandum that got released at seven a.m. this morning. And you know, it's interesting. And obviously the main question here is, okay, well, I mean, if they didn't do anything illegal, what's the pardon for? Right? It's interesting. Well, they did do something illegal and they know they did shit illegal. And so does Biden. All those people did. They pulled a fucking coup. They stole election. They pulled a coup. They engineered a quote unquote pandemic. They tried to usher in a gender 2030 driven by the world economic forum that committed crimes against humanity. They made people, they lied to people about what therapeutics were effective. They put people in fucking jail like the, those, that group of doctors that was basically at the front line doctors, the frontline doctors. And they took away their medical licenses. Like doctors that were prescribing, I've remected and we're getting their medical licenses take away. Pharmacists were calling the fucking federal government on doctors who were prescribing hydroxychloroquine and I've remected to people and getting their fucking medical licenses revoked. Pharmacists were doing that for saying the truth. Yeah. For saying the truth. No, bro, and it was an example. First of all, it was crimes against humanity. Second of all, it was an example of mass formation psychosis like what's his face was saying on, you know, what it was. People didn't give a fuck that was right or wrong. They just wanted their shit to be right. You were going to fucking do what I say. Like the amount of, the amount of power hungry citizens that came out of the woodwork to try to force people to do things is fucking absolutely disgusting. And quite honestly, it changed my viewpoint on humanity and our country as a whole. I no longer look at those people as people that I can deal with because if something were to happen again, those people have already shown their true colors. They will tell on you, they will fucking get you put in jail. They will ruin your life. They will kill you if you go against there. And these are these are the dumbest motherfuckers in society. Okay. If you fell for this shit, you're a dumb motherfucker. That's it. Okay. You don't have the capacity to think critically. You don't have the capacity to work through and think logically. And that proved it. That proved it. You are willing to disregard family members. You were willing to ruin relationships. You were willing to call the police on people who didn't do what the fuck you wanted them to do. Those people are not safe to be around. They are not safe. They are not your friend. They are not your family. They are not safe to be around. You should not trust them. And I believe that. And I always believe that. What brought what it was? It was people. I'll never ever ever forget it, dude. Never. Well, what it was, brother, was people who are always picked last for fucking kickball, getting the fucking captain of the team spot. That's what it was. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. The amount of fucking abuse that we took was insane. And we were right about fucking all of it. They brought me, listen, I remember firsthand, because I had my first daughter during the COVID-19. They almost didn't let me see my daughter during the delivery room, bro. They don't say like they force. They force one of my best friends to watch his dad die on a fucking Zoom call. It's, it's a thing. They forced another friend who had someone die. But they weren't allowed to have a fucking funeral. Yeah. Okay. This is, this is the hysteria that was caused by these people who just got pardoned. And they caused it intentionally to disrupt 2020. So the fucking Trump wouldn't get reelected. Yeah. You know, and, but, you know, I mean, dude, the individuals that did it, I'll never forgive them. No, I'll never forgive them. I hope they figured it out. I hope they've come over to the fucking good side. I hope they've realized it. But unless those people sit down with me and have a fucking real apology to me, I'm never going to trust them again. I know. Those people are off the fucking team. They're off the team forever. I'm not letting them back in my life because they're fucking dangerous. And you should think about that too. Those people would fucking turn you in to a fucking concentration camp. Think about the crazy shit that we just went through over the last four years. Think of how close we were to becoming legitimate, like fucking a communist country where they were fucking genociding people because they didn't want to take a fucking vaccine or they didn't want to, you know, wear a mask or they didn't want to tell their employees that you fucking don't have a job. It was an intentional play dude to ruin the economy. And there's a lot of it. Ruined the economy, steal the middle class, like Joe Biden said in his ex-interests. He's like, we have the largest middle class. We created the largest middle class. Yeah, you didn't create the largest middle class by bringing people up. You created the largest middle class by stealing everybody's fucking money during COVID. And middle class, I think it was low class. Yes. Yes. No, middle class is not. They took people who were above middle class and pushed them in a middle class and then ran on that and said, oh, we created the largest middle class. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. You know, poverty, well, the thing that was interesting too, like with these parties that he put out, you know, specifically on this first set, you know, in the memo, he says, in certain cases, quote, in certain cases, some have even been threatened with criminal prosecutions. Who has been threatening them with criminal prosecutions? Because like Trump hasn't showed his cards on this at all. Not fucking once. You know, I'm saying like, who's threatening them? Nobody's threatening. There's been no fucking filing of documentation. I don't know. We've been saying that you're going to fucking public execute. The people have for sure. The people have for sure. But there hasn't been any official fucking documents that have been entered. You know, I'm saying, nobody's actually started the processes on this. You're preemptively partying these people for, you know, stuff that apparently they didn't do it at all. Like what it was. Well, and it goes back 2014, which shows you when they started planning all of this. It's a slip. It's like, bro, who how? Well, one of the other parts, I don't know if you saw this one, but one of the other parts, he could part in that Capitol Hill cop that that shot and killed Ash the Babet. He put, he put him into the sweeping preemptive partens and then minutes before the inauguration as you alluded to. Barton by an announced blanket pardon for his brother James, burying family, influence peddling probe for good. I don't think these partners, I don't think, listen to it. They can't stand. No, I don't think they should stand because I think what should happen is there should be an investigation to prove that 2020 election was stolen, which it fucking was, was really invalidated his president and invalidate the pardons. 100%. Yeah. Also, pardons don't apply to crimes against humanity. So there's still hope here. And also, they don't apply to state level. Okay. So if the state's taking up on their own, what you're doing it already, Florida's already doing it. Well, you know what, you know what my take is on all this? What's an emission of guilt? They would have been better. Would have been better off not doing it because now you got everybody stirred up a lot to shit again. Bro, like my thing on this, bro, here's my thing. Let's say, let's say, you know, they don't go that route with, you know, he wasn't really the prey, like, even if all of that was true, knowing what we know with the shit that these people have done, fuck those pardons. Yeah, I agree. Fuck them. They mean absolutely nothing. The amount of damage and destruction is big. I agree. And they will do it again. And what it shows is is that people could commit literal treason against the people of this country and get away with it by just saying, oh, well, you pardoned. And by the way, not only did they fuck us all, they fucking stole our fucking money, too. Mm-hmm. And tripled it. Yeah. Fucking quadrupled it, bro. Yeah. It's insane, man. So I mean, a lot of the stills come, I know with a pardoned situation. I don't think Melania Trump is thinking about pardons right now. She doesn't, I don't think that's not to kill a fucking husband. I don't think that Trump is either, dude. I think we're going to see some fucking some headwacking happen here. Bro, you know, I was watching when I was watching the speech, you know, and you see the crowd stand up and shit and you look and behind them and you see fucking the Biden, you see the Obama's and you see the fucking Clintons and shit. Yeah. Part of me was just hoping, brother. I said, Trump would just be like, you know what? And we're going to start. Rest them all. We're going to start right now and bring like bro, I was praying for that. Yeah. I might still be my, you know, tin hat, tin foil, stuff, but man, bro, those people deserve to be in fucking jail. They deserve to be in jail forever. And that's being light. That's being light. The Clintons, the Obama's, the Kamala's, the Biden's, they all deserve a fucking traitor's sentence. We all know what that is. They all deserve it because the disruption that they fucking caused over the last 20 years, most people still don't understand. Most people don't understand that the fucking Russia collusion was made up by Hillary Clinton's team. And then they all ran with it. And then they plastik you to this dude, they fucking embarrassed them. They do, they tried to bankrupt them. And then they're all sitting there like, oh, this is just politics as usual. No, fuck you. I'm going to tell you this. That were me. I'd be like, yeah, those parties don't, this probably will never be present. But I fucking look at them and be like, yeah, fuck those parties. Some public executions today. And then I would get on TV and I would say, this is why we did that. No one's ever doing it again. No, I'm not trying to stay in office. Yes, we're going to continue the rules of this country. But those people do not abide by the rules of the country. We're going to have accountability. And so if you ever think you're going to do this ever again, this is what will happen to you. And set a precedent for what happens to fucking traders. These people are traders, dude. Straight up. Yeah, I mean, you know, look at them sit there and act like they're like, you don't get to fucking safe. Bro, you don't get to do what you've done to this country and then sit there and act like this is politics as usual. Jill Biden, you look like fucking people from Walmart. That's the fuck she looks like. New logo or old logo? No, she's old logo. She's the old crusty logo. She's the old clammy logo. Fucking clamshell. Clam shell. Fuck. Oh, they're so nasty. She's fucking, dude, she's fucking looks like a people of Walmart trying to fucking, I can't stand them, dude. They're all standing there whole group. Those people have caused more pain to the American citizens than any outside fucking army has ever caused. They killed more people than any fucking outside army. Americans. Yes. Americans. Letting the fucking crime happen, letting like, dude, what the fuck? Oh, we all pardon ourselves. How about no? And then we see all these same fuckers who censored Trump kicked them off the platform, donated all the money to fuck them. I'm all sitting on his side. Trump better not make the same mistakes that he's made, dude. I hope not, man. Because this is the same shit he did last time. He let all these people get close to him and then they all fucked him. Well, I think they're important thing and you talk about this a lot too, man. Like, I mean, just on some real like truth here, you know what I'm saying? It's okay to make a mistake that you got to learn from it. You know what I'm saying? I think that's one thing. I mean, he's admitted that, you know what I'm saying? There's things that I've done. All the censorship that we face for the last fucking four years is sitting right there in that picture. Right there. I mean, Elon Musk can't really hard him too much, but no, but that's fucking Google, dude. Google beta. Yeah, fuck it's all there. You know, so I mean, listen, America is back, maybe. America's only back if the American citizen is back. That is it. Okay, if the American citizen does not fucking take responsibility for their own existence, America is not back. No politician's going to change it. Yes, Trump's going to come in and change some laws, change some rules that are going to be beneficial. They're going to create more opportunity. They're going to allow people to chase the American dream a little bit more freely. But we have a long way to go to ever be considered free, especially when the tax code is the way that it is. And I've heard very little talk about reducing the income tax to where it's not oppressive to the citizen. Where are we talking about that? The income tax should be fucking eliminated. The one guy who's talking about the income tax being eliminated and brought down a 10% is basically kicked off the Department of government efficiency now and Vivek's going to run for governor of Ohio. So like, what are we talking about here? I got my concerns, bro. You know what I'm saying? But the reality is is that if the American citizens don't stand up and they don't do what it is they need to do, they don't take responsibility for their own lives and they continue to say, oh, well, Trump's in. Things are going to be good. I think that your entire existence depends on one man, thousands of miles away from you and you're going to give up and defer responsibility for your own existence. That's the case, dude. America's going to be shit. That's it. So the way it's going to get better is for us, the people, to take back our lives and that has to happen. Yeah, that's real shit. But guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. With that being said, let's go, let's go cruise some of these comments. This first comment comes from at Michael, a perurek, April, April, whack, April, whack. Yep. He says, five foot, five guy here can't confirm we're mad all the time. Well, at least he's honest. Is what it is? Yep. All right. Sorry. I make shoes for that. Yeah. Next one. This next one. Oh, man, almost read this one on stiff sock. 201. Stiff sock. Why is that your username? Brother, what is that? Stiff sock. I don't know. What's he got to say? Let's see what he says. Stiff sock, 201, he says. It is, it was at 1004. My wife is Italian, Brazilian. She's the love of my life. She's beautiful, smart, hardworking, and again, beautiful. She's right behind me holding a cast iron pan. I love her very much. I'm so lucky to have her. She's got retarged strength. She is a fantastic cook and is one of the most creative people I know. If I said anything bad, she's going to beat me with that retarged strength and cast iron pan. I love her very much. Yep. I mean, Italian, Brazilian is a pretty, that's an interesting mix. That's an interesting mix. That's an interesting mix. I think this is a cry for help. Oh, man, that's a rough. Yeah, that sounds like a cry for help. Somebody go check on stiff sock over there. Like twice. Yeah. Let's do a courtesy check on him. Well fair, Chad. Yeah, man. All right. Last one. Yeah. From at B keeping 69. He says down to gas station, Rhino pill with the great first form energy and got my shit looking like Mike Tyson's neck ready to pedal fit out my hellcat and I registered my name. But what is wrong with these people? Pedal. What's a Rhino pill? It's dick pill. Yeah. That's interesting combo. Did you write this comment? No. Yeah, the hellcat gave it away, man. No, I want to say this. I'm like my guy's. Oh, man. All right. That's cool, man. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, Rhino pills for everybody. Hey, my people are interested, man. Yeah, they're interesting guys. We do appreciate you though. We appreciate you for being real ass fans. Keep liking commenting. Make sure you guys are sure. We appreciate you for being real ass fans. Keep liking commenting. Make sure you guys are subscribed and hit that bell notification. Stay up to date with the latest episodes from really. That being said, let's keep this cruise moving. Head on to. We're going to do a little. Let's go back in time a little bit because we got to cover these. We didn't get a chance to last week. Some of the nomination hearings were interesting. A lot of good stuff. There was some weird stuff going on though. I'm going to go first. Did you see this senator down in Georgia? He's a state senator for Georgia who was basically the leader trying to get Fanny Willis out of the prosecutions and stuff like that for Trump. He got assaulted and arrested while trying to enter the Georgia House chambers. Did you see this? This is interesting. All right. I got some thoughts on this, but let's dive into this. Are you posted this tweet? Is Senator Colton Moore? Senator Colton Moore exposed and defeated corrupt district attorney Fanny Willis last year has been arrested by the anti-Trump speaker of the House. Colton is being held in the same Atlanta jail as President Trump. This was tweeted from his profile. We are working to ensure his expedient release. Police pray for all of those standing up for our freedom and peace for all Georgians team Moore, who's the clip? Check this out. He shows some restraint in our woman at Old Man's Ass. He's a real man. He wanted to. You could tell. And that ain't no little dude, bro. That's what got me. Bro, how'd you fall? Well, there's fucking, I mean, he tripped over to sign behind him. And you got 16 state troopers there. So they arrested this guy? They arrested this guy. Really? He's an elected member of the organization. So these guys are just arrested and whoever to fuck disagrees with them. Whether they... That's what I'm saying. And nobody talked about this. That's why I'm like, I saw him. What the fuck is going on down in Georgia right now? I don't know. I don't know. That's weird, though. I'm surprised he can get up swinging. Bro, I would have. Self-defense. Yeah. But you gotta be careful with what you're doing in there. Also wanted to bring into the... We talked about it a little bit, Pam Bondy. I know, I buddy, Eric Schmidt's a big fan of her. I know they've worked closely when he was the AG here. She was the AG of Florida. There was some cool dialogues. I really like... I didn't know much about her to be honest. I really didn't. But I watched through some of her... or nomination hearings. And I thought she was pretty cool. Let's check this clip out. This was one of her exchanges. It's happened last week. Take us out. About the day. About the day, yeah. After I gave an opportunity to study overnight. So can you tell me in this committee what the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment says? Senator, I'm here to answer your questions. I'm not here to do your homework and study for you. If I'm confirmed, I'm just wondering if you're interested in what I'm doing. I'm asking for a confirmation book, Pam. Hey, you cut me off. Can I please finish? What does the 14th Amendment say? Senator, the 14th Amendment, we all know addresses birthright citizenship. I've been a state prosecutor. I've been a state AG. I look forward to even given your remarks today, working with you and the people of California if I am confirmed as the 87th Attorney General of the United States of America. I didn't take your homework assignment. I'm sorry. Pretty bad ass. You know she's 60 years old. Shut the fuck up. Yeah. She's 60? Yeah. 59 years old. She must've got some black in her. I don't know. She's going to look 59. I'm locked in the whole man. She's 60? 59 years old. Oh man. Yeah. No. And these, yes. And these dudes are in here talking to her like she's some 25 year old bimbo. She's like, I'm sorry to take your homework assignment. Take face. She's dick. Yeah. I like her though. Yeah. She's cool. Yeah. She tells these motherfuckers what's up. Tells them how hard to do your fucking homework asshole. I'm here for this. Yeah. You know what I mean? Talk me out. I don't know. I thought that was pretty fucking cool. She seems like a good pick. She seems reasonable. Other things that were going on. What? I mean, thinking what we just had. Yeah. That's true. You know. Fuck. That's true. Now I mean, the reason I, the other reason I wanted to bring her up to those is because, you know, we talk about this accountability part. She's going to be crucial in that. You know what I'm saying? As the federal AG, I mean, she's going to be very, very crucial in that process. And so it's going to be interesting to see. I mean, I don't know if this is more of like a warrior loyalty's lie type of thing, but I don't think these are like traditional times, bro. I don't think so either. You know, and so it's like, you can't use traditional methods. I mean, you can't go through traditional means. Like a lot of traitors to claim pardons for themselves. She's going to be crucial, bro. Listen, dude. The fact that fucking we have a group of traitors that just pardon themselves is unacceptable. Right. We did nothing wrong because we said we did nothing wrong. Yeah, that's right. Fuck you. Bullshit. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. So I mean, it's going to be very, very, very interesting to see what she does, man, and how she reacts. And that's what they were trying to grill her on. I don't think it worked. I mean, I think she held her on and, yeah. You know, she's in. So we'll see. Like I just want to do a little quick follow up on that. That's headline number two, not too much there. But let's go to a third of final headline. We're going to go travel the world a little bit, check out some other places with headline. Number three, this is an interesting one. I want to show you this. Okay. And then I want us to guess what happens next. Okay. Headline number three is Pope Francis. Resistance to immigration is a primal reaction. Okay. Pope Francis has reiterated his call for a more welcoming attitude towards migrants, insisting everyone has the right to dream of a better future. Yeah. Create a better future where the fuck you're from. He says certain populist political regimes as well as certain liberal economic approaches maintain that an influx of migrants is to be prevented to be prevented at all costs. And Pope's laments and a new encyclical letter titled Brothers All meaning the great numbers of lives are at stake. He says he wants to ask everyone to move beyond those primal reactions because there is a problem when doubt and fears conditions are way of thinking and hectic to the point of making us intolerant, closed and perhaps even without realizing it racist he warns. And his way fear deprives us of the desire and the ability to encounter the other. What do you think happened next? What should happen is you know all the migrants that come into Italy should be hurt hurt hurt hurt into or rounded up and put into the fucking Vatican and have him care for him if he loves him so much. Well, it's funny because you know the migrants try to do that. You know what happened? They probably wrestling. Vatican promises stiff penalties for illegal aliens crossing its border. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny how all the people know. Listen, it's funny how all the people who fucking advocate for migrants to be in other people's countries don't let them in their own. Right. They don't let them in the Vatican. They're not letting them in Israel, but every fucking Israeli guy is about. Oh, you're a racist. If you don't want how the fuck are we racist that we don't want fucking those motherfuckers in our country. But you live in a fucking ethno state. Right. How come China's not taking them? How come India is not taking them? Why is India made up of Indians? Why is China made up of Chinese? Why is Japan made up of Japanese? Why is fucking every Arab company country made up of fucking Arabs? Why is that? Why is it that only Western Christian nations are told that they have to bring in all these migrants? Right. Why, where the fuck are they bringing them in Israel? Where they bring them into the Vatican? Where are they doing these things? Oh, they're not. It's only good for the United States of America. It's only good for Europe. It's only good for those people to take in third world people that fucking come in and commit a shit ton of crime. And openly talk about raping your women and re-re-designing the gene pool and the racial disparity in one's country. Where, how do that work? It doesn't. It's a lie. It's fucking bullshit. And the Vatican's part of it, in Israel's part of it in a period. No, we got to welcome everybody. And then they double their fucking security. Right. Like, how does that work, man? They're liars. How does that work? It's so crazy to me. Vatican's in with the world economic force. Oh, 100%. They're in on the globalization. I mean, dude, why don't you ask the Native people of France what they think? Or the Native people of Italy what they think? The Native people of Germany what they think? Or the Native people of Holland what they think? Or the Native people of England what they think? Ask them. Irolynt. Ask them if they think that fucking immigration should be happening. They'll all say fucking no. But then everybody pushing for it who's not from their country is forcing it upon them. Right. Right. Well, you know, you know, I saw this thing a while ago. It was like the most popular baby boy name in Ireland is right now. Muhammad. Yeah. It's been that way for years. You know what? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like it's just crazy. Now, we got the Vatican doing this, you know, this back and forth or. Well, listen, people have citizenship for a reason. Okay. Every fucking citizen of another country should be forced to go back to their regular country. And we'll do a global reset of where the fuck everybody's supposed to be. That's what he's to have. That's where. Well, that's why we have it. Why would we have citizenship of countries if what's the point that's supposed to be in the fucking country you're a citizen of? What's the point? What's the point of it then? I agree with you. Now, some places, you know, we will say this, there are some places that you're starting to see. And I don't know if this is tied into DJT being back in and they know that, you know, how we're going to be handling the shit here. But you do see some other country starting to start to wake up. Right. Let's go to sweet and first here come the deportation Sweden to change constitution and remove citizenship from fraudulent migrants and threats to the state. There's a new word on the street. They don't want to use deportation anymore. They're saying remigration is what they're not calling it. And that's a strong trend in Europe against not only illegals, but also non-assimulating or criminal migrants who have already obtained citizenship. So while the European establishment is going mad over Germans, AFD's electoral chances, some of the political actors that already empower also advancing in this issue with vigor. Sweden has just made a promise. The current government announced yesterday, this is back on the 15th, that it will change the constitution. So it has to take away passports from people who got their citizenship by fraudulent means, where else are a threat to the state. So they're about to start doing this mass remigration in Sweden. Isn't that the home of the WF as well? No, that's Switzerland. Yeah, Davos, they all look the same. How sweet of the head this one's the head. But Swedish people deserve their own country. I do. Why shouldn't Swedish people have their own country? Why shouldn't French people have their own country? Why shouldn't English? Why shouldn't Spanish? Why shouldn't Italian? See, that's diversity. Right. It's global. No, listen up. Listen, diversity is not what they say it is. What they're trying to do is create one thing. Right. They're trying to mix all these cultures and all these races to create diversity. That's not diversity when you go to France and it looks the same as Spain and it looks the same as Italy and it looks the same as Switzerland and it looks the same as Sweden and it looks the same as the United States of America. That's not diversity. Diversity is I want to go to Europe and I want to experience French culture. I want to experience Swedish culture. I want to experience Italian culture. I want to experience American culture. All right. We are being forced into the opposite of diversity through the efforts of these people and then they call it diversity. What's diverse about having all the people look the same? That's not diverse. Right. Like, diversity is not making a movie on Netflix and all the characters being fucking one race. Right. It's not diversity. Okay. Removing certain fucking citizenships and certain cultures, customs in this name of other people's customs is not diversity. That's elimination. That's genocide. Okay. And you don't think it's genocide. People don't think it is because they're not killing them. But what they don't realize is they're inner breeding people so that in three generations a Swedish person doesn't exist. And I'll be real. And I'll be real. Swedish people are pretty good looking. I like to look at Swedish people. They got their own little vibe going on over there. All the women are beautiful. All the men are tall and good looking dudes. They got the shit. I would like to go to Sweden and visit Sweden. You understand? I want to go to Italy and see all the fucking Italians. I want to go to France and see the French. That's what the fuck we're supposed to do. If I wanted to see everybody else, I'd go to all these third world shitholes and go visit those places. Right. We are not responsible to harbor all of these cultures at the expense of our own. And that is fucking facts. And I don't give a fuck if someone calls a racist or whatever they call it. Everybody has a right to their own place. They have their own place. If they want to create prosperity, learn fucking economics. Learn how to produce. Learn how to farm. Learn how to manufacture an export. Maybe we should create programs for that. Oh, we already've done that. It doesn't work. So fucking anybody who argues for the shit anywhere across the world should be required to have these people, at least one family of these people living in your home. Otherwise you get no vote, no say, no opinion whatsoever, unless you are actively taking care of one of these families. Otherwise, shut the fuck up. I think that's how you solve it. But they won't do that. No shit they won't. Nobody will. It's only a good idea when it's not in your home or not in your neighborhood or not in your house. And all of these rich motherfuckers live in fucking Switzerland and Zurich and fucking Davos and all these places where it's the most expensive place in the world, the fucking live. So they protect it. Yes. They protect themselves, man. Bro, these people are fucks. That's so crazy. But these people are fucks. They're the only people in the world that want everybody else to fucking be weaker so they can be stronger. That's really what it is. I know it is. And you know the fucked up thing is on top of all of that, you know, it's like these countries, you know, obviously America they tried it, you know, it doesn't work too much because we have guns. We are able to protect ourselves so far. But they punish these people that are speaking out their frustrations about this shit. Fucking Europe, they're putting them in prison. Bro, look in Germany. Okay. So the AFD chapter in German city district, they were distributing these flyers that are made to look like one way deportation tickets. All right. And now everybody's in a fucking meltdown. They're trying to fucking jail these people for this. This is crazy. So German elections, there's coming up in February of this year. Okay. All the parties are campaigning hard and all that good stuff. There's the alternative for Germany party, the AFD. And they have started pushing out these flyers that look like this. We're looking like this, right? And, uh, Bro, people that, I'm not going to say people because I know the people of Germany are with it because most likely AFD is going to win the election. Right? Because again, the people that are fucked like fed up of the bullshit. They're trying to jail these people right now. The people that are part of AFD party, they're trying to throw them in jail for doing this. You mean, you mean, you mean how they've been passing laws here where you can't, can't criticize any sort of, uh, Jewish anti, yeah, right. We have anti-Semitic speech laws in America. Think about that. We have no, there's no other anti-laws like that. You can say whatever you want, but you can't criticize those people. Why is that? Why can't you just defend yourself? Right. Right. It's a simple question. It's a simple question. Well, I'll tell you why. Because it's the same people that are advocating for this shit. Well, I mean, more, not even just advocating it. I mean, you look at the shit that they do. I mean, we're talking about this mass illegal, you know, influx of criminals we have in this country. You know, but when they put these bills out, when our government, our own government try to put these bills out, you know what I'm saying? To get rid of these people and the legal routes and ways to do it. You know, House Passes built to deport illegal aliens who sexually assault women and abuse children. 145 pro illegal alien Democrats vote no. How do you vote no to that? Because they're fucking beholden to the biggest packs in the fucking whole entire world that fund their entire campaigns. You've never heard of most of these people. Most of these people are no different than AOC. They're regular fucking people who are stupidest fuck, who somebody grooms and finds and then finances their way into the political office. And luckily, that's going to slow down and slow down and slow down because of what's happening in this country. But the reality is that this migration should always push by people who are the bottom paid for or people who are from ethno state countries that don't want those people in their own country. It's sad. Now, with all of that, one of the things that Donald Trump did push out of the world is sad and he needs to end. And he needs to. Yeah. Here's the other thing too. I guess people are waking up to it. It's not going to be pretty though. And that's what people have to come in terms with. This shouldn't going to be pretty. Today, Donald Trump, President Trump, I'm sure you saw this, but he put in a national emergency two day. Right? That just got put in on the Southern border. And he did a couple of things with that. He designated the cartel as a terrorist organization. Great. Right? That opens up resources and other tools that we can use with those. Those people because the shit that they're doing is it's unreal. On American soil. Yeah. On American soil. Yes. Right? Fuck, bro. Start drawing them, man. Start to fuck out of these people. Fuck. It was just going to put them back into fucking a thousand years before Christ. We are invaded. I mean, there's a war happening in our country. You got to handle it. But he put this in. And, you know, so we'll see what happens with this. You know, but he didn't put it in. So I mean, it opens up money. All of that stuff. Let's check the clip out from President Trump. There's a doubt. We will not forget our constitution. And we will not forget our God. Can't do that. Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. So all about common sense. First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. The only people that stand in Biden, Paris and their spouses and Barack Obama. What does that tell you? That tells you they did it on fucking purpose, dude. Those people are fucking dude. They're fucking traders. I'm going to tell you this, dude. It is really, it really is a good thing that I'm here behind the podcast microphone for a lot of people and not in that position. He handles himself with much more discipline and much more fucking tact than I possibly could considering what these people have done. Knowing what they've done. Yeah. And maybe he'll do it his own way. And I hope he does. I fucking hope he does, dude. Yeah. All illegal entry will immediately be halted in the end. And I'm going to tell you this. All illegal entry will immediately be halted. And we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. I will end the practice of catch and release. And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. Under the orders I signed today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Why would we let fucking tens of millions of people in this country with no fit and just men? Why would we do that? I mean, look at this picture. You have to make that speech takes this picture. It's one woman. There's like 15 people in a picture. There's one woman. Bro. Let him in. And then you double up security. Like, come on, man. Yeah. Like I said, the shit's not going to be pretty. I think we pretty look at it, but you gotta get over it. I think it'll be pretty. Yeah. I mean, it won't be palatable to some people. It won't be palatable to the fucking white brunchers. That's it. No for real. It won't be palatable to them. Oh, we're good. Fucking, they'll have AOC doing some drama piece. Bro, listen, we got a quit having sympathy for people who shouldn't fucking be here. We got a quit having sympathy for criminals. I don't give a shit what happened to someone 20 years ago that caused them to do the thing that fucking caused my family member to be dead now. Right. We don't care. Okay. This is absurd. We're giving more leniency and more fucking care and more resource and more empathy to the fucking criminal elements. We're giving more fucking criminal elements of this world than we are the good people who follow the rules and who do what they're supposed to do, who can tribute and pay the tax that is then turned around and used against them to bring these criminal elements to them. It's fucking absurd and it needs to end and people need to start being fucking vocal about it. And dude, I love what's happening in the country today. I'm ecstatic about what's happening in the country today, but don't think for a fucking second that we shouldn't be holding the Trump administration accountable to follow through on all of this shit and clean this shit up. Yeah, 100% man. I think he's pissed off and I think he's going to do it. But if he doesn't do it, I hope the people who are like, oh, daddy Trump blah blah blah will be just as critical of Trump as they were of anybody else for not following through. I can promise you I will be 100% the only thing I'll say on that man is like, you know, because they asked him one of those. I think he has a chance to be the greatest fucking president ever in the history of fucking United States. And I think he knows that. And I think after he got shot, he really knows that. And I hope he brings the mother fucking thunder on these people, bro. Well, I say this. I mean, it's very clear he's still holding his cards, right? Because there when he signed like one of the first when he was signing the nominations, right? And getting these people into his cabinet. One of the journalists, she tried to ask him, hey, what do you think about, you know, Biden's partens and stuff is like, we're not going to talk about that right now. Yeah, like he's holding his cards. Yeah, you know, I'm saying. Listen, dude, we'll see when you have a illegitimate presidency, your partners don't fucking matter. We'll see. Guys, it's time to get to our final segment of the show as always. We got thumbs up or dumb as fuck. And I brought two of our favorite things. We like to cover for these sections. It involves bears and Indians. Kind of Indians. Like Indian Indians. Like Tato, not like Z-Shine. Oh, okay. Like 7-Eleven. Right. Right. That was kind. Yeah. Okay. Our favorite guy, they're good people. Yeah. Good people. Funny. You know, unless there's a human, hard work. Yeah. And apparently they'll do anything to protect their fields. So our thumbs up or dumb as fuck, have not reached. Fed up farmers in India have started wearing bare costumes to protect crops from monkeys. Fucking monkeys. They're not dealing with all the crops. They got monkey problems. And all you got to do to solve this dress up like a bear. Dress up like a bear and get rid of those monkey infestation you got. You. You. Dude, we're not going to be able to do this one. Oh, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Stop. Well, I mean, they've had to resort to this. It's fine. What will cause the degrees work to it? I listen. Let's dive into it. Let's dive into it. Let's try it. All right. Let's get it to it. All right. So farmers have been dressing up in bare costumes to scare monkeys and protect their crops. The farmers, based in the Indian state of utter protest, began wearing the costumes while patrolling their fields last month. Villagers pulled money together to purchase a bare costume, which the farmers take turns to wear. Now the farmers wash it between dirt. Oh, fuck no. Oh, no, no. You got to keep. You got to keep the you got to keep the the sense of the musk the musk. The monkey's no. Yeah, it's a real bear. It builds up. That's right. Right. You can walk it. You can't walk it. It's a real Indian bear. Well, so fun fact, I didn't even know India had bears. I didn't either. I had no, I had no idea. You know what I'm saying? So I just found out 10 minutes ago. Yeah, I thought like, you know, they were scared because like, oh, there's something they've never seen before. Not, but they actually do exist. This is this is the picture of an Indian sloth bear. Yeah. Okay. But yeah, so the farmers, they've been putting money together, working as a community. You know, it's a lot of them in those communities that work together. I don't get it. So it's not hard to come together and, you know, get up five bucks for out. I'll fit. Um, so I have a picture here of one of these farmers in the bear, bear, bear, bear costume. Here's the picture. Shut the fuck up, dude. That's not real. It's all you need. What is on his face? That's the man. It looks like some hills and ice. That looks like a fucking secret Hollywood horror movie. That looks like if Shane Gillis was a bear. Bro, that looks like fucking, uh, what's that, what's that fucking movie? It's the hills have eyes. Yeah, that looks like one of the people. Yeah, it does. But apparently it works. It works. So, you know, these monkeys have been a problem. So if you guys have a monkey problem at their home, just get a bear costume. Apparently, it does work. They keep the monkeys way from you shit. Yep. They won't steal anything. Bro, you're so racist. Why? Listen, this is groundbreaking shit. They're doing it over there. I'm sure it'll work everywhere. Bro, some of those monkeys are good. You get me, though. You've seen the videos you clip that like snatching the kids and shit? Stooping to purses and stuff? Oh, wait. No. Wait. Wait. Stouching the purses. No, it's real stuff. Next thing. Next thing. You're gonna say they're car jacking people, bro. What's wrong with you? No, listen. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So you're telling me to dock it to wear a bear costume so I don't get car jacked. Oh, my God, bro. No, bro. You guys have seen the clips. Okay. We're like the tourists. It's like China has this problem bad, too. Right? Like little bamboo's and stuff. They'd be stealing. Like even if you're a tourist, you know, they come up and try to take pictures. And the fuck? The monkeys like beat the shit out of them. Yeah. They steal their stuff. Just wear a brick-hosted. It's good. They get them right. It's working. It's working here. I mean, it's working in India. Is it working? Apparently, I mean, they're running off. You know, the monkey see the. This is a picture of the monkeys in the field. And they see that. They see that. They take one look. Like, nope, don't want none of that. And apparently, I don't want that either. Yeah. So, yeah. Indian farmers. Fixing shit. You know what I'm saying? Innovation. Innovation. Solving. Solving serious problems. It's a real problem. Yeah. It's a real problem. Yeah, man. Well, what we got? We got on this. I say thumbs up for innovation. Yeah. Listen, they got to protect their stuff. You know, they got to protect their stuff. I will say this though. The mass. You know, now that I'm looking at the bear picture again, the actual bear picture. You got the ears right. The neck. The ears are right. Sort of. But I mean, everything else is a bear. But I prefer it, man. I prefer it. No, you get it. I give it thumbs up. I like it. For what? I mean, if it solves a problem, what problem is it solving? It's the monkey still in the props. The monkey infestation. You know, usually, you know, usually, historically, you know, what's it? I give it thumbs up for innovation. I can cover it. Alright, guys, Andy, that's all I got. Alright, don't be a huff shirt show. Never sleep in on the flow. Now my jury box froze. Fuck up, bow, fuck up, stole. Counting millions in the coke. Bad bitch, booty swole. Got a own bank row. Cank foe. Dusset, no. Hits, shot, case, clove, clove.
