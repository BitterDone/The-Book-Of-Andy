What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the real estate goodbye to the lies, the thickness and delusions of modern society and the vocal. Another fucking reality guys today we have a special broadcast service announcement. I'll get to in just a minute. Yeah, we haven't done it a long time. It's been a minute. Black people breaking news. You like to throw in your races in many ways. I mean bro you ain't gonna do it. I gotta do it. I know I'm not gonna do it. No, I'm saying like that's from my strong suit. Your racism. Anyway guys welcome to real AF. This is your first time listening you're going to hear 75 hard versus episode which we'll get to here in just a second. But when you tune in on normal basis, this is a personal development entrepreneurship society and culture show all mixed into one and we have multiple formats today you're going to hear 75 hard versus other times you're going to hear Q and a F Q and a F is where you get to submit the questions we give you the answers. You can submit them a couple different ways the first way is guys you can email those questions into ask Andy at Andy for salad icon or. You can go on YouTube and go on the Q and a F episodes and drop your questions right there. In the comments and we'll maybe if you're lucky answer some from there as well other times we have CTI that stands for cruise the internet that's where we put headlines on the screen we talk about what's going on in the world we speculate on what's true what's not true and then we talk about how we the people can be the solution to the problems going on in the world other times we have real talk real talk is five to 20 minutes of me just giving you some real talk. And then we have 75 hard versus what you're going to hear today and today 75 hard versus is actually 75 hard versus me. We have a special guest to help communicate the 75 hard versus story none other than the person who lives with me and shares my house with me and basically knows everything about me so she can tell you all the shit that it's done for me. And then ask me some questions my amazing wife Emily for Sella. Thank you. Yeah. I was going to say what else are you going to intro like believe it cooks meals or what. I mean I'm just saying like who better to know what the fuck's going on the new. No, but that's what I'm excited about this doing this and we have talked about this like wanted to do the show for a while because people don't realize what you tell them but they don't understand like the nitty gritty like you give the macro perspective of like what change this or that they don't actually understand like I'm sorry you give them. I want to give like the micro of like all the little things that I noticed as your wife but then also I know like DJ as well you guys you know we're doing the program together and you finish phase one can raise start phase two all of that. So I just thought we'd be able to like cover a lot of people kind of an all encompassing show because you've never been the feature of any of these sunny hard versus shows so. Well, we thought it was two options. It was either me pretend and wear a different outfit and interview myself which we thought was a great idea. Yeah, it's still yeah, we still might do that or get Emily who knows the most about me of any human on the planet to interview me. Yeah, so I think first though because if anybody hasn't ever listened to show 75 hard kind of how it came about you've mentioned it before in like one or two shows but tell everybody kind of how study five hard came to flourishing like in that January when you made that bet and how much this one well when it first started it was. You know for me I've struggled with understanding my whole life like understanding why certain people had this ability to do things and make it look easy like stick to a diet or stick to a work. Out program or follow through and I was always confused on why people were able to do that I didn't understand that I thought people just had that or didn't have that and so I've always been obsessed to a point with mental toughness and mental mental you know discipline and things like this like I read all the books I I I I understand what they were saying but it never really click with me and it's still always felt like you know certain people had it and certain people didn't have it and at that point in my life where 75 hard came around I had just went from one of the hardest times of my life where I got myself up to 350 pounds and I pulled a bunch of the weight off. I was a bunch of the weight off of myself through just pushing myself through a hard program but I hadn't really fixed the problem I never fixed the problem and I noticed it was still hard for me to diet and it was still hard for me to eat right it was still hard for me to get my workouts in and I wanted to put together a program for myself that would help me fix that problem and so I thought I was going to do it. And so I thought about and I thought about it and I made a bet with the people in my RTA group we had an RTA meet up that was 75 days from the time when I started and I was going to stick to the program for 75 days when no no compromise no fail and a whole bunch of people decided to do with me I just announced it on the podcast and the next day I was starting and a bunch of people started to and that's kind of how it started and what I did to come up with the program was I picked the things the items that you know is 75 hard now you know eat eat clean diet train twice a day one of them being outside drink a gallon of water read 10 pages of personal development and take a progress picture and the reason that I picked these five things is because these five things were all things that I had found over the course of my life when I made the most progress that I was doing. Doing most of these things alright consistently and so I thought and thought and thought and was a student of you know what makes and what's develops mental toughness and discipline and really 75 hard was just me running the play that I thought was going to fix the issue and I was doing myself and it just so happened that I said it in public and a whole bunch of people started with yeah so that's kind of where it started. But something that you just said you said like the doing the things that you were consistent on that you knew were going to provide a result and a lot of people may not know you know we've been together 15 years and I've seen your weight when we started dating you were 30. Yeah you were 330 pounds and then you lost a bunch of weight when we went on vacation and then you had gained the weight back to about where we're yet three. Where were you at the second time when you gained weight because you went up and down about I think I got up to like 300 okay and then I worked back down again then you went down and then I went back up to like 350 exactly and then and I stayed there for quite a while right so from what I see that's like you were taking those little lessons like okay well I know this worked the first time I lost weight and then the second time I did I was actually adding this in because I added cardio and it wasn't just weights anymore so that was a component so like you going having those three large scale up and downs the time that I've known you it's like you took pieces and components from each of those lessons that you learn to kind of formulate this program because since you started this in 2019 your weight has not fluctuate at all you know I continue to get better continue to get better continue to build more muscle get leaner so it's like I just think that's important point to point out because so many people go up and down and yo yo dieting and this the way I see it it's like this is what actually got you to stop doing that well yeah 100 yeah 100% because I fixed the problem the problem is not let's not that people don't know what to do it's that people can't do what they know how to do right and that's the problem the problem is you do not have the discipline the grit the fortitude the mental perseverance to push through uncomfortable things for a long enough period of time and I recognize that because here's what would happen like I go to dinner with people like let's say my kuna ha right or somebody who's walks around for the moment the most part and pretty fucking good shape all the time and we be having dinner and and you know I'd look at the menu and I'd I'd have without any control I'd have to order whatever look the best for me right and I would go to dinner with these people who were my friends who walked around at a high level and they had discipline they could order a decent meal that was clean and yeah they could have a few drinks but that was never how I was I had to eat exactly what I wanted and then I would drink as much as I wanted because I was telling myself I'm going to start Monday anyway so it doesn't matter so I'm going to try to get this in now and then Monday I'll fix it and I that's all I got to be 350 no and you didn't just tell yourself that you told me that do yeah you know I mean like oh hey let's just eat this and we're going to start we'll hit it hard tomorrow and we were like okay so then because you and I like people don't like we would go out and drink like three nights a week yeah also when we were quote dieting we would have a cheat day and it would be as much as we could fucking eat till our stomachs hurt yeah we feel like shit until Wednesday get our shit together Thursday Friday Saturday then eat like shit again on Sunday yeah it was a cyclical thing yeah you know that's it I think that's I just recognized that certain people had the power to make the choice which I lack yeah I did not have the ability to say no to someone setting a beer in front of my face I did not have the ability to look at restaurant menu and order what I knew I should be eating because of the commitment I made to myself I lacked that power and I recognized that and and so that's where I honed in on what the problem actually was and this is the problem with all of you too listening your problem isn't that you don't know what to do okay your problem is is that you can't fucking do it which is what the point of the program is and what this program does is it takes all the components that are basically in every single fucking diet program ever and it forces you to do them over the course of time without fail for a long enough time that it actually changes what's going on in your mind so that you are now aware because that's what really happens on 75 hard it's not it's not that it like rewires your brain it's that it creates awareness to win your negotiating with yourself and you start to recognize that that negotiation is what's costing you all these things that you actually want in your life and when you can become aware of when you're negotiating and aware of when you're you know compromising and aware of when the bitch voices winning the battle which for most people that's almost all the time when you could become aware of that now you're a step closer to actually being in charge of your own mental dialogue and making the proper decision and so like I was just where everybody else is I just wasn't aware enough of the mental conversation that was happening in my brain the justification of the bitch voice nobody can tell you know you the shit you need to hear it's going to make you compromise your long term goals better than you like I know exactly what to tell myself like dude and we all do it we all do it present in those conversations bro we all do it and this is what the program is designed to fix it's a year long program people don't understand that you know 75 hard is the first phase and then there's three phases after that and you're you're supposed to do this every year you know so in every year that I've done I've got better which I'm sure we'll talk about but the point is I recognize what the real problem is and the reason there's been millions of people who have had success with this is because this actually addresses the real problem the real problem isn't that you don't know that you're supposed to drink water or you don't know that you're supposed to eat less calories than you know then what you're burning right you don't know that you're supposed to lift weights you don't know that you're supposed to move your body like we all know those things that's common knowledge but what you don't really understand is that knowing what to do and doing what you know to do are two different skill sets and the skill set that this program targets and the problem that solves is the ability to adhere to whatever plan that you decide to put in front of you which makes you infinitely powerful yeah so you touched on you know the the old Andy let's say the pre 70 have hard Andy so your mindset from like 2010 to 2016 you know you that's the up and down and wait it's the you know emotion regulation drinking cheat meals all start tomorrow mindset so was it just you know a lot of people like the picture that you know showing now if you're watching on YouTube so was there like a certain picture or a moment where you like fuck this I'm done with that or what what made you get to that point of like no it wasn't like that for me I knew I was fuck first of all I was strong all right so I was always the I was always an athlete and I was always very very strong so I built my my justification upon me being a fat slab who had no discipline upon the idea of being strong all right so when you can lay down on a bench and you can wrap out 405 pounds for fucking 20 all right you're stronger than most people on the planet all right now I know all you fucking strong men and power lifters I understand you're strong too there's a lot of strong people okay we don't need to whip out our dicks but I was strong as fuck okay and the the where I had built my identity was on that so I understood that I was fat but I also understood that I was strong so I justified it as okay you know like yeah you own a supplement company you're fat I'm like yeah bitch but I'll fucking lift your house you know that's what I'm saying so like you know that's how I always justified it which was a weak lie that I was telling myself that that kept me in this place where I wasn't happy because dude nobody knows how unhappy I was more than you like how many time like dude remember remember the fucking outfit that I used to wear that what yeah you'd wear your your t-shirt or your big hoodie and then you'd wear your baggy long cargo shorts what and do you tell the people about the shorts so we had these shorts that he would only wear that there was their only pair that he had because he couldn't and I didn't know this when we started dating but the only pair you could fit in that's right and that's why you would wear those and I would tease because one day he when he wouldn't we first met I said oh I like your shorts and then you warm every fucking time I saw you and I was like okay I told you I like them I didn't mean like you to wear them every time I thought he was like man like I really I'm glad she likes these I'm gonna keep wearing them I didn't realize they're the only fucking clothes he had to fit in yeah and so as the the shorts would start to tear or get worn out I would I patched him I patched those motherfuckers for like two years and so finally we had to have like a proper burial and move on to a new one pair of shorts that he had which were then can't because those were plaid yeah and then the new ones were camouflage yeah and finally yeah they're getting so thin and worn down the plaid ones that he switched to camel ones and he wore those and I patched those several times and then finally they got to be where you tore them somehow and they could not be mended and then you had to then you started wearing your MFC yo-short or you know your regular workout shorts of the time and that's really all you wore and then we would go out it would be one pair of jeans and your shirt and our member I would only wear a first form polo because first form made the polos and back then we actually put them on underarm or clothes and it was the only thing that like I felt like didn't make me look like fucking fat a shit but I still got yeah but and something that is a little side note or caveat to this like that I've noticed in your body language over the years I know I've said this a long time ago the pulling on the shirt yes so what he would always do is he would wear if he had to wear a t-shirt or even the polos he would consistently pull on them at the bottom and so when you would he would take them off they don't must be stretched like out a little bit because he kept pulling at it because he felt uncomfortable in them even though they weren't too short or anything like that but do you remember that time we were at my dad's house and we had he had a barbecue and we left early because of how uncomfortable I was yeah we did that we did that more than once yeah that you would be it's just be so uncomfortable and like not feeling good in your skin at all that we would leave places and we wouldn't go in places wouldn't go on vacation you know it was like you said on the show like we went on our first vacation since our honeymoon that was back in February so I was like we've been married almost 11 years now but it's like that was 10 and a half years gone by because just the ups and now obviously we're just not like super vacationy people either but it's because well that could true you do it yeah yeah but it's just you know him feeling so uncomfortable so when you stop when I've seen you stop pulling on your shirts like because that's like something that you almost did it like habitually where you even know you were doing it yeah I could start to tell that you your emotional state was also improving then because you started feeling more comfortable and actually who you were you know what you were like presenting outward yeah so dude it but it wasn't a it wasn't like a picture though it was I was tired of feeling like that yeah I was tired of because remember when I started with 75 hard I had already lost a hundred pounds okay because I lost I gritted out a hundred pound lost just like I had before in my life right you know I I did it the way that we used to always do it right eat clean and then I binge you know and then I eat clean and I was just stretching out the eat cleans long enough to where the binge wasn't eating it up right and that first year that I started dieting in 2016 for real where I haven't gone back you know I lost a hundred and ten pounds that year right and so then but it was still hard like I still wasn't like cured like it wasn't I was still struggling like I was like I would still go to a restaurant and yeah I could win the battle right I could order the healthy food but it didn't like feel natural um it was forced does that make sense like it was a very difficult decision and that's actually what led me to understanding that this is a mental problem this is not a physical fucking problem right this is a problem that people have to fix in their minds not in their body because I had already kind of fixed it in my body but my mind wasn't fixed yeah you see what I'm saying yeah so so that's that's sort of what created the motivation for me to take it past the level of just physical to the to the mental and and this is why a lot of people have so much difficulty understanding the mental that this is a mental toughness program and not a diet right or a challenge it's a program it's a program that you put yourself through to make yourself think about things in a different way than you've thought about them previously in your life and this is also why people who do the program the right way see drastic change in people who don't on day 76 they're going right back to their old habits because they compromised through the whole thing all right and they're pretending because it's a trend that they actually did it and the reality is if you actually did it you are terrified at the end to make changes because you just recognize how much progress you made so the crazy thing is like it's 75 days but there's like 10,000 battles mental battles bro it's every day in the like yeah yeah multiple a day yeah most of the day dude that that's a super important point yeah and I think what you said about the mental mental and physical connection that's a big thing people because when people want to lose weight they think just physical I just need to just like we use something well yeah I want we're going on vacation let's get a shit we were never gonna wedding let's get a shit exactly and yeah it was always guiding for a occasion right instead of like hey I just want to feel like a fucking great and tying in that mental aspect of it I think that changes everything because again it's like you're not out extra you know you're not just it's like let's say you have a house you put it's fallen down it like the foundations crumbling you can't just put fresh paint on it and new siding and call it new the inside the actual the you know literal the foundation is crumbling that's like the mental state of it like you're not fixing what really needs to be fixed first because if you fix the inside the outside will happen as well and I think that's the that's the biggest thing well I love it the program as well because it's all like a mental thing because you know when with Sloan's accident I started setting up hard right after it because it was a fucking very hard time yeah and I knew I needed that to snap myself out of it I had I could care less about any sort of the result that I would get it was just I needed that mental you know that mental focus it's so powerful for that yeah dude I think I think the main thing that most people need to recognize is that you're the state of your life on the x on the outside legitimately reflects the state of your mental state and we can fake it like we can we can die it and lose weight for a wedding or an event or or we can be productive in business like I was already very successful in business at this time it wasn't the craziest part about it right we're doing great yeah but where would I have been if I figured it's not earlier that's where you got to touch on that next so so so we can fake it we can we can push and we can go through phases and we can like get results but until you really recognize that this is a true mental issue and that the skills and the reason I call them skills is because they are skills they are not traits the skills of discipline the skills of fortitude the skill of mental perseverance the skill of physical perseverance these are things that you must develop and the way you develop things is by pushing through hard things and so when you start to look at it like that and you start to realize that that's the actual problem and that once you fix that problem now you're able to do all of these other things with literal with literal ease right like without you're you now become the person that you always looked at and you thought why do they have these things that I don't why is it easy for them and it's not easy for me oh they have better genetics know they fucking don't they got better habits and they built better skill sets in their own brain all right now if we're going to split the hair on genetics sure some people have better genetics than other people but you mother fuckers tell it yourself that everybody has better genetics than you and it's not fucking true and you know how I know you do that because that's what I used to do yeah so let's talk about the professional aspect of it so 2019 you're building this headquarters here so we're moving headquarters we were moving into our new house we are to send it it was a year old and we were having we moved into our house on May 1st and we had 250 people at our house on May 20th for a big party so we were going through all of that you're running us to doing the podcast all the other businesses and brands that you work with and consultant so you had a million reasons like to not do this so how did you prioritize that time or how did you move forward with all of these projects interesting that people say 75 hearts of fat and it's been going for five fucking years I know and getting bigger and bigger and bigger I know what other fat has done that a fat is 195 days I think I I read it yeah I read a article several months ago and it said I said what is the what is the gauge of a fat and I think it was like 195 days and I was like yeah we're kind of stretching that quote fat out there so like how do because that's the thing is like when you when people hear this sometimes they're like I don't that picture bother me there yeah yeah I was a picture that bothered me yeah so this is that was actually when you met Mike Cunehan when he when we met him in New York for the first time no I met Mike before that well that's when I was with you yeah yeah and yeah came back to St. Louis yeah that was I remember that because that that was your infamous polo and I had to keep that thing washed every day I think we had two of them revolving at quality meets in New York so when people are always like well I've got this going on I've got this going on the thing is is that I know you say on the podcast like oh you know you're busy your people would actually understand what the fuck your days look like because every single morning you get up and you rock for an hour then you cold plunge then you take calls at the house and get some work done before you come in here you come in here you work with all the teams you have meetings you know then you have to get your second workout in and then you record the show then you're recording the show for hours and hours and hours and I'm taking calls again till 10 11 o'clock and then lots of people don't get is like you know they don't understand they don't hear it 630 or 7 at night you come home you eat you go in the garage you take calls you have people over for white board sessions to help them or teach them or you have our teams over at night until 10 o'clock at night people don't see that because obviously like no what they think what they think is a lot is way out of line and reality of what it takes exactly they don't understand how much like when you say you're fucking busting your balls that's like you're you're not busting them you're fucking mash them because you were like yeah go crazy every single day and people don't realize that's what the years yes years and years decades now yeah so like if people can say I don't have time and I get personally offended by that I'm like are you kidding my mother fucking husband works is fucking dick off dude they don't think like that you got to understand that's not how people think people don't think that way they've hit they look at people like me for the most part and they say that guy got fucking lucky or that guy had rich parents or that guy fucking hit a trend or he fucked they tell just like you tell yourself why that beer matters or why that food is okay right now or why it's okay to walk around a 350 pounds they tell themselves stories about other people's success the same way and so when when when I try to help like the reason I don't talk about this shit is because nobody would believe it anyway like if I told him that you know what people would say look it for so a promoting hustle hustle culture well guess what mother fucker if you want to build a fucking massive mother fucking company in fact a whole bunch of them uh you're gonna have to hustle and it's gonna take all your fucking time and that's that and not everybody wants that I get that not everybody can even do that if anything wanted but the reality is what people expect success to take and what it actually takes art is the difference between fucking that puddle that you had to step over and the pacific ocean yeah it's totally if that's how big the difference is of what it takes versus what people think it takes and this goes for people to have careers this goes for people that are on sports teams this goes for people their own companies and this goes for actually putting work into yourself as well so how do you think that the program has helped you you know partly that into the business aspect of or actually all aspects of your life you know anything because again your building you know you built this facility moved in here now you've got two massive buildings going and across the street that are almost done and then growing all the other companies so you know how do you feel like you've bettered yourself through the program to give into like your employees and your teams well first of all I'm gonna say this and this is just reality like where we're at now the level that we're playing at now would not it would not be possible for me to play at if I hadn't worked on developing that skill set of mental toughness or to grit perseverance self-esteem self-confidence understanding that I build my own confidence understanding that I build my own self-esteem without that understanding that execution what I'm doing at this level is impossible all the people that I compete against at the level that I'm at they're all no they're they might not do the same things I do but these are high performing individuals these are people that are savage as fuck okay they're not pussies they're not talking about balance they're not talking about they're fucking journaling and their affirmations and their morning routine and all this shit they're fucking people who wake the fuck up and go in and crush every single day at a high level and that's where I'm competing against and so for me to even be at on that level because I dude I'm not some none of these people by the way are some gifted people these are people who earned these skill sets and this this is the problem people tell themselves when they look at people like that that oh they were born with that or they just have that or they just no they built that and that's what people have to accept as truth it's reality and so when we think about you know um the skill sets that we need like to even compete at a high level you have to understand that you could get pretty far being how you are okay just by doing some stuff because most people do nothing but for me to even operate on this level I have to have those skills so now it's not an option it makes me think though because I remember this was probably even a couple of months ago um the race team was going to the mind and you and my point is I'm gonna go come back to my point but you you were like man I want to go but do they have a cold tub like they got one I can't go because you got to get your shit done and I think me looking at you being with you every single day I see you what I get is your prioritizing yourself always and like it's him you have to be selfish to be selfless you can you can accomplish any other stuff you can't make those calls and like I've seen it and we talk about it because you know we go through your schedule it's like bro I gotta get my workouts done I gotta get this done and then anything else is extra that's yeah you know and I think that's a really important part and I think it's something that people misunderstand when it comes like prioritizing yeah they look at it as an addition to their day yeah instead of the day being the addition to their personal develop yeah and that's a different kind of thing and that's an accurate too bro I take my rook everywhere I fucking operate on 75 hard when I travel anywhere asking anybody who's around me out there'll be a party going on and be like peace I gotta do my outdoor workout it is what it is um and that's a massive that's a massive point you know you have to put it at the front but how does it change my business this fucking change everything it's taken it's taken you know we went from a fucking you know good size small company to knocking on the door of one of the you know bigger most more popular brands out right now yeah of any any level so that's that's where it takes you it level it didn't level me up one level it didn't level me up two levels a level me up fucking thousand yeah so those you guys watching on youtube there's a I'm sorry if you listen to the audio there's a picture showing right now and it's Andy at first form summer smash first one yeah first one and it's just crazy to see this picture compared to like to see you now because you're on stage with the with the shorts on with the polo on and you've got a whole beer in your hand holding it up and it's just it's crazy to think about that because like you know when you're around someone all the time you kind of forget those things like sometimes with Andy and I will text pictures back and forth each other like from the old days and we're like damn we looked bad because like we are drink you could tell we had like that drinking face like that bloated face and we do that's embarrassing to look at like like those people are I don't know that's just embarrassing yeah well and I think you know you're talking about performing better here but I think almost nearly everybody under this roof has completed 75 hard at least one time and I know there's a lot of people in the uh center of hard the official like Facebook community that we have that and people that I I know as well they get actually their whole teams on board like they make it a whole team culture building exercise it should be a prerequisite for fucking hiring anybody it is because that thing is the the people that I know that have done that that have you know had their teams sign up and they'll put some like prize on it or something like that for you know everybody that completes it or whatever they just say like they cannot believe the level of productivity that their companies have now because everybody now raised their standards and then doing it together that struggle helped you know build their culture stronger the people are performing better the employee the employer is happier which makes the employees happier so it's just people don't realize like the trickle down effect is like you say you know you have to be selfish before your selfish or selfless but that's exactly what it boils down to is like when you take care of yourself you're going to be way better for everybody else and that's like the you know that's a wonderful obviously byproduct of that I couldn't do this without that yeah we wouldn't exist how many times I know you you've lived this lifestyle since 2019 consistently you've done 75 hard countless times you're on the live hard program every year so I've only completed it too out of the out of the five years there was I mean it live our programs hard to complete yeah oh that's our idea yeah so you've lived this so that's the thing is people don't really because I had surgery one year yes we had something else not just say that this is the fifth year so two two of the four years I did it and two of the four years I didn't do it yeah but that's the thing and then this year I'm going to do it people don't realize like you said in the beginning of the show it's like this is like meant to be done every year because it's not like one thing where you don't change your oil in your car one time and it's good to go for the rest of the lifetime of that car yeah it's something you do every 3000 miles or whatever to maintain it and that's what that's why it's a program exactly so dive it into those phases a little bit that's the quote maintenance on the car if you will so kind of explain those just a little bit more kind of I know you said about as far as the live hard program but the phases those are kind of like your fine tuning and tweaking yeah so so people have to understand like it's set up and structured intentionally for intentional reasons and I have the new book coming out the book on mental toughness that comes out I think this year you would know better than me but that book explains the phases and the psychology of the phases in detail as well as you know I think a bunch of you know it's a shit ton of other content like it's an actual book it's not just the book of the program it's amazing yeah so it breaks down all the different aspects of mental toughness why it's necessary how you develop it and then it gives you the full psychology of the program the second part of the book but basically it works like this 75 hard is the first 75 days this is the this is where you're going to do 75 hard it's going to be extremely difficult you're going to be extremely sore but if you do it it's going to change a lot in your life and then you have to realize like Emily just said that these skill sets the skill sets them that encompass what we call mental toughness discipline grit forward to perseverance self esteem self confidence etc these are skill sets that you are either adding to or subtracting from every single day by your actions all right so these are perishable skills if you want to think of them like that like for example if you shoot pistols and you don't shoot regularly you start to shoot like shit those of you that play golf if you play golf and you hit balls every single day you're swinging and everything stays in balance and you can hit the golf ball pretty good but take a year off take 30 days off take 60 days off and then see what happens your skill sets when it comes to mental toughness are no different all right and that's why we have extra phases within the year and this is why they're spaced out as well which I'll get to in a second so after 75 hard which I call the boot camp of the program and this is where most people know it right there's three phases there's phase one phase two and phase three all right got real creative on the names here phase one is 75 hard plus some additional tasks okay and these additional tasks are designed to make you more uncomfortable and add more to the program and a lot of people me included I like to do phase one immediately on day 76 and so I end up running you know what is that 105 days straight on the program and what you're doing is once you complete 75 hard now you're adding in these other tasks that make it even harder and it's a 30 day it's 30 days all right so that's phase one phase two is the exact same tasks that are in the original 75 hard without the extra tasks of phase one phase two there must be a 30 day break at minimum between the end of phase one and the beginning of phase two and a lot of people are like why can't you just run them consecutively a couple reasons number one I make the motherfucking rules of my own program all right number two you have to remember what it's like to not be on the program because a program actually isn't any good if it's actually just the program making you strong and making you make the decisions you have to be able to operate outside the guidelines of the program and that 30 day break shows you where you are do you go right back to your old habits do you start back with your laziness do you start back with your justifying and what most people find is that phase two is the hardest phase of the program even though it's 30 days even though it's something that they did for 75 days already because it follows this break of you be going back to reality all right so a 30 day break and a lot of people don't do 30 days they do 60 days 90 days which makes phase two exponentially harder if you have to do it the more you wait the harder it is all right and so then phase two basically is a big slap in the face of you showing you how off track you actually are and how much work you still have to do and and then we have phase three and phase three is is the hardest phase when I fail live hard the two years I failed it I failed it on phase three because it's a lot of work and basically for 30 days you're dedicating your entire life to the fucking program because of the amount of shit that it takes you have to be really fucking fine tuned to finish that part of it but phase three is to be done the 30 days prior to the initial start date of 75 hard the year before all right so you begin the year with 75 hard you end the year with phase three and then in between there's two phases that you can do at any point in time and the reason this is all spread out over a year and it's less than half of your year that you're doing this is because these are perishable skills and just like you know hitting a golf ball or taking a shower every day it's necessary to become aware that you're disciplined your grit your fortitude your perseverance your mental toughness your your confidence your self esteem are all constantly moving up and down in the amounts that you have them they don't just go to the top and fucking stay there when you go back to being a fat lazy fuck that's not what what it happens what happens is your did what actually happens is is that you're disciplined lowers and then you get fat right so when we're talking about how this is all laid out you know it's a very effective program which is why it's not a challenge and it's not a fat and it's not a fucking trend it actually has been growing and for five years now so yeah so I want to get into some really my favorite topics with 75 hard is let's start with 2021 you had full shoulder surgery like it wasn't just like a little tweak you had basically not tore everything every single thing like the worst surgery where I remember texting your surgeon about you know what was going on he said he goes he goes it is the worst surgery you can have and I he purposely told us that it was not as bad as it's going to be because he knew you would not want to have the surgery because it was such a fucking brutal terrible it's like as he said it was like as bad as a heaven hip replacement or worse I can't remember exactly I don't know I don't have never had a hip replacement I tell you this it was fucking horrible yeah so let's talk about where you're talking about the second day when I was home yes I had you call him and I said bro you definitely fucked up my shoulder well because I mean bro it was so fucking it was like pain pills yeah so I don't take pain pills right so like so like he and and my surgeon he told me he's like hey man you know you need you need to take these pain pills I know you don't want to take them fucking take them and of course you know I'm like I'm not fucking taking those and the nerve block of a giant like the shit the shit fucking wore off bro I thought it was gonna die you were here and then it wore no we went home yeah I got I went home it was 11 o'clock in the morning yeah yeah you got done with the surgery you came back up here we did cardio yeah that's so yeah the next day yeah the next days when I went home early because the nerve block wears off for like 24 hours I think yeah that's gonna say so like during this recovery you and I spoke so many times about how you know pivotal setting have hard wasn't your recovery because I remember saying you know like because again I picked you up from the surgery center like brought you home and we stopped here so you could get an outdoor workout in because you were like I'm not gonna I'm gonna still do this I gotta get my shit done so you literally woke up from anesthesia 30 minutes later out doing your walk yeah and during you know your recovery you were always active as much as you could be and I remember us both saying and I remember telling you like it was just seeing your change of if that were 2014 Andy having shoulder surgery we talked about how you would have just been on the couch like I'm recovering I would have been back to three 15 let's do this because like I'm just recovering this was a completely different Andy that I did not know but it's because center of hard you had like instilled that discipline within yourself and it strengthened it so long already through those few years of the program and already been in existence so like how do you attribute center of hard to the recovery process because do you think it helped like I know it helped your mental state to you know because it was a fucking long road to recovery it's worse than that first of all people the day I tore my shoulder I was in the best physical shape I'd ever been in my entire life by a lot I was I was I was exactly where I was wanted to be all those times all those years all that time I was fat and felt uncomfortable and you know it was miserable and we're in the same clothes and turning down parties and turning down beach vacations and being embarrassed of how I looked I was finally at that point where I was like dude this is exactly where I wanted to be and if you remember I had just finished 75 hard like three days prior because we had an eight week challenge going on at first form and I did 75 hard and it happened to end like right at the same day and then we went to that trip I'll never forget it yeah like I was I just told him we yesterday I'm like dude I because I was there when you when it fucking happened yeah I still have the like a video recurring in my fucking head went like the fucking seconded Bob yeah I can't get out my brother yeah well that's because it sounded like fucking I don't know what the fuck it was sound was but I don't want to hear it again it was horrible many how so there was that right so I fucking was at the best place I'd ever been in my life and then I black I tore my shoulder to the point where I couldn't lift my arm over my head and at that time there was masking going on and you guys all know how I feel about my masks and I'm not doing it that's the other episode yeah yeah so so none of the places would do an MRI or get me going on surgery unless I was doing the mask and wouldn't do it so I finally found a guy who I happen to know my whole life who's a tremendous surgeon who's like yeah do it you know fuck these people I'm like all right cool but that took till December there was so there was three months here okay so now remember during that three months by the way I'm watching my physique deteriorate and there's nothing I can do about it I'm eating clean I'm working out I'm I'm training one half my body I'm training legs you know I'm doing all the things I can do but dude like where I was at that level physically cannot be I was at pinnacle Pete who'd be like saying a a guy who plays NFL and he's an all pro player you know you can maintain most of that by just you know fucking training your leg like dude it was a complete mental fuck job watching myself deteriorate after all that work I put in bro and all that time I spent trying to fix this and um in hindsight you know I mean I'm through it now I say in the last it took it took me 18 19 months to truly get through the pain and recover so that's almost two years of not training and I'm still not all the way back physically to where I was before like still so I think that's a mental fuck can we talk about this though I think I think that's still just mental bro because I'd say I know you I mean I'm close listen I'm close but I'm not I'm not there you're very very I mean yeah I know I'm not I honey says I'm not too so um he thinks I'm about 10% off and I agree with that assessment but the point is is that like dude that's a big mental fuck job and had that been me before back in 2011 or eight or ten or whatever I would have I would have for sure I would have sat on the couch I would have eight shitty I would order pizzas I would have drank and I would have been 350 and fucking three months and I would have said I'll get this off I will get this all off when I heal when I can start training again and instead of saying oh I'll start Monday it would have been I'll start in six months when I'm healthy right and and it would have created a mountain that in my age might have been insurmountable yeah right because it's not like I'm like super young anymore right like my body I'm physically young but I mean dude I'm 44 years old like this shit is not as the same as it was when I was 24 right you know so like that that truly I believe me doing that work ahead of that injury say I think it saved my whole fucking life I think it did too yeah do you go back to that picture that was on before this one so this picture if you guys are on YouTube so this was when you were getting out of surgery you'd done your eight week challenge you got the best shape of your life and this is when you started after you were pretty well healed but I remember us taking this picture and we were still like happy because you still you could still see some abs and everything so this is just you doing literally just that's just me doing two outdoor you know I did two cardio's a day so I did on the days on I would do my legs every three days and then I would do it like one arm uh the shit I could do with one arm yeah and that did on most of the days I did two cardio's so and but at that time I wasn't rocking I was just doing you know you're yeah but it's still it's like you look at I I look at that as where you at when you ended the eight week challenge in a 25 hard and then to this one you started again it's like yes there's a difference with the thing is that I'm massive difference yes but it's like you got to throw the picture in there of what we got it yeah because you guys didn't put it out but what we but the thing is that I think this to be your starting point whereas if it were years ago prior to setting of hard this it would be an after photo of a contest instead of actually like or you know or a challenge or for the eight week thing so um okay so more recent events is what you spoke about so much about which I know everybody is so happy to because I think it deems from people about you sharing your experience of getting yourself off Alexa Pro after being on it for 11 years because people don't realize the damage that it does they don't realize it while they're in it it's when they get off of it is when it's bad so there were tons of you know ups and downs through that that was a insanely hard year dude listen I'm gonna be real this is just real talk and people don't realize this because they see the financial wins those financial wins that were work that I did 10 years ago five years ago okay but I'm gonna be real September 15th to 2021 till maybe June 1st of this year was probably the hardest fucking time I've ever had in my life for a whole bunch of reasons because a whole bunch of shit hit me all at once it started with that mother fucking injury and it went into you know the the scaling of the company and went into me getting off Alexa Pro and there was a number of other things that happened during that time that were like mentally very fucking destructive and hard to get through and the reason I I decided to end Alexa Pro literally was because I was at a point with DJ and I doing CTI so much I was starting to realize how predatory the pharmaceutical industry was because before that I never really thought about it I never really thought about how predatory our entire system is towards personal excellence I just thought you know okay most people are just you know regular people and then there's higher people than that that are above average then there's great people and I wanted to be a great person I wanted to be great in everything that I do I'm a competitive person you guys don't realize this and I don't give a fuck what you spiritual guides have to say on the internet I'm a competitive motherfucker if you're friends with me I'm competing with you I want to do better than you I want to be more ripped than you I want to make more money than you I want to fucking look more handsome than you I want to kick more ass than you but that doesn't mean I don't want that for you I want you to win I want you to win too because when you fucking win it drives me to win right okay this is this is actually why my friends are such good friends like my friends that I talk to on a regular basis honey ed her mosey like these dudes are hustlers they go out and fucking crush they it's my brother you know the people I surround myself with I start that I want them to lose but I still want to beat them right okay and this is how I'm fucking wired and so for me having to sit on the sidelines and watch all this shit deteriorate away and watch my physical which I had never been physically in that kind of shape before bro like I'm a fat like my body is a natural endomorphic type physique like I'm a fat dude by by nature I'm strong and I'm athletic but I'm chubby and you know when they say husky jeans motherfucker I wore all the husky jeans okay like I'm a husky dude and you know the thing is is I had gotten myself to this point where I I was like dude I'm I'm I'm unfuck withable okay like I'm killing it in all these areas and then an injury happened I think the injury happened to fucking humble me because in hindsight now explain this in a minute this whole time which how many months was that what was that fucking September 21 all the way till June of 23 that no June of 23 it's longer than that it's a year and it's almost two years that whole time was that was a fucking test just like I talk about test days on MSEO project just that was a life test that I fucking passed okay and the reason I decided to get up and I'm happy about that like it's a big fucking win for me the reason it's probably the biggest win ever had my life real talk was good enough no just getting through that period of time like dude it almost killed me a hundred times like you have no even you don't know it was bad like you don't even know so I decided at that point in July to stop taking lexapro which was July of 22 because I had become aware of all the things that we were talking about on the show and I'm like fuck these motherfuckers are fucking poisoning my brain you know and man I didn't even know how bad they were poisoning it until I stopped taking that shit yeah and I started having like real withdrawals like I had someone message me the other day they're like I've been off for seven days I'm like and she's like I can't take it and I'm like well you don't know what you're in for because it fucking gets way worse and that's just real shit like you better be fucking prepared and this is why I don't recommend people just stop taking it and the first 70 80 days I was suicidal legitimately by the hour like I was fighting the withdrawals were so fucking bad when I say anxiety when I say paranoia when I say depression you guys and you think of like the worst you've ever felt in your life that's how I felt for 80 days straight and the only way I got through that was by having the structure of the program real shit because I did 75 hard those first 75 days of when I stopped and I think that's the only way I made it through it well and I remember there are days that your tasks would be the only thing you could you would yeah that was it because I got him done growing I'm getting like kind of tears like thinking about that time because it was so so bad yeah and and it was you know people don't understand there's physical symptoms that come from the removal of these drugs and this is why you unless you're mentally prepared to deal with it you should not just quit okay you need to build your mental fortitude ahead of time and understand what the fuck you're going to do and have a plan to push through it I was a port system I was just gonna say listen you should be doing you should be tuning your mental you're fucking brain up for a year before you decide to fucking just quit it yeah okay because you're gonna go through some of the worst shit that you're ever gonna go through and there's gonna be nothing you can do about it I lost my balance I had brain zaps I had brain fog I had suicidal fucking fantasies and anybody who suffered with depression you know what I'm talking about where you get a suicidal thought in your brain and it's obsessive you cannot stop thinking and these things were at the highest possible level that I've ever experienced during this time and then after the first 80 days it did get better it got better but it got better slow and and I think I think up until about a year of being off of it which was just recently I was still having withdrawals because I would still have these ups and downs and these ups and downs and I think within the last 30 to 60 days is really when I started feeling like myself again where I wasn't having this crazy anxiety and that's also why that's also a big reason why I sort of withdrew from from my content and a lot of shit and like I just didn't feel good dude you know I didn't feel like the bad motherfucker that I had been in the past and the thing that I recognized about being on Lexapro like this is something that like people like you don't realize this till you come off of it but it actually makes you immune to the good things in life too so it numbs you from the bad shit but it also makes you not care about the good shit so you don't really ever have any real emotions and one of the hardest things was like getting used to having emotions again like I didn't I hadn't had them for 11 years so like notice that summer smash I think that was the first example because I've been with you for four years yeah that was the first time where I was seeing like genuine raw emotion come through that yeah I have not seen in situations yeah well that's because they I was taking their bullshit yeah right and like their bullshit's real good at making people not give a fuck about anything so you don't really care that they're taking all your money or propagating you to be a fat lazy piece of shit or you know you know dividing everybody all the stuff we talk about on CTIs every day right you don't notice it because you don't fun care so you know I personally my personal opinion you know obviously there's no scientific evidence to this and that I'm aware of there probably is but I don't know it is that they give I think they give people I think the reason they're so quick to put people on that shit is explicitly for control society I think it's a mind control drug I think they put you on the drug and I think they understand that you're not going to have the lows but you're also not going to have the highs so you care a lot less about everything and you're willing to accept what they do to the population which is make you struggle financially make you struggle physically with your health intentionally poison you with chemicals and things in water in the air like and plastic like all these things that they do to people you don't give a fuck about when you don't have any emotion so like you know and dude the other thing that like how I was prescribed this was so flippant and so like it was this I was in the office and my doctor was like he's like how you feeling and I'm like well I'm I don't know I'm fucking feel like shit and he's like well it's because you got that business and I'm like well yeah he's like you should sell that business I'm like well I'm not selling the business and he's like well you should just let me put you on this pill dude it'll make you feel better and like I was like all right I fucking started taking it and that's how I don't I where there was no because that back then you you would be able to trust a physician well look dude I don't think that I don't think that I don't blame him I just think that's the way it is no because you that's what I'm saying that's the that's the medical system yeah these doctors don't even know what the fuck they're doing they don't even realize they're they're they're taught they're taught in an education system that is funded by fucking big farm right they don't know what the fuck they're doing that's just what you do when you're a doctor the studies they read right exactly well let's say about 11 years ago we didn't you know there's been so much that came out since oh no you're not going to everything where we're all more of like we're like let me look yeah we're way more skeptical of it back then 11 years ago if you're doctor you would naturally assume that they knew why they were doing this they had your best interest at heart not that hey take this and I know for sure listen this is not shit talking because my doctor at that time he's not my doctor anymore was one of my best friend's dads right and he's still a fucking great friend of mine and I still know that he would like if I called this dude I said hey man I need bury a fucking body motherfucker will show up you didn't do it to hurt me right it's just what they do you know but back to your emotions I think that's one thing that I noticed the most too is like I remember you've been saying we're out the farm right on the side by side and you looked at me and you're like I don't know why I feel like this because you weren't used to having like emotions and you were showing a motion again but as your wife what was what was cool for me to see is that you were way more engaged in what was happening around you it wasn't just like you know not that you were like zoned out before but like you actually could tell you were like really listening to every single person that was around and you were way more engaged at events that was that was hard though yeah like that shit's hard like when you don't have any emotions for fucking a decade and all of a sudden you're like listening to people like dude like for real this is this just this real shit okay um people come up to me all the time and and like I'm somewhat well know like I get when I go in public people recognize me and it's not like a athlete recognize like when you see an athlete people want to take it a picture with the athlete right or you see like the rock you're like oh I saw the rock I took a picture with them with me it's different because of the nature of my content all right so with me because I put out personal development so long at a high level that there's lots of people out here who have actually benefited from that content and when they see me they want to tell me their story when they tell me their story it's always a good story but to get to the good part they got to tell you the worst part right and the worst part is you know I had a fucking gun in my mouth or my fucking wife you know uh died of cancer or my husband you know it's always these severe like hardship stories and they're telling you these stories but they're telling you these stories so that they can tell you how they overcame these stories and which I appreciate right but like dude let me tell you something like when you stand in a meet and greet line for nine fucking hours and you hear a thousand fucking stories like that bro it will crush your soul people don't understand that and so when I was on the fucking medicine when I was on the pills I was able to meet these people and hear their story and it didn't really fuck with me too bad because like I didn't want to feel nothing I was like no I wasn't like I was detached but I was detached like I was like I was like man that's really that's that's horrible like like that I didn't feel it okay but what I've noticed now and this is also why I can't do a lot of these meet greet type things anymore is that like dude the shit really affects me so like when someone was fucking standing in front of me or telling me one of these stories now it like fucks me up right and that's one of the biggest things that that I realize and a lot of people say oh that's a great thing yeah it is except for when you have to do it a thousand times in a row yeah it was just two or three times yeah it's carrying a heavy load no dude listen dude people don't understand and this is not disrespectful because I'm very appreciative of the fan base and the following I fucking dude this is not disrespect but what's happening to me in those times is I'm getting every single person's worth worst fucking story emotionally dumped on me and in a in a in a in a in a in an action of gratitude right and so like but that shit still fucks you up and so you know and that happens to me every day it happens to me my DMs it happens to me in my conversations with people like phone calls I can't escape it like and it's really fucking difficult to manage and people think you know because I were kind of withdraw myself from a lot of situations dude I'm just protected my fucking energy yeah like I can't fucking be dumped on like that and operate my life like I'm not a fucking professional dumpster you know what I'm saying yeah I'm sorry you're having a problem I've dedicated a big part of my life to giving free content to help you help yourself right that's what it comes down to yeah and so um I don't know where I was going with that but the point is is that like I started feeling those things and feeling things that I hadn't felt in so many years made me realize how bad that shit was for me you know what I'm saying yeah because I know people personally that are on they are on the quarter of the amount of dose that you were on and they try they have tried to get off several times like I can't deal with the withdrawals like and they say like I don't know how that how the fuck you did this and I was like and I tell them like it's through the discipline you gotta have a structure to it and I think that's I just decided I was fucking done yeah exactly yeah and I know there's people that you and I both know mutually that have followed your lead on that to get off of that and they feel they could they say the same thing it's like even though they were on a very very low dose they're like I wanted to kill myself every day like even just the smallest amount you can get it's what this drug is doing people don't understand that dude yeah like because victimization has become popular in society and when people you know now and unfortunately you know people talking about killing themselves in public has become almost like a virtue signal all right um people I think a lot of people are desensitized to the real feelings of that like what we're really talking about like when you're talking about suicidal thoughts you're not you're not there yet bro until you're planning it and you're like how do I do this with nobody finding out or how do I do this with minimal disruption or how do I do this so Emily doesn't have to clean up my brains on the fucking floor like that's when you start to fucking that's when you're in that place okay when you when you're having when when your pistol is in your nightstand and all you can think about is pulling it out of your nightstand and fucking blowing your brains out every single fucking other minute you're starting to have and it doesn't sound bad like it doesn't sound like oh I'm scared of this it sounds like damn dude I just kind of want to do this like it's it's a it's a different thing and like because society has become so soft and I'm not sitting here saying your valid or not valid or I don't give a fuck what I'm saying is victim culture has become this thing on social media where everybody who's having a hard time talks about wanting to end their life for right I almost wanted to kill myself one time dude people shouldn't say those things unless it's actually true because it waters down and you can't identify who's actually struggling anymore yeah and so there's levels to like life and sometimes life is just fucking hard but when I explain suicidal fantasies and tendencies that's what I'm talking about but what about the glamourization of pharmaceuticals because that's kind of I feel like that's also a huge crutch in society it's not just the victimhood but it's the glamourization of the wine mom brunchers and hey let's pop a Xanax and go to this and it's like it's you know and I've seen designers come out with you know like Adderall like fancy rhinestone Adderall yeah it becomes a part of their identity yeah and like these you know wine I was like oh I got I'm taking kids are out of summer you know I'm be taking a Xanax bar every day it's like they make it they try to make it trendy well other drugs are like that too I mean other people you know they do that would lead you know they make a part of their identity you do it with alcohol you do right I know but I'm done those things yeah yeah yeah so okay so let's talk about you being you say your chubby your naturally husky fat so let's talk about that big bone uh well I mean that's that's no big bone I mean that's that was like a old that was like when we were young like that was like what people said big bone fat you're just big bone right right yeah and I like to do the X-rays and everybody's bones are like the same size okay so what I want to talk about though is that I love this so I have my little documentation here so your cardiologist is fucking fantastic he's absolutely amazing just love him yes and so you had you know you we we both regularly get our labs done get our blood work done and I'm not gonna do but I have a 13 page analysis here from your labs but the cool thing about this is this happened um very beginning of the year and we had our last labs done that we discovered this is that you know and you've always joked around like oh I got the fat gene I got the fat gene you know it's just like what people say like the husky the big bone but I actually had it you actually no you did not have all of them you did not have a fat gene you actually tested to have every fat gene yeah so him saying that for all these years we found out he actually has every single one which is very rare for someone to have every single fat gene and so that's the problem or that's what I got yeah I got the same yeah you have the unfunny gene so the uh but you you guys can battle over who has least trophies I'm just saying I got two of me and I'll keep to ourselves I got two of them right there I don't see him lose out there no those are those are trophies how many episodes you've been on mother fucker those are trophies you used to have you're on probation they're getting they're getting recycled to me now yeah I don't know about that either you want to have dinner tonight you want to go off for dinner for the two of you okay I'm making lasagna my fuck I can go I didn't go to a restaurant you would ever want now yeah that's true okay so this page it's 13 pages long of the fat genes okay and all your your things so I was texting him and I said what are like tell me what these fat genes are and he said the two the main ones that just extracted from this uh lab report now I always thought this was bullshit I didn't realize fat gene was a real thing do same I thought it was bullshit show the fat gene show the restaurant again so that's the infamous under armor polo as well too so it's just that's the thing but you look like I wouldn't want to fuck with that guy like he just looks no I was just beavy yeah but I was fucking fat you know that's what I'm saying I was strong but I was fat I was obese like my shit didn't do I was wearing a 44 pants there bro it's crazy you know what I'm saying that's 10 inches of fucking pants bigger than what I wear now it's crazy so the two main fat genes are FTO and MC4R so the polygenic means more than one gene is affecting the phenotype and that higher you know higher the risk score and the more likely the person to have that condition so with a risk score for like 79 the person is way more likely to be obese and epigenics is how your lifestyle interacts with your genes and turns them on or off so changing to a higher protein diet with more physical activity was enough for you to turn these genes off this is like a text directly from your doctor saying hey you guess what if you fucking work out and you eat good have a high protein diet you get to feed your genetics yes and what is well you know what he also verified that too because I said oh that's awesome thank you so much you know blah blah and he texts this it says no worries 75 hard versus genes guess who wins because he knows the program and how well it works and so with us like joking about you having the fat gene I remember you coming home and telling me that because he's awesome he came here to give you your all your results and everything and you're like you're not going to fucking believe this and I was like what you're like I don't have a fat gene I fucking have all of it's like no way and it just goes to show you like how well the program works and just just getting your fucking shit on track you know what I mean and take your responsibility for your own life because so many people like you said it's like that of time with the discipline of those genes I mean in all fairness let's be real it's not the program didn't defeat those genes my physical health defeated those genes okay and the way I got the physical health was by using the program to fix my brain yeah okay so that that that the actions that I was taking have been consistent enough over the course of time to actually switch those genes into the off position right so like just doing the program one time is not going to fix your genetic makeup but if you fix your brain which allows you to fix your lifestyle that allows you to fix your health then you end up with you know some of these kind of changes that we're talking about that are yeah and I think and if you really think about that in the scope of this study of hard being around for you know five years now and you having these results from doing the program at the time that the you know so it was you know four years you would done the program and live that lifestyle consistently by fixing your mindset to get your body right and everything else that you know came along with that is that if you really think about I mean four years that's not a lot of investment at all to literally fix yourself in that regard you know to continue that yeah but see here's the thing that you got to remember when most people die at dude when you're like when you're like overweight or like obese or fat or however you want to say it um all you want like you would like you would give every fucking thing that you own to be physically where you wanted to be at that time like there's not a person right now who's like super overweight who if I said bro I'll give me everything you fucking have give me all your money give me your house give me if fucking give me your cat and your dog and I'll snap my fingers and fucking right now you will go to your ideal physical self all your clothes will fit all your clothes will look good you will look amazing every single person will take that deal if you could fucking snap your fingers and make happen that's how bad of a desire that these people want to change and where they fail to realize the change actually happens is in your mind first you have to condition your mind to be able to adhere so that you can then change your health and these things do not compute to people because of the way the weight loss industry and uh the pharma industry and everybody markets weight like let's look at the marketing of most weight loss for the course of history most of it is take this pill and you'll lose weight take this drug and you'll lose weight take this and you'll get there nobody's out there except me and maybe you know I think the fitness culture has definitely shifted to this now but it started with first form saying hey we do the work okay that's starting in 2014 that was a major initiative of our brand was to change the mentality around the marketing of weight loss and the reason that we wanted to change the marketing around the mentality of weight loss is because it's a fucking lie and it was a lie for years and years and years and years and years the idea of taking a pill or taking a product or getting a shot and you just becoming this version of yourself is bullshit all right and it's no different than someone who wins the power ball lottery and is broken two years because you don't have the financial skill set to maintain responsibly that amount of wealth and so that wealth leaves you and so even if you were able to take a pill even if you were able to take ozembik all right and get lose 15% of your body weight the minute you stop the habits that you have are going to take you right back where you were it's going to make you unhappy so when we look at like four years you say okay that's not a lot of investment for four years well what if what if in 75 days you could do enough work to get most of the way there physically and create the awareness mentally of what actually the problem is now you're in a much better position now not only have you gotten in pretty good physical shape because most people can make tremendous improvements in 75 days maybe it takes you a hundred maybe it takes you two cycles but very few people are outside the realm of a hundred and fifty day transformation unless you're six hundred pounds okay so we're talking about a very short amount of investment to create most of the physical results that you're trying to achieve that you would sell your fucking dog to achieve all right if someone could snap your fingers you can do that in 75 days and now you're in a position we're not only are you most of the way there physically but you actually understand the game mentally and you may not be fixed mentally and because no one's fixed mentally but you understand these are perishable skills I have to work on them I have to go hit my mental golf balls every day if I want to golf well right so I have to exercise discipline I have to exercise grit I have to push through these hard times because by pushing through these hard times it equips me to push through hard times okay and I had a guitar teacher one time tell me says Andy you're the least patient person I've ever met and I said well what do you want me to do he goes well I want you to practice patience I said how do you practice patience he says by doing things that require patience all right and discipline's no different grits no different perseverance is no different okay you have to put the time into these hard things so that you understand that you have the ability to do hard things and then the next time the hard thing show up you have the confidence which builds your confidence builds yourself a steam to actually push through the hard times to continue on the path of what you told yourself you were going to do and when you can do what you tell yourself you're going to do your confidence goes up your self esteem goes up your self worth goes up and you understand that you are actually in control of your life when before you thought that you weren't you were looking at everybody else who is successful you're looking at everybody else who's fit you're looking at everybody else and you're telling yourself a story you're saying that guy's fit because he has better genetics that person's successful because they got lucky not because they work from the time they wake up till the time they go to bed right like we tell ourselves all these stories and once you remove those stories because you are aware now you start to aware that holy shit this is actually it actually becomes a whole new game now your life opens up to you you become aware that whenever plan you set forth in front of you you can achieve because you have the ability to adhere and you have you know what to do when the hard times come and here's the thing about life guess what it's yin and yang and if the yin represents the good times and yang represents the bad times how much percentage does that represent of the bad times the hard times 50 fucking percent and if you fucking flake out on 50% of your life because it's fucking hard you're going to lose that's reality you're going to live a life in a body you hate you're going to live a life with the income you hate you're going to live a life with relationships that you hate you're going to live a life that you fucking hate because you lack the skill set which as we talked about are perishable to actually adhere to the plan in front of you so you have two choices your choices either you can become all powerful and fucking have the ability to adhere no matter what the plan is or you can float through life like a trash bag in the wind and you can take the good times when they come and you can take the bad times when you come personally I want to be in control most of the shit that I have going on I think that's where if you're one of these granola people and you want to float through life and live in a fucking van and think this is all great post on social media all the time and have zero discipline and all this shit and then pretend like you're cool with it and then in 10 years when your life sucks that's cool too I don't give a shit because I ain't me all right but I'm just telling you right now if you're struggling right now with you getting your life on track and you're struggling with becoming that version of yourself that you know exists inside your mind and your heart and you're not understanding that things that other people have are actually skill sets that you just haven't developed understand that first and then go develop them because once you develop them once you go through this process of self-development and awareness now you're in a position to adhere to whatever you put in front of you and if you could follow any plan that you put in in front of you what are the limits on your life there are none so what I want to touch on and go back to is you said awareness and I had that I wanted to touch on that so the self-awareness and you know you're removing these stories from your life I think one massive component that is overlooked as far as you know propelling your life and excelling and enriching yourself in all aspects of it it's not just you're getting your mentality but I feel like your self-awareness is so heightened that now you realize all the bullshit stories people are telling themselves and you also are starting to like extract people from your life that you're like I don't want that anymore because now I am at a heightened awareness I've got my you know I'm working on getting my shit together I'm gonna continue to work on getting my shit together they're not and it's a turnoff for you to be like almost associate or friends with them anymore because you're like what was I doing I was living in a fog you know I hear that a lot of people I know dude two things that are gonna happen over the course of this development that you should probably be prepared for number one you're gonna realize that you're a fucking liar you lie to yourself all the time especially about the amount of time that you have you're going to say oh I don't have time to do this and then you're gonna start doing this and you're gonna be like dude I was totally lying like I have all this time and now I actually have more time because I'm organized I'm executing okay so that's the first thing you're gonna realize that you're full of shit and that's a good thing that's not a bad thing I don't say that in bad way you everybody here needs to realize that you're full of shit okay because once you realize you're full of shit you can work on not being full of shit all right so but the second thing that's gonna happen is that your ability to tolerate excuses and your ability to tolerate mediocrity and your ability to be around people who are just like the normal type person where it's like fucking come on man what differences it may just have one beard hang out with bro I cannot have those people around me I fucking can't ask it because I don't hear anything other than you're just the weakest fucking bitch that I've ever met my entire life that's all I hear coming out of your mouth yeah like I don't hear oh these guys love me and they want to have a good time I hear my friend who I thought was fucking one way is actually a fucking pussy that's what I hear and I can't be around it what I tell you last night when my biggest fucking source of unhappiness in my life is it's people that are complacent not driven I cannot surround myself I cannot be around anyone whether it be on this team whether it be on my point of context on on the board of first form whatever I'm doing whatever I'm involved in if I am around people who are complacent if I am around people who are not driven at a high level it makes me angry and miserable because that's how I run I run at a high level I look whether you think it's right or wrong that's me okay I don't give a shit what you want I don't give a shit what you think I am unhappy being around anything less than that has to be that otherwise I can't be around you I just can't do it and you know people say well that sounds pretty fucked up well I'm sure it does because you think that it's okay to drink beer fucking 10 o'clock till fucking eight o'clock at night every Saturday and Sunday and fuck off your life away I'm sure it sounds fucked up to you but here's the thing though it's like the those people want to do that with you and they said oh do just relax but blah it's like but then they compliment you on the shit you have achieved so it's like which way is it gonna you know what I mean like which way is it gonna and I can't even talk to people it's no but it's no coincidence where um you know life was back in 2009 to where it is now and how your mental development and you know developing that mental toughness has been able to get you you know to the point where you are today and a lot of people just be quick to discount that again like the lucky or oh you know he's had this which you've never had any fucking funding you had to build everything yourself so I think with when people like that your friends are like always dogging on you or trying to like hey man just come out with us you never go out but the thing is it's that's I think what Sunday of heart is done for me too it's raising that awareness of reals and like you know and I do not want to say like this is gonna sound bad it's like I I kind of feel better like hey you know what I'm doing shit that you're not you know what I mean like I'm doing the stuff that you're you're gonna go out and drink and I'll say that I take pride in that shit that's just no different than when fucking I saw uh one of somebody that you all know I'm not gonna say his name because I'm not gonna embarrass people but you know some dude fucking posted on my uh uh I I do my cold plunge at 35 degrees okay oh yeah there's no physical benefit to 35 degrees all right um you're gonna get the same physical benefit at 50 degrees that you get at 35 degrees all right so I unplugged the heating element on my cold plunge and then I plug the chiller directly into its own outlet and I can get the fucking thing to go to 35 all right and it's highly not recommended by the factory because it'll burn your chiller out but guess what I'm rich and I can buy another chiller if it burns out all right that's reality no because he was literally like how do I get this thing cold so so I don't give a fuck so when it burns out I'll fucking buy another one in fact I'm pretty sure they'll give me one because I've sold more cold plunge for them than any of their influence okay so the reality is I do it at 35 and I posted it one day and I get this message from somebody that you all know who's like you know the physical benefits are only blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and you know what I fucking thought in my head that's why I'm me and you're you bitch yep yep that's why you're that's why you're watching my shit and I'm not watching your shit that's why you're learning for me and I'm not learning from you because I do shit and take pride and shit that other motherfuckers will not do or refuse to do or can't do and I love it and it makes me feel great and that makes you offended I don't give a shit because it makes me feel awesome yeah I take pride in everybody's like that it's just about putting yourself in those situations to develop that right like I'm proud of that we're gonna walk out in the fucking snow in two feet of snow no one's doing that you know but well when we're out there in two feet of snow like that dude that's pretty fun DJ and I did a cardio session a year two years ago we had 18 inches of snow and it was fucking I don't know how many minus it was minus degrees it was I think it was minus 10 or 15 or something and when was blowing it was cold it was cold as fuck and it was 18 inches of snow and we had to do our norm we we got we got 45 minutes in and we were halfway on our normal route which means we were we were our same route that would take us 45 minutes was gonna now going to take us an hour and half yeah and we realized that about 25 percent in so we were like okay and we had a conversation remember and we said we said we said should we just turn around here because we turn around here it'll be 45 minutes and then we were both like no fuck it we're doing the whole route and so we did an hour and a half and a fucking 18 inches of snow and minus degrees and you know what when I open my phone you know what my friends are doing playing fucking golf yeah I'll talk you know what my friends are doing yeah they're on fucking vacation and fucking Italy you know you know what you know what I thought this is why I'm fucking winning bitch well and here's a thing though because even at events that you go to they ask me like dude is he always like that they try to they try to like probe me for info about him and I'm like no that's fucking how he is all the time they're like there might be some people to do more extreme shit like gogins running 245 miles and I'm not doing that kind of shit you know yeah I'm just saying the consistency in which you operate is unmatched and I do always have I've always kind of found that kind of comical when the get these guys would be like oh yeah so because they may not know me because we don't like post our cell phone they're trying to see what what he like dude so what's really everybody says that the most fuck what's what's he really like so fucking annoying and people in my DMs are asking me it's like so what's it like to live with Andy like is he really like that I'm like yes he operates at that level all the fucking time and it's just they're they're like I can't even believe that you know or they think like but they don't he's like don't understand I have to I don't have a choice you're doing it's it's for sure you can't do what I'm doing and not be that way that's what they don't get yeah like it's a it's not me trying to like be a hard-ass maybe there's other people out here who can run at that level and fuck off there is there's lots of people they have bigger companies than me that are higher skilled than me that are smarter than me that have done way more than me and they don't work as hard as I do okay those people I'm not one of those people I'm saying for me I'm a regular person that comes from regular life I have to do that shit that's why I do it I don't have a choice I have to do it well plus I think one differentiating factor is people may not realize you're not you know you don't own this company and own it from your house meaning you're active here every fucking day you're in the office seven days a week people don't realize that you know what I mean so that's I think where that that that all comes in because people that may you know be more quote successful or whatever it is or you know further along or whatever it might be they are not actually active in their companies anymore no and then only that they try to like they try to like it's funny because they try to justify their shit to me they're like you know I'm just in a different season of life you know no I'm being for real it's called being on the couch no listen this is what people say the people above me that that or at my level that don't want to work that hard they say well I'm just in a different season that's what they say the people below me what they say is well I want more balance in my life I want a different life and so it probably works yeah that's right and that's okay but it's only okay when it's true it's not okay when you're just justifying your lack of ability to actually pour into yourself develop yourself and become that version of yourself that you actually truly want you want to know how you fuck up your whole life you take that version of yourself that you imagine in your heart in your mind that ultimate version of yourself and then when it gets hard you you throw that dream away and you say I never wanted that dream in the first place and you settle with some bullshit life okay that you didn't really want and then pretend you wanted it that's how you fuck up your whole life and that's what a lot of people do and I'm not judging anybody I'm not saying you because listen this ain't for everybody this is why it's said ain't for it not for everybody in my Instagram BIOS is 2012 I'm not for everybody my goals aren't for everybody my dreams aren't for everybody my personality's not for everybody my work ethics not for everybody and I'm okay with that understand that but when you throw your own shit away because you don't want to fucking become who it is you have to become to achieve that and you instead adopt this other life because you see people on Instagram or you see people live in this carefree life or this more fun life and you throw away those dreams and then you put this new thing in there you're going to hate yourself your entire life you're going to have fun for a few weeks maybe a few months maybe even a year but after a while that version of yourself that you know you're supposed to become is going to creep back into your mind and into your heart and you're going to have tons of regret about not willing not being willing to put in what it took to actually create that yeah it's gonna it's gonna fuck you up that's how people ruin their lives well one thing I like about with balance you know because I've never believed in balance I never really saw that growing up because you know my dad was not new as well he's still the hardest working dude I know yeah he's what is he almost 70 yeah but one thing a quote that I like that Tim Grover says is like when you have balance it the scales at zero nothing's happening when actually bolt the scales balanced it's zero so these people that want balance in their life I always ask them well what have you done to make you want to have that balance because so many people just think balance is almost like it's a trend like oh I need to have 50% of my time with my family and 50% at work but how how have you gone like run through the finish line to see that it's extreme to our way I need to I need to kind of pull back the reins a little bit to have that balance I think a lot of people have this idea of balance instead of actually like testing what is my balance going to be you know what I think what I think people need to stop judging people on how the fuck they live yeah that's what I think I think if you want to certain outcome it's going to take a certain amount of effort and that's reality if you want to travel the world in a van and go camping and that's all you want to do that's not going to take a whole lot all right if you want to build a multi billion dollar operation uh that changes people's lives that's going to go down in history as one of the fucking great iconic American companies that's going to take a little bit more than living in your fucking van okay and and then there's levels in between the ultimate lesson here is this everybody's on their own path and I don't want to judge someone for wanting to be free and easy I just want you to understand that there's a cost to that and the cost that you're going to have to that isn't going to come until later all right so really the truth is most people need to shut the fuck up and focus on that version of themselves they want to become and actually be willing to become it and that's what's ultimately going to create the fulfillment that you're looking for it's not going to be your coal plunge it's not going to be your morning routine it's not gonna be your journaling it's not going to be your grounding it's not going to be your granola lunch it's not going to be you living in the fucking van it's not going to be your therapy it's gonna be the work that you fucking do to become that version of yourself that is the exact version that you know you're supposed to become and then being proud of it that's what's going to create the a fulfillment that you're searching for. And all of this other shit is just band-aid shit to try and fix something that you know is a real problem in yourself. Oh, good man. Yeah. So for those that have not done 75 hard, and we talked about day 76, you know, you go right into phase one on day 76. Usually, yeah. Yeah. So what do you wish, because this is a lot that I see in the Facebook group, is that everybody's always like day 76, and they wanna go right into phase one, because they're like, and what if it is, it's like some people, like as they get to their program, first they might, you know, start to complete the program, because they want a physical transformation or something, or a lot of them, you know, it's, I feel it's like 50-50, they want that mental element to it. But what I see a lot on is when people get close to 76, they don't want it to end, because they love the way they feel so much, and they love the structure, because again, what we touched on earlier is they realize how much time they've actually been wasting. And people, I love the group, because I go in there like every day and read this stuff, but they call themselves out like, I was full of shit. Like I can't believe that I got this, you know, where they're at, and like, by being so full of shit, and then I love when they share like their wins, like you were talked about, people losing a lot of weight, like after, you know, a majority of their weight, like in the first 75 days, or maybe it takes two rounds, there's a gentleman yesterday, or that I shared in here with the team, that he had done two rounds of 75 hard, and he earned you lost 130 pounds, it's completely fucking different person. Like he's got a picture of the kids, and you can just, this seat on their face and their eyes, like how proud of them is, because they realized, they've been telling themselves bullshit lies for a really, really long time, and they finally have their head above water and realizing like, I can do a whole lot fucking more. That's the awareness I'm talking about. Absolutely, yeah. So, DJ, you got anything else to wrap this up before I share the next aspect of this with Andy and I? No. Okay, so let's tell people, because I'm starting 25 hard on Monday, and you are gonna be starting phase two. I'm starting phase two. I've phase two of my program that starts Monday, Emily's starting 75 hard, DJ's starting 75 hard, and a whole bunch of our friends are starting 75 hard as well. I'll probably, usually, every year, I usually do 75 hard twice, and what I normally do is when I finish phase two, I just keep going all the way through 75, which is what my plan is this time. So, you're starting 75, DJ's starting 75, that group that we know is starting 75. And then I'm starting phase two, which I'll probably complete a 75. Yeah. And so, we want you guys to join us on this. I think it's gonna be fun to see, because we always like to see everybody posting and sharing. So, we're gonna start August 28th, which is Monday, and then 75 days will take us to November 11th. And so, what we want you guys to do is like document this, because you and I love seeing people post that and share it and we search the hashtags and stuff like that. So, share with us on Instagram, TikTok, wherever on social media platform, and make sure you use hashtag 75 hard. Tag us in this. And so, then after November 11th, when 75 days is over, you're gonna have one week to send us email in your transformation and then also like a 2000 word, little blurb about like how you're feeling, what it's done for you the most through the program. 2000 max word. Yes, 2000 max word. So, we can read everybody's stories, and you're gonna be emailing that to 75 hard at AndyForesella.com. After you submit your submissions in to 75 hard at AndyForesella.com, we're going to have a panel of judges not Andy or I go through and choose one guy and one girl that best documented their 75 hard journey. And what they're going to win is a all expense paid trip to St. Louis to head first form headquarters. You're going to be on the podcast with Andy to talk about your experience doing 75 hard. You're going to get a 75 hard workout done with Andy here. You're going to get Andy's 75 hard first form supplements stack that he always uses. And then you're gonna go to dinner with us. So, make sure you guys let us know if you're starting in the comments below. Again, we're starting August 28th. We'll wrap up November 11th. Then you guys will have one week to submit everything and then we'll bring you out here in December. I should just be like, be like, look at that, it's doing good. Get down in the comments you guys.

Let us see what you got and make sure if you are doing this with us, if you're live hard, something of hard, whatever. Make sure you join the Facebook group too, because I love to see you guys in there too to connect. And there's a ton of help and support in that network as well. So and fuck off for you not in that meeting about being a dork. So. Where's to put that in the video? Super dot not over. I know. What an asshole. It's fired. Oh, no, he's not. Don't want to point. Yeah. Yeah. This is hate speech. All right, guys, that's the show. No. Don't be a hoe. Don't be an Emily. And share the show. You're going to last some more your own joke. Yeah, there's no trophy. Wow, this guy really bad. No, it's really great. We're just going to go and keep going. Guys, if you want to know what the program is, go to episode 208. It's available for free. It'll give you all the breakdown of the whole live hard program, explain 75 hard. There is a book available. It's not necessary for you to buy. It's on my website and if you sell it.com. It'll give you the whole rundown of 75 hard. It does not have the live hard phases in it. The live hard phases are available exclusively on that episode 208 for free. That's audio feed only, by the way. We weren't on YouTube back then. So go check that out. Get it for free and join us. Yeah. And I also think if you guys are doing this, definitely, I highly recommend getting the Sunday Haven't Hard app. It's on Android and iTunes because you can actually set timers in that and like alerts. So like if it's you go to bed usually at 10 o'clock, you could set an alert at 10 o'clock to make sure you took your picture, you finished your water, whatever, because it eliminates you guys from for getting anything. You take your pictures in there. It'll do like a slideshow for you. It's fucking great. I've used it every time I've done it since we came out with the app. So definitely check out the app for sure. It's just 75 hard. So. All right. Why? Yeah. Never sleepin' on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck a boat. Fuck a stove. Counting millions in a coke. Bad bitch. Booted slow. Got a own bank road. Can't fold. Just a note. Hands shot. Case closed.
