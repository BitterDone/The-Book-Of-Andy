If if we had everybody listening the show for the last four years I can promise you we wouldn't even be in this situation So one of my biggest regrets is that we haven't grown the show to the proper size to have the impact that we want to have I finance this show myself I do it so we can help society and make an impact and you guys are a crucial part of that So if you listen to the show and you find it valuable in any way if it's something that people need to hear Do it's a solid and share the show we have this little thing that we say here it goes like this Don't be a hoe show the show all right.

Yeah, and tag me in this stuff Where'd you get that I can't say if I told you I'd have to kill you I'm willing to die. I'm gonna hold now. Oh, you like that great, huh? No, I cannot find a great. Bro is great your favorite one grapes Listen, I don't I don't try to I'll usually hate stereotypes And I try to combat statistical truth. Oh, you do I like great.

I can this one hasn't even hit the retail shelf shelf yet bro Soon though that needs to be everywhere. I know it's amazing. He's be everywhere. Yeah Well, we got a lot of There's always do not like CT odds are getting hot and I love it There's a lot of interest and stuff happening a lot of updates to cover a lot of dots to connect as always But before we get to our headlines. I wanted to bring this up This guy is trying to become one of my like like favorites. I really like this guy. I think he's awesome Byron Donald's oh, yeah, he's bad ass dude. Yeah, dude's awesome Like you got to talk about what he did on the breakfast club. It was amazing. I saw that and it's going viral Yeah, let's see Watching this clip so Byron Donald shows proof to breakfast club host that Kamala Harris helped spike inflation So representative Byron Donald's who's a Republican out of Florida Stunned the host of the breakfast club this week when he argued that vice president Kamala Harris helped cause the Massive rise of inflation during the Joe Biden presidency Speaking with Charlemagne the god Donald's said that Americans have not been thriving due to inflation which he said Was brought about by Kamala Harris. Here is the clip. It's fucking awesome Let's check it out. I would argue when I really thrive in right now This inflation which by the way was brought to us by Kamala Harris It says really slowed down people from being able to excel by Kamala. Yeah Oh, oh Charlemagne president Charlemagne listen man when Joe Biden wanted to do his American rescue plan Kamala Harris was a tie-breaker vote in the United States Senate She broke the tide and started this inflation that has hurt so many people in our country everybody listening to your show It's not true First of all, it's the issue You show you want to go there? Okay, let's go That's fine. I have no For every infrastructure project in your community You should go out and think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and the Congress that voted for the American rescue plan That's what that's what should be happening Larry Summers wrote a op-ed back in 2021 Larry Summers was a Treasury secretary for Bill And he was economic advisor to a Barack Obama He said that the American rescue plan that Joe Biden wanted that Kamala Harris was the tie-breaker vote in the United States Senate Would create a massive inflation that we have not seen in a generation. Well guess what? Larry Summers was correct. You know who also was correct? Angela I was because I was in the budget committee when they brought the bill and I said in that committee is gonna cause massive inflation That's what happened So the problem we have in our economy today is that prices have gone up massively wages adjusted for inflation is down People's pocketbooks are hurting Yes, the quote I mean look dude Byron Donald's is pretty sharp man, and he's not to be messed with With you know here say political commentary, you know a lot of these people who like to go to bat for Kamala Harris I mean let's be real bro. They don't know what they're talking about and he just proved that because this woman's on TV And she's on the show and she's talking about how we need to go thank them for the infrastructure Listen man. This is exactly what I talk about every single day on this show This is the racism that I'm talking about when we talk about oh he said this or They told this joke or you know one day 20 years ago. He did this That's not the racism that we need to be concerned with racism that we need to be concerned with is people like that woman Who believes that those people are actually doing good when in fact they are not doing good for your community They are promising funds. They are promising infrastructure. That is not happening You can't tell me that you can walk around any of these democratic controlled cities and look around and say man Good things are happening to the infrastructure. Let me go think. Come on. Yeah, that's not happening Okay, so she can believe it's happening all at once But all that tells me is that she's not walking around in the places that we're talking about Because they're not it doesn't happen These people do this every two years they come into the black communities They make promises that they do not intend to To to keep and then they people buy it and they say it's happening. It's not happening. Where's it happening? Show me show me where it's happening I wrote it right and broke you know like I actually when I listen to radio That's what I listen to is the breakfast club because I like to hear there's Perspective because it's different than my perspective most of the time and You know, I disagree with a lot of what Charlemagne says But I do think that when when you present Charlemagne with the facts he he's a reasonable human. You know, he can he can Respectfully say okay, all right cool. Yeah, this being okay. I was wrong. I was this you know and I like that And I think actually that's why he's such a star, you know And in terms of the the broadcasting world. Yeah, but You know women like that woman on the zoom there They're not willing. This is what we talked about yesterday, dude They're not willing to humble their own viewpoints or their own ego to say shit I'm not seeing this right and like bro. We can't just support people because they talk a good game We can't just support people because they look like us or they you know have the same level of pigment in the skin We have to support people that are doing the best job for the American citizens And it is very clear that the people who are in charge now give zero concern to what's going on in the world especially the inner city Democrat controlled areas you can't walk through those cities and tell me that these massive awesome infrastructure goals are happening dude and by the way What kind of infrastructure could be built with the money that's been sent to Ukraine and Israel and all these other countries Like we're not even talking about that. No. We're talking about what they're building which they aren't building with the crumbs They're left over from them sending all our shit overseas so they can funnel have the back to themselves There's one example bro like you know with the American rescue plan and the American infrastructure plan and All of these fucking plans like ever something put in To connect every home in this country with you know The next generation wi-fi and they spent billions of dollars on that bill. Why would they do that? Well, I thought I thought black people couldn't use a computer according to them. Oh, yeah I mean that's the other bill they got to push through is to you know give black people computer lessons right Yeah, that will never happen. So they're gonna give wi-fi to people that can't use a computer and register to vote Okay, but I mean to the point though not according to them not me not one American Has been connected or how much wasn't I mean it was I want to say it was like almost six or seven billion dollars Went to that that that one plan alone and not one person has been connected or the EV bull shit You know, they spent billions of dollars saying that they're gonna build all of these new EV charging stations And that bill was put in the 20-21 they've built seven. Yeah, you know, I'm saying so it's like There is no infrastructures. I wrote just till shit. They've been building for can 44 for the last 44 fucking years Yeah, like there's no infrastructure like we got to be honest. You know, I'm standing like I like this guy I'm I like him a lot too every time I see him I like him a little bit more. Yeah, he brings he brings the heat dude Remind me you know what I'm reminded me of when he started growing. Yeah, I could say right now When our homie from New York was here and DJ brought out his fucking notes and he didn't want to talk about Yeah, I'm we're gonna say the facts man, but they but that's the part that bothers me is like because you know the truth Yeah, like you know you don't want me to bring them out because you know it's the truth Yeah, and you're willing to lie to progress your own personal agenda or what your ego feels like you're supposed to identify with dude It's bullshit. We have to get away from this man. Got to get away from being told that we have to vote for people because they look like us or they sound like us No, man. We need to pick the best players to go play the game so we can win That's real man guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think I was that being said. Let's get into our headlines remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos Go to Andy for seller.com. You guys can find everything linked there for you with that being said headline Number one, uh biggest news story of the day. You got to talk about it, man. This shit is crazy Check this headline out Biden Harris administration blasted for running out of money to deal with Hurricane Helene after blowing billions on migrants Now I know this is probably gonna piss a lot of people off. I know it will it pisses me off. I know it pisses you off But let's just dive through because I think it's important You know, especially as we get closer to this election the people understand the intentional destruction of this country and where the priorities have fallen and how it actually could be because I got some numbers for you So let's dive into this The federal government's disaster response agency Doesn't have enough money to help Americans left in distress by Hurricane Helene after blowing billions on illegal migrants over the last two years The federal emergency management agency or FEMA has handed out more than one billion dollars to specifically support illegal migrants with housing But now We have 150,000 American citizens American citizens Um who have reached out for federal assistance after their homes were destroyed by this hurricane and uh According to uh my orcas FEMA doesn't have the funding Now I think it's interesting because I like I got plenty of of of facts and I got plenty of data here that I think everybody needs to see Um This is not like like oh, we just somehow ran out of money Okay, that's the first thing I think is extremely important for people to recognize and realize If we look at this chart This chart is showing us The money allocated towards disasters and natural uh national emergencies Um, and it shows it in a chronological order going back to 2020 All right now those numbers uh, you know The 5766 that's in millions, okay, I think that's 5.7. So that's 5.7 billion dollars, okay What do you see um Going through and just looking Compared to when things happen, you know for example during the Trump administration you see very clearly How much money was given to natural disasters and national emergencies Uh like Hurricane Maria in 2017 2.3 billion dollars was given Right, but under uh Biden administration look at the Hawaii wildfires a fraction of it 210 million hurricane item 20 10 2021 414 million Hurricane Fiona 177 million hurricane sandy under Obama's and Obama was 161 million right now There's been some inflation since there so we could say probably Maybe double that right so 300 million, but still it's a very clear Clear tail tail sign. Yeah, there's a big difference between when uh of Republicans Yes, and when the Democrats in office well a recent Democrat. Yes, right Um, and now we're out of money, okay, and so uh my orcus uh, he said quote We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have we are expecting another hurricane hitting my orcus said quote FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season Now my orcus uh, he all receives the Department of Homeland Security or Homeland Security that controls FEMA that controls Um our border right controls a bunch of different things secret service falls under there their budget as well And I have a couple of headlines here. We're gonna ideology read through these Um, and you tell me what you see Department of Homeland Security announces 380 million additional funding to communities receiving migrants FEMA awards 110 million to the emergency food and shelter program to assist migrants Department of Homeland Security announces distribution of more than 77 million in congressional funding for communities receiving migrants New York City to get 104.6 million from FEMA for asylum seekers Department of Homeland Security announces distribution of more than 12 million in funding Department of Homeland Security announces 300 million in direct funding to communities receiving migrants and 340 million for a new competitive awards process Now don't you worry we're helping Americans. We're taking care of our own Uh, Kamala Harris chimed it on this check this clip up Uh, and the federal relief and assistance that we have been providing has included um FEMA providing $750 for folks who need immediate needs being met You could see it on her face how bad she knows that is you could see it on her face So 750 bucks bro It's disgusting. We have migrants having their their EBT cards loaded up with six to 12,000 dollars receiving free housing free food free health care which by the way You and I pay for and now these same people are unwilling to help actual American citizens who are displaced by this hurricane And literally We have no idea how many people are dead. We don't even know how many people are missing We have no idea because it's so it had You would all do yourselves a major service to really dig in to what is going on in the Asheville area in North Carolina area with this this hurricane situation There are People using their own means their own money their own fuel their own time to rescue these people while Just yesterday six seven days after it happened there was a An approval of some troop activities all right But up until yesterday. This has been entirely civilian based Okay now through largely is yeah bro listen man Yesterday I said they almost seems like It's on purpose now. I'm convinced it's on purpose well after seeing them come out and say We're only going to give them seven hundred and fifty dollars And then my ork is saying female doesn't have the money to do it after they've sent 150 billion dollars overseas to both Ukraine and Israel and then a number of other amounts in the billions to other countries Oh, well, I got the numbers for you bro. Here we go just this year alone This is 2024 so if we included 22 23 24 that Ukraine number be over a hundred. Oh, okay, but I'll read the numbers to you because the audio people can't see this 24 billion to Ukraine 11.3 billion israel 1.95 billion Ethiopia 1.6 billion to Jordan 1.4 billion to Egypt 1.1 billion to Afghanistan 1.1 billion to Somalia 1 billion to Yemen 987 million to Congo 896 million to Syria 9,000 dollars per illegal immigrant that has entered the US and the American citizens who lost everything They're homes their towns their communities their loved ones seven hundred and fifty dollars per person And by the way You paid for all of that Does that sound like the people that you want representing you? Does that sound like freedom when we are working until july and august to pay the federal government and our tax revenue This and then they take the revenue and spend it all over the world and funnel half the back to themselves bro, we are tax slaves. We are sers all right this year To non-American citizens there has been a hundred and eighty three billion dollars distributed to non-Americans There is a hundred and fifty thousand americans in need of relief and each American for that money could have received 1.2 million dollars, but you know what they got 750 bucks What did they get over there and in and you crane what did they get over there in israel See why are we spending our money on these other places and by the way most of these other places hate us So why are we doing that? Okay, the answer is because they can't launder the money through our own system So they send it over there they pretend like they're doing some fake social and work or some sort of war or conflict They take half the money they buy weapons which makes their weapon donors Raytheon Lockheed Martin all these companies and those are their biggest donors and makes them rich They get to keep part of the money because they wash it back to themselves It comes back through into their lives as donations and all kinds of other BS as we learn through hunter Biden's laptop While American sit here in suffer bro and we live in a declining nation a decrepit nation a nation with Bullshit infrastructure that's 20 years behind other countries and we're told this is the greatest country in the world This is the land of the free do you think it sounds very free when you work until july or august for the federal government and then the rest of the year you get to work for your own family How is that free and it would be one thing if that money was to come back to us and our country was completely safe With no crime and beautiful everything roads buildings infrastructures programs health care Totally different story I would still think that would be better if private companies did that But I would have less of an argument for lower taxes if our government actually spent our money on us and The things that are good for us and I think people are finally seeing it with this hurricane situation How little our government cares about us and how much they care about themselves and you guys wonder how they walk out of the office You know worth hundreds of millions of dollars. This is how this is how they do it Okay, and these people are more concerned with making money for themselves Then they are with helping people who are literally dying who are American citizens They could very easily have rescued all those people probably in 24 hours But they chose not to all right, so why did they choose not to why are they allowing this to happen What is going on here and there's a lot of theories about that there's the theory that You know because do this happens when it happened in Hawaii Black rock comes in these big funds come in they buy up all the properties and then they move people out of the way why Why do they do that in certain properties when When these disasters happen in Florida that's what happens these big funds come in they buy up the houses that people move He's on the dollar Well, it just so happens that this area that We're talking about is the richest natural resource area in the United States when it comes to lithium and cobalt which are the Products needed to build the electric vehicles and the electric technology that is being pushed on us by the globalists and the green people All these people still have stocks in yes, okay So the next thing that's going to happen here is these big funds are going to come in and try to offer these people money For their property which is no longer there and it probably a lot of people are going to say I have to start over man and and there's nothing here to start over with here's 25 grand for you or whatever You know dude. I hope I hope that people realize what's happening here But that's one theory. I'm not saying it's the truth But people are talking about it and it does make sense And then you know because dude I've been in touch with a bunch of different people on the ground I've been in touch with a bunch of people in the government trying to make shit happen at the best I can I mean in the big scheme of things. I don't have that much pool, but I do the best I can and Nobody can give me a straight answer on what's going on You know the the military is on site allegedly, but they're not getting orders to do anything right? Okay, and they're being told also that well for safety reasons The locals know the area better than we would know it so for safety reason we're to let them handle it There's all kinds of shit coming out from the ground floor that the government is actually denying in public And why aren't they showing this on CNN? Why aren't they showing this on MSNBC? Why aren't they showing this on ABC? Why are they showing and pretending like the government has come in and had control of it And then everybody on the ground is saying otherwise, right? Why is that? Who do you believe I tell you this? I don't believe the media saying everything's under control I believe the people on the ground are saying fuck dude. We need help help us Yeah, and I hope everybody will take an interest in helping what's going on there. You know there's a There's a legal defense called the bad a woman syndrome And I feel like that's what the fuck they're doing to us like I feel like we are abused spouses That are going to fucking snap on these fucking people, you know now the one thing and we we've pointed this out a few times so far throughout you know covering the story man um And it it's refreshing to see I'm glad to see it. I'm glad it's happening man, but it shouldn't have to be happening It's stories like this. I don't know if you've seen this This tweet from dr. Clayton Forster Mountain Buil Packer Ranch is a company based in North Carolina that provides pack mules For military missions the company has been using its mules to get donated food lights, tarps, batteries and other supplies To stranded residents in black mart mountain and swananoa north Carolina This is what America's all about and so it's this man on it again like you on his own dime. Yeah Using his own money his own resources He is going in and doing far more than our government is doing. Yeah Dude the thing is here bro is that We have to come to an understanding Of what's actually happening these are communist people who are trying to demoralize this country as much as possible And they're normalizing these kind of things so that we will just get used to having it happen And then able to tax us to death steal our money not give any back and you know what fuck you That's what they're doing to us. You're not gonna do anything you guys aren't good We have as citizens of this country We have to come together dude We have to stop believing this divisive shit that they put out against us We have to stop believing that this is left versus right or black versus white or gay versus straight It's not any of that shit. It's tyrants versus citizens That is what's going on in this country and these people are not believers in the republic of the United States These people are believers in an alternative way of operating this country which is totally against what our constitution is about There's articles being written by these leftists saying there's a time to abandon the constitution That's what they want okay because they want a communist state here in this country They want a third world country in the United States that is completely dependent on the government So that they can work us to death take all of our money and keep it for themselves And create an upper upper class that they all belong to and a peasant class that the rest of us belong to And if you don't think that's what's going on you do not get it no This they're not doing anything here Yes, your day. I was like man. This seems like they wanted to happen today I'm like they are trying to demoralize the citizenship. What bro to that point, you know, it's like There's something to be said we talk about on the show. It's personal accents, right? We should be at a point in society where we don't have to rely on our government, right? Like In a perfect world that'd be great the problem is is that when they're taking our money And billions of hundreds of billions of dollars There is a responsibility in obligation that they should be doing something and they're not doing something bro Have they not been taking our shit cool listen to the government is so encroached into our daily lives So much that the media has become an entertainment channel for What's happening the theater that's happening in politics? There's no news reported. There's no actual things. It's a propaganda resource for them and That's now what this country's supposed to be dude We're supposed to be able to go live our lives worry about our careers You know make sure that we're building our own families and our own communities and our own careers And we should be able to do that without having to worry about this That's the point of the government And they haven't crouched on us so far that now it's a literal discussion amongst everyone every single day Every single day everyone is out here talking about what the fuck is going on in the United States America We shouldn't even see them We shouldn't even hear from them We should they should be trusted to reasonably and responsibly allocate the tax dollars they do take What should be far less than what they actually take to spend that responsibly so they don't have to tax us Into a financially difficult situation. They choose to do that intentionally Because the weaker we are the stronger they are and what better way to weaken us than to make it impossible Financially to survive how can average American pay attention what the government's doing when they are stressed to the max About even being able to fucking eat that is what's happening in this country right now And it is intentional it is tyrannical and it needs to stop and the only way it's going to stop is that all of us people White people black people Gay people straight people left people right people whatever you think you are You need to wash yourself of that identity and realize that at the end of the day Everybody else in the world including our own government sees us as Americans And our own government is saying we're gonna They're not hurting just one segment of society. They're crushing everybody Do you think the government who says all this stuff about left right black white gay straight you think they actually believe that shit No, they say it so that we won't come together knowing that we will sit here and bicker and fight and argue and never create the unity needed to Deplatform them from taking advantage of us And to your point about intentionality, bro. I mean like you said you see it more and more every day, bro Biden decided to get them to answer questions very rarely does he do so Israel's right now talking about bombing oil sites in our in Iran See what this fucking dude just said Discussion that I think I think that would be a little And guess what happened right after this we were discussing. I think that'll be a little anyway Yes, why happen right after this this video they probably did it. No Oil prices searched. Yeah, you know, I'm saying like there's a direct thing and just like it's commonly like There's intentional things that are being done and that's the whole point of this headline guys is Like we talk about it, but there's proof here. There's intentional things that are being said and done to hurt this country even more You know what I think bro. I think they're trying to create as much damage as they I think they've realized that they can't cheat their way around Trump They've tried to shoot them twice. That's not working Fuck it. Let them have them. No, I think what they figured out is we're gonna create as much damage as we possibly can So that we can blame it on Trump for the next four years and hopefully win back and you know two years the Senate Four years the presidency and get back on the track Because I think they've realized they've derailed it So now I think they're gonna try to create all these problems and pin them on Trump if he gets elected Well, I mean people don't even understand the implications of that alone bro like there is gonna be the Trump if Trump gets elected. He has four years He has four years to try to one Obviously hold these people accountable, right? But then too he has to fix all of this shit that they just fucking fucked up Bro, it'd be easy to fix the real talk is this is easy to fix Okay, you walk in you sign a few executive orders about getting us back on the energy Our own energy independence You get the prices down you get that means shipping prices go down. It means cost of goods go down. That means families have extra money um And you're gonna have to do some sort of debt restructuring with the banks, you know every time there's a problem with the economy What do they do they put more money and stimulate the economy by giving the Bell them out by giving the citizens money And the citizens don't understand that that inflates the rest of the currency which makes their money that they do have and the things They own worth less So all they're doing is stealing from you and giving you more cash upfront which ultimately makes you poorer all right So They do that every time I think it's time for A drastic restructuring of a tax structure of our debt structure What if somebody were to say the next time that the economy needs to be stimulated they said you know what VISA mastercard You know all the big banks in the world. Guess what Everybody's personal debt is wiped out fuck you you've been on these people's ass for a hundred years You're gonna take the hit this time. What if they did that? What would that do for the economy? See there's all kinds of things that could be done Immediately to fix shit and flip it over whether or not that's gonna happen I don't know but I think it will because I think that's the only option he's gonna have He's gonna have some very specific action that needs to take place place immediately and um You know, I think these people are full destruction mode because they understand that you know Whether or not they destroy and Trump gets in they can play me on him or whether or not he doesn't get in They still continue to move their agenda towards the world economic form agenda of third worldizing our United States and then creating you know uh Poverty destruction Third world living for the rest of us.

No, no, no, we don't we don't want them in sports We don't want them to read and drag our story time We don't want to wear tights at the restaurant and act like it's a strip club in front of little kids.

Well, I'm gonna point now where I just assume if you're defending it bro You got some issues and and your hard drive probably doesn't need to be checked. Yeah, that's fair statement Yeah, we guys let's keep this cruise moving. Let's get into headline number two. This is uh, this is a funny one Uh, headline number two reads Politico Says JD Vance's facial hair is about conveying aggression Shows his hatred of feminism. So all these men that have facial hair addresses women or they hate feminism too Oh, oh man, I didn't So it's okay for a drag queen to have facial hair, but not JD Vance a woman because it makes JD Vance hate women What about the women that have they are women So they can't possibly hate women because they are women, but just with a weiner. Yeah, right. Yeah, but so so if you dress as a woman If you put a dress on you got a weiner and you wear a facial hair, it's okay You're probably woman, but if you go on TV and you run for vice president United States and you've come from nothing and you've built yourself into a quality man You hate women. Yep. Okay. I got it. Yeah, got it makes perfect sense sure does that's diving to this man So in a bizarre post debate analysis Politico magazine has looked into the supposed significance of JD Vance's facial hair After Vance gave his fellow vice presidential nominee Tim Walls just During Tuesday nights debate Politico sought to dissect the candidates body language including their physical features the piece written by body language expert Joe Navarro he explains one of the first quote One of the first bits of non-verbal communication to appear in the debate was on JD Vance's face his beard As political magazine has noted before Vance is the first white house want to be to wear facial hair in 80 years Our appearance is fundamental to our body language and research indicates that voters see beards as surprise surprise more masculine Uh, that can be positive as some um That could be positive to some but to others especially women it can be negative conveying aggression and opposition to feminist ideas. So here's here's the post All right, there it is that circle that that's political circling his beard which In all fairness Vance I think in these little you know, I got your beard's a little weak bro. Yeah, yeah, we need a toughen that thing up I can send you we need more we need more toxic masculine not less I mean toxic masculine is not even fucking toxic. It's required So they're calling regular masculinity toxic. Well, here's the thing out of here So I want you to see what they have to say about about walsers is it washes? Huh walls walls walls is walsers. Let's look at what they say about walsers Read his Andy. I want you to know what you do Wals wide eye showed his passion. Oh, yeah That's what I saw that's what I saw I popping can sometimes be a sign of surprise But for walls it was simply revealed his emotional intensity Hey guys you better get your shit together. How's that gonna work for me. I'm gonna talk like this all time. Yeah, shame to be I can't even open my eyes like that Cuz like my my glove or told me I got some Asian in me or something a little Dave in you. Yeah, something anyway The point is Is this is bullshit bro. Well, I mean, I just had a how do you even like this shit dude? Who believes there's nobody to believe this I guarantee you that this Navarro dude. Uh, what's his name? Yeah, he's got pronouns Joe Navarro. I guarantee you he wrote this does he got Instagram? Probably look at my CVs got pronouns. He's got pronouns. I guarantee you That while he was writing this article He was a Stadium urinal with his pants below all the way Dude, Joe Navarro definitely pisses with his pants around his ankles. Bro. Yeah, I mean, it just made me think man It just made me think like I think about this country and I think about the history of this country And I'm gonna get a little comular going but in the context of context I grew up in middle class family Start there. No, because what middle but I think about like fucking historical fucking figures massive things that have happened over this country and the great men That did those things like Abraham Lincoln. Yeah, he had a beard. Yeah That's right. He did. There was some girth there. He looked like he took a chin strap beard Yeah, a little chin strap. Yeah, but I think about like the fucking like like bro The people who literally changed the course of history in this country You mean like you list assessed Grant who had the coolest beard ever Bro and by the way the most underrated president of all time this man actually fought in the Civil War He founded the party called the radical Republicans. He went on horseback and killed the slave owners himself And people don't talk about them. No, they don't say nothing about it. Yeah, now here's another interesting thing All right, because that got every single person should read about General president grant, bro. He's awesome bro the true American in the terms of what America was supposed to represent He struggled his whole life with alcoholism He had all kinds of negative things that happened to him This guy overcame those things became president. He was a great president He was a great leader a great general and he is actually responsible for physically Yeah, physically responsible for the slaves Being free and the country being reunited But I think he's the I think he's the best president to ever Existed. Yeah, for sure. I mean definitely underrated, bro. Like he does not get the credit he deserves Um, but I thought this was interesting and here's a thing guys like we we know how the internet is imagine him debating Tim Wallace Bro tampon Tim. Oh my god, but but here's the thing the internet is a funny place because you know When you put things out on the internet they stay there right like there's receipts that can be pulled right and if we go back a little bit in history to politico all right back in 2020 I want you to read this this tweet from politico on December 23rd of 2020 At the very beginning of this in terminable year Justin Trudeau grew a beard the beard was significant a symbol of a once youthful prime minister who is now older Weisler and battle scarred. Oh, so bearded our fine. So it's okay if they do it if if it's on cucks, but it's a problem when we do it How's that go? It's cool. They do it. Probably not do it. There you go. Fuck him But I mean, I'm just Bro, it's interesting. You can't tell me that Trudeau is not fucking fiddle Castro son Have you seen the pictures of him side by side? He also pisses with his pants around his ankles He does more than that. Legitly. Yeah, he does more than that. Yeah, he drinks a be fucking big giant green cucumbers are on his grocery list every week And they don't get eaten They get swallowed Not man, but obviously we know there's like there's a pockery and like you know they're they're cool with their guys You know our guys is fuck him, you know we I get it You know, but I didn't think this other piece was interesting to I've been watching this over the last couple of days seeing what comes of it and it's interesting. Have you seen this Media berry woman battering allegation with Doug M. Hoff puff pieces Um, you see this no So the second gentleman Kamala Harris's husband Doug M. Hoff, okay, he has since been accused in recent days of Slapping when if his Girlfriends. Oh really? Yeah, like slapping the show out of her. Oh really? Yeah, and And to no one surprised let's read this article to no one surprised the corporate media are engaged in a full-on propaganda campaign to Barry the credible bombshell News that Kamala Harris has husband Doug M. Hoff allegedly battered a former girlfriend on Wednesday The Daily Mail released a story that includes statements from three friends of the alleged victim Along with travel documents and photos to back up the claim The claim is this in 2012 while attending the K. N's film festival M. Hoff slapped a then-girlfriend so hard she spun completely around Now I don't think he can swing that hard. All right. I think you know, but you know, okay Two of the alleged victims friends say they were told of the abuse at the time the third learned of it in 2018 As of now and for reasons we can all understand the identity of the alleged victim and her three friends have not been revealed This is political dynamite that could hurt the Democrat nominee for president just weeks before an election Where these people to come forward the corporate media would pull all their resources into annihilating their lives and Reputations that's fact Democrats are always Protected by the media at all costs, but as of now the fake media are not only ignoring The credible allegation of physical abuse committed by a man who could become America's historic first gentleman The media are going even further to bury the story by producing one puff piece after another Uh to make M. Hoff look like some type of hero from the New Yorker Um entertainment weekly. I mean, they're just putting these dumb articles out Um, they're trying to paint him as this awesome dude Um, I mean covering the fact that he went to a fucking water burger Like who gives a shit, you know, it's just interesting Um, now to that point another person waiting Texas go to water burger even better do it with beta over And then pee in the computer when the pants are on our ankles We can sort fight Yes What a burger with a sword fight There could be a better day. That's often menu. You gotta ask that often menu. That's a special. They hooked us up because I'm dug him off Fuck But uh Now another person I don't know I'm not gonna say I put this guy on my my he's like he's not on my favorite list yet I don't know if he could get there Chris Cuomo All right, no he's banned I think I think so too. He's banned for life for what he did for COVID But he is I don't know if this is like it's like I feel like He's a snake bro. I feel like trying to work his weasel his way out of the bag of accountability by pretending like he's fucking one of us I agree But I feel like I'm getting some like Mark Zuckerberg vibes from him. Yeah, well, right Because even he's calling bullshit on this Chris Cuomo blast mainstream media for ignoring Doug and Hothas Saw claims quote if it were Trump it would be on every TV show Yeah, man. Why would you talking like that when you were on CNN? Why would you say in any of that stuff four years ago whenever you were on the TV Making people feel like they were gonna be exiled from society for not wanting to take an experimental Vaccine people like me who have pre-existing heart conditions, right like Listen, man I would have to have a long personal conversation with Chris Cuomo to ever think that he wasn't a piece of shit That's just my personal take Chris the office on the table. Yeah, he's welcome to come on the show But like dude what he did in my mind was unforgivable, unforgivable. I agree. Let's check out what he had to say on this topic though If the name were Trump instead of M-Hoth it would be all over the news Daily mail echoed by the New York Post has a story Doug M-Hoth Kamala Harris's husband Accused of striking a woman he was on a date with at the Cannes Film Festival back in 2012 They they had been drinking and he didn't like how she talked to the valed He smacked her she smacked them back You do not get very often people coming forward named and the reason is they were worried about retaliation These are very powerful people were talking about three friends all saying they were told the same thing Two of them contemporaneously this woman Jane we're calling her she called one of the friends Immediately after the incident that's what this this friend told me ordinarily and don't care about these stories You could say well there may have been an assault while she didn't go to the police He's not really running but again if it were Trump or anyone related to him It would be on every TV show that is on right now Well, of course it would be because it's extremely wrong and damaging right you shouldn't be smacking a fucking woman, bro Okay, like that's the reality What it is what it is and that's a big story for anybody and you know what She's right They will come after her and they will try to ruin her life they will try to take her job They will ruin everything it doesn't matter how much good she did it doesn't matter she could have cured Diseases she could be they will try to ruin her for standing in the way of Their agenda and dude that's that's completely wrong. They've done it before they did it with the fucking laptop Bro come on five years ago. They do it to every don't let Hillary get away from it everybody who has a voice of Contention yeah in the opposite direction the minute That they that person opens a crack for them to fill and then they try to fucking take your house They try to take your companies. They try to ruin your life. They try to ruin your reputation and never fucking stops Okay, these people are a disease that needs to be cured from this country I'm talking about the big corporate media. I'm not talking about you guys on the local level who actually do a decent job of Representing the news just so we're clear. I'm talking about the big fucking network channels They are all propaganda. They are all about the narrative and they will crush anyone because there's no Think what they did before social media to people. No, man. Yeah, that's a scary thing Yeah, this is why Dave Portino is such a great character in in the internet because Dave Portino when they do the shit to him He just goes right back at him. He's like, you know what? Eat a dick. Fuck you. Eat three of them when he got when he got called out for having like freaky sex He goes so I like freaky sex So why like dude the guy just knows how to handle these things and he didn't have a thousand bottles of loop either no Now of course Doug M. Hoff and I can't even say him personally. He had one of his reps Come out. Doug M. Hoff rep the nice claims second gentleman slapped in girlfriend at 2012 Canes film festival second gentleman dug M. Hoff has denied a shocking report that he slapped his then girlfriend more than a decade ago After thinking she was flirting with another man quote this report is untrue An M. Hoff spokesperson told see before adding that quote any suggestion that he would or ever hit a woman is false The girlfriend described as a successful New York attorney by the Daily Mail Apparently slapped M. Hoff back the friends at the friends Provided photos and other interactions between M. Hoff and the former girlfriend to the Daily Mail to corroborate the story M. Hoff and Harris Again their relationship in 2013 one year after the incident and then they married in 2014 so Oh look dude, and we're gonna be fair okay, we don't we don't know if this happened or not All right, and it's very easy to Acuse someone of things like this once they've ascended to a position of notoriety or power for sure now Do I think it happened it probably happened But there's lots of this shit that happens to men every single day that is completely made up All right, because the truth of the matter is is that men Their story is not true When you stack it next to a woman's story never no and you know, we see this all the time where women come out of the woodwork They accuse somebody high up with some shit and then it comes out that they were making it up and then there's no repercussions for that person All right, so we have a fundamental problem with false accusations and law fair in this country when it comes to sexual or violent accusations Inside of a domestic relationship Okay, so for I'm not saying he didn't do it in fact. I probably believe that he did do it But I think there needs to be if we're going to accuse people of this shit there needs to be solid proof and I haven't seen that yet So you know, but I hear why they wouldn't it doesn't have a hand for it I mean, you know, dude look you got the form look people don't realize dude, you know When you when you start to You know become somewhat famous or are you people know you have money People come out of the woodwork to try and fuck and get some of it and they make up stories and they tell lies and they do everything They can and there's no repercussions. They zero And there needs to be like there needs to be a situation in this country And it will never happen because the people who make the laws are all attorneys But there needs to be some sort of repercussion like if you accuse someone of rape and it comes out that you didn't do it The person who made the accusation should have to serve that sentence Okay, if you accuse someone of doing something extremely violent to you and it comes out they didn't do it You should have to serve the sentence of the accusation and that will stop false accusations And maybe that's not the exact plan. Maybe there's maybe there's some nuance there But there needs to be accountability in a real way for false accusations And that's what I'm trying to communicate what do because a lot of times the accusations alone will destroy that person You can't get it back and nobody cares if it comes out a year later that it wasn't true No, the damage is already done dude You see it countless of times 100% yeah college football players You know I'm saying on the rise to fucking NFL they get into these Happened to that picture from the Dodgers Trevor Bauer Okay, he had a woman and I think it was two women I don't know the details of the story off top of my head But anyway, they made these accusations against them that ended up being false And now he's pitching the fucking Mexican league bro this guy want to say young No team will even sign him even though the allegations have been proven to be false That's an example of what you're saying. That's not okay, dude Because this man only has an unlimited amount of time to you make the money in his career choice And because he was accused of something that turns out to be Apparently not true now he can't even earn a living these workers whole life to work Dude, that happens to men all the time bro That happens to men all the time and once they get that stuck to him dude It's stuck to him and there needs to be a societal recognition of that meaning like it doesn't matter if I don't like him I have to see the truth to know whether it happened or not That's how we need to do this. Yep instead of just saying oh You know, I fucking hate that guy cuz I don't like him. No, I don't know But but to assume that he's guilty of that without seeing the proof I can't do that. Yeah, that's fair Yeah, that's why we keep it real as fucker guys. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think Let us know down in the comments, but that being said let's get to our third and final headline at number three Uh, hell on number three reads talk about some proof 13 bombshell revelations from lawyer filing suits on behalf of 120 Diddy coms accusers 120 bro hey Bro, so he's been doing some work organizing this bro lizard. I haven't I haven't been watching this I've been watching I've been watching the uh situation in the Middle East and the hurricane more than anything Well for sure and I am listening to your point, you know accusations You know, we have a rule in this country. It's supposed to be a rule here in this and it's approving guilty right? All right, that's in the court of law. Yeah, but when you got 200 people saying he did something There's that and there's police reports like like this man has the evidence. So let's dive into this um, and let's let's check this out the busby law firm and the ava log group held a joint press conference on Tuesday where busbies lead counsel Tony busby unleashed a slew of bombshell revelations and allegations involving the 120 cases that will soon be filed against disgraced music mogul Sean Diddy coms his associates and others Now the article list out 13. I got a couple important ones here. We'll cover So the first one there's 25 of the 120 coms accusers were minors at the time the alleged incidents occurred quote When we talk about the ages of the victims when the conduct occurred it's shocking busby said 25 of the 120 individuals who are plaintiffs in these cases were minors at the time of the acts complained of uh another piece of this is that The the youngest alleged sex abuse victim of coms was just nine years old Check this clip We talk about the ages of the victims when the conduct occurred it's shocking Our youngest victim at the time of the occurrence was nine years old Jesus We have an individual who was 14 years old. We have one who was 15 25 of the 120 individuals who are plaintiffs in these cases were minors at the time of the acts complained of The time frame of the acts complained of is very wide The conduct that issue spans from the years 1991 all the way till this year 2024 If you wonder why there are so many alleged you can't tell me That this dude isn't part of some sort of blackmail op They allowed it to go on since 1991 over 30 years. Yeah You do you think that these people haven't been coming forward you they just came forward now If you wonder why there are so many alleged victims that's your answer We're talking about more than 25 years of this type of conduct Now to people who say you know because like there's always this all well like why did they go to the hospital? Why did they go to the police? Why did they say something? Well, here's another bombshow piece in this investigation Most of the alleged victims filed reports with police or hospitals at the time of the incidents More than 55% of the victims filed reports Reported this conduct to either the authorities that is the police or to the hospitals Quote we are in the process of collecting with our team assistance medical records reports that were made to the authorities And I've already said that some of the individuals did in fact talk to the FBI What do you think happened here? Because I tell you what I think have no exact what happened what Where did you say he was shondit p-diddy? I'll just listen to them. Okay. Yeah, we'll take this into what we'll do in a minute We're working on some stuff already. We're just gonna add this into the case Why we'll get back to you. We'll be in touch with you. That's right. That's exactly what happened It's discussed there the three letter agencies came in because I promise you the police were ready to do something The local police are not in on this. This is the three letter agencies coming in and telling the police It's not jurisdiction. Hey, we got it. We're working a big case Don't worry about it. Don't fuck it up. Right. We got it. That's what the fuck's been going on You know, that's that's what I think's been going on and that's what's happening and he's saying that you know You would think that there would be Thousands of people jumping on this. This is another point that the attorney made. He's like, you know We've been we have we have a call line that is set up I mean post to the number. I mean the number is right behind him in the clip And he's like, you know Typically what we see in these cases is that people you know will like jump in and you know because they have to verify all of this Yeah, they verify that their age time, you know They really look into this. There's no point of bringing bullshit to the court and he's like, you know In this case that he feels like it's far more than 120 people They're just scared of like they're scared to death literally That's what this attorney is saying and that's why we're not seeing more numbers because he's like once they open up the call line They were expecting thousands of calls to come in So now what happened? It's like even the victims that he has right now and this is not a class action lawsuit He's filing each one of these individually bro every one of these people was probably at some point threatened by Diddy and Told if you say anything about this bro, I fucking kill you and you know what? I have people that'll kill you That's probably what he was saying and you know what that's believable It is man Now other other points in this check this out banks pharmaceutical companies and hotels Will also be implicated in the lawsuits from the attorney says quote These defendants will not only include individuals but also include corporate entities who ultimately profited Off of this culture and behavior buzz be said. I'm looking at banks Pharmaceutical companies and hotels we know that many of these individuals were paid cash We know that many of these individuals involved whether they were ones being assaulted or abused or they're witnessing other people being assaulted and abused And then paid and threatened and told to leave typically paid 10 grand in cash and told to leave Now a last revelation that I want to point out was this one here, which is even crazier But the 12th point they have on this is that the group of alleged victims is evenly divided between males and females Our law firms have quote our law firms have been retained by 120 individuals at this point to pursue cases In civil court against shonditi combs buzz be said you should know in this group It is evenly divided between males and females there are 60 males and 60 females who have joined us to pursue these claims as plaintiffs Now If this was not giving major Epstein vibes I think honestly we're getting more information from this diddy case than we have with the Epstein case It's the exact same thing. Yeah, it's the exact same thing where this man allegedly Has a hold on the industry in his case is the music industry These people are guaranteed though the plaintiffs in these case these are probably rising stars These are people who would have been top billboard track artists These are people who would have made it bigger the music industry and he controlled the keys to them entire thing Through this shit you'll be leasing them in the hip hop in the hip hop culture world exactly Bro listen, I think there's way more people just like this. It's just like diddy Yeah, I think there's a whole bunch of people just like this who all have their role to play in this operation And and dude him getting caught up in this and the Epstein thing and they'll probably be another one and eventually It's gonna it's gonna open people's eyes to how things are the way they are Meaning why is the music all about doing drugs and fucking hose and you know making money over everything and why is the You know the music industry so satanic in their presentation and all these things Why is it that only certain people get chosen to make it when there's all these other people that are just as talented If not more right like let's be real bro Diddy wasn't a fucking talent to do when he got on stage like I could go on stage and beat his ass a hundred percent a hundred percent I could a hundred percent I do a concert listen I've proved a plenty of times people have been around I have way more stage presence that fucker has that guy rode the back of biggie smalls bro And I believe my personal opinion is if you want to look at who killed two pocket and biggie and who who profited off of the most I mean he made the most money off of it. He's shot to start him. All right Just saying You know you got this guy who's the government you it listen like okay cool. Just listen. Yes. Yes. Yes They allow they want him to do it because it gives control over the shit You got this guy who's at 17 years old is literally the best rapper alive and he's killed at 24 You're bullshit The guy was out shining him Do you think biggie went to sold the amount of records and been the legend that he is had he not been killed No everybody to get killed early that has talent is like that And this guy rode I mean who owns the masters the biggest music Who won who won who's made the most money off of him You see what I'm saying Peter he inserted himself in 20 of the fucking 25 songs on life after death He's in there going. Yeah, oh, huh bad boy like that's his whole fucking shit. He ain't talented bro He never has been You know there's the best song they ever made with a song called victory and there's a whole verse in there by diddy to sucks You know you got you know what song I'm talking about You know what I mean like dude whatever look at that guy's face. He's not even good looking bro. He was chosen Looks like a mother fucking alien. Oh man. You look like the dude he looks like the dude off Captain Phillips on the captain. Now the captain. Yeah.
