pretty and really impressed by what's going on here I like being surprised in an inspirational kind of way yeah so you're so northwestern Ohio is where you are I say the greater Toledo area because I don't want to totally claim Toledo as sure so Perry'sburg let me see it makes it yeah yeah yeah now Perry'sburg I say is the town like America was for chain stores and credit cards so it's pretty darn nice really yeah yeah I love it that's awesome man I really do it's great great life there you know especially for raising kids yeah I can drive any cookie-old car I want if I want to pick up my kid from school in a 1931 Buick Faitton big I'll do it yeah or you want to rock the stick shift Lamborghini in the countryside I'll do it yeah it's just you know it's just it's just all American yeah that's awesome dude I find myself craving that more and more yeah here yeah it's kind of like I'll hold you 43 yeah so we're real close I mean like I find myself starting to like and I think it's different for guys that are our age because we experience that life yeah and then we've experienced this life yeah 80s and 90s for cell phones and internet right there's something visceral about it yeah it makes a cross-town yeah you're on your own it was adventure every day yeah like your parents kicked you out of the house and they said you know go do what you're gonna do and yeah or you just ran off yeah you might get hurt you know we started a fire jump three creeks and I build a cannon yeah someone talking about dude but like it's just I don't know what it is man I'm starting to like crave that like bad like where I don't want to live and maybe this is just like the hermit in me because I am a little bit of a hermit you're a little hermit yeah but her little hermity yeah it's in there you know well fuck man I mean I justified for sure it's be real the show it's nice to be yeah yeah yeah but yeah dude I've started to like I kind of I'm like fuck do maybe I should just move like where the fuck out like you can and then get a helicopter you know what I'm saying I think there's a there's a trick to this okay so some of you guys probably seen going around maybe like Instagram oh another's this common theme is like this is what they took from us you guys have seen oh yeah right you see and I've said something similar it's like I'm a my own grass I don't necessarily have to and maybe you know the time resource be if I paid somebody else to do it but I don't want that taken away from me yeah I still want to feel good about maintaining my home set like I got white pain on me because before I came here yesterday I'm like I'll drive later I'm gonna I'm gonna paint the deck today yeah you know and I think this is important to for us especially in this day and age when so much is being taken away and like you're fired and changed it's like just still be a man or be a person take ownership of what you're doing and work with your hands DJ does that all the time sure that's a big hobby is that's all but I don't know if that's necessarily an age thing I think I think it is the times yeah different though you're you're I would you I would call you like a old soul like you you like things like he likes that he's only 29 he likes all the same kind of shit that that we would talk about yeah you know I think it's rare for guys you're age is being more deep in things it's like hey you can be interested in just what is now okay that's fine be in the moment but there's thousands of years of human history before this to explore and be and you know adventure in and be inspired by yeah yeah dude and like I remember like we will go to my mom's my mom was raised by her grandparents and they lived in Shawnee town Illinois okay which is right on the Ohio River and he my grandpa great who's my great grandpa which was like her dad yeah he was a cat fisherman on the Ohio River so that was his business and dude talk about a tough a tough man he lived in the corn crib of his of where he worked yeah in the winter he like lived inside the corn crib wow of this farm that he worked on then one time when he's growing up his brother got drunk and shot him in the fucking shoulder with a shotgun yeah dude so he ended up yeah so he ended up being a a fisherman on the Ohio River so when I was young we would go up there and they had like a barge that was like on the river and you know they had a little ramp and it would go up almost like a dock like people would think it was a thing people living on kind of like barges in the Ohio River I don't know I know a guy that does I'm a binner for a long time yeah I mean it's been 25 years since I've been up there and I think about going up there all the time dude just like checking it out but yeah we used to go there me and my brother and bro he'd be pulling fish out of the out of the water that were as big as us like this fish you catch on the Mississippi dude they'd be three feet four feet yeah huge catfish and dude he had an old Coke machine that had bottles like glass bottles you know and like that was the big deal so had cocaine in it no not that one too far yeah too far back just about a glass bottle dude that's what I'm saying so like it was a big deal for a I could still remember like the smell and like which wasn't good but it had a smell and and then like the toilet had a like it just went straight into the river yeah so you'd sit on the toilet bro and there'd be like water right there my you know that made me think when you said the the Coke machine you know me growing up the family business was a little public golf course yeah Senna Gahill Sally's not there anymore but you know in the 80s I grew up helping the family business you know like you know people would want candy bars and pop or whatever they'd get in beer and stuff like that so like my whole childhood is a blend between the movie Caddy Shack just straight up I love that movie like being a kid again DJ's for sure never seen it yeah no you got to watch it man like my wife is like let's have cocktail night and watch Caddy Shackton brother I fucking get him to watch days of thunder you know he says me he says oh dude you see all bad the videography what I'm like it was fucking 1985 man drink something yeah no shit yeah no I see that like that same thing back in the 80s it's like some people say it's like what was your childhood life I'm like well it's kind of like being at a bar outside all that so I still remember like all that guy drank stroze yeah I drank bud like you know yeah dude we grew up on baseball diamonds were all the parents fucking drank yes like after the games bro the parents got fucked up and we just got playing baseball yeah bro I I probably shouldn't say this but one time dude I was like nine ten and fucking I drove the car home because I'm so fucked up sounds done it too bro I'll stretch you to loop take yeah there is for sure we're good but uh but yeah I mean dude I just like I don't know man I crave that kind of like nostalgic feeling almost and I don't have too many memories of like being young I don't know why like I don't I don't I'm not one of those I'm always looking forward sure I don't like look back to yeah yeah and there's some value to nostalgia like yeah finding memories against and knowing who you are where you came from yeah I move forward yeah and uh the more the more the more we're going a long way around but the more and more like the older I get you know I've got a beautiful house and and this crazy garage and all this shit but the older I get the more I'm like fuck dude I just want to move like I kind of want to move like an hour away or an hour and half away and and live in a regular house like a farmhouse yeah and I have big garage though yeah right that's that's there's no compromising on that I can't compromise that yeah you tried to take my cars away I will go to war yeah and gonna happen yeah but no I got a theory about that and I think the internet in a sense has pushed everybody to a point to wear in a sense now especially being a young man I think you can't feel good about yourself anymore see when we got to grow up as kids in the 80s in the 90s and whatnot you were part of a culture whatever it was doesn't matter who you are where you're from or what call you are nothing but you were part of a culture and you could at least be proud of yourself in your culture and now it's so hard to do that because you're always under attack and I think that is a is a root of one thing that we're all trying to find a culture again find those things that's why I said even just mowing the grass or painting your deck or working on your own car I found this I started a group called the Noosnob portion 944 squad just helping out young guys and gals like buy a cheap portion 944 and fix it up and then suddenly I found this created this whole community and I think there's something bigger there because they get to fix something out and make it their own that's outside of all this so I think everybody's just looking for that culture to be proud of one of the things I love about cars to is because car culture is one culture but then there's a million subcultures inside of it and they're usually I mean almost always very very positive totally and the other thing about cars is it brings people together for sure different backgrounds and socioeconomic classes because if you think about it since the industrialized revolution cars represent everything from just transportation to sport to art to social economic class or whatever history so it's a it's a great way to bring everybody together and it's it's a the biggest like symbol of absolute freedom I think we have period and in a sense the Germans right Audubon they still have unlimited sections the German Audubon is the equivalent of America's second amendment basically yeah you will not take this freedom away from you're driven on it I have my my mercy Lago my gated mercy Lago I bought it in Germany what year is your what year is your gated oh three it will color orange around your boy Alice I call it a lot orange yeah I don't I don't get that fancy it's boy Alice probably yeah orange mercy I have a I have a I have the first customer deliver new 4 GT 17 painted that same color nice yeah it's a beautiful color especially that's gold with orange and top of it but I tell you that thing 150 200 miles an hour cross Germany that is the dream oh yeah 200 miles an hour on your way to get beer yeah yeah is it do you own any other landboes yeah I got to on 04 launch edition Gallardo that's also manuals Chris Tucker's car originally yeah yeah yeah that's it it's cool yeah I'm out of manual those are hard to beat bro I just bought a 15 r8 with a V10 gated nice yeah fucking love it yeah now I'm all about it I love love these kind of cars got a couple of the early vipers the blue white stripes GT S and I yeah yeah yeah this is right here yeah back there those are two vipers and then my Omega car course that's the one you built right yeah yeah yeah that's that's a that's a whole topic of discussion right yeah we'll get into that yeah we'll get into that but no you know other things I always love vintage racers got my 60s form the B I got a few motorcycles got a couple of vintage decadies and MV August and a triumph of love got a 31 Buick Faiton you know pre-worked car you know you if you ever come by like any y'all what would drive around in the Buick with the top the way it is smoke and cigars it's awesome that's that's the way it's a real man dude sounds awesome I'll I'll bring a couple cars up we're getting ready to I'm I'm buying a tank a two-car hauler just so I can kind of like go around and unload cars and drive them to a place yeah yeah exactly I'm huge into it dude like I actually just bought my first Lamarie talked about this you don't know this I don't know this I bought my first okay so I used to be a huge Lamarie Gini guy I owned a fuck ton of Lamarie Gini's from 2011 till 2019 okay and then we've sponsored the race team and all this shit and we had this falling out yeah and we had a big falling out and so I like protested I sold all my fucking can we just talk about this on the show what show is he was Casey all right Nathan yeah so I just bought my first Lamarie Gini and says 2019 I bought a I bought a an SVJ rooster black it's pretty fucking sweet yeah for sure it actually comes today does you get it from the guys that that made that video did you see that video down where would you get it from Florida Arkansas Arkansas okay yeah it came from elite Shelby down there in elite he runs the 4GT store got you I bought a number of cars man he's got the best fucking course but uh well yeah dude I you know I think I'm gonna pick up an SV2 an event or SV just because there's a two last NAV 12 that's why I got what I got did the last two stick shift yeah yeah fuck dude that mercy I mean I was got anything 47,000 yeah yeah it's fucking still worth a ton of money yeah when I when I first got on the on a bottom driving to see that beautiful orange I'm just like those high speed sweepers the German countryside yeah buddy of mine I'm like it's because all perfect yeah it was like all of my DNA or whatever it is at me came together this perfect moment I'm like they can pry it out of my cold dead hands yeah dude yeah there's gonna bite I'll fight you for it I get it dude there's cars like that man I'm like that with my chavelle I've got a 70 chavelle yeah that uh you know we it was an original LS6 that I found off this dude in Alabama it was fucking sweet people are gonna get pissed when I say this but anyway we tore the fucker apart yeah I kept all the shit so I could put it back together if I want but we put a art Morrison chassis on it uh I run a 454 LSX to all four down wipple super 4.5 wipple on it yeah and dude it is fucking awesome and I drive the car three days a week yeah this is your creation I get it my my blue viper is the same way I bought that thing with like 19,000 miles with the light way back when loved it because it did everything you could want yeah and it was reliable yeah I get a hundred thousand miles on that thing yeah that's awesome the story is a bit yeah and then more recently since I got other cars and things to do I'm like you know what I don't need this viper like I did before like when it was kind of like my main car I should just go nuts with it like go crazy with it everything just make it so it's like trackable streetable just go wild so I have a spin it's been a lot of fun doing that yeah the fibers are cool man you know just raw you know fuck yeah I'm sure we see those that often no more not the older one though just not man I don't know yeah people got way into the newest ones those really came up in value and for some reason they're going crazy yeah those new the new ACRs like the newest one fuck I get it but I don't get it the other thing too you got to take certain things with the grain of salt and I kind of avoid cars they get too hot because when when a certain car gets too hot it's not organic yeah you know I mean it's the high-buying yeah that's another thing as I've gotten old how long have you been how long you've been buying cars yes okay me too me too yeah so so I it's been I mean legitimately probably about 15 years for me where I could afford cars like nice cars yeah I mean shoot when I was a kid is doing slot cars or something yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah just keep going baby for sure I mean how we use micro machine slot car we have a slot car track in a garage yes and uh like the old not a fucking you know out of the I'm talking the the one that takes a 24 scale yes yeah they're fucking awesome uh built I built my own slot car dragster out of uh out of cutting up a wire yeah yeah yeah it was awesome and dude I've ever since I've been a kid it's always been cars man but um out of all those cars out of everything that that I've had uh it's it's still almost impossible for me to say that's the favorite car I have my chavelle I get it my chavelle is absolutely like the car like if shit went bad yeah and I had to sell all my shit I'm keeping this one thing I'm keeping that I'm sure yeah I don't care what I gotta do I'll drive it every single day yeah it's crazy it's down my three for me it's like you know I'm gonna have to always have one of these it's my blue viper yeah uh GTS as silly as it sounds a portion 944 all things being equal fight me over this statement I think it's the best car I've ever made I know that sounds crazy but in a way it is I never drove one and my mercy log up there just this perfect little car it's completely over my neighbor my old neighbor had one of those a bowl one they were sick they look good they do it all they don't rush you can drive it for seasons yeah it feels good to shift it you know is it rear-wheel drive yeah perfect weight distribution it's great car how much how much power do those make I don't remember I mean the naturally asked for a one's probably like 160 and the turbo ones are 240 something so enough to be like the power to you know yeah just driving every time I'm talking about this right here right yeah yeah I just bought a fixer up or throw when I was a kid dude you saw these everywhere yeah yeah that black that black one right there is what my neighbor used to have right here yeah right I actually asked for a one right in the middle yeah yeah yeah it's a great car I mean it's not worth that much you're not gonna you're not gonna go to some club and everybody's gonna think you're magical for it doesn't matter it's just the perfect car man it's tied into like 80s culture where kids it's just you can drive it it's like a bench car you can daily drive and then not worth so much that like normal people can't get into it find a new love and I like here's this other meme going around people like is the cure to mail loneliness starting your own delicious or something you know what I mean it's like that's cars right no it is but I was like you know what it is get a fixer up or 944 yeah I did I bought another fixer up or I don't need to I can afford better cars but the something about it yeah I get it dude yeah I like I love I like the 05064 GT's too okay yeah those are great yeah yeah yeah that two of those I fucking love them yeah I like the 930 to row to you you know what I like them a lot I think I like the way they look you got I think the design of that 930 body style she's got hips yeah it's the best she's got hips but they they became too I canized but like too worshiped by the air cooled Porsche crowd yeah so I was kind of a hipster in a way it's like you guys you're drinking you're drinking cool you're drinking oatmeal stouts and shit it's on talking daily driving vipers in the winter yeah oh yeah these are sick yeah they are they're sweet and when you see them in person I mean bro they're super slow I actually are yeah no the 944 turbo will decimated 930 turbo same year around a road course really yeah no it's true I didn't know that that's true no and and all the the the the air cooled snobs don't want you to know that because they worship this car now now dude there is something to be said for driving a slow car fast that's accurate if you really want to drop learn how to drive you get a slow car you know how drive fast well there's something to be said for it too because okay we do live in America okay we have speed limits so if you if you know our Lamborghini's right yeah the trouble is if we really get to enjoy that exhaust note for more than like one gear we're going to jail yeah right well bro you know I'm saying that's how my 4GTs are you're my second gear the the top end of the second gear in the 05064 GT is a hundred oh yeah so you're only using first a second gear around how 100% yeah so no some value about cars like that and then you know I like to tease the air cool crowd but the nice thing about cars like that is you you actually can enjoy using the motor in the ears and not yeah you like you're putting everybody's lives at risk it's the same with motorcycles bro everybody wants a thousand CC motorcycles it's like bro get yourself a little fuck it get a 600 or get it even smaller because it'll teach you how to ride right you'll enjoy it I've been wanting to import one of those 250 CC four-stroke bikes from the late 80s from Japan you know like the 250 Yamaha Kawasaki's yeah why not bro did you see that gromm going on the road the other day yeah dude what you fucked it that guy having it he had something in there though we saw this dude riding a gromm and he rolling yeah dude yeah he took so so let's get in to this all right because I'm sure people are mega car people are probably thinking like well you just bring this dude on to fucking talk cars maybe maybe I brought it on because of that fucking door that said stop talking about cars guess what really F is all cars now on wait no one it's all cars it's all cars yeah every episode's all cars fuck all of you guys that's how I operate bro like you tell me not to do it I'm fucking doing it yeah so this is the start of it all cars yeah so the omega car here you want to talk about that thing huh yeah let's give everybody your background and like oh god kind of like just let's give him some context in these because you're a pretty interesting dude oh god grew up in northwest Ohio family businesses small golf course midda was car guy you know grew up riding a Ford Model A to 67 Corvette and British cars you know loves slot cars loved all that well trains on those kid animals that sort of thing and you know young men you want you want a cool car grew up in the 80s you want to test or she want to coontosh or something can afford it yeah who can work on this stuff especially before the internet right I want to DeLorean my dad's like no way who can work on that so you got to learn right and we always had to fix our own stuff you know family business you know my granddad was a World War 2 vet battle of Okinawa he was a solid America well fix our own things you take responsibility for yourself to figure out a way and I want to cool cars want to fast cars so you take pride in what you have and where you're at and you learn to fix it up but then you got to think about hey if I buy this thing can I get my money out of it or can I make money and trade up can I keep going if I don't magically have a business or career that's going to allow me to to buy anything I want and so that was just kind of mindset that drove that and always wanted race like going fast that was kind of my sport or fencing like martial arts and that sort of thing and kind of grew a drive there and you know just journey through life it's all about the cars and building cool things I built what was known as the world's only turbine powered Batmobile about 15 years ago I built an exact replica of the Tim Burton Michael Keaton film Batmobile you still have it no sold it long time ago but I powered it by what it was in fiction I sourced a Vietnam era drone anti-submarine turbo shaft engine was made by Boeing most of my guests were pushed into the ocean after the war but found this one worked perfect for adapting to a modified automatic transmission driving the wheels so that was really cool so done things like this what did that come off of the engine yeah a drone anti-submarine helicopter from Vietnam dude no joke it's called the dash drone anti-submarine helicopter it was launched from boats it could travel like 70 miles away carry two torpedoes it was counter rotating props like the early drones it kids so this is a helicopter engine in the car yeah yeah this thing looks fucking crazy it it idled at 20,000 rpms had a maximum usable gas generator yeah there it is right there there's the engine of what 40,000 rpms in the gas generator had two tackometers one for the gas generator one for the output shaft driving the transmission I've just shift based upon the the RPM range of the you know the the driving side and then you just monitor your gas generator so in a sense it's kind of weird because you got a gearbox and I know we're talking about the Batmobile now but instead of the automatic Omega car but it's good tangent it's kind of weird because driving it it was in a weird sort of way kind of like a sailboat because you're being powered by thrust by power internally it was almost kind of like this like the windy hand of God is thrusting your car forward so it's really really cool yeah there it is there it is dude we covered this we covered this in the thumbs up are you dead yeah we covered that yeah yeah yeah I've roasted marshmallows on that exhaust with my fencing rapier you know I took this thing to the clubs back in Columbus that let me park on the street and like real guns on it no those are Simfire Browning 30 cows which is what in the movie but it's powered by oxygen and propane out computer controlled circuit with a couple soinoids so you get the cadence of the fire you wouldn't have the projectile breaking the sound barrier but you'd also get the nice muzzle flash that's crazy dude this is what I do with small resources man someday if I actually have Bruce Wayne resources it's gonna get fun yeah that looks pretty good that's bad actually that's good how long it take you to do that I think it didn't like five months so you were doing it all day long it's rocking a roll I'm pretty efficient you know I you know how do you make the body honestly the body was already made believe it or not in a source it because the movie the stunt cars were built by a studio in England right and as the story goes six flags amusement park got a license to do live action shows after the movie they needed they needed stunt cars so those prop cars were floating around and then I guess somebody made molds and you can you can find one every now and then yeah so I cut up a C4 Corvette I use a suspension and bulkheads to do that use the same you know the transmission out of it because it I actually adapted that General Motors 4 speed to it in fact those are the Corvette seats I just vinyl painted in black to make it work and had to you know basically make my own space frame with the bulkheads and stuff and then I just it's still titled as a Corvette and I just ensure it is a modified vehicle that there is my Corvette for those while you know how much horsepower I think oh I think it was better part of 400 something like that yeah and it was it was a light engine so the whole car didn't didn't really weigh that much I didn't weigh it did it sound like a turbine okay yeah I'd add a 20 grand that's crazy it's crazy yeah yeah there's the engine no that was cool but the Omega car so a built things like this and some other cool things did a bull scale flying tarot saw replica and things like that just for fun but this came about because back in 2008 I didn't really care that much about politics back then okay I was still a younger man like in my in my 20s I was way more interested in you know what's the next fast car I can get and was a pretty woman I go out with you know that's that's what I cared about fast cars and pretty women and not necessarily in the order not yet yeah yeah they make that that's a good joke about Kentucky it's all about beautiful horses and fast women yeah and so oh wait was coming around right no bomber was the hot tick and he's talking I'm listening to him and I didn't think much about policy I'm just watching you know with friends like what's going on I remember him in the Democratic National Convention going on this big thing and how he's going to retool Detroit so the energy fuel efficient cars tomorrow both here for the sake of the nation and world and that just struck me as bullshit I'm like you're not Kennedy this is not we're going to the moon within 10 years kind of a statement it's not going to happen and that stuck with me and you know we had the financial crisis in08 and then a few years later I'm looking at what the automotive industry is going on with the bailouts and stuff and and we're doubling down on you know muscle cars and big trucks and come on man I love muscle cars and big trucks and if you can afford the fuel do it do you want it's America right don't don't force me to do something but I'm thinking this is also be a something's off here you know we're not actually doing anything I'm looking around right I still vividly remember thinking about this right around my motorcycle and I was researched in various materials and kind of you know different manufacturing techniques and stuff because I always like to think about like what cool thing can I build next you know and one day it hit me I'm like there's there's a myriad of ways to make a cost effective strong more recyclable energy efficient structures that we can build cars with I'm like I'm going to do it and I just had to do it it was like it was like a flash and I said you know electric starting to be a thing but nobody knows what the heck a kilowatt hour is so I'm gonna I'm gonna make it be diesel because everybody understands a milder gown and my goals are I wanted zero to 60 and under five seconds I want to crack on a hundred miles the gallon and I figured those two things people will understand and if I build a car that is recyclable and representative what we can actually do because you could put any drivetrain in good design and engineering philosophy that's what the car represents good design and engineering philosophies with mass production right but I did diesel because people understood that you can make it whatever you need to be and so I built it over the course of the year kind of got burned out I showed it at the Pittsburgh Cars and Coffee Hanger party and did like a talk and I think I talked too long and boredom or whatever but you know and I did it and then I realized I don't have a voice you know if I finish just saying the numbers and stuff nobody's gonna know it it's not gonna matter and so I just left it my garage for better parts 10 years I know it sounds crazy and some people like you're telling me you built this thing but I'm like yeah that's exactly what I did and I'm probably looks a lot better in the Tesla too I agree thank you you know it's form following function you know I had a goal and I wanted to be good looking but you know and in that time when it was sitting it wasn't that I was doing nothing I was doing the genius garage educational programs picking up the slack from the American educational system that I now tell people what that is so I built a 501 c3 back in 2013 my wife has been incredible so I can't say I build it alone that's not it there's a lot of amazing people that help make that happen so it was this I looked at young engineers at universities in college you know and other people in design you know building and all that and I go school is an academic vacuum you have no real world experience there is nothing that is driving these students to create better because there's like no accountability it's it's a vacuum it's this little padded room kind of area and then they get out and out in the real world they have mentors they got a direction they know how to do anything and these are the questions and problems that industry was facing and I I just thought one day I was involved with race cars and building vintage race cars it's a team thing it's really cool come together for a common goal you know racing I have to tell you same thing with airplanes build airplanes and I just thought if I'm going to be involved with you know racing and airplanes and things anyway why I do it in a way that matters so put the structure together and did it as such because it was simple I wanted to put together a program to where then I could use my you know my contact book my roll of decks of everything from CEOs to fighter pilots to anybody there's a great matter to bring them in as mentors real world mentors for these young people give these young people common goal we're going to build this race car and we're going to go race it in the real world not some academic challenge is the real world and what we're going to do is we're going to document this on the way you're going to do a the research writing paper your life to and I'm going to do it and package it in such a way that the world cannot ignore you that you that's the way I looked at it just boldly do what needs to be done and it worked that the the formula worked from the the first year and getting them jobs and it always ends up putting the resume on the top of the pile you know and that's what they always talk about hiring things and it's worked since that time and I just believed in and fought in it the whole way you know I don't get paid to do it down to for 11 years got a couple of cool lifetime achievement awards from the last couple of presidents it does it that's nice but doesn't keep the lights on and it just it just means a lot to me because it matters because it works and that's that's why I fought for it man but that's that's what I've been doing while the omega car has been sitting and you know and it's funny enough because that's what actually drove me to becoming something of a social media figure on YouTube because about five years in I was I was pissed off because we couldn't get any exposure for what we're doing I'm like I got college students that are putting together an indie car we're actually running this in big races we're willing to airplanes they're getting unbelievable jobs that are ever from Tesla and Palo Alto two Lockheed Martin marathon you know Chrysler Ford whatever and no one's writing about this why do you think that is well let me come back to that question let me tell you what I did okay I started trying to play the game like is this sponsored content is that how it works that's not what it is I knew a guy who owned a magazine a premier magazine in vintage racing I don't like dude why don't you guys write something about he's a little sub to our editor wouldn't write anything so I went on a mission and as silly as it sounds I made a little video on my Facebook and it was not big it was just my Facebook at the time right and I said I'm giving way three of my most prize personal possessions anybody can help get publicity and I had a big fossilized megalodontooth in the big shark tooth I had an early copy of Darwin's origin species and early copy of Einstein's relativity books and one of my past students from the first year he's like connects me with Ed at Benbecky and I didn't know what the heck that was back then but it was a place you could tell stories about cars which is really kind of cool another person connected me with traditional publicist PR type guy and fortunately I had enough car stories enough personality that that worked I kept getting invited back with Benbecky and that kind of build a present there in social media and then what was doing with genus garage could also tell those stories so got exposure to people sought and believed in it you know the public you actually get out there and do it and then with traditional meeting the publicist I learned the kind of silly way the traditional media actually works I say it's silly because they're just hurting themselves they don't even understand the nature of social media but then I figured out how to pair those two things together so the I just saw something that was wrong with society and the educational system that young people weren't getting the mentorship and the opportunity to really fly they just weren't that's what I wanted to create with genus garage because that's what I didn't have you know and no telling where any of us could be if we had the right people on our lives at the right time and I knew I could make that difference for them at that time with what I know and connected to so I did that and then media was jacked right and we'll get into why because I want to hear your thoughts too we'll talk about it so then built that and kept going and then more recently of course the Omega car but your question relating to why would nobody write on it okay let me speak about the microcosm that is the automotive enthusiast world and then we'll we'll extrapolate that because it's all this stuff works in the same way right if you just consider automotive YouTube okay that's cool but all media kind of works the same way so it's kind of like a test so let's say we got the racing world we got the concours world we got the car collector world we got the aftermarket world that's all great but in a sense those industries only exist from money from another industry their industries of hobby and fun not need in society does that make sense so and because of that you get figures of power a money you know of well-standing and I kind of also notice that with that it's almost like I called them little kings you know because if you have somebody let's say they have a big race team or let's say they own a series or maybe they own some big car collection that series they're kind of a little king and then they sort of have their their royal court and you have all that and if you're not within that royal court and those are the ones established that's what the media is going to write about you're just you're just this fringe tear thing you're out and you're hoping that somebody throws you a scrap in a manner of speaking and I think that's sort of how that works so I think what pushed me on the scene in a way where they couldn't ignore me anymore was the nature of social media and Ben Wiki where you just tell stories which is kind of cool because it's no different than like the 19th hole to golf course you know I grew up with like World War Two vets with a picture of beer talent stories where you learn to tell stories and in this way it was the opportunity to do it so that's one of the really cool things about social media where you can people can make bigger things happen now tell people by Ben Wiki that don't understand what it is just car stories yeah you know it was an app to track men numbers and such that had bullying created brilliant move and it's a place I kind of consider it you know the tv show cheers you know is everybody got spin off kind of thing but it's a place where you can go on and just tell an interesting or crazy car story and that was I think a cultural movement in a way and a really good thing because that was a way to bring the whole call culture worldwide together and share stuff so it's really cool admittedly I have gotten miffed because in my personal opinion like having been somebody who's done this so much to help young people and be something of a role model I've gotten frustrated by so many stories about illegal stuff and glorifying because I started to see the negative effects about that and I've been openly critical about it but the platform and Ben Wiki's an awesome thing has created a lot of good for the car world but I would say going back to why the media exist a way it is it's the little kinks so if we look at the rest of the world right who owns what media group whether CNN or Fox or whatever what are their agendas that's what they're going to see of course you know and you know I've met her I don't know a better part of a hundred young people in college and they're all different backgrounds man all different politics all different races some that are I'll use the old phrase of fresh off the boat but no really like they they can't they're coming over they're just learning the American culture maybe their first generation just cross the board and the thing of it is that's kind of shocked me in knowing this is and people I think are waking up that dude the media is not the media anymore it's propaganda like everything's bought paid for these these so-called products everything it's orchestrated dude a hundred percent but remember you have to be a certain age you remember yes so like dude a lot of these guys that are these these kids that are 20 years old they don't fucking remember that yes because it's always been propaganda their whole life they don't remember when the news was actually the news and by the way we don't even know if the news was actually the news yes because there was no internet to counter counter balance what the truth may or may not have been correct and that's in a sense where guys like us are now questioning the past in our own culture like what was real and what what's the true history yeah that's true just cross the board there um but no that that's a scary thing and I see it so much and and being a youtuber even just in small ways in the automotive world I know what kind of BS people are doing behind the scenes to meet their objective where it's not what they say it is I know what game you guys are playing to try to be big you're not being real and that's the one thing when I did my channel I'm like you know the one thing I don't know what the heck I'm gonna do with my own personal channel I like cars I like build stuff but I know I can be honest and I would rather personally have a smaller channel and be honest and do things in the real world and be able to address things that are really happening and do something of value then be huge and just be it bro it's a dancing clown it's depth versus width right like I could get a we I could have a much more dude I could have way more fucking subs on YouTube if I just you know flexed my shit all the time yeah and didn't talk about these issues that are unpopular but the people who listen you guys listening are they become very strong supporters true and you know and fans of the show yeah and you give people the opportunity to see something to where maybe they'll start using more independent thought on the round because you know I'm not I don't want to speak for you but I don't think like I'm not here to program people to make you think a certain way I'm gonna share my opinion if you agree great but contest me I'm not a side up dude you can question anything let's go yeah no I agree I mean I am trying to get people to think a certain way but it's just think critically yeah exactly that's it exactly and it's a journey you know we'll I mean I'm sure you I mean we've all changed our opinions on things as we grow we get more information more experiences you know absolutely dude that's the whole point yeah so the Omega car I want to blow some big world narrators with that thing when I finally did something with it yeah okay so I said way back when I started building I was like 2013 I wanted to zero to 60 under five seconds over a hundred miles to gallon I wanted to represent something that'd be more sustainable recycle would be cheaper people could buy because like I tell you this I've never bought a new car in my life not one you know maybe someday I will but one who can afford to lose money depreciation for no reason my would you pull off the parking lot this doesn't make sense yeah this doesn't make sense not gonna do it but anyway I want to do something better because they're talking about not happening well in that 10 years I've been doing genius garage and I want to sit around a lot has changed okay the left push for EV mandates is coming to play big time Tesla's coming to prominence we've had more radicalized politics we've had people not being able to understand reality more just going with propaganda such and and last year big year election year I mean I would say the direction of the world is largely at stake and I'm like okay EV mandates are going on it's gonna be Kamala or Trump like first of all these EV mandates are the worst possible thing for the automotive industry they will destroy all innovation and I know that they're bad for the environment oh it's a total whole lot it's a such a joke it's about control bro they want to be able to control the fucking power of your home and fucking control where you go and absolutely yeah 100% and the only thing I have to say is fight back on the BS and the narrative and and the lies if you see it but that also doesn't mean that we go so far the other direction we just destroy the environment like I actually like the environment and conservation you know hunting and fishing and stuff so let's let's be cool reasonable human beings but let's not go along with the lies anymore so I think it's fair to say wouldn't you well yeah I mean nobody wants to destroy the environment but we have to acknowledge the reality of the environment which is this the environment takes a lot of carbon dioxide to produce the amount of oxygen that we need and the carbon dioxide balance compared to what it is now to 50 years ago or a hundred years ago or anything it's the the environment is a self-adjusting ecosystem that's accurate so when we talk about oh well there's more people and more of this and more of that yeah there is but also there's more people consuming the the byproducts of that so like the whole environmental argument is actually a pretty low IQ argument correct because you're not you're you're the only people that truly believe in it there's two kinds it's like vegans bro vegans believe in veganism for one of two reasons they some believe it's healthy it is not healthy others believe it's morally an issue which I can relate to that they enjoy feeling good okay that's okay if you're a moral vegan I can respect that but you are not healthier because you are vegan if you are a moral environmentalist meaning you just don't want to see shit you don't want to see oil on birds and and six pack do that plastic all right finish so if you if you want to see you know you don't want to see cups in the street and shit everywhere that's fine I agree I'm with you dude just so you run your business every clean stuff dude I'm with you I don't want to see that shit either I care a lot about that I care a lot about all those things but when we start talking about electric cars being better for the environment when you're stripping out all these irreplaceable minerals to create the batteries yeah lithium lithium and cobalt mines in the Congo right that are being mined by fucking human slaves yeah okay like the the whole lie that it is better for the environment is I mean bro it's a massive lie and I can't it's hard for me to respect anybody that even believes it it comes from that because they're not looking past the surface level bullshit they're being sold so but I mean if you want to you well so you believe in pollution no I don't at all but just I don't believe in bullshit this is the same week arguments that you've done everything oh you're not for that well you must be a Nazi yeah yeah I don't shit dude like I serious 9 I'm ready yeah yeah man no but so last year on that right with the world narrative I'm like I got to speak up I got to take a stance and the other thing was like I didn't actually test this thing at the numbers it works but it's only what I thought it would do in my head way back when and I called it on video I said this on video 11 years ago actually I put that one of the beginnings so I go okay measure distance driving normally through the country so I didn't even have the fairings on I didn't have it full tune I'm just like we're gonna drive this I'm gonna fill the metal tank exactly to this level exactly and I've got a graduated thing I can measure fractions of an ounce I'm gonna drive it normally stop sign start up drive it stop signs turns everything come back measure it 104.72 miles a gallon first try it will get better that's with no tuning or anything else just okay done next day I need zero to 60 times with comps because the other thing zero to a lot of zero 60 times with you know manufacturing stuff is kind of a lie it's a roll out what not perfect conditions sticky tires and all that okay great so I'm gonna run my 93 Dodge Viper RT 10 get a little fashion American big car you know I don't know what's the thing at 15 miles a gallon great it's fine it's good car not bill of fine I'm just saying okay we'll do that got a 2019 Corvette Grand Sport let's use it it's kind of a modern car I got my neighbors Tesla Model 3 rear wheel drive to be fair you know they're all rear wheel drive and I got a cell Ramers and GPS so next day I did it ran the Viper a few times like 4.8 seconds tires a little older ran this 4.1 seconds excuse me 4.61 seconds the Grand Sport was also 4.61 seconds and the Tesla Model 3 the best it could do was 4.6 flat 1 100th of a second and it progressively got slower as the charge went down because I did with full charge to be fair so I'm like okay so it's as fast as Tesla is it's getting 104 miles a gallon it's like a cheaper cycle car something be like 20,000 dollars on the market so then I thought about it and I'm like hey what's a what's carbon footprint of burning one gallon of diesel EPA's got numbers cool this isn't going to be too hard to math like what's what how many kilowatt hours of electricity does it take to make a Tesla go a certain distance okay what's the carbon footprint of generating kilowatt hour of electricity national average in the U.S. now I'm not even taking a consideration losses and all that but just you know let's just let's just look at this compare it here my car on straight diesel has a lower carbon footprint per mile than a Tesla does when charged at home and it's cheaper to drive per mile and we have the infrastructure period okay and it's affordable so right then and there the entire left this narrative on EVs being better for the environment I crushed it now okay we can argue maybe there's going to be better battery technology in the future yeah well that's not now what do we got now I can't afford that car why can anybody else also I don't like all this government control of autonomous cars where you're pushing it to be where if all the cars can be self-driving and you don't even own your own property anymore because that is where everything's being pushed guess what you and a car is nothing more than a physical manifestation of the algorithm driving wherever it wants you to go and I'm not okay with that kind of world because who controls that not the people because we're basically you know if you talk about the nature of propaganda young people not being able to know what the world is anymore that's a big problem yeah you ever seen the old sci-fi THX 1138 was one of George Lucas's early films so really good one basically everybody lives underground there's this sort of like Jesus-like figure that's a picture that's always talking to everybody everybody's on meds if you go off your meds they come and get you everybody's building some sort of like in working in like a nuclear factory and everything is programmed and manufactured and propagandized and the one dude like stops taking its Robert Duval actually it's a really good film or an early days he stops taking his meds starts having a like a relationship that's unauthorized with this woman and there's this big escape scene in the end it's actually low latissimony race cars from the 60 kind of dude it up and dudes on motorcycles and they're escaping from a tunnel in the end of the movies climbing out of this tunnel of the surface wasn't there a nut one they're remake of that with like Leonardo Capri or some shit I don't know but the original were the same outfits like a jumpsuit maybe but I gotta be honest the original THX 1138 is powerful and it's still holds up yeah not a lot of dialogue so it's it's real viby but it holds up man and so the omega car it just throws all that for a loop and you know okay that's the one car built a build it is a sports car I realized that people need things like trucks and four door cars but here's the other reality of the world if I built that and it was ugly or it was some boxy or just some dumb thing nobody care it needs to be a sexy sports car for people to get it a little bit because yeah I can use those same design engineering philosophies and various materials well that's how Tesla got attention to people don't remember that Tesla actually made a cool first car well and they didn't even really make the car that was the lotus Elise that was rebody electrified and it wasn't Elon's company to start with he technically didn't found Tesla all he founded Tesla you know what I mean he bought into it was smart and new where to take it but yeah so there's a direction to go so last year I tested it got the numbers and spoke out and I spoke out on what I thought about politics and who to vote for and why so and you know here we are we're talking about a guy so yeah you ended up being like you been on Tucker and yeah yeah it was super cool yeah a friend of mine you know had I don't know shared me his contact one day it's like you should have this I'm like what the hell am I gonna just call it Tucker you know like I'm not gonna you know and one day I'm thinking I'm just gonna text him you know and it was one of those things where it's it's efficient it's like here's who I am this is where I come from I respect you in your privacy this is where I got the number here's a couple things I've done here's what I think they matter you know a little bit more and it's like I have no ask of you other than there's too much a stake out there here's been working for and if you ever in the future you see a resonant way for you know me to affect positive change you just share this I'm all for it thanks and appreciate what you're doing here's some pictures just put my cards on table and then three hours later forgot about it and uh dude text me back then it's funny how well that works well I'm just being real I know respectful I know here's what like I don't want to try to get anything here's what I have to respect you if there's a place for me I get my stuff yeah it's like it's hat in hand it's old school manners it's that's the way it is yeah and and I you I he owes me nothing like nothing right polite and so next day text back I'm like what the oh cool you know and he was totally personable and he's like wow it was a really charming pictures because it's got a couple pictures just you know like a wood like hey I'm a real guy you know yeah um and uh he's got some nerds no feet pay down no no no you sprays how far that goes this picture like I don't know me and family out to dinner stay on a boat like this picture here the car you got shown up you know just that just a little something to validate it's like yeah yeah check up on me I know you know not hearing prints look into me or whatever anyway so yeah so next day does that sends me a screenshot of like watching one of my videos there and whatnot he's like totally cool yeah I'd love to let's do a show on a fish and diesel or something sometime like cool and it was crazy because later I realized dude was just straight texting me like a normal guy's like three hours before he did Madison Square Garden with uh Trump and Elon and everybody back there so it's cool you know it's cool everybody's a real person at the end of the day yeah you know you just there's there's ways to be a real person everybody you know what I mean dude a hundred percent man yeah so no it's uh it was a thing and it's it's important and I also think just as another note and jump in anytime don't mean to just no take away yeah I really do care about young people going somewhere yeah you know and I need more mentorship I was so thankful to have the family that I did you know my dad worked hard okay hard people don't think it because it's a golf course I was got made fun of his kids it's rich kid it's you do work my dude this is a farm that goes 24 seven in front of the public with thousands of people coming there's a liquor license we have to maintain all this machinery the grout everything this is insane they don't get it you're just a rich right but anyway um so young people you got to find a way you got to find somewhere to go my grand day was amazing my my great uncle you know he flew F4 phantoms and Vietnam was an amazing guy amazing stories I had strong men in that regard so I was fortunate to have that but not everybody has that not everybody has that anything else and the internet times crazy so I just I think about that sort of thing I do too you know and um you know I have my own passions and love love race cars build love cars things like that but it's perspective you know I've got some really nice things I was like some nicer ones or some more adventures but at the same time too that isn't life right and with the omega car I just saw the change the need to happen the world I knew I could do something it's better it's just an example and then talk about it and we got to do that and unfortunately I had I guess just enough traction or just enough open doors to be able to do that and that then that gets in actual real world things to the popular you know consensus to talk about it because not only is it like breaks the narrative of the left ED thing was it's only about control period only about control for nobody not the world not any nation's best-sentress global control um which I am so that makes you want like so what do you have in mind that you need that kind of control you see what I'm saying the whole government I know that but I warned me about people don't ask those questions bro they don't ask the question they they just simply say oh you're crazy that's not real mother fucker that is real it's real tell I had an ex-girlfriend ex-girlfriend girlfriend wants ex-girlfriend I remember saying the United States can never fall and she was adamant I'm like are you serious like if we don't stand up protect and do things like what we have left she was absolutely 100% in the belief and complicitcy that nothing will ever change and we're okay doesn't matter and I'm like it's been changing for a hundred years the goal is incremental change so subtle that nobody notices correct that that is that is that is the the communist method and if this has been happening for over a hundred years yeah that's what people understand and you see it in every aspect of just our life and talk about culture now like we were driving the other day going down to AB but just innovation architecture like if you just compare the two and just a short span look how much has changed oh yeah I mean it's it's almost disgusting and oh listen dude that's brutalism is a tactic of of context for sure okay to be you down beat down your culture it's that's correct beat down the inspiration people don't understand what that means like when you guys go like when you guys go to Europe if you've ever been to Europe oh yeah you will walk up and down the street and you will see buildings that are a thousand years old one after the other after the other after the other and they're all beautiful yes and it's and wait and there's modern stores there's a Louis Vuitton and a thousand year old building yeah there's a coffee shop in a 1500 year old building okay here obviously we're only 250 years old next year but there's still beautiful buildings that have been constructed here there's lots of them and the reason that most of the shit looks the way it does now you guys think oh it's efficiency it's this it's that no the building codes have actually been altered to the point where it's almost impossible to build something beautiful for the reason of demoralization of culture and it's called brutalism that is what that's about it's a real tactic true well the other place they did it is through universities yeah and see I was around industrial design which is centered in fine arts and actually both my parents went to fine art in 72 and so I kind of saw this and I'm like why is it all the classic things are beautiful why is it that you know to be a Dutch master or at the paris salon lady in 1800s you had to be an absolute unbelievable master of light and form and color yet now idiots can throw stuff at a canvas and make up some story and people like it and the more we're hot dog to the wall yeah no it literally literally is communism and an influence and a lot of these people in the 20th century there's even some crazy things because you know we get into the nature of CIA and such was probably the most evil entity in the world and influence to change and make that over but what I'm saying is art changing and modern art of the 20th century is a manifestation literally of communism yes destroyed everything good and beautiful and I'll just say this okay I'll give you that there could be some modern art out there that is avant-garde and top provoking and interesting and really is making statement it's ignored intentionally correct but here's this is why I asked you about why you couldn't get your shit written you're got a good point it's too good yeah it's too good but here's the thing if an artist isn't technically good if you can't be like a Dutch master before you do that I don't care about your who-who stuff if you don't have technicality because I don't know this is any good and you're right about that it's being purposely ignored I'll give you an example um this is the first one that comes to my head I'm sorry if it's not the best one in the world but I'll just say it so um you know growing up I was love racing it was the thing I was best at I know cars and no building I'm athletic I'm good I have little seat time but a fast I do my own thing was vintage racing drives some big cars and always wanted a professional race grew up loving indie cars so you always dream of doing that but there's no road there so after a while you eventually kind of give up on your dream because you weren't you weren't connected enough you weren't born wealthy there's no way there's nowhere to practice can't afford a car to get in it's just not gonna happen that's not your sport respectfully there's other sports that are a little more you know it's the most expensive it's the most expensive sport you can participate in correct so whether myself even even people don't understand like to be a racer for real you they have either have to go like the Lewis Hamilton's dad's route where he gives up fucking everything correct and he was brought on by McLean the early days and made yeah but even what most people think rich people are they can't afford a race no no no you need to be able to just vaporize large sums of money but unless it's a business related time yeah so here's the thing and I want to bring this up relating to it not the media not working so this is something that I learned and anybody can say whatever they want to fight me for this is the experience I had when I started becoming big on you know YouTube with my own channel been wiki and stuff I looked at numbers I'm like wow he's a crazy numbers and then I looked at the viewership numbers of the indie car series where I was wanted to be an indie 500 in person spectators TV internet the world over and the one year when I was hitting it hard just my videos alone reviewed more than the entirety of the indie series worldwide on all their platforms my videos alone and then it clicked one day I go wait a minute okay well I think that might mean I have a ticket to do something because if I had somebody's support and we did some driving and you know and I'm getting a drive well that team is going to have more exposure than anybody else yeah so this should work and I tried for a number of years it didn't work and I learned that the entirety of the racing industry is different than what it's reported to be you don't work your way up into it it's a car way into it that's correct it's a club and that's okay but from the one indie car NASCAR it's all it's a structure in a way that it's a club for purpose whether you're doing it for fun and you can buy your way in or whether it's a business entity's coming in a way together you know um Kaleta major top fuel team right they have Kaleta airlines and DHL coming in as partners and it works out for all of them to be their club thing to do to do business and that works and that's perfectly fine but young people need to know that that's the reality of it but there was something else I would and I'm not going to say what series are who because I don't want to do that but I would talk to series presidents or leaders or PR people and whatnot the PR people avoid me like the plague they want me to go away and I didn't make sense to me I'm like let's work together man they don't want to work with me because I threaten them too much yeah you tell your dude and other shit and I was saying the president of the series or some I'm like man let's work together like just let me be like kind of like a positive inside agent I just need to be part of your whole deal let's do this together they don't want to do it I'm like this makes no sense bro but it throws off the power structure and that's why I'm like if we and I would try to tell people like if we just do this we'll own the whole series dude trust me you know I'm talking about it that's the way it is with the we have a top 20 fucking global podcast and you know many times I've been invited to be on the media up fucking zero no they don't want you that's right because I burn their ass that's right yeah no it's true it's true I know it's true so then the thing is then the conundrum is then you get you know you're saying real things you get out of frustrated but then you got to find the people to put it together to actually change the world which then yeah you have the opportunity to do but you're exactly right you can be even if you're ready to work together it's like hey let's just do it together just be a team they don't want you even if it's such a small-minded thing everybody wants to protect their little job and the status quo and the way it is it's like look man I'm not trying to wreck you keep your job let's just do more let's do something better they don't want to do it and I just I don't like that kind of insecure weak personality type yeah it's gatekeeping it's bullshit no it's total bullshit it's like look I am not the best at anyone trying to protect the narrative bro it's just it happens in racing it happens in fucking it's it's everywhere yes it's in business it's it's just it's cow it's cowardly like I'm afraid I'm afraid of the truth I want to put this narrative out and anything that is going to be an argument to that narrative or contribute not allowed and dude that's very dangerous in society because what that creates is a situation where no one ever knows the truth correct you know what I'm saying you know and it also can't it continue eventually it will die yeah so and that that goes with everyone well we see it look at the media look at the ratings oh 100 percent it's a joke yeah nobody's watching these these uh you know mainstream channels anymore except like people that are there's in homes it just we get right exactly the scariest thing now I gotta be straight with you with how powerful AI is I know and you know what the fuck is real you know Obama said a while back ago one tactic is to just it's as has he put it and it's kind of negative I don't think he should have said this um but the tactic is kind of like the metaphor is flood the city streets with sewage so much that nobody knows what anywhere anything is anymore and AI will be able to do that nobody's gonna know what's what or what to do anymore that's why in a way it's intentional dude oh it is and AI has existed for much longer than what they say it correct it was unleashed to the public when it was intentionally as part of the world economics forums great reset agenda social programming yes to to confuse to further demoralize and destabilize everything correct okay so you know and and dude it's really bad because it's Pandora's box yeah because once it's open you can't put it back in and this is a problem and the only hope we have for AI to not become that level of a problem is if the FCC figures out how to badge or make them call out but the attorneys that are in office if they don't make some sort of regulation around it they're gonna fuck them their entire profession out yeah and I have to be honest right now uh some I saw that I and Trump just put something through so you can't fucking uh do anything to 10 years yeah yeah so then I'm like okay so are you in on this call no exactly okay so I'm gonna go off a little tribe right now I'm big Trump supporter I am too I voted for him that's the way we had to go okay great go all the way however no you can go to still criticize Trump unregulated AI for 10 years so sure the fucking end no it's the end and end and so here's the thing I don't like I'm just gonna say it too so tech bros right let's look at the tech bros that do it and I'm gonna I'm gonna pick on it JD Vance and Vivek Ramaswamy look at their background like okay JD Vance I like him well enough he's put on well he did a great job at the debates and everything like that yeah he's manufactured okay he's manufactured the storyline is two succinct and perfect all the way up there and you look at who supports him Vek Ramaswamy manufactured I mean he got his college scholarship money from the sorrows family look it up yeah no it's true and then he talked he was on the show he talked about was he really yeah so he then you buy the rights to a pharmaceutical drug I asked him about that when he was on the show right yeah failed its first test then you build a business to promote that as you know possible helping direction to go for Alzheimer's you build a business around of it hits a market cap of over a billion dollars he cashes out at a certain point with I don't know 130 some million dollars of course it doesn't work and and and go out of the window I'm sorry but I look at this at the level of people can work in in the billionaire class and such and I go this is manufactured and that's the way to make somebody the whole way up and I don't like it and the nature of so then oh he's gonna run for president even though he doesn't even get as many votes as Chris Chris be keen Christie oh and then he just backs out and instantaneously backs trumps with all his same talking points even though he hasn't lived that life before he just has all the talking points and then he hires all the people left over from Trump's 2016 campaign thinking he's gonna dovetail in his VP maybe seems like it and then oh but he's going to be he's not the VP pick but his buddy JD Vance is and oh he's gonna get appointed to doge awesome we need doge great but then right at the end something seems wrong and he's out of doge gonna run for Ohio governor when doge I argue is way more important that's like the most important thing we can do with a nation now so Elon's doing that all himself while he's gonna run for governor yet ramaswami is there talking about we're gonna make the Ohio River Valley like the next Silicon Valley why because it's got enough cooling for all the infrastructure and computer systems and stuff that's what you wanted to you want to exploit Ohio when there's nothing Ohio about you you didn't go school here you don't have any businesses here you've done no philanthropy here there's nothing Ohio about him and then he goes on a nut I'm on a rant yeah so I'm keeping no I'm keeping a rant I'm gonna keep going so then he's on another podcast to talking about and I appreciate this if you legally immigrate to the United States legally and you care about the United States because we're all different we're gonna make a way for some sort of cultural philosophical thing awesome yeah I agree we are fellow Americans agree there is a but and he danced all over and stomped all over it he was saying they were laughing about how will be an American's not about how many family members you have buried in the Kentucky cemetery and how far back it goes you know what bull fucking shit well I yeah that's in a way okay no dude I'm just a limit no you're right keep wrong here let me cut okay that doesn't make that doesn't make that doesn't make you don't you don't have to have that to be American but it does fucking mean something that's right you know my great great great great grandfather blew the bugle in the Calvary way back when it still has the bugle my grandfather's battlevoke and I were to Ohio State University 1950 GI Bill went the little Sydney Ohio's an optometrist my grandmother when she died they were married 74 years yeah okay like I still sometimes wear my granddad's high school class ring that he wore through the Pacific I still have his Bible that he was reading in a cave sitting on a cadaver the enemy polishing his bullets wonder if he's gonna get out of it like I still have that his younger brother nuclear B 52s during cold war circling the polar ice cap and then F4 phantoms in Vietnam barely coming out of that supersonic taking shots about getting his neck tweak to try to avoid stuff getting up this is what I got raised in you know my family built their business like we never went on vacations my dad worked his ass off and then 2008 financial crisis came on changed everything because Washington just agreed in stupidity and now the golf course it was part of Tiffany Ohio has been plowed under since then like everything being ruined for yeah my family has fought and lived in the United States America and Ohio and yeah they're buried in Kentucky and Arlington National Cemetery and Dayton National Cemetery and around here and I'm still here fighting building on profits racing businesses and all and we have a guy like this built manufactured by billionaires pretending he's Ohio when doing nothing and I hate that and I love Trump but there's something so wrong about what's going on in it's a same crap that's trying to bring us under brother I'm totally with you on it like I get thank you for no I listen I couldn't agree more with everything you just fucking said and actually hearing that you and I are very fucking similar my yeah fuck yeah my dad's my dad and even met his real dad my dad's real dad was killed in France six months to the day after surviving storming the beach on D day wow okay yeah he was 20 years old my my dad's dad never even fucking met him yeah never saw my dad grow up never saw him start a business never saw him do anything never saw my brother go play professional baseball never saw us build these companies like bro that shit fucking matters to me yeah man people people are like well why do you care so much how everybody else lives their life because we have an obligation to do the best that we can and you mother fuckers don't take it serious exactly you think that the freedom that we have is about sitting on the couch eating fucking Doritos watching Netflix oh that's my choice yes it is but it's a shitty one because other people are fucking paid for you to have an opportunity and you're setting an example for everybody else that comes behind you or around you next to you to say I don't have to contribute yeah at all it doesn't matter what I do and it does fucking matter because guess what the rest of us who are out here doing all of this stuff to try to try and contribute and make the country better yeah gotta live with the result of your shit okay so I'm gonna take an interest in it and dude that is that is what this country supposed to be this country is supposed to be filled with men and women who realize that we are blessed to have what we have and that we are stewards of this we are not owners of this country we don't own shit we're here for a little bit and then we're dead and while we're here we should do the best that we can so the people will be here we're dead have the same fucking opportunities that we had and that's disappearing by the fucking day here exactly and do when we talk about what's going on with AI and Trump saying oh 10 year game over dude motherfucker do you understand what that mean I don't think he understands what the fuck yeah not at all it that is game over that is a well-earned game over overpower everything and I got to throw this in there too so everybody on YouTube is ever gotten jealous how I see you in a fancy car oh you got an orange mercy a lot of you know what all that means you know what that is that's all the people that fought and worked and blood sweat and god damn tears to make this happen the only reason I'm doing that what that actually shows is everything goes back that's why I hate so much when Vivek says some crap like that you know I'm carrying never did well he felt himself by saying that no this group I mean really really so on that there was a lot screw him yeah but broke there was a lot of people I like Vivek there was a lot of people I know him personally I like him there's a lot of people that feel that way after he said those things well it just goes show it's not mean he can't learn done mean can't do something I will say this come on I have said my share of dumb shit so I have a little bit of fucking grace for it and so my my fire right now comes from I'll just say this one thing I think you're perfectly justified orange mercy a lot of people see that you want to get jealous think about something else like I actually have to work and caretake that for the future the only reason it exists is because all the people that came before me family community everybody around everybody who shaped me in some way old guys telling stories yes putting forth those values for the future that's why we can have this beautiful land and opportunities and nice things so and that's why I'm here being able to talk to you doing with it that's the thing what are you doing with what you have you may not have had all the exact same opportunities but you had opportunities and not only that none of us started the same place it's not about where the fuck you end up it's about the ground covered okay you might have started very very low there is millions of people who have started less than you would have done way more than you yeah okay and it's not about having a million dollars or 10 million dollars or a billion dollars it's about what the fuck did you do with your life bro how hard did you try what standard did you keep how how how much did you pour into the next generation and people will say well you you know you don't have kids you don't understand no I know but you have kids and your fat is fucked and you lay on the couch all fucking day and you don't do shit and you act like you're raising them when reality you're not raising shit they're on a fucking iPad they're on video games they're they're not learning anything and you say well you don't know what it's like no I do know what it's like because I've had to raise thousands of other people's kids who were raised that way and the truth of the matter is some of them are never going to recover from it they're never going to learn what reality is about correct okay and like dude if we're going to have a country that is great every single person has to understand that you have a very important role in that yeah the the most important role people say well I don't have a podcast I don't have a YouTube I don't have a this okay if your voice doesn't matter if if your voice is irrelevant then why the fuck do they try so hard to censor you great point why do they try to get you to not talk about certain things why do they scare you with cancel culture by the way where did cancel culture come from it didn't exist when you and I were kids okay it's a cultural weapon designed to silence you and if you think that your voice doesn't matter then ask yourself why trillions of dollars are allocated for propaganda and tools such as bots and fake traffic on the internet to scare you into not talking why during COVID where we not allowed to go to bars because the seeds of revolution are sewn in taverns okay they don't want you saying this hey this is fucked up what do you think fuck I think it's fucked up too no they want you to wear a mask they six feet apart not talk to each other and fucking bro because everybody went along with that it worked when 90% of the mother fuckers were doing this shit hey man with how'd you how'd you get away without wearing that mask I don't know I just fucking didn't wear it what do you mean you know like like bro I don't know how to explain this to you I just didn't fucking wear it you know like it's dude we got a courage problem in the country yeah well it's the truth and a crazy sort of way maybe that was the big wake of call that everybody need because we got way too complete complacent they went way too hard yeah that's the thing that's what I noticed in 2020 I said the one thing that maybe will save America is they went too hard and lit the afterburner yeah if they would have been a little smoother and slower and might it work but also you hear this big concussion oh this is not natural and then look at it in last few years I'm just gonna say it so like all right what's the first thing that we can exploit let's go the division between black and white it's everything related to Ferguson it there we're gonna do that okay well that's that's waiting trans people trans people rainbow community that's starting to waning anti-semitism Jews Israel so what's next now now it's now it's Mexicans oh Mexicans I was had to think yeah now it is the now it's Mexicans if you're against illegal migrants like bro you know how many messages I got from people who follow us that are Mexican in the last three or four days fucking tons and they're all saying the same thing bro that doesn't represent us man yes I know bro I fucking know you're an American I'm an American just because you come from there and my family comes from over there doesn't mean we're not fucking both American bro exactly and all these dudes are reaching out and they're like fuck bro it's you know everybody thinks I said no here's what the fuck we don't want we don't want these third-world motherfuckers that came across the border at a rate of 98% men for the military age men for the last four fucking years this has nothing to do with Jose that lives down the motherfuckin street that you know fucking his his whole family's been here for 20 fucking years that is not what people are upset about what people are upset about is third-world savages that eat our mother fucking ducks out of the fucking pond and rape our women and dude but that's that my point is that's the next one but they only and I'm air quoting protests in the big democratic cities LA Portland Chicago New York you name it give me a break that's could see only place you know the song try that in a small time yet try that in a small town and see how fast you get laid out yeah dude it's true bro and not only that did you see I had buddy of mine who who was at the protest he actually got shot was the rubber bullets yeah and I was talking to a blast I was like yeah fucking hurt but he was out there he wasn't protesting he was just like watching what was going on yeah and so I said well how was it he's like fuck bro he's like people are fucking crazy and I said well who is it out there and he's like it's like all the gangbangers and all the hood rats yeah the looters yeah and then and then all the purple hairs and which is the fucking people we said it was on well and then it's funny because then you get the theater of like Gavin Newscom and old Karen Basson like this is all because of Trump no it's not actually yeah you're a horrible leader yeah your state is a joke you can't take care of anything you're being exploited you're not being exploited because you know this is how it is yeah this is what you want screw your communist revolution or whatever the hell this is at this point it's just no bro I think most people like real talk I think they're in deep shit no they are the damage because yes it's in shambles most people are like the that's dangerous in a way dude dude dude it's super dangerous because I saw 30 fucking videos on the internet yesterday of like the hillbilly crowd right coming out that my fucking people bro yeah all right they're just short of the smore's party people yeah right yeah cuddle blocks before that's right but they're still good they're good for sure they're not racist they're just regular fucking Americans these motherfuckers are ready to go oh yeah well I want to let's get into it because this is actually our first headline for the cruises these guys but it's also dangerous bro because if the left knows that they're done right they're at that point where I think they're willing to about to do fucking anything accurate and you can't like that's the scary thing for me and on top of that the shit's being exposed way faster than it was you know correct let's say George Floyd riots or Mike Brown right it's like it's happening way faster like you know we just talked about this dude on the last cti we just covered the guy was a gas mask pulled up in a fucking truck passing out these bionics shield mass right yeah they just got them they just got them they literally just arrested him took him right out of his fucking house his name is Alejandro Theodore or or element yes now are they gonna take it all the way up the line and arrest the one Walton woman that seems to maybe be selling and promoting that I heard that they should they should that's a real thing she's doing that she is so what how far we're gonna take this off the pole shit all the way but I gotta tell every motherfucker that gives a fucking dollar to any of this shit should be in fucking jail the legal stuff like that not just and now here's the thing I have to say about the Democrat party if it's in shambles that's actually bad look everything that party has become I love okay they were completely exploited radicalized not American bad but we can't have a one party system that's yeah worse that's dangerous too right cuz I started thinking about I told you about the things I don't like about this unregulated AI I don't like these millionaire manufactured darlings that come in place that's worse because that is usurping the American government and finding the foibles by billionaires that can do it not good and I think to myself what do you do you run against it well no they already bought the whole party well what about the Democrat oh god I can't do that like what do you do yeah like America is pretty robust it was a pretty damn good system across the board but there's ways to exploit it slowly this is not good you know no no no and the other thing I have to point out relating this guy you're saying about things that can happen real fast they can find it that's the danger about AI because then you get in the throck thought crime territory okay so freedom of speech is freedom of speech whether you damn well like it or not not because we want it second amendment is there in case the government goes rogue bro you can stop it that but but if I if I say because I posted something on Instagram the other day I went shooting with the range I had my 300 blackout my 556 there you know and I you know those are kind of joking but my AR I know those are yeah are you sure yeah sure wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait what do you remember that yeah I mean I know you can't shoot I don't know if you need nothing about guys all right well I posted something that's on the line but reasonable and I said and I put in parentheses I put that picture up and and I put the song the old whistling Yankee doodle dandy like revolutionary war and I said in parentheses tens of millions Americans five minutes after looking at the news and I said there's grass to touch out there and families to raise Washington get your shit together hashtag this is not cool this is not good we don't want this and part of the reason I did that is because I don't want people saying like oh he's a thought climb radical and it's gonna go on again no I'm not so the CIA FBI I'm sorry whatever the wants to set me up I am a dog crime radical I argue with chat gpt about these things and I always make it admit that I was right that way if it ever fucking good that way if they ever fucking go through my dialogue they could say smart go right mom the fuck it said I was right yeah yeah sometimes it takes a while but anyway I just want to say that about things being too fast too far because then we end up in the bad sci-fi no listen you know we there's look bro here's what here's where I'm at leave us to fuck alone run the constitution the way it's supposed to be run hold everybody the same level of accountability our taxes need to go away the fuck down our spending needs to check that's a different conversation we can we now we cannot continue to call America a free country when we're paying 60% of our fucking money back to the government that's not freedom but that's a different conversation correct the point is we're tired of the chaos we want to get along we want America to be what we have always known American to be which which is a multi-cultural America that is fine but we have an American culture that you are expected to somewhat abide by right and we want low crime we don't want we want to be able to go out to dinner in our fucking cities that are paid for by our tax dollars yeah without getting fucking card jacked okay these these are real things that we all fucking want and that's not exclusive one that white people want black people want that everybody wants yes they but they make us think that that is some sort of discriminatory thought it's look bro go to fucking Dubai yeah like if our country looked like that I wouldn't have a problem with any of it at all nobody would say anything although they they get a little too serious about speed limits for my taste in Dubai love everything else but they're not cutting heads off and shit are they I don't I didn't see anything that's automatic take a couple of things that didn't let me see the automatically just the ducks we should be we should be dealing with violent crime harshly human trafficking harshly these people should be put to fucking death yes please hanging we need to hang people wrote a big problem in our society military actually I'm talking a fair trial and a morning you don't understand a big problem in our society is that nobody fears the law anymore in any real way correct if violent criminals were dealt with in a way because right now there used to be this thing where you know maybe they didn't do it okay and that's that's fine 20 years ago there wasn't cameras everywhere there wasn't everybody recording everything there wasn't the technology people didn't have cell phones in their pocket they tracked every place they fucking went there weren't license plate readers on every mother fucking stop sign we're pretty certain who did what at this point yep and there are times where maybe they committed smartly maybe they didn't carry a cell phone maybe they went and analog car maybe they did some other things that they could do to get away with and maybe if you can't prove it then they shouldn't be dealt with that way but if they're caught on camera and all this shit like most of them are now there are these people should know that in like two weeks time you're going into the fucking wood and if that if that weren't happened we wouldn't have any crime no I mean do this even like the riots and shit going on right now like here's some people that are doing this shit yeah these are the way four of the fucking five of them are white and five you said that two days ago and five out of five of them got released on zero dollar bill yeah within 24 hours yeah these are the people burning down the fucking cities and some of the girls smiling she is living in an alternate reality Casey you can assume I'm gonna look at this feminine dude with no Adam's apple and a shitty mullet smiling he's in an alternate reality that's a that's a day them it's a day them she's are all day them they got to be with that smile look at them smiling they're all day them look at this guy he's got fucking mask her on are you sure you just get clock good man now this little David Bowie and black here's some more from Texas they're what now here's an interesting picture this was Texas okay but wait that's the same guy from the other one yeah that's a great that great thing you called out how the fuck did you get from Texas to fucking see I don't think we talked about it's organized yeah it's organized yeah and that's the thing like I saw this comment we had this comment coming on YouTube I'm sorry Andy but you are very wrong on this one to think that no fuck I'm not that they should you're fucking wrong motherfucker you're wrong to think yeah I spent listen bro I'm pretty fucking successful in life I've wanted everything I've ever fucking touched here's but I'm fucking so stupid I can't read into things four levels deep follow the money okay so you're wrong to think I get tired of these people that say oh you're wrong no I'm not wrong I'm actually like real talk I'm very rarely wrong about fucking anything and that's not a character fucking fault it's that I don't open my mouth unless I know what the fuck I'm talking about the point is that true or not yeah well they're saying better say to ex I fucking pay you I'll back you up yeah but like bro these dudes like sitting there fucking basement and look at the name you don't even know some real person or AI this might be a really good person or whatever but like at some point dude you got to look around at your life and say fucking how how smart am I really because if you were would look like that wouldn't even about that you don't even have to you just just let's wake up look at things objectively and realize this is not organic this is not actual real have some compassion and humanity for once what the fuck are you talking about what okay I'm gonna read this I'm sorry Andy but you were very wrong on this one to think that nationwide protests are being funded by George Soros it's quite ridiculous why can't you look at the fact that we are treating humans like animals have some compassion and humanity for once do those motherfuckers have any compassion humanity for the women that they are raping and killing from fucking all over the country okay I'm fucking over it okay I don't have you're right I have no compassion for it I'm not gonna sit here I'm a victim of violent crime motherfucker just so you know I got stabbed in the fucking face when I was 23 years old damn okay I got stabbed four fucking times three times in a face and once in a back what the fuck experience do you have with real violence okay I don't have compassion for violent human beings I don't have I don't care if those people are rounded up that are violent and put into a fucking that's what they belong okay but aside from all that I'm actually a very compassionate person make heart okay how many schools have you built how many neighborhoods have you revitalized how much have you done for people before you talk about me having compassion humanity fuck you yeah well I just want to point out the piece on the George Soros funding process here yeah you know because I guess you know person's fucking ten years old it can't be true well the other thing is George Soros has made his fortune by destabilizing nations you don't think it wasn't ruining hundreds and thousands and millions of lives and all of those nations sorry with our tax dollars sinister our tax dollars yeah no shit and our tax no a hundred percent our tax dollars you spend a dollar for his own money USA USA ID fucking gave it to his fuck the bro it's crazy man sinister George Soros anti ice plot emergence oh your comes the propaganda amid LA riots as paid foreign agitators are finally exposed wow let's also go back and talk about I thought that was actually a propaganda this is real that's a minute usually when you see something like that they're trying to discredit it no it's real man it's real let's dive into it you got the LA based coalition for humane immigrant rights or charla is another group that's played a role in the protests espowed into face-offs with LAPD and federal agents rating workplaces across the city charla staged rallies in LA last week to announce the ice rates which are said to be targeting criminals living in the US legally research by Palombo and others showed how charla received tens of millions of dollars during the Biden administration mostly from the state of California but also 450 thousand dollars in grants from the Department of Homeland Security to provide citizenship education and training now air quote all that there has been cut right but the group also received more than half a million dollars in 2023 alone from the tides foundation which is the pass through body that George Soros and open open society foundation uses to bank role it's present a progressive causes and activists it is literally being funded by our taxpayers our tax dollars through these NGOs and their quotes listen that person and made that comment is a fucking more I'm sorry you could say oh I love you Andy but well dude then you don't you don't get it no you're not listening you don't get it okay this is happening this and for the record just so we're clear if you're not a fucking legal immigrant get the fuck out no yeah I don't fucking care who you are I don't care what you do I don't care where you come from we have to draw a line at some point in time and we are to that point if they want to go home and come back the way that this man has come here from India the way this man has come here from Bosnia I'm on 100% okay with that if you are legal it's time to fucking go so we can get our shit back together and then we will figure out a way to bring the ones back that belong here and you we can't you're not those look dude I don't care if you're illegal you got to go and that's how I feel about it yeah we can't differentiate between anymore people are like oh what about this guy who's been over 20 years okay no we don't there's no time for this anymore well Trump just passed an executive order this morning protecting people like that yeah who have had a history of employment yeah I'm fine with that cool with that I'm fine with that I am fine with that no no these other people got a fucking go and it's not about Mexican people I don't really honestly I don't really give a fuck of one Mexican person is deported I am actually talking about all the other countries they're trying to turn this into a Mexico no South America Africa China you name I know bro but that's how they plan military men in the country I know but listen dude this is why they're doing it because the second biggest population behind white people that voted for Trump is what Hispanics yeah okay here's the deal they're also the second biggest population in the country next to white people oh that's the next division thing you're right correct so what they're trying to do is they're trying to I wouldn't be surprised if that mother fucker that was on the motorcycle with the Mexican flag yeah is fucking propaganda oh for sure well he's perfect yeah I know the photo was perfect bro we got professional photographers here that fucking couldn't make that photo like he was also pretty good at riding motorcycles how do you do that with one hand awfully nice I'd be real no bro how do you drive a dirt bike that big a flag with that big a first one hand you can't do it I you know I can't you know I know you can't do it because I try to make fucking videos of me riding my dirt bike with one hand it's almost fucking impossible I've been riding motorcycles since I was fucking eight dude I when I run my first big go kart race and gotta go rip around with the checkered flag just a damn checkered flag 50 mile an hour hard to hold let alone that that was practiced those are you guys who ride dirt bikes they've been riding your whole I've been riding my whole fucking life thank your fucking cell phone with your left hand and try to ride your dirt bike it's almost impossible even for someone that knows how to fucking rest stuff yeah so I'm very sure I'm 90% sure that that was a complete propaganda photo to create division between the two largest populous of this country and like do we got to be smarter than that we're getting sucked into this fucking where you know the Mexican guys like I have 30 Mexican dudes to follow us DM and me being like bro you know hey no dude fuck I don't even care I don't even care if they to pour one motherfucker for Mexico they're trying to make it seem that way right but really what we don't talk about the smile that's right we want the fucking yeah right we want the third world shit bags that have come over here with no families military age no fuck you know that they have no intention of being part of our culture similarly Mexico is part of our culture of this fucking country man yeah we won they lost but we work it's not even that it's not even that it's that dude there's a there is a huge part of America is Latin culture like that is that it's a lot of it's in the pot it's the second most spoken language here in this country I don't think my personal opinion and and dude I think there's probably some out there there's probably some people that are like fucking get rid of everybody except the white people or whatever right but I mean there's a lot of people that are saying get rid of all the white people too so there's a anomalies yeah but the truth of the matter is I don't think I think the issue is being manufactured to be Mexican versus American because of the population size of the Hispanic community correct they they have the black and the white community has not gone at each other the way that they did at George Floyd because now they realize they got played so now they got to have a new group to go against and dude I don't think that most Americans feel like they want to kick out their neighbor Jose back to Mexico that's not we're I'm speaking for myself but I'm talking about these fucking third world fucking people that were dumped out of prisons and sent here by the millions yeah most people got to go yeah it's like that moved from the 80s red dawn you know these kids up in the yeah right movie it's it's like that except we got everybody here no exactly right and that's the old communist tactic the United States was too strong to to beat him against an invasion I think it was the Japanese that said behind every blade of grass is a firearm the Russians even ran all the scenarios and they're like there's too many guns in the no way the way to do it is from within and the old Soviet tactic is you break down and nation at the weakest point of what they consider the fabric of it they thought the division between black and white was it they tried that they tried the next one with the rainbow community tried it with anti-Semite which was not even a thing right and and now and now the next thing is it's funny because I'm almost kind of wondering why that's a baptism is becoming a thing what Israel's doing dumb shit well that's right and and people are tying it into Israel and they're saying oh well you hate Jewish no I fucking don't like what that government's doing oh yeah that's a different thing anyway it's becoming a thing because they're getting special treatment with their hate laws they're passing anti oh yeah speech laws against so why so so we're gonna pass laws where you can't say that fucking white people are colonizers and that white people are this and that and this we're not doing that we're not doing that right like are we gonna do we shouldn't do any of it none of it it should all be on the table for discussion you're exactly if you're a fucking asshole if you're a racist asshole you'll show yourself yeah well and the other thing that popped up is in the last number of years from you know George Floyd related things black lives matter rainbow community all that the biggest thing is if you criticize us your racist you're a big it we've been hit with that so hard I don't care I don't care exactly right but we've been hit with it so hard for so long all of a sudden now when the amitisemitesism thing a legend thing is a thing which is not actually a thing in America it's just not now you got like these these these rabbis going nuts getting a big hot cast going any criticism of anything relating to Jewish or Israel anytime is anti-semitism we're like fuck you yeah that's right like you committing genocide we're supporting this outside another country fuck you that's not anti-semitism your country is doing dumb shit stop yeah right yeah that's it I saw this video the other day that is fucking hit right it should be that simple I saw that I saw this video the other day it was like the New York mayor or debates that we're going on oh my god that yeah okay as you see this so they go around you know it's like what seven of them on the stage or whatever they're like you know what's gonna be your first you know uh you know visit that you will do foreign visit as the new mayor oh I'm going to Israel going to the holy like every fucking one like a Disney Land that's because the biggest fucking financial lobbies in the world are pro-Israel lobbies bro they got to get their money for their fucking election oh yeah they have to say those things yeah none of those people are wealthy enough to support themselves or wealthy enough to fight the ad campaign that a pack will run against them if they don't say what they're told to say yeah yeah so like do they may not need the money but even if they don't need the money they're not going to be able to withstand the fucking media slaughter that's gonna come their way yeah so they have to say that to get an office it's crazy or you've got to be like legitimately like Trump or Elon worth billions of dollars and just say we'll fuck you yeah yeah Trump didn't even do that Trump took a hundred fucking million dollars from yeah yeah you guys are real quick on this last little right thing you guys want to see uh NFL hall of fence tackle hit me oh yeah yeah baby yeah well

Yeah, and I do like the brand a lot But bro the reason I like the brand is because they make the best fucking ice engines ever I want them to sing yes so They're not talking about that GM is also building they spent a billion dollars to do to build a plant that that develops only Natch or gas power V8 engines So so I actually think what we're going to see and I'm interested to hear what you think on this But I actually think we're going to see this time of EV I don't think it's gonna stick. I think we're gonna see it go from gas to you know the last 10 years EVVVVVVVVVVVVVV and I think we're gonna fade back in because due to the end of the day people are buying them Correct. They're not buying them. Yeah, what's the market say? Yeah, and you know, they're not returning much and there's issues with them and And frankly dude like for the battery replacement like dude. I have a McLaren P1. Yeah, okay People understand this the battery on a fucking out. What's the battery in a Tesla to replace? Isn't it like oh, it's a 25 30 grand right? My P1 batteries 200 fucking grand great Yeah, so like dude these are not not that I think no dude no that you know do It is what it fucking is and it's the technology is not how it's they Promoted to be It's not Doing anything good for the environment. It's actually worse for the environment. You know this correct For infrastructure to those cars. No, let's be real. They suck. Well, here's the other thing Nobody wants to drive a fucking golf cart everywhere they go Here's the thing the electric motors are pretty darn good. Okay, there's only so much to develop you can develop battery technology to make it faster or hold more Okay, great, but in the meantime we can still develop ice engines a long way. Yeah, we can we can have the Infrastructure already for then here's something Well, bro, they killed that motherfucker that figured out how to do it on water Yeah, there's so many stories that going on for so long. It's funny because with my car people are like watch out big Well, I'm gonna get you. I'm like I'm not worried about them because I'm their advocate It's EV or global leftist that would be after me or want to silence me right now and I would say that's accurate Yeah, that's that's that's the so-called enemy that's why they want you to be quiet and go away But you know EV there's or with internal combustion. There's so much Father to go and develop and I have to point this out because nobody thinks of this I remember I think it was freshman year high school physics class We were talking about electric cars versus you know internal combustion So people got to remember not every place in the world is a first world country with infrastructure your second third world country or the military Oh, we're gonna generate electricity on a grid that doesn't exist on They were trying to electric vehicles. Oh, I know they were freaking they were trying to make electric tanks idiots Idiots idiots, you know and so the point is fucking going to war bro Let's get hurt the environment There's a reason the word retarded has come back. Yes. Yes. That is a hundred percent fact Just saying the word retarded with people you don't know at the right time the world is healing you know I'm talking about it. No, no, no, you're 100% true people still get mad about it But they they're not they're not like pressing you like they were I say I say it about myself in public So you know you're some people like I say nobody I'm already started today nobody calls a mentally disabled person retarded no one it's not there's context to every fucking word Yeah, it's like okay like the other word you're your guys is word that we can't say which word no no No, but when you always say here's your wallet back. No, it's one. No, you say give me your fucking wallet Not that one I'll be right bad kids. Yeah, I'm going to get milk He's a mo That's what you never say Anyway the point fuck The point is there's context the fucking words man. It's matters. Yeah, like for real dude Like nobody's out here calling like actual Mentally disabled people retarded right like we're calling you retarded for getting mad Oh Point on that okay with people getting to a point where they don't care anymore You know you got you got pushed too far for too long you know I remember 1999 my first year going to college right and all of a sudden bam I got hit in a face with the PC culture basically telling me everything I thought I never bought into it No, I know but that was I remember that when I first got hit in a face with it when I went to Ohio State from Tiffin right And I was like oh my god and since that time we've been pushed to You know, we're the bad guy. You can't say this you can't do this She got to support this everything and I realized over the last decade I'm like I spent my life building a more efficient car than an EV that's good for everybody and the environment I spent the last 11 years of my life not getting paid to mentor students of every color and background To pick up with the air American educational system has failed to help get them jobs I'm doing everything the left pretends to give a god damn about but never does because all they do is go out and Convert you signal at a party. Hopefully. There's an open bar for them and feel good about themselves when I've been out doing it And I'm the one they always attack and you know what I don't give a flying fuck anymore dude me neither I mean attack me in every way showing you got nothing dude. This is the point. They did not want people to get to I'm here because dude. I am too. I don't and dude Like I started speaking on the show recently about the the the discrimination against fucking white people Okay, that's a real thing All right, and people will say because it goes against every narrative that's been told for the last 20 years But it's true, okay, and you know, I've generally found that most people get it like most black people are like yeah, dude Fucking stand up for yourself. You should you know like and uh At the end of the day bro, I think that's what's happened. I think people have pushed like dude it It's it's gas. It's emotional abuse like you're a good dude like I'm a fucking good dude bro What the fuck you calling me all these names and eventually you're like Fuck you Yeah I've gone out and I've done the work. They didn't think anybody would I've done it Bro, dad's home now. I'm not taking any shit. That's right bro. Listen dude. Here's the deal We got to be smart about this because they want us to fucking here's what they want They want white people to get so fucking mad that they actually do hate everybody else. I don't and no That's and that's how they fucking win How we win is by laughing at them and saying look at how fucking obvious these plays are look at obvious They're trying to turn Mexicans against everybody else in America look at like we're not falling for it bro Like if you're falling for it and you find yourself mad and angry and emotional Dude you gotta remember that's the outcome that they've tried to create yeah, they're trying to get you to hate people of a different Uh Sexual orientation or a different color of their skin and dude. There's nothing more low IQ than hating someone else because of who they like to have sex with or what color they're fucking skin pigment Whereas there's good people and then there's fucking shitty people and there is good white people and shitty white people There is good black people and shitty black people and there's good gay people and shitty gay people But like it's it's it's fucking in india bro is they're good and bad people And Bosnia is they're good and bad people Fuck it's it's a it's humanity Okay, and like them Trying to agitate all of us into this game of hating each other is how they fucking win correct And yes, we could criticize them and we could say this is wrong but You have to be very careful Because you brought it up dude the pendulum is now swinging so far back And the problem with the pendulum swing so far back Is that the true power lies on the right side of the fucking equation? All right, okay, so The the right the center right of this country owns all the guns there It's all the capable men accurate. It's fucking everybody that you don't want to fuck with And if we allow that pendulum to swing too far back We will end up with a really bad situation And so it's up to the responsible men of this country who are angry and are mad to say yes This is not right, but I'm not gonna do what they want me to do Fuck them and we need to all all of us Look at the people who are manipulating us and who are pulling the strings and say bro How much easier would our life be if these people weren't doing this? How much easier would our life be if George Soros wasn't funding all of this crazy shit How much easier would our life be if if Joe Biden hadn't funneled out a hundred billion dollars from the date of the election Till the date of Trump's inauguration to go into USAID and other NGOs to fund their mission for the next four years These people are our fucking enemies. We are not the enemies of each other That is they are our enemies and we White black gay straight yellow red blue. I don't give a fuck need to realize who the fucking enemy really is And it's not each other. It's them correct and I'll give it one example and another statement on that so Virginia's garage right I Choose students simply based on what's in their head and their hearts, okay? It's not just specifically your resume It's like who do I think is gonna do something with this investment of time and money and effort Who do I's life can I change the most for the better? That's that's how they get chosen and You know what straight up honest at home in my garage is a bright orange Lamborghini and on the wall next to it to Magaflag and last year Students that I directly met her and spent my own time and money to help out I had a first-generation American whose family was Chinese I had a black dude from Ohio whose dad I should you not was a black panther in the 60s and he's pretty conservative now I they were actually pretty conservative. Yeah, well this son is yeah And this is just a thing. I'm like I can make a difference for this person and I don't necessarily know whatever But I also had believe in or not a trans woman in there and I also met her a Jewish kid So if anybody wants to come at me and says that I'm whatever you can go fuck yourself and look at my track record now The thing I got a point out regarding who the real enemy is let's look at everything going on in the world, right? um Manufactured protests the infiltration left to create that and stoke that Things going on with Israel to stoke war in Iran Be immigrants being pushed in the Europe different kinds to destroy the European West What's being pushed here to create? division in America if you just take all those things and find the commonality of what's creating it you found the enemy That's the enemy all this stuff is crap mess. We have to take care of but what's creating it? And then meanwhile we have to be vigilant like you said as Me a midwestern straight white man with a family that helps people out and votes are Republican But the same time too we have to look at our own party and we have to realize that if we completely destroy another party And it's gone that's not good for America and if our own party does dumb shit i.e Unregulated AI for 10 years or starts having people that look like they're manufactured by billionaires in that's not good at either And that's the way I feel about I don't I don't disagree with any of that. I'm not at all and dude. Here's the other thing The enemy list is not a religion or a race You fucking idiots Okay, it is a group of people with names So if you want to get around the defenses that these people use which is to call you names racist anti-Semite Fucking big it blah blah blah blah blah Then Stop referring to the enemy as a fucking group and start referring to them by their fucking names Because that is the defense that they use to make sure that we cannot criticize them They've worked or come up by the way those people are from all different fucking walks of life There are fucking so-called Christians that are in on it. There are Jews Quote unquote that are in on it There are these people all use these titles as shields so that you can't crit it's no different Then that fucking shitty dude that you know that every fucking night he's on internet Saying he's blessed and quoting Bible verses and you know him in real life and you know he's a piece of shit Yeah, it happens cross-border. Yes, that is the these that's what those people do They say I'm Christian. I'm Jewish. I'm this to protect themselves Okay, if you just name them and leave it at that and and don't bring into these other things They're race that where they come from this that the other now We have an opportunity to solve the problem. I'm glad you think they're all organized. That's called the world economic forum mother fucker Davos Switzerland. Yeah, fuck dude. Yeah, man guys Hell of a conversation jump down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think but that being said Our final second of the show. Yeah, we have thumbs up a dumb as well So this is where we bring a headline in We judge it we critique it and he gets work holy shit. I'm all the way through him a great Fuck I ain't sleeping night. I'm ready to run away from home. Yeah Oh, you are you ain't running nowhere. I'm out of fire. Oh Did I didn't tell you know what Addison did this morning? Well, she ran so fast you can catch her.

Yeah, true So is this what happened that got pissed at someone's business and went and destroyed it? Yeah, probably with this excavator So he's trying to do like the kill those are thing kind of Why did he choose to drive it? Was it funny?

Did you see him style, but no, he's cool, bro. Did you see he's similar to you? He built all kinds of shit. Yeah, he does it a little differently. Yeah, he's younger than you though. He's uh He's in his 20s, I think the entertainment of destruction and mine is I'm actually trying to create stuff in the real world And being pissed off the coolest thing I saw him do was put that fucking That tank on remote control. Oh, yeah, that was cool. Yeah. No, he's done some he's done some very entertaining stuff Yeah, but fucking missiles on his monster truck. That was pretty cool real ones I don't think they're real, but like you guys should probably connect because I'm sure you could make him oh I definitely could yeah That sounds like I have a few I May or may not have recently helped a student get a job somewhere Nevermind.
