That's what we're gonna do. That's what CTI stands for. It stands for cruise the internet. It's where we put topics on the screen. We speculate on what's true and what's not true and then we talk about how we the people that solve the problems going on in society. Now I'm gonna skip the rest of the intro and get right into it but remember we don't run ads on the show and for that reason we need you guys as help. So I do a little trade with you. I'm not gonna fill your ears for 30 minutes of ads but I'm gonna ask that you help us grow the show by sharing it. We're constantly talking about things they don't want us to talk about. We deal with traffic throttles shadow bands having things removed so we need your help to get the message out. All I ask is very simply that you share the show. So don't be a hoe. Show the show. What's up? What's going on man? Not much. Yeah. So what do you? Nothing much. Do you need glizzies lately? No. No, no, no, Thursday glizzies. No, I don't know. I like I like the big glizzies, the big bites. I can't believe you don't know about big bites. I've never heard of it. At least I got big bites of 711. They're called small bites. They're called appetizers. Yeah, I thought apparently 711s be in like there's like a merger going on with 711. 711 who? And what's the circle K? Oh really? Circle K is kind of trying to buy them out. What are they going to call it? Circle jerk. Circle 11. Full circle. Circle 11. Okay. I just have a feeling there's going to be a lot of very upset people from a certain demographic. No, you cannot do. Fuck you. You cannot bunch or you cannot do. Fuck you. You're sticky. What the fuck bitch? I'm sorry. No, I'm not. You cannot do. I love. I love our Indian people. Brother, they're cool. Their funny is fun. Food's amazing. Yeah. And nobody knows how to curse someone out like a fucking Indian person. I don't think they know how to curse. I mean, they do. It sounds good. I like it. It's very convincing. There are only people that cut you out. You'd be laughing. Oh, you're laughing. You're laughing. You're the fuck fuck. Oh man. Well, let's just start to show off with some good old fashioned races. It's going to be good. Yeah. You know, it's going to be good. That's right. No, man. I thought let's redo this topic. We'll try this to temp again. We got another dumbass of the day for you. Oh, really? This is great. You know, and I've been watching this for a minute, watching this guy. And I don't I don't know if they're like making him do this. Or if he just has like no other options to get any type of views, I don't know what it is. Dumbass of the day is going to down lemon. Oh, man. He has been getting hammered and not by penises. Not the way he enjoys. Not the typical way. I mean, I'm sure he likes you guys know what I mean. But Don Lemon, man, he's been getting it stuck to him. Look at his smile. He fucking loves it. That's a happy man. Hey, I wish I was that happy. Maybe try fucking some beard. Oh man. We're definitely going to get a this show deleted. Yeah. Yeah. Um, Don Lemon dumbass of the day. So I got a couple of clips here, man, because he is just being getting destroyed and obliterated left and right. I want to show you this first clip. So this comes from an interview that he did with Elon Musk. Okay. And say what you want about Elon Musk. I like him. Everybody knows he, you know, he's a unique individual. He's on the spectrum. But the dude's fucking smart. And I think that's really why don't even think he's on the spectrum. I think he's just extremely smart. That's what I think too, bro. I think the guy's a genius dumbass is just can't understand. That's right. You know, I've met people like that in life. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, there's a real thing. Um, and, uh, and so check this interview out between Don Lemon and Elon Musk. They're talking about censorship. Okay. Um, and, uh, let's check this out. So Don, you love censorship is what you're saying? No, I don't love censorship. Then why are you asking? I believe in moderation. Boteration is a propaganda work for censorship. Look, if something's illegal, we're going to take it down. If it's not illegal, then we're putting out them on the scale and we're bringing sensors. You're putting your thumb on the scale for moderating hate speech. I mean, you don't put out child pornography. That's not, it's illegal. That's some people would say that's considered censorship. I'm just saying. I literally said, if something is illegal, pause right there. Who can, who would consider pulling child porn off the internet censorship? People who enjoy child porn. Okay. That's that. Are you guys agree with us out there? I have to pause it. Yeah. Don, what are you talking about? Well, hey, I think we might have to check his, uh, I think collectively as a society, we understand that a child porn is a crime and it shouldn't be tolerated anywhere. And the people who enjoy it and the people who produce it and the people who do anything with it at all deserve to be fucking executed. That's, in a very painful way for you. So let's stop normalizing this idea of minor-tracked people or child pornography or... It's because of the self he tried to put that in there. Or, you know, downlimin saying we shouldn't censor child pornography because that's censorship. Some people would say that. Like who? You? Yeah, right. Right. You would say that. Or anybody who's affiliated with this shit. You know, I think the greatest thing that's happening in our country right now and in the world right now is that these people are exposing themselves. Because I get it's how they do it, man. I know. I know. I know. Well, that's how they do everything. You know, here. That's how they do everything. They inch in and inch in and inch in and inch in. Then they start calling for normalization. Then they inch in. Then they force it on you. And if you don't do it, you go to fucking jail. Like all these hate speech laws now. Yeah, man. If you say that if you misgender this person, you should go to jail. What are you talking about? That's a fucking man. That is a man pretending to be a woman. They ain't doing pretty, they know what's good. Yeah. Only people do it right or Thailand. And everybody knows that. Yeah. I just have to pause it because I like, bro, that's weird. It's not weird. I know what you're at. Nah, I'm gonna get your fucking way. We see you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Check it's fucking hard drive. Check it. Please. But let's keep, let's keep going with the interview here. Okay, we will obviously remove it. Okay. But if it is not legal, if the laws in this country are put forward by the citizens, we're a democracy, if those laws put in place, by the people, we adhere to those laws. Okay, I agree. If you go beyond the law, you're actually going beyond the will of the people. What you're suggesting is censorship that goes beyond law. And what I'm saying is that we I guess have a disagreement because I do not believe in censorship that goes beyond law. And you do, we have a difference in the opinion in that regard. So you don't consider that hate speech. I guess you're not understanding what I'm saying. We don't agree on this. Yes, you want censorship, but I don't. No, I don't want censorship. Yes, you do. No, I want responsibility. I think there is, I think there you desperately want censorship. No, if I want to you say you, you say you want to so bad, you can taste it. Can you say that? You desperately want censorship. No, I want responsibility. I think there is, I think there you desperately want censorship. No, if I want to censor, so much censorship is so bad, you can taste it. No, this is true. It's not true. And I'm against censorship. I'm in their favor for you to listen to speech. And free to listen to speech only is relevant when people you don't like say things you don't like. Otherwise, it has no meaning. That's funny. He wants censorship. He wants to know bad. He's definitely what censorship. That's funny. Good and hammered, man. So you got that. You got it. Like, bro, you listen, you're sitting here arguing with a dude. It's got like a 200 IQ, bro. You know what I'm saying? Who's made multiple billion dollar company? Like, listen, I, you know, I feel like I'm a pretty intelligent human, but I'm not going to sit there and try to jouse with Elon Musk, bro. Like in Don Lemon, I would crush you. You know what I'm saying? Like there's levels to this game. Yeah, man, for sure. You don't tell me something. I'm going to be like, okay, you're probably right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you have that man, right? And then, and like I said, you know, he left CNN, fired left, how rewant to put it. He left CNN. And so I don't know if he's trying to like do if this like rebrand phase or something, but he started doing these going on the street interviews. And he has been getting hammered. I know. Holy. It's awesome. It's amazing. It's amazing. Dude, you know what? What's funny about his, well, just played a video. Yeah, let's check a couple of clips out here. Here is one of him on the street doing these end street interviews asked the people that are political opinions. How are you feeling about the election? I'm going for Trump. I feel like every time they don't want somebody who is good for us to win, they throw somebody black in our face, thinking that's going like make us vote for the black person. I vote for Obama because he was black. I don't want to vote for her because she's the first black woman to run for president or to win. I don't know. Well, I want Donald Trump. I'm sorry. I want Donald Trump. Why do you apologize? Well, I know nobody likes him, but we had good times with Donald Trump. I'm running for Trump, so you are. Yes. Well, why? I love this. I don't know. I've just always been a fan of here, so that's how many more. It used to be against Trump. I used to live in Virginia. I saw the bad side of it, but really moving to Cleveland, but I saw the other side of it. I'm supporting Trump. Because it has to change. It has to change. Now I vote more for what fits me better as a person, rather than voting for the black person or voting for the first woman. What do you think about coming here? I don't think she's following her fake. I'm saying, I'm like, you know, what are you? I'm not feeling her. People get mad about it. I just don't feel her. I don't like her, her, the way she speaks, the giddiness, the laughing. Everything's a joke and it's not a joke. We're in trouble. I'm going for Trump. Come all of us on Biden team and I don't like Biden. Gas one this time when Trump was our president. Food wasn't this high. I love it. It's fucking amazing. That's a beautiful thing to see, bro. It's especially seen so many of those people say, I voted for Obama here. I voted for this person there. I didn't like Trump. That's, and then they're saying it right to Don Lemon, you know, which means they really have conviction about what they believe because a lot of people lack the courage to say something to someone when they know that that person has a different opinion for sure. Conversations are happening. Yeah, I really like that. Conversations are happening. You know, and I want to show this next clip too, because this is when he, like he tries to push back and he, he still like, he still has to see an end in him. Like, he's still, no, bro, listen, it's a lot different when you talk to people. We'd say this for years. When you go out on the street, it's not like what they say. No, no. But, but Don Lemon, I guess, you know, because he's never really done this, like going on the streets and talking to people. He's been too good for that. And so like the lies that he was so easily able to tell to people, you know, through this TV screen behind a desk, that was easy for him to do. Now he's having to try to lie to people in their fucking face and backfires. Check this clip out. He likes them, but we had good times with Donald Trump. Our economy was good. Life was good. But you know, the economy is better under Biden than Trump. Oh, shit. Well, that's what the stats show. That's what the facts show. Well, you know what? I don't know where they're getting their facts, but I don't think they're valid. I don't know where their facts are coming from. Yeah. Their facts are coming from them, making up their own data and then calling it facts. Exactly. The data that they're making up and saying and presenting to you is actually factual. They're just omitting the real data, right? When they say, Oh, jobs went to this. Yes, they did go to that. But you're not considering decisions that came before that to put them down so much. And then you're not considering who's getting the jobs, which is illegal migrants from other countries. Right. Like dude, we both said, I mean, even even the real meeting. I was holding comes. But have you been watching how they do this? Like if anybody's been paying attention to how they do this, you know, they come out with the report and they say jobs are up 10%. I'm just making this data up, right? And then they they put that out in the news and they put it out. They put it on a social. They put it out everywhere. And then four or five months later, they say, Oh, we made a mistake. It was only up 0.05%. Like something that was they they go back and they make a correction. But then they don't push any of that in the community. Correct. And so they're manipulating the Democrat voters by by putting this shit out. And bro, let's be real. How many of these these people legit, you know, like you and I do a show on it, right? We have time to research. We take it serious. Like every night you and I are texting back and forth. Hey, look at this. Look at this. Look at this to talk about what's going on the show. If you think about the average voter or the average Democrat voter, especially these people are not well informed because they listen to the media and they're not aware of the media is lying because the media isn't owning their lives. So you know, when they come out and they say, Oh, you know, inflation is is down. Yeah, it's down compared to a high that happened because of something that they did, right? Like they're not telling the whole story. No, not man. I'm this is very refreshing. But dude, like that lady saying bullshit. Yeah, like she like I know, bro, but like the regular person, me, you, everybody else that's listening, they all know that the economy sucks. And they have to watch these people get on TV and say the economy is the best it's ever been. And think about that level of manipulation of gaslighting to someone because like someone who's, you know, let's say they're just an average American. They're working hard. They're doing everything they can. They're showing up to their job. They're fucking putting in. They're trying to get better. And then they show up and, and you know, they're struggling, right? And they can't afford the food. They can't afford their electric and they can't afford all their bills. And then they're looking at TV and they're saying, that's the best it's ever been. Imagine what that does to someone's individual psychology. That's what I'm saying. It tells them it's just you. You're the failure. You're fucking up. That's right. It's my spending too much. I gotta say it. I'm fucking. It's much as wrong. Dude, how many people out here listening have thought that they've been like fuck, bro. Everybody else is winning, but I'm losing, right? Because that's what they're telling people. Right. Well, and on top of that too, and he like finances, you know, one, you gotta look at two like the majority of Americans, we are financially illiterate, right? And so like, intentionally, intentionally. So you take that on top of the fact that finances has always been under this like guys that is this private personal information, right? So like when you are in that mindset, nobody talks about it. Nobody's gonna talk about it. Nobody's talking about it. And so like, you don't talk about money. You don't talk about religion. You don't talk about politics. That's it. Why do they fucking put that into the? Why do they? Why do they encode that into our culture? Why is that? Ask yourself, why they don't want you talking about money? Why they don't want you talking about religion? And why they don't want you talking about politics? Why do they say that? The answer is obvious. They want you to be financially illiterate, okay? They want you to not be connected to God more or less week. That's correct. They want you morally flexible and weak. And then they want you to not voice your opinions politically because that way they can gaslight everybody even more. So it's all about manipulation, dude. And we've been, we've been manipulated our entire lives since we were children. And our parents were manipulated. And their parents were manipulated. And bro, that's not the sign of a free society. Oh, man. It's just like I said, there was refreshing to see this. Yeah, I like that. That's like those are two clips guys. He's been doing these fucking on the street interviews and begin to ask kids. Yeah, all of them. There's actually something that are way worse. Yeah, way worse. I always wanted to call them like a fucking he said something like dumbass. I could fold dude. Like he's getting a taste like look, man. Yeah. Do you think that down lemon and these guys like do you think like bro, listen, these guys are not any smarter like it's not like these guys are like geniuses. Right. Like these are just normal dudes that went to quote unquote journalism school to sit on a fucking camera set and repeat the news. Okay. These are just normal people. So when you're in CNN and you're in this culture and they're telling you this is the facts and this is what's going on in this is that bro, he believes it. He believes it. They're manipulating him. He's that shit up. Yeah, and he goes out there and tries to argue this and he cannot argue. It's actually very telling like you have a person who's on TV telling you all this shit. Remember what he was saying during COVID body bags bro. That's people are dying in the streets bro. Insane shit. Anyway, these are the facts. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. All right. Don, you keep you keep donning out there. Yeah. How that goes guys. Jump in the conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. With that being said, man, let's get to let's get to our headlines. We got headline number one. Let's cover this on a different light. Day three of the DNC just wrapped up and there were some notable speakers there. They had you know, Cory Booker of course, Amy Globuchar, Bill Clinton, good old Slicky, Slick Will. Slick Bill was in there in the house. Oprah Winfrey was there. She spoke Pete Buttigieg. There was a long list of people that were speaking at day three of the DNC. But you know, and I don't know. I don't know if it's always like what's with like the third day of things. I don't know. But we should always starts to happen. And it's no different from from day three of the DNC. There were some interesting things I started coming out. But you see this CNN's Dana Bash argues DNC appeals to men who are not so testosterone-laden. She's there wrong. I mean, that's 100% accurate observation. She's saying, this is what she's saying. I'll say this as I wrote it. CNN's Dana Bash argues that DNC appeals to men who are total pussy. That's what she said. That's what she's saying. That's exactly what she's saying. That way, but I'll say it. Yeah. Let's see what she said. I got a glib. Here it is. But they are doing so in trying to put forward male figures, Tim Walls being one of them, Doug M. Hoff last night, who can speak to men out there who might not be the sort of testosterone-laden, you know, gun-toting kind of guy who wants to listen to Hulk Hogan and the kind of players that came out at the RNC or might want to listen to that. But also, in addition, understand that it's okay in 2024 to be a man comfortable in his own skin who supports a woman. And that's something that they really are trying to work on with male voters beyond the base. I don't know about you, but that's just an awesome gun-toting. Fucking Hulk Hogan. Listen, man. Listen, dude. These people don't know what the fuck they're doing when it comes to this particular issue. Your man are bitches. They just are. They like them like that. They do. They like them. And bro, they want them to be these weak little, sublicating men who this is why toxic masculinity became a term. Taxic masculinity is not toxic. It's just masculinity. And they villainize that and try to work that out of society. And it's funny that she said, you know, in 2024, men, you know, can be comfortable in their own skin and support a woman. Well, masculine men support women and protect women. That's what the fuck they do. That's what the three women are. I know. That's what they do. That's what they do. You know what I'm saying? That's what the fuck you're supposed to do as a masculine man. A masculine man doesn't sit down on his couch and throw his fucking gaming headset on and, you know, look like a sack of fucking shit who couldn't fight off a fucking puppy, right? Like, like, dude, you're sitting there reading fucking romance novels with your wife. While your wife is out fucking some dude that's jacked and ripped and fucking tottening the gun. Right. These dudes are like, okay, I never fucking find a woman and my woman always leave me. Yeah, because you're a woman. Because you act like a woman, bro. Hey, women. No, bro, dude, real talk. Dude, look how women hate other women. They fucking hate you, dude. That's what I'm saying. Hate you. You think you're being what they want. No, they don't want that. A lot of times women don't know what they want. They say I want one thing. I want I want a sensitive guy who has feelings and then, you know, and then they fucking cheat on that guy to go fuck the dude with the fucking six pack and the fucking, you know, guns, a man with the Hulk Hogan sticker on his truck, you know, saying like in the truck. Yeah. Like, dude, they don't want you to be a little pussy, bro. I don't give a fuck what they say. They can say whatever they want, bro. They can say, oh, yeah, I want this dude and, you know, dad, Bob, blah, blah, blah, blah, bullshit. And you're gonna learn that lesson the first time the dude walks by. They fucking has all that other shit. They can't help it. It's a primal instinct of women. They cannot fucking help it. Women are attracted to men. Just like men are attracted to women. Women are attracted to masculinity. Masculinity is attracted to femininity. You can't fucking change that. You know, that's why these guys are like, oh, my, this girl's always go for the assholes. No, they don't go for the assholes. They go for masculine men that know who they are and stand up for what the fuck they're about and actually say, no, they don't fucking go around to the dude who stands out in the, in the street with the boom box in a fucking 4,000 roses and says, I love you. Bro, that's not what the fucking happens. Like, and they propagate that in society to make men these fucking total pussies and then men can't figure out why when they're 25 years old, no girls want to fuck them. And then they got to go on this soul searching shit and they got to go to masculinity school and they got to go to school. Run around naked with a bunch of dudes to be masculine and crying a pool like bro, it's just, it's totally fucked. Like bro, men are men, women are women and it's a biological primal thing. Masculinity will always attract women. Family will always attract the masculine men's attention. That is it. You don't get women's attention by acting like a woman and a lot of these Democrat fucking men are that way. That's why they're women running the fuck over. Yeah, they run them over and then they go fuck other dudes. My wife's boyfriend, he's really nice. Yeah, like, like he was, they, they, they, the playtime wrong your back against me. Hey, why is it gotta be black? What the fuck? What the fuck is that about? Look dude, all of them say it is the facts. The data is the data is just support that. But like, the point is, it's like dude, you guys are confused bro. You know, like, they didn't hit man. But that wasn't the only thing. Data Bash's pussy comment was not the only height of the DNC. There was more happening on day three. Did you see this camera, awkwardly cuts to Maryland delegate as Oprah mentions childless cat lady during DNC speech. Whoever this camera operator was, they did this woman. So wrong. Check this clip out man. We just try to do the best we can to save them. And if the place place happens to belong to a childless cat lady. That's fucked up. That's fucked up man. Man, man, man, you see her face? Come on now. That's fucked up. That's fucked up. That's mean. Ain't right. That ain't right. That ain't right. Oh, probably right. But it ain't right. Yeah, it's probably accurate. That ain't right. Fuck, that's kind of sad. It's like, what's that? Look at her face. She's like, it's me. They're talking about me. I'll be honest. That's always been one of my fears though, bro. Like going to like a big sporting event. You know, the jumbo trying to put you on camera. Oh, bro. Like, you know, comparing me to something. You're like, I just always a fear of mine. Bro, you ever seen those ones where they do the kiss cam? Yeah. And then they like get on like like a two a man and a woman that ain't fucking together. That's the best part. Yeah, fuck me. That was the camera man's wrong in this one. Yeah, he's wrong. It's like, what's that? You know, key and peel? I mean, this woman would probably call us every name in the book and say we're total pieces of shit. 1,000. But I wouldn't do that to her. No, she that's sad. Yeah, that was fucked up. Yeah. Play out. I'm fine. Oh, got one. Yeah, that lady there. Fuck. Doesn't matter if you're gay. DJ's got us a big bite. Oh, man. 7-11 is going to sponsor us, bro. I can feel it. I will take a 7-11 sponsorship. Hey, no doubt. We will put a fucking slurpy machine right in here. Oh, we fucking. We will have Sia run it. Like a slurpy machine. Yes. I love you, Sia. I can't wait for you to get back from India. But one last one thing. Do you ever notice what you ever notice what happens to Tazeesham when he comes back from India? What is Keith? What is it? Bro, that's all they do over there. Is he shit, man? And then he gets jacked and then he goes back over there. This is recent. Yeah. But yeah, man. So, so you know, you had this happen. But I got one little final piece. Like the day three, I thought it was just fucking hilarious. It was a lot of funny stuff happened. Did you see this headline reads, Democrat influencer Harry Sisson tries to crash war room gets roasted by Mike Ladell and Natalie Winters. Yeah, I saw this. This is funny. Do this is great. So at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday left wing activists and Faggot Tik Toker. Harry, what happened? What? I thought I heard something. No, Tik Toker, Harry Sisson. Yeah, it's all there. It's emptied to confront my pillow CEO, Mike Lindell, as he appeared in an interview on Steve Bannon's war room for supporting former president Donald Trump. However, the exchange quickly turned humorous as Lindell delivered a surprising comeback. Here is the clip. Check this out. Are you not ordered to get your mom to get her birthday? And then he runs off. That was funny. Bro, we went out to cover. I know, but I've seen a bunch of clips of Harry Sisson like talking to like a lot of the conservative people. They actually have some pretty good candor. It's actually they're like being funny. Yeah, I mean, I still think Harry Sisson's a clown, but for sure. But I mean, Lucy can make us laugh. No, for sure. You know, how do you feel about voting for a convicted felon? I don't know. How do you feel about voting for a bunch of fucking criminal pedophiles? Michael Dell says, did you get a boarding? I pray for you. I'm glad you were to board it. Yeah, man, it was just, you know, it's not happening. I thought day three was pretty interesting. Did you? I watched most of it. Yeah, we saw a little bit last night. Yeah, yeah. We saw a little bit of it. Here's what I'll say. The Republicans can learn a lot from the Democrats in terms of their ability to speak. The Democratic the lineup of speakers, I'm talking about the quality of their delivery and how they actually speak. I think was a hundred times better than the Republicans. Not even a question. And all I could see, all I could think about when I was watching it was like, these are all the people that for the last eight years have been accused of being around Epstein, it had John Legend and like all these people, right? It's like the crew. And I'm watching them speak, bro, and Oprah gets up there crushes like her fucking speech was amazing. And like the funny thing is like these people like, there's a letter Trump posted from Oprah saying that they should run in politics together. And she's up there talking all this shit about Donald Trump. What happened? You know what I'm saying? And and dude, these people, they're up, I guess what I'm trying to say is I can understand how someone who doesn't pay attention to what's actually happening and what the actions of these people are could be swayed by the power of their speaking ability. And I mean, I believe so. Yeah. And there's only one speaker in the Republican side that has anywhere close to any of their ability to speak. And it's Ramos, and dude, these other guys in the Republican, you guys need to learn how to fucking talk. You need to learn how to speak. The most powerful weapon in the world is a fucking microphone, bro, and they're tank and they're bomb and it's a microphone. And they know how to fucking use it. And that's why people fucking vote for them because they watch this and they're like, God, this feels good. Did you notice how they're messaging with is all moderate messaging? And then you have Kamala Harris saying she won't release her actual policies until after she's elected. So we're going to get up here and we're going to say all this neat stuff and we're going to sound good. Like dude, it almost reminds me of what I hate about the the personal development world and speaking in that world. It's like these people show up that don't really know any better. And they go to every event and every event and every event, they show up, they show up, they show up and nothing really ever changes for them. But because the message is so like positive and it sounds so good, they think it's going to work for them. So they continue to do it. They continue to show up. And dude, I could see how this type of shit sucks these people in, right? Because like dude, there was some good speech. Is Bill Clinton gave a great speech? He looked good. Oh, he did look good. Look really good. Yeah. Like a Drenacrone good. You know, you got straight off that drip went right up on stage. You know, walk round of a hot dog party. Yeah. No shit. But dude, it's all those same people that are accused of all this shit. Like it's like the it's like the it's like the who's who of heavy hitters of, you know, the Drenacrone conspiracy shit, which bro, I don't know, Oprah's like 70 years old. Fucking look at her, bro. She looks pretty good. I'll say this. Her speech was amazing. Bill Clinton's speech was amazing. They are much better speakers than the Republicans. But I also know that just like we watch that down lemon clip, there's a lot of people who are watching this being like, bro, I can't fucking afford food. They can see right through it. I can't fucking pay my gas. Like I understand, like like that. And I think what's happening now, because so many people have woken up, like they let Biden run for so long and people woke up. So many people woke up. And then they had the Trump assassination. And then they saw Kamala being a fucking clown for the last three and a half years, four years. And now they put her in trying to celebrate her maker. Look, like I think the people, the people, what's happening here because they're so good is the people are realizing how good of manipulators they actually are. So I actually think it's a really good thing that they are performing well because it's actually exposing them more because of what's happened over the last couple of years. Yeah, for sure. Because dude, that's the comments I saw. I saw a lot of comments. And I went, I don't go on just to people. I follows page and look for comments. I'm saying, if you go on any page and you like go to a neutral page, and they post something about this, the comments below were like, yeah, dude, look, look how full of shit they are. Like everybody seeing it because they're trying to, you know, overly manufacture this moderate message. You know what I mean over compensation. Yeah, bro, and it's exposing themselves. 100% man. 1000%. Guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments, what you guys think with that being said, let's keep this crews moving. Let's go check out some of these comments with crews, the comments. This first one comes from at William K 41 94. He says, I don't know how to send a picture of my fantastic 10 4 hat. You take a picture on Instagram and tag me in it. Yeah, all right. There you go. Tag it on the IG tag me in the two and we'll, we'll check them out. Yeah. This next comment comes from Flandrop. So the reason you're so angry is you can't get laid. Got it. What? Who? Me? I'm happy. I'm not mad. I'm not angry. What? Who was that at? I'm assuming you. I'm more upset they said I was angry. Now I am angry. Yeah. We're talking about. That's weird, man. What do they? What do they? Was that supposed to be on our show? Was this on a YouTube comment or Instagram comment? That's IG. Okay. I must have been off one of the reels. Yeah. Yeah. Go. Can't get laid over here. I'm testosterone laden. That's right. I was actually thinking about switching parties and going for the DNC. Yeah, right. Right. My small little we we my no testosterone. Man, my lack of masculinity. I'm just poor women. That's right. I support women. Guys, this final comment comes from at oh, imagine that being the comment that you try to burn someone on. Yeah. But you don't get laid. Just like me. I'm saying. Look at those people, bro. What are you? A thousand? You ain't getting laid. Yeah, no. Anywhere you go, bro. Dusty old fucking shade over there. Like they walk in the museum. They're like, what the fuck is this? It's supposed to be used in decades. It smells like a fucking fishing doc. Oh, guys, last comment. This username is interesting. At stiff sock. Stiff sock. Well, he's getting laid. Yeah. Stiff stock two. What? He says, uh, Andy should do the show on gas at some point. I bet he would either be a whole level funnier or he'd be quiet as fuck. Who says I'm not on gas? How do you know? Hey, I'm a lot funnier when I'm when I'm smoking the smoke. Mm-hmm. At least I think I know. Now I can't get to a point where I get quiet. But it takes a while. Then I get I just get hungry. Yeah. Yeah, man. Guys, we appreciate you. For being real ass fans, keep liking. Keep commenting. Make sure you guys hit that bell notification on the YouTube to stay up to date with the latest episodes from really. I was that being said, let's keep the screws moving headline number two. I'm gonna do a little follow-up update with the whole Trump assassination stuff because there's some interesting stuff coming out of there. I mean, I have left that out intentionally for the last couple of episodes because there hasn't been much, but now we've got some updates. Some things we knew, some things we did. But let's dive into this a little bit. Headline two reads, would be Trump assassin had encrypted messaging accounts on platforms in three foreign countries. GOP reps says, why does a 19 year old kid who is a health care aid need encrypted platforms not even based in the United States? So we're not talking about signal. We're not talking about what's at, right? Those are US companies. But we don't know what apps they're talking about because the FBI is not playing ball. But so let's dive into this a little bit. So the 20 year old man who attempted to assassinate former president Donald Trump on July 13th and Butler, Pennsylvania used encrypted messaging accounts on platforms in multiple foreign countries according to representative Mike Waltz out of Florida. Waltz, who is on the congressional task force investigating the assassination attempt, told reporters in Chicago on Wednesday that it has not quote learned that much about Thomas Matthew Crookes encrypted messaging accounts. But he did reveal that they discovered the accounts were based on platforms in Belgium, Germany, and New Zealand, which the congressman described as strange. The New York Post reported encrypting messaging apps allowed for text messages to be sent through an encrypted code that can only be deciphered by the recipient's device. Quote, why does a 19 year old kid who is a health care aid need encrypted platforms not even based in the United States, but based abroad, where most terrorist organizations know it is harder for our law enforcement to get into? That's a question I've had since day one, Waltz told reporters at the Trump hotel in downtown Chicago. Now Waltz, a retired green beret, then ripped the FBI and Secret Service for not releasing more information from the investigation into the attempted assassination. He says, quote, they need to be releasing information as they come across it because this wasn't an isolated incident. He said, quote, the threats are continually Iran's threats referring to the messaging that has been coming out of Iran, which leads me to this next point, right? There's a lot of information overload that's happening, not just with this topic, with plenty of topics. And you've got to like see in between, can't get too emotional along either side or the other, which again leads me to this next headline, able child exclusive, next of kin autopsy stifles the truth on would be assassin of President Trump. All right. Now, representative Clay Higgins out of Louisiana, an awesome representative, I believe, of the people, super solid guy. Actually, I do believe he is of and from the people. Clay Higgins, you know, he's on this task for, I love the gateway punnett. Yeah, they're good people. Yeah, Joe and Jim are good dudes. Good guys, Jim Hoff, they're great guys. True patriots. Yeah, for sure. You know, but there's been some interesting things happening. So like, again, like, you know, we call bullshit where it is. I think it's important for the integrity of the showroom for people listening. So Clay Higgins was kind of pissed off. So let's lay it out a little bit, right? So their article starts what exactly has the FBI done that doesn't sit well with the congressman. So first, Higgins complains that quote, the coroner's report and autopsy report are both late. And the second issue the congressman has had with the FBI is that the federal agency allowed the alleged shooters body to be cremated prior to congressional inspection. All right. So objectively, let's look at the truth. Let's look at the, because there is some bullshit happening, but not all of it is necessarily true. So contrary to congressman Higgins' statements, the coroner's report and autopsy are not late. Abel Chow spoke with the Allegheny County Medical Examiner's office on August 4th and was advised that the autopsy had been conducted and returned to the Butler County coroner, which will be explained later in the article. Neither the coroner's death certificate nor the autopsy is late. Okay. That's not the issue. The issue comes from the FBI ascertaining those documents and supplying them. All right. So they're not late. They were done. They were submitted. They were stamped, signed, sealed and delivered. It's the FBI that's not playing ball, which the article continues to say, whoever provided this information to the congressman was either out of the loop or lying. The Butler County coroner was in possession of the autopsy and his own death report when congressman Higgins met with him to say to otherwise his bizarre quote, it might be who of the congressman to inquire again with the Butler County coroner about not only the reports, or the coroner had in this possession, were meeting with the congressman, but also why the coroner was directed at midnight on the night of the shooting to return the next morning to carry out the identification process. The congressman may want to know who made that request, who was guarding the crime scene all night, and where is the police log of all who may have been on the roof of the AGR building during that evening. Now, what they're saying is that the day of the the attempted assassination, once all the cell is done, they lock up a crime scene, Crooks' body was then sent to the medical examiner's office. The medical examiner started working in this process. There's a process that goes, it starts with identification, you take outside, you move onto the autopsy. At midnight, he was directed to leave and to just come back the next morning. Who gave that order? That's what they're saying that needs to be the focus of it. Who made that call? It's weird because... When he came out the next morning, the body was gone. The body was there, that would continue, but in things like this, there's a chain of custody that has to be maintained and kept. With something at this height of national security, chain of custody is extremely important. That stuff should be protected and guarded and I left fine. Did anybody else show up while I was gone? At that point, the body is my responsibility. There's supposed to be a complete step one. You don't do it halfway and then pick up on it the next day. The identification process, meaning he should never have left until the identification process was fully completed. He left him between and finished it the next day. That's incorrect. That's not following the rules of chain of custody or any other standard procedures that literally any organization would be following. He didn't follow it. Now, there was this idea of this missing body. The missing body, yes, the alleged shooter's body was allowed to be released to the family for cremation on July 23rd, just 10 days after the shooting. This is not by accident. This is where it gets weird. The FBI signed off on the release by the Butler County Coroner and unless the family agrees to releasing the autopsy, the public will never know if the alleged shooter is actually Thomas Matthew Crooks. Now all of that stuff is completely sealed and the family has the right to say, yes, we're releasing it or no, we won't release it. The autopsy report, yet knowing 100% for sure, the body that they did the autopsy on was the shooter. There's a lot of questions here. Now all of that stuff is set behind this veil that we may never know the full truth on. It's very, very interesting. The medical examiner, he released it to the Butler County Coroner fairly quickly before August 5th. But it is anyone's guess whether the alleged shooter's body was returned to the coroner or whether the coroner just provided permission for the body to be released by the medical examiner. Either way, the FBI had to allow this to happen. So they obviously felt confident that they had all the information that they needed within 10 days, yet again, they're not being transparent with the people nor the representatives of the people, which is something's wrong there. Yeah, something's wrong. Now about the family, right? The family has the right, it's there, next if kin, all of that stuff. And that typically is protected by the constitution. It's very rare that even a judge can overturn that. However, ironically, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is one of 21 states that make release of an autopsy's mandatory. All right, so according to the autopsy laws as of 2024, quote, it shall be the duty of the coroner or the deputy coroner of any county in this Commonwealth. In all cases where death is sudden or violent or is of a suspicious nature and character to make or cause to be made such an autopsy as the facts of the case may demand, meaning that there is a loophole that somebody has to be willing to push it. Who that is? We don't know. Is it the FBI that's already not playing ball? Who knows? And obviously the death of the alleged shooter certainly falls under this, falls under the cause of the law, you know? So it's interesting. Now another news for Trump. So you got all of that stuff happening. Trump's doing a speech right now at the border. And apparently there's a manhunt underway right now in Arizona for a suspect who threatened to kill Trump as former president lands in the border state. So a manhunt's underway in Arizona. This guy identified as Ronald Lee Servood made a made a threat less than a month ago, threatening to kill Trump. And he's been on the loose to have been able to find him. The sheriff's office said Servood has outstanding warrants from the state of Wisconsin for DUI, failure to appear for DUI and from Graham County, Arizona for a hidden run and felony to register as a sex offender, shocking. You know, a typical leftist you know, with all of these wild radical views also likes fucking with kids, you know, there's that. And in good nature, of course, we got more, more fear mongering from our FBI. I have to believe this was just a bid to get one money coming up for the fiscal year. FBI chief warrants of unprecedented rise in security threats ranging from terrorism, cyber attacks, foreign interference, and just some basic security threats are all on the rise according to them. Andy, what do you got on all of this? So you're saying that the FBI is intentionally creating threats so that they'll get funding. That sounds like somebody I know happens all the time. Sure does. That sounds exactly like somebody that we know. But we'll talk about that later. But anyhow, yeah, man, I mean, it's a bunch of corrupt shit. I don't know what to think. You know, they're trying to hide everything they can to make sure that we can't look into this and see who it was. And I think the more they hide it, the more people realize, bro, listen, man, you saw the people on the street with Don Lemon. People know, they know who did this. They know who fucking did it. If you walk up and down the street and you say, who the fuck do you think tried to kill Trump? They're not going to say some 20 year old weirdo. They're not going to say, Iran, they're going to say the fucking Democrats in our three-letter agencies. That is what the American people believe. The American people believe that the CIA and the FBI have colluded and the Democratic Party have colluded to assassinate Trump. It's very obvious the amount of, you know, ridiculous unfair attacks and propaganda. We could go all the way back to 2016 and we could go through Russia collusion made up. Who made it up? Oh, Hillary Clinton's team. Okay. We could go into and that went on for eight fucking years. Okay. That that was he was a Russian asset. He's dude, they convinced their entire fucking party that Trump was a Russian asset for eight years over something that was made up. Then they hit him with the fucking very fine people. That was bullshit. We could go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on down the bullshit train that they've said about Trump. They've been attacking the dudes since fucking day one and on day negative one, they all loved them because he was a fucking icon. There's pictures of every single one of these people with Donald Trump, loving Donald Trump. Okay. So they've attacked and then we have to ask, well, why would they do that? Well, they're doing that because this man understands what the fuck is going on and they are threatened by him. Yeah. When they say he's a threat, like they mean that. Yes, he's a threat to them. He's not a threat to our country. He's a threat to them. And so they've attacked, attacked, attacked, attacked, attacked, attacked, you know, they raid Marlago, they admit that they fucking fudge the they set the papers up to look a certain way. They do all this shit. They ignore all the shit Joe Biden's done, including the shit that's come out to be true, where you fucking took 21 million. The guy took way more than 21 million. All right. That's going to come out later. They've done all these things and like, bro, this is just the factual nature. This is not like some pro Trump, you know, messaging. This is just what they fucking have done, right? And now they're trying to hide the fact that none of the shit works. The more they press, the more they attack, the more they push them through court, the more he grows in his power. Okay. And so now they're like, well, fuck, what do we got to do? And like I said, multiple times for years, they're going to try to kill him. Okay. And they tried and it didn't work. Okay. So now they're trying to cover up that they that they did it. Right? Because had they done it, had they killed Donald Trump, they would have brought in the fucking force of who they really are immediately. Because there's no real resistance outside of that politically, outside of him and his people. And we could say whatever we want. We could say, you know, we don't like the way does this or that. But the reality is is, bro, they fuck with this dude every which way possible. And he keeps showing the fuck up. And so now they're trying to cover up the fact that they did it. And I mean, do you have any doubts you did it? Fuck me neither. And I'm sure to the stocks recovered it. Bro, I tried to show the fucking stocks. Yeah. And make money off of it. And who was that? Who did that? Right. Who? Oh, it was the biggest fucking funds in the world. So you're telling me that these powerful finance years who fucking interfere in all of our local actions and all of the global politics who finance armies and finance crimes and finance Antifa and finance this and that and this and this and this and finance all of the population of every single motherfucker that spoke last night at DNC and that will speak tonight and the three days before that. Those same people are the same fucking people that tried to kill Donald Trump and everybody fucking knows it. Everybody knows it. Everybody knows it. And now they're trying to hide it. No, guys, they manipulated this fucking kid just like they do with the school shooters. This is some fucking kid. They probably told him, Hey, man, we got your back. Do this. You'll be an American hero. You won't get killed. And they fucking fucking did it. And they blew his brains out. That's how these people work, bro. That they encrypted messages. You want to know what those encrypted messages were over there? Why would this 19 year old kid have encrypted messages overseas because our own fucking agencies have been fucking manipulating the kid for fucking years. I guarantee it. I guarantee it. And they know that it's hard to get into it. It's like these people are fucking criminals, bro. We as the people of America have to stand up to this and call this shit out for what it is. You cannot allow just five or six or 10 or 20 people who happen to have an audience to call it out. Everybody has to call it out because, bro, if they know and we don't all stand together, they will eliminate the people who are fucking pointing this. People like me, people like fucking Rogan, people like fucking, you know, uh, P.B.D. or any of these guys, they'll kill those people. You won't have anybody speak for you. None. None guys. Jump on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments what you guys think. Uh, with that being said, man, let's get to our third and final headline headline number three. Uh, got another little follow up here for you. Yeah. Um, headline number three reads, family sues Detroit judge who cuffed sleepy teen on courtroom field. We called this. We said they were going to sue them. They try to get their ducks. Maybe they, hmm, they're not. Hmm. Stop it. This is some bullshit. It's 1,000 percent some bullshit, bro. So now we're gonna, now, like, look at this. This is like the Daniel Penny thing. Okay. So you got Daniel Penny, a fucking good man. Some fucking psychopaths going crazy threatening passengers. He fucking controls the situation as a good Samaritan and then he's in fucking jail. Okay. So they're trying to remove any good influence from society at any point. I'm making an example of it. Yeah. It's insane, dude. Gotta make an example of it because when you make an example of it, people don't want to do it. You will get less of that. How many people are going to fucking stand up on a subway right now and choke them out of the truck or out, it's acting crazy. Right. I mean, yeah, I would. I would. But I mean, you know, they don't want that shit. They want crime. Not because all they do is just put that little, little seat of doubt in your mind, bro. Men got to start standing up regardless of what the consequences are. I have to. They have to. And more importantly, the people, people need to stand up for those men, have to support them. Yeah. That's right. You know. Um, but yes, the Detroit judge who slapped hand cuffs on a teen girl and forced her to wear jail clothes after she fell asleep during a field trip to his courtroom is being sued by the student and her family. Judge Kenneth King was accused in the lawsuit filed a Michigan federal court Wednesday for violating 15-year-old Eva Goodman's civil rights when he singled her out for following a sleep and having what he considered a bad attitude during a field trip to the 36th district court on August 13th. King's actions were quote extreme and outrageous and calculated for the purpose of inflicting fear and severe emotional distress on the teen according to the lawsuit, which seeks over $75,000. So while visiting the court house, like I said, we covered this with a nonprofit group, the greening of Detroit Goodman, the teen fell asleep, angering Judge King who woke her and said, you fall asleep in my courtroom one more time, I'm going to put you in the back understood footage of the incident shows. Now when the teen apparently talked back, King ordered the court officer to place handcuffs on her and make her wear a jumpsuit. The entire incident was broadcasted on a live stream video from his courtroom. King then threatened the teen with juvenile detention in front of her peers before releasing her. Goodman's lawyer is alleged that he acted outside the scope of his judicial authority. King quote acted as a producer, broadcaster, complaining witness, a resting officer, finder, effect, judge and disciplinarian. Attorney's Gary Feltey Jr. and James Harrington said in the lawsuit. Now the teen's mother, Lotteria, yep, that's hard one even for me. Lotteria, Teeel said she may have been tired because the family does not currently have a permanent address. Now over a week later, Teeel says her daughter is still grappling with the cruel and humiliating punishment. Quote, it's been pretty devastating. Teeel said, Eva doesn't want to come outside. She doesn't want to be involved with no one else but her family relatives. It's hard for her to sleep at night. Oh, but she had no problem sleeping in the courtroom. Interesting. She's asking me, quote, why the judge do me like this out of all the kids? She should be asking, why did the judge do this and embarrass me in front of all the kids? Not why did the judge do me like this? Right, just saying. Should be sleeping English language is fucking deteriorating. She was probably sleeping in that class too. Just saying. Yeah. But King initially defended the, if you heard these young kids, fucking talk. Oh, it's ridiculous. Bro, you came and understand the fuck they're saying. Yeah. Now King initially defended the unusual punishment saying he was trying to teach the girl a lesson about the legal system. I mean, do not think he was overly strict. Quote, it wasn't so much. In fact, she had fallen asleep because I have attorneys to fall asleep sometimes. So it's not that big of a deal. It was her whole attitude and her whole disposition that disturbed me. I mean, so W XYZ TV. You know why she hasn't added to it? Because she gets to do whatever the fuck she wants and people protect her every single fucking time. Which is what I said, I believe, the first time we covered this. This is some bullshit. It is. Everybody's a victim. No, you know, it's always, you know, if this was a white judge, he'd be, he's for rick and racist. Yeah, right. Exactly. Could you imagine that? It's fucking insane, bro. Your kids fucking act like an asshole. The guy fucking stepped in and tried to help her. I know you as a fucking parent are literally fucking ruining your own kids life because you're teaching her that there will be no accountability for anything that you do ever. Which is why these kids grow up to run around and scream and throw tantrums and fucking destroy stores and fucking do all this crazy shit in public because their parents are fucking pussies. Oh my poor girl. She's fucking, I don't have a permanent at. Why don't you have a permanent address? What the fuck are you doing? Right? Fuck you doing that. You don't have a permanent address. I don't want to hear no fucking excuses. There's a thing I'll be willing to bet. You know, I wonder maybe maybe you should fucking take care of your fucking kids. Maybe you should fucking do whatever the fuck you got to do to make sure that your kids do have a permanent address. Right. I'm fucking tired of this victim shit, bro. It's bullshit, bro. It's bullshit. You know, they remove this dude from the bench. Like I guess I mean, we did cover it, man. It's just it's fucking ridiculous, man. That judge could have saved that little girl's life. But the mom stepped in the way and fucked it up. And then listen, here's the thing about Cromer, bro. You can't block somebody else's fucking. This is a big difference between white parents and black parents. And it just is. You're gonna want to say you call me whatever the fuck you want. White parents, you go home for the most part. Mothuckers gonna be like, well, don't fucking do that. Right. And then the problem beat your ass for it too. You go into the black households and it's, oh, you somebody's picking on you. Yeah, I'm not dealing with this. Yeah, right. Like, bro, listen, man, and maybe that's maybe that's an absurd statement that it's a white black thing. I don't know. But it seems to be the case. Okay, I'm sure there's exceptions on both sides. Yeah. But the reality of it is is this. It's very, it's much more common in the black community. It isn't a white community. It's the same thing when black people commit crimes that they know, like a black person commits crime and you know them and everybody looks like fuck, I didn't see shit. White person commits crime. They're like, bro, that's my cousin. He lives down the street. The guys are shit bad. Go fucking get them. For real. We don't want this dude out here either. It's a big difference that like, why do we do that? I mean, it's, I don't understand it. I mean, maybe someone can explain it to me, but I don't get it. And like, this is bullshit. This guy deserves a fucking award not to be removed from a bench in a lawsuit. Bullshit. 100%. Guys, jumping on this conversation. Do you agree with me? I want him to say it with the differences in culture. I say this to Bo because like, like, am I wrong there? No, no, no, no. I know it's a generality, bro. And I don't like generalities. But I don't only really think it is. And like, and I say that because I do, like, you know, I used to coach, when I coach high school football and stuff, man, it's like, you know, I, I'm not that old, but back in my day, bro, like, there was accountability there. They're like over the last probably 20 years, man, like it is definitely eroded. Yeah, completely, right? Well, I could do that. But like, when I was in school, I did some fucked up shit, bro. You got your ass beat. I'm getting my ass. Well, I can tell by the way you behave. You know what I'm saying? I was like, but now it's like, you got these kids who act up in fucking school and the parents are jumping on the fucking teachers. Yeah. It's like what it, like, it's completely flip flop, man. It's like, I don't think it's a cold. I don't think it's a white black thing after I'm thinking about it, bro, because now, because like, I got some teacher buddies that are like teachers that like, small boy schools that are mostly white and they got the same problem. It's the same issue. Yeah. I mean, you know, so I think it's a societal thing, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. You know, but like, it just goes with the lack of accountability. And I think what really pushed that over if I had to, like, pinpoint, like, when that happened, I'd say look at 2014. Yeah. And with the mic brown shit, you know what I'm saying? Like, once, once we realize, once people realize, holy shit, we can make martyrs out of these fucked up individuals and then there's zero accountability. Yeah. And then we can burn down shit and there's zero accountability. Yeah. You got mic brown, who's a fucking criminal who literally stole from a fucking convenience store 15 minutes before the situation happened where he got killed. He reached in the car, grabs the fucking officer's gun, the officer fucking shoots him and people freak the fuck out. Right. And it's like, what would you do if you were an officer and someone try to grab your gun? Because I could promise you, I don't care who it is. I'm fucking shooting them in the face. It'd be a little JJ, be a little Tim. It doesn't matter. Okay. And like, bro, and then these people all marched for Obama through gas on it. Like, it's this fucking civil rights movement. And bro, we've been dealing with the repercussions of that fucking criminal asshole for 10 years. Every since that's what I'm saying. Like, and so I get about the pinpoint when that happened. It's probably then. Yeah. And 10 and then we got this officer here and fucking St. Louis, where on the, because that happened here in St. Louis, the fucking officer that just got to break, he got that brain injury because fucking these people still all let it go. That was a criminal, man. Right. You want criminals running around your street, fucking with your shit, fucking with your family, threatening your family, fucking with your kids? Like, what the fuck is wrong with you guys? Make some sense, man. Make some sense. But I do know this stepping in front of somebody trying to block somebody's fucking karma from coming. It never ends well. Yeah. It's going to come back to you that girl when she fucking continues from now, she should be in a way worse position. Yeah. Guaranteed. Yeah. Guaranteed. And that $75,000, that should have been going on Newport to the Hennessy in about a week. You know. And this is what it is. My guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. With that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show. As always, we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck. Now, this is where we bring our headline in. We talk about it. It'll get one of those two options. I don't know why. I don't, this feels like memory lane. This is like a memory lane episode for us, man. I don't know. But I think I just figured out this picture with picture. It's thumbs up or dumb as fuck. I'm giving thumbs up in the picture. And EJ is looking at it like that's dumb as fuck. Is that the get is that the point? Yeah, look at this. He's an artist, bro. He's putting this subliminal messaging in this. Holy shit. It's chasing born. Yeah. That's Jason Bourne of graphics. Jesus Christ. It's Jason. Oh, man. But yeah, man, little memory lanes. I want to jog your memory, Andy. Do you remember because we have covered this on the show before? Do you remember this guy? I don't know. Which guy is he? It's the same guy in both pictures. I know, but what do you do? I can't remember. No, I don't remember it. Okay. All right. So this is covered this guy. We covered this guy. Wait. Here we go, maybe. Okay. All right. I don't remember. This is Kevin Ford. He's 54. And he was working. Oh, is this the guy that was working fast food and got like a bag of bullshit when you retire? Yes. Yeah. Got it. No, even in retire. It was working 27 years. Yeah. All right. And then that's what they got it gave him for his 27 year service. Right. It was a gift card. Yeah. It was like one movie ticket, a Starbucks cup, candy, and some chocolate. Now listen, I mean, most places don't give you shit. Most places don't, but like, I mean, it's fucking Burger King. You know, I'm saying like, race some expectations, race some standards, go somewhere else, get a better job. You might have some better rewards, right? Well, some people, listen, man, some, some people are, listen, bro, I don't want this to sound derogatory, but like some people are made for cooking french fries, man. 100%. You know what I'm saying? Like, dude, we need french fries. No, we do. And I don't say that disrespectfully. Sometimes I do say that disrespectfully when people are underperforming, right? Like, sometimes people will say, well, I can't do us, I say, well, you know, the world needs french fries too, bro. Right. You know, but like in this case, there are situations where dude, it's an accomplishment for someone to hold a job and do that work. Yeah, he's never missed a day. Okay. So that's honorable work for my opinion. For sure. You know, and so when we come to that, that, that, you know, that was the situation. There's been some developments every since then. There was a go fund me that was put in for him. God, I hope it's good news. Oh, it's great news. All right. No, he bought a bunch of new ports in Tennessee. I didn't want it to be that. No, but that was a go fund me that was put in for this, this man because that is honorable. That's some normal show. I mean, 27. Listen, bro, I respect anybody that works and does their shit and does it every single day and does it with a good attitude. I don't care if you're mopping the fucking floors or you cook a french fries or you're splitting the fucking atom. I don't give a shit. But just do your shit right. Yeah, you know, I'm saying that's respectable shit. Yeah. And so that was a go fund me that was put together for him. Again, when the story happened, uh, maybe even two years ago. I don't know, but that was a go fund me. I was put together for him. Oh, two years ago when we covered this. Yeah. And he raised, uh, you know, the people donated 300 grand to him. Yeah. Right. Now that's a, that's a one money that most people will ever have in their whole life. Ever have in their, at one time for sure. Right. Um, and, uh, yeah, I mean, never missed a day for 27 years and there was a massive go fund me that was raised for him. Right. Now we also talk on this show or maybe on the more on the Q&A, the Q&A episodes, but like, you know, just be responsible. Like, you know, this, this is a rare situation. Most people, I mean, unless you're hitting the fucking lottery or something like that, you, you won't come into that type of money. And it's important that you do something good with it. You don't go buy a new ports and in a sea. Um, well, no, I think, I think a lot of people end up with that kind of money when they fucking worked their way up. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. For sure. Um, um, but in my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, but in good news, this man did something very, very good with that, uh, little nest egg. Um, this headline reads Burger King Cook, Kevin Ford, who received mediocre gift after never missing a day of work in 27 years, starts new culinary adventure, became an entrepreneur. No way. Yeah. What's he doing? He came an entrepreneur. So as daughter, uh, Serena, wasn't so pleased with her father's bosses and created a go fund me to show her love for the man. She says helped put his four daughters through high school and college because of his dedication to the chain. Quote, the originally began working at this job as a single father, uh, when he gained custody of me, my older sisters 27 years ago. Serena wrote back in 2022. Quote, then as our family grew and he remarried, he continued to work there because of the amazing health insurance that was provided through his employer because it was, uh, unionized. This got all four of his daughters through high school and college with full healthcare coverage. Um, now since that's a fucking grown man. That is a fucking grown man. That's a man. That is the exact opposite of the shit we covered in the fucking story before that 100% that's a fucking grown man. 100% that makes, dude, it makes me almost emotional, bro. Like working 30 years for a fucking fast food chain, take care of your fucking family, put them through college and high school. I don't know. It's fucking awesome, man. Now since the original story, you know, three raised 300,000, it's actually was more than that. The fundraiser, uh, as of today, it raised $459,000. That was well over the initial goal that was set of just 200. That's all she was created. She created the GoFundMe to raise 200. Just give them like your date night or something, you know, um, and end up raising half a million dollars. Um, so what he did with this is even even more incredible. Uh, so Ford purchased a black and silver food truck from China for roughly $20,000. Um, it's a kitchen on wheels. It comes fully equipped with the works, including an oven and a fryer, the outlet reported. Um, the exterior is adorned with a giant K-27Y, it tribute to his viral fame, Kevin 27 years. Um, so the Burger King employee and his daughter who was trained at the French culinary school, the court on blue, uh, will begin with the basic menu consisting of hamburgers and hot dogs. Hot, what? Lizzie's. All right. My bad. Sorry about that. That's right. Almost, almost pulled my cart. Hot, uh, hamburgers and had a right hot dog. So why people understand what they're talking about. hamburgers and guns. Uh, but this is the basic menu. Uh, before it says that he plans to add Filipino dishes to the menu, to honor his, uh, Filipino, uh, Filipino fiance. Um, as he begins his entrepreneurship for, uh, remains a dedicated worker at Burger King, but plans to retire by May of 2025. His 30th anniversary with the company. Um, and it wasn't just that he didn't just become an entrepreneur. This is fucking awesome. It's fucking great. It's fucking, I mean, here's the truck. I got the, the pictures of a truck here. This is awesome, dude. It's probably, it's pretty fucking cool, two younger kids there. Look, dude, he, look at the nice house he has and shit. You know what I'm saying? That's the other part of it. Yeah. Um, check this out. So not only did he purchase that, the purchase of the new mobile dining establishment comes months after Ford bought his first home. Thanks to the money raised through the GoFundMe. He closed on the, uh, power up Nevada home on December 13th, 2023, paying $177,000 for the thousand square foot, three bedroom, two bath house. Um, that sounds like the first house I bought. Yeah, only I paid 74 because it was a long time ago by dynamics. Yeah, no shit. I get it. Um, but yeah, man, uh, just a solid thing, man, doing some good work. You know, you get, you get, you're blessing and you do something good with them. Man, do something amazing. I love this house and nice. Now it's a newer about to be launching his own little food line, man. I love that. I love the font they used for the logo too. Yeah, it's clean. It's cool. And it's, it's, uh, you know, it's, it's marketable. It could be on merchandise. Yeah. You know, it's a great, great logo. I think this is awesome. I think it's one of the best stories we've ever covered. Um, that's a grown fucking man, bro. Total respect to that man. 100. I could also see how like people would enjoy doing the food trucks. You know, like everybody I've ever met that does food trucks for a job. They really enjoyed doing it. Like, you know, you know, like, like, I don't cook very often, but I used to when I was younger and and was a bachelor. But like, there's something about like cooking a good meal and then seeing people happy about it. Enjoy it. Yeah. And like, dude, there's, there's, like, I could see, like, dude, let's just people are gonna laugh when I say this. But like, if, if like, I wasn't doing what I fuck I do, I would enjoy doing that. Like, like, if you and I had a food truck, we had so much fun, bro, so much. Oh, you're so much raising. We could just make content called any DJ's food truck. We fucking cook. Do we should just get one? Well, let's do we should get a food truck and go out a day a week and record the interactions. Talk to people about what the fuck's going on in the world and have a good time hanging out. Actually, be pretty fucking bro. Let's do it. I'm fucking by its meant today. I'm down. Let's do it. I'm down. I'm being serious, man. Listen, let me tell you something, dude. I grew up in business and retail. And in retail, you talk to people all day. Yeah. Okay. And I grew up in sports nutrition, you know, health retail. And you know, everybody like sees me as like this CEO owns all these companies and fucking, you know, a very successful man, which is true. But the best job I ever had doing all of the shit that I've had to learn how to do because like, when you grow a business like what we have in multiple companies, like what we have, you learn how to do all the shit because at some point you had to do it. And out of all the things that I've ever had to do, my favorite fucking thing was working the floor at our supplement super stores retail stores because bro, you get to talk to people, you get to know people, you get to hear about their lives, you get to help them solve a problem. They're grateful for it. Like you get to tell jokes and you know, like I don't get to do that anymore. You know what I'm saying? And like maybe, maybe like dude, I think we should seriously consider doing this. I'm down. Because bro, if we made a YouTube once a week of us doing food truck day or we run our food truck, it would be fucking gold. You know, and you know, the foods would be fire too. No, dude, I know that because like, you know, between you and me, we'll figure through yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck yeah. Bro, I'm down. Yeah. I think we should. I mean, you're fucking chef Gore, Gore May, chef, bro. I'm saying to be good food. Yeah. And like, I know, I know, I know how to like rate food. You know, like I know what's good. Yeah, right. Like I know what's good. I know, like we could come up with some shit. You could teach me a little skills. I got a couple tricks. You know, I'm down. Yeah. I'm down. We can't let Emily in the fucking food truck. Because Emily will make our fucking food look like shit. You know, like because she's so good. Yeah. Nobody's going to want to eat our shit. Yeah. Yeah. Go get your own free truck, Emily. Yeah. That bro, she would start one and fucking take all our business. That's the problem. She put a big picture of herself looking like Dolly Parton on the fucking side of her. We go to learn to need to her food truck. Yeah. Bro, I love that story so much, man. That is so fucking cool. That is what the American dream is about, bro. No. That's why I do this. Like, that's why I do this fucking show. A lot of you guys think that we just come on this show and fuck off. That's not why I do this. Like a lot of you guys are new listeners. I have the number one entrepreneur business podcast for years. That's all we talked about was making money business entrepreneurship. I'm an entrepreneur. I've been in business for 25 years for myself. The reason I talk about these issues is because I want to protect the fertile soil of this country so that young people can do these things that I'm talking about. You see those two kids? Yeah. If we don't fix what the fuck is going on, they're seeing their dad build a dream. They're not going to be able to build that dream at 54. That's what I'm saying. And bro, it shouldn't have taken him that or go fun me to be able to do that. Right. Like, if housing was where it was where it should be and economy is where it should be, someone who starts in fast food should be able to fucking escalate, but they can't because of these greedy fucks, which is the whole reason I started talking about current events. So when you wonder what we're doing, yeah, we like to have fun. Yeah. You know, I like you like a lot of people are like, why the fuck does he finance the show? Why does like, dude, it cost me millions of dollars put the show on every year. Why do I do that? I do that because I care about that shit. You know what I'm saying? I fucking love this story, bro. We need to find out when he's going to like, yeah, he has a soft, he has a soft launch. He's actually going to be, let me see if I don't know. So let's be doing it like a, a, a home depot. Like he's going to be at a home depot. I would like to go visit this guy's business one day and like do another business that we got to go eat at is that diner that Rachel has. Yeah. And I mean, yeah, no, it's not Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania. Yeah. I'm down. But like these are American owned, built from the ground entrepreneurs, bro. And I don't know, man, like that's just, I know how hard it is to start from fucking ground zero. And I was lucky to like grow up when I, you could still do it. No doubt. There are lots of people do it every day, but it's getting harder. And if it continues to get harder, it will become impossible. And that's why I do this, bro. Yeah. Yeah, man. And I hate the people that we talk shit about. Fuck it. We're going. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, man, thumbs up for that, man. That was relations. Kevin, man, keep working. Um, well, God love that, bro. That made my fucking day. Yeah, it's a good, it's good shit, man. It's good shit. Guys, Andy, that's all I got. All right, guys. Don't be a hoe. Show the show. In the cold, bad bitch, booty, throw, got a own bank road. Can't fold. There's a note here. Shot case, cloth, cloth.
