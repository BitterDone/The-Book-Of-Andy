pretty gay yeah it is the month man we got celebrated we got to celebrate and yeah man so let's get into these headlines guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them links there I was that being said man let's get to headline number one we got a little follow up here we got to address everybody's still kind of talking about it out there but like there's some information that's come out that's pretty interesting so we've covered this a few days ago with the hunter and laptop that came out during his gun trial right and here lately a lot of people have been put in a lot of focus on those 51 intel officers that sign that letter again we covered this a few days a few episodes ago but in the days since Hunter Biden's laptop was entered into evidence in his Delaware gun trial Republican lawmakers have called out the 51 intelligence officials who originally cast doubt on his authenticity before the 2020 election quote I think there needs to be an investigation into every single one of them representative catcamic Florida told the Daily Mail during a congressional baseball practice quote we know that the Intel community never operates in absolutes and the fact that we had 51 come forward and try to put forward a narrative that this was disinformation misinformation when everyone knew full well that it wasn't that it was very real that speaks volumes about the politicization and weaponization of the DOJ and the intelligence community now again I think they all of these people they I mean this is direct treason yes put your name on something to fabric something to influence or sway an election to prevent information from coming out to prevent the American people from being informed and making informed decisions because that's really what it's about absolutely if you knew that your president was involved in you know all of these things why to protect them what would the votes really be right or how much would they have been able to fudge right well and then where would the country be right now you know we have all of these people that are suffering and especially in the middle class who you know we have debt at an all-time high we have savings at an all-time low eventually that breaks and people go through a depression and it ruins people's lives and none of us would be in that situation we wouldn't have the migrant situation we wouldn't have World War three we wouldn't have Russia subs off the fucking coast of Florida had those motherfuckers not lied and bury that story and that is a fucking fact the fact man so we have to look at what the damage was that got created by their lies and what was the reason for their lies the reason for their lies was to deceive the American public for the purpose of maintaining control and power for their own benefit over us when in reality they're supposed to serve us these people can never be trusted again no never well so the interesting thing that comes out of this is because you think about it right like you got 51 people how do they all how are they all in the same page who who is the one that called the meeting who's the one that talked about hey like I think we should do this right there had to be some type of orchestration for sure and of course we know that and we can make allegations and speculate on who that was Hillary right well that's not even an allegation that's proven with operation hurricane crossfire that they did and back going all the way back to 2016 but here's the thing interesting person came out we got emails verified emails to prove this Anthony Blinken who is the Secretary of State the current Secretary of State he's the one that kind of led this effort to get all these 51 intelligence officials on the same page secretary of state Anthony Blinken is silent on whether he regrets his alleged efforts in helping discredit Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop that would later be used as evidence and Biden's federal trial resulting in a conviction the ties between Blinken and Biden were brought into the forefront last year after former CIA deputy director Michael Morel testified to the House judiciary and intelligence committees of Fox News digital review found so this this has technically been out in the public for a year but that has been silent until today there are emails between Anthony Blinken and Hunter Biden scheduling the meetings right to get this all set up no way verified emails here this is an email that was sent this is all the back in 2015 an email from Hunter Biden have a few minutes next week to grab a couple coffee I know you are impossibly busy but would like to get your advice on a couple of things best hunter to which Anthony Blinken replied absolutely I'm just about to land in Tokyo and route back DC from Burma I'll be in office from Tuesday on copying Linda in my office to find a good time look forward to seeing you Tony here's another one dear Hunter I will be in touch with you directly to schedule a good time please advise on best times for you next week and we'll try to accommodate that's the personal assistant of Anthony Blinken there's another one that has a confirmation of the actual meeting and what Morel again that farmer CIA deputy director testified to under oath was that in those meetings that's when it was created to get 51 intelligence officials all in the same page to describe that when was that laptop thing an issue when did it come out as an issue that was 2016 hold on hold on we're we're talking about the 51 intelligence guys who signed that paper right saying that Hunter Biden's laptop was Russian bullshit correct that happened in 2020 okay so how does these emails from 2015 relate to that they were already planning it in 2015 so this guy Morel testified to the House Judiciary Intelligence Committee that that meeting in 2015 was about was setting it up years and events no way that's what's coming out here man yeah Morel testified to Blinken as president Biden's then campaign senior advisor so that was his role before Blinken became Secretary of State he was Biden's campaign senior advisor and that quote he played a role in the inception of the public statement signed by intelligence officials claiming Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop was part of a Russian disinformation campaign just weeks before the 2020 presidential election that they planned it five years before that how bro I think what this is exposing is that you know these moves are calculated they're planning all of this stuff years in advance event what's the the big year that they're like that doesn't make sense to me dude so like how I would be thinking years years no that's not not that because I know that because what we're dealing with here is communism okay and communism is a 100 year 200 year in the future playbook right that's the thing that the American people have a hard time grasping so what's happening right now is the result of things that Klaus Schwab was putting in place in the 70s right that's not what that's not what I'm confused about what I'm confused about is that this guy is saying that in 2015 so is it like this like hey if this I lost this laptop if it ever comes out this is what we're gonna do this is the play yeah well couldn't they fucking track the laptop down in 2015 well that's also coming out and that was some of the stuff that the FBI actually had that laptop a long time before they officially so why wouldn't they just fucking shut it down and make sure it never came out well I think that see here's the one thing that we talk about all the time right like inside of every single one of these agencies FBI ATF inside of every single one of them there's a home team there's good guys right that are on our side and then there's a side that's not yeah for sure right and it only takes one person to leak some stuff I believe that the truck campaign Giuliani they knew about the laptop well in advance right I don't know if this is just high level chess here right like there's like they're very strategic about when things happen right and we've always assumed that like there's a reason certain headlines come out when they do for sure right like there's no doubt about that and so I think that you know they have these strategy meetings right long time like long-term playout of what's gonna happen and if this happens and we'll do with contingencies we'll continue to do that that makes sense but I mean what makes more sense is that in 2015 they were working in conjunction to create this narrative of Russian disinformation Russian interference in the election should Trump get elected right that makes sense like what happens if this guy wins the election oh well when then we come out with this when we say this and this and this and I could I don't know like there's it's confusing as to why why that would happen to me yeah I mean it's weird but I mean like but here's the thing there's and I got this in the second headline but there's weird things happen even now planning for 10 years ahead that are coming out of the Biden administration today right that it's being talked about one final thing on this just hold a bunch of items out did you see that Joe Biden came out and says Hunters a victim of weaponized system of justice the irony no bro that it's not ironic it's only ironic if you don't know what they do you read rules for radicals like every single motherfucker listen to show should read rules for radicals it's by Salalinsky Hillary Clinton talks about Salalinsky being one of her mentors and heroes and somebody she looked up to every single one of these people's loves that book and they credit that book and they talk about that book openly in terms of how it's influenced their political direction and belief system it is a book about communism and the tactics that they use on how to get people in the position they need them to be in and one of the major rules that they talk about in rules for radicals is to always accuse the other side of what you are doing that is like it says it that plane always accused the enemy of what you are doing and if you understand that rule and that these all people love that all these people love that book that it makes sense when they say shit like this because what he's saying is exactly what they're doing right and everybody knows this because I see these I see this in the comments across the internet they're projecting they're gaslighting this is what they're doing yes no shit if you took a fucking hour or two hours and read fucking Alinsky's book you'd see it clears deck real yeah it's crazy man and so and with all of this stuff happening right we talk about the elections quite often we we try to uncover this stuff there are a new poll just came off from rasmussen where 66% of voters believe outcome of 2024 presidential election will be affected by cheating so this is a new poll that just came out and so obviously I think with this show that there's obviously more Americans that are waking up and understanding okay hey yeah not only is this one in jeopardy but most likely 2020 was also right they're admitting they're coming to terms with yeah but they're not saying that there this is now what here's the the the meat of that statement or that poll isn't just 70% of people believe the outcome of the 2024 election will be affected by cheating because they're cheating Trump right if Trump wins those people are going to say that Trump cheated just like they did in 2016 right everybody forgets that everybody forgets that for four fucking years while he was president all they did was accuse him of cheating the election you had Hillary on TV column it illegitimate president you had fucking them telling that he was placed in power by Russia or Russia cohort or strategizer or ally or sympathizer that they and and it's all come out that Hillary Clinton paid to have the only piece of evidence that implicated Trump as some sort of Russian asset slash connection she paid to have that created it's called the steel dossier if you go read about what the steel dossier is it's a document that Clinton had fucking created to accuse Trump these people for their own self interest and their own greed and their own fucking self-worship have ruined the country for the last seven years okay I'm with her well she fucking hates you all she cares about is herself all she cares about is getting what the fuck she wants which is to be president because she's an egotistical piece of shit okay and on top of that I think she's evil that's my personal opinion and I think anybody that looks at her watches her talk can see that she's not a good person she's fucking crazy she's completely disconnected from the American people there's a video of her online walking through a regular persons apartment and her face is like disgusted like she doesn't want to touch anything she doesn't realize this is how most people live you know what I mean right and she paid these people are so above us the regular people of America that she thinks that it was okay for her to pay to have a piece of evidence manufactured to say that Trump was a Russian asset the media and all the politicians that disagree with Trump for seven years have called him a fucking traitor or Russian asset Hitler they impeached him twice they do all this shit they ruin the American economy they ruin racial relations they created much just as much disturbance and disruption and division as possible okay for for their own benefit that in itself is treason okay we have all had parts of our lives taken from us because of this small group of people wanting to be who the fuck they think their destiny to be the bitch wears fucking emperor clothes she wears robes that look like she's a fucking emperor like what do you think she thinks of you and these people think of you they're fucking they think you're shit they think you're scum they think you're subhuman to plurable people that's what they think they say it publicly why are you percent of supporters need to go to reeducation camp right that's fucking out of her mother fucking mouth right right bro it's time to fucking get whatever we got to do to get those people out of our fucking system they need to be handled well it's funny you say that because I want to show you this last little article that is they've ruined enough of our country dude oh bro 100% but these talks why are we allowing a hundred elderly people in our country to fuck it up for the rest of us why are we allowing that oh man and it's interesting and the thing is on this track talk right it's like you know you had somebody which recovered the other day maxing waters right like what are these people gonna do are they you know they're gonna make a revolution like like baiting us bite and for the fifth time in the last four years comes out again with and threatens us directly threat that's a threat him saying what he said for literally a fourth or fifth time in public the other day yeah that is a threat to the American people what he said if you didn't catch you go look up the clip he said again he said I hear this the a bunch of these people and he goes the blood of liberty like he starts misquoting the fucking quote because he's too stupid even know the quote okay he's he's up there and he's saying all the the the tree of liberty blah blah blah blah blah blah that these guys are think he just starts mumbling and then he goes he goes these people are trying to tell us that if we get out of line they're gonna have a revolution while I got news for you you're gonna need a 15s for that so what he's saying directly to the American people is fuck you I'll do whatever the fuck I want we'll do whatever we want and they're in shit you can do about it and he said that four or five times okay so he's saying it in open he's saying it out in the open he fucking means it these people are communist bro they're threatening us like legit threat imagine that imagine the president of the United States saying hey if we get out of line there's nothing you could do about it because you don't have that 15s and we do bitch that's what he said five times yeah five times you know you think it's baiting yeah yeah and that was that that was at a conference you know again while they're also trying to make legislation and push to take guns right assault rifles whatever they were they were they're terrified bro that's why they keep wanting to take the guns well 100% and it's interesting because on this note a new study just comes out let's headline reads Canadian study worries about under anticipated US civil war ignores growing resentment at home so this is interesting this is coming out of Canada and mind you we just covered the other day they got they're they're talking about their own inside trees in the tap and inside of their own parliament right they want to release a study that comes out of Canada that is saying that one of the top threats that that you know is concerning right now of the time is a civil war revolution inside of the United States um and and so there's article dives into it says if you dig deep into the subterranean uh internet files of the Canadian government you might find a link to policy horizons Canada a group that you might surmise is attached to global affairs Canada but no it is affiliated with the federal public service the posting of a recent study titled disruptions on the horizon might have been missed by the public had an article not been posted to political declaring quote Canada's big worry a US civil war it's a 37 page document and there's a lot of worries inside of this document with another American civil war not even making the first top 10 lists uh that is called the top 10 most likely disruptions but first on the list is people as quote people cannot tell what is true and what is not that's their first top worry um that would seem to be a politically correct choice to make given that prime minister Justin Trudeau is chronically uh urging Canadians to avoid misinformation and disinformation on the internet um and to only believe the news that they see on approved mainstream media um and to calmly accept the introduction of his widely totalitarian online harms act as something that is really about social media safety um other concerns are you know billionaires run the world and mental health as a crisis um but but one of the lists and i think it comes in at like 13 on that list um is the under anticipated disruptions list um where they are concerned about a civil war in the United States saying quote civil war rubs in the United States US ideological divisions democratic erosion um and domestic unrest escalate plunging the country into civil war very interesting civil war and who are the two sides what are the two sides well they're listen so civil war you mean what do you mean like progressive leftist first everybody else because that's not going to be a war that'll be an extermination those people don't have guns they're not equipped they're weak they're sick they're the nerds of the world that have never fucking been able to run or throw or do anything that's why they are the way they are okay so that's not a war what are those guys going to come and attack everybody else with their fucking nerf and their trash can lids and shit is that what the fuck they're gonna do we're gonna larp we're gonna larp in the fucking park that's not a that's the war that they're talking about is a potential revolutionary war okay but i don't even think it's that because if you pull the police and the military of who the fuck they support they don't support Joe Biden now they may not say it publicly but privately that's what the fuck they're talking about so are we are we really supposed to believe that the military and the police are going to turn against the American people and even if they do aren't they outnumbered a gazillion to one in terms of the weaponry that the civilians have versus the military yeah what are you gonna do just blow up everybody corporate bomb yeah what are you gonna do like bro by the way that wouldn't be the way what happened they don't think about it it's not people don't people think there'd be some like mad rush to the capital and it would be like what they think January that's not what would happen what would happen is everybody would organize in their own cities and they would take the people out in their own cities and take over their own cities so how is the government gonna stop that right how can the military stop that if there were a fucking group that were out here and said hey we're gonna handle this city we're gonna handle this city we're gonna handle this city and it all happened at one time how the fuck could it be stopped okay that's that's what you what do you like these people think they live in fucking Hollywood you think that the rest of the people are here bro there's millions and millions and millions and millions of people that are like itching for something like this to happen they're so fucking sick of it and do these people think because they have these big weapons and because they have f15s which an f15 is like five jets ago dumbass okay because they have all this shit that they're gonna somehow you know how is that gonna work for them they only have enough troops to fucking cold down six American cities there's like 60 major metropolitan areas and you actually think that the state governments are gonna go along with this like bro how what are we talking about what are we talking about these people are delusional and I think what they're trying to do is bait the outside fringe people into taking vigil anti action in small little groups in an unorganized fashion so that they can weed out the quote unquote troublemakers or the leaders of these movements correct but like to think that this is somehow of like we're gonna rush the capital that's not what the fuck would happen that's why he's saying January six was an insurrection is such a fucking joke there was no guns there was no organization there was no fucking buddy killed by the people side right please garbage man yeah guys this mother this old crusty fucking all his fucking buddies are saying oh you're gonna need f15s okay all right I want the f 35 personally um yeah guys jumping on this conversation down of the comments let us know what you guys think uh with that being said let's head to let's go check some of the comments out our people are awesome yeah I think it's undeniable um

you guys hit that bell notification on the tube so you get stayed up to date with the newest episodes coming your way now that big cell let's get back to our headlines head on number two uh speaking of you know this this planning out ahead okay um this is how I read Biden and Zelensky to ink ten year deal meant to lock in US military support for Ukraine framework could box in Trump with US election up for grabs now this is an interesting deal coming out again I mean how far out in advance do they plan right and I think it's a lot further than the most people think yeah right because let's just dive into this before we get too deep into it so President Joe Biden is set to sign a deal with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky intended to commit the United States to a decade of military support a move that could pressure rival Donald Trump if he takes the White House oh well the move is a key deliverable of Biden's G7 meeting set to begin uh in the Apulia region of Italy Thursday uh the president arrived last night and meets one-on-one with Zelensky before the two leaders are set to hold a joint press conference Thursday evening local time quote uh we want to demonstrate that the United States supports the people of Ukraine that we stand with them and that will continue to help address their security needs and not just tomorrow but out into the future White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force one and route to the annual confab quote this is a big deal he added Thursday he called it a quote real marker of our commitment not just for this month this year but for many years ahead to continue to support Ukraine both in defending against Russian aggression in an deterring future aggression um now that's just one of the deals right um and this is already after uh you know we were just able to send another 60 billion dollars to Ukraine okay this is after that apparently there's another deal on the table right now um another deal emerging from the G7 meetings as an agreement to provide Ukraine with another 50 billion dollar loan um amid its territorial losses to Russian forces the money comes from interest on 300 million dollars uh in seized Russian assets and gets around opposition uh from with the alliance uh from within the alliance to uh to using those funds um how do they get 50 billion dollars of interest out of 300 million dollars you know listen i'm not no veterinarian but it makes sense to me well that's because it don't make fucking sense yeah something's weird right there and it's called a lie here's the good thing though just like you just called bullshit we call bullshit everybody watching listening calls bullshit um so did the EU because the EU just uh cancelled that and said fuck off um and direct quote we might be stupid but we're not that stupid was the direct quote from them turning down this deal uh so a major rift has emerged between the US and European governments over a plan to secure a massive loan for Ukraine leaving negotiations to run past this week's G7 summit and perilously close to the United States election as leaders of the group of seven advanced economies gathered in Italy from Thursday American hopes that the meeting would act as a showcase for Western support to Ukraine as its war with Russia stretches into a third year uh look like being dashed amid increasing European irritation um so quote what Washington is proposing we the US take along Europe takes the risk you Europe pay the interest and we the US use the money for US Ukraine fund said one senior European uh European diplomat quote might be stupid but we're not that stupid um and so that's cancelled that's off the table which is good as it should because they also know that the people of Europe um inside the European Union they're done giving any more money to Ukraine not only that they don't want a war they don't want a war so so the US is pushing for a war a proxy war which could turn into a full real war yeah with our troops on the ground you have Lindsey Graham and some of these fucking dumbasses saying let's send our first first of all any politician that thinks that we should go to any war whatsoever in any place of the entire planet should be required to serve on the front lines for at least 18 months okay so if you're in if you're in congress or you're a senator or you're whatever you're representative yes sure and you're voting to go to war all right you and your family should be required to go to that front line for 18 months and if we made that the law we would have zero fucking wars it would never fucking happen but they're okay sending your brother or your sister or your children to go fucking die for their pocketbook and that shit needs to end here in this country the other thing is is do you think that these European people want to have their fucking livelihoods their countries their their everything that they've known their whole lives destroyed like they already went through fucking 80 years ago they don't want to do that bro um geographically brother they're so close that's right all in that shit yeah we're fucking pretty safe and removed from that are we we got a fucking rush of summary in 60 miles off the coast yeah but but like typically we're pretty safe from yeah that's not a reality that these men in our country have ever had to face none of these politicians that cheer on us going all over the world have ever really been in a war never really okay you don't see someone who went to Vietnam or someone who served in World War II or someone who was on the front lines of a major conflict saying yeah we need to go to war it doesn't happen dude no no but they're they're more than comfortable doing it because a little fat troll ass will fucking smile with his wooden teeth on television and his little plastic fucking bullshit politician smile and tell us that we need to send our children over there to fight for him so he can make some fucking money fuck you bro yeah and another dramatic shift uh this is I feel like this is important to cover too um and hold on it's also interesting it's interesting it's interesting what's happened to the men in Ukraine how much how what's happened to the men population Ukraine it's it's it's decimated it's done it's decimated okay so so there's all kinds of uh you know missing men in Ukraine and then we have this this situation going on in the middle east okay I would encourage people to try to connect the dots as to how those are related why are we being told that we're gonna rebuild Ukraine why are we being told that we're gonna we're gonna float the bill the United States of America to rebuild Ukraine doesn't this 10 year agreement sound a lot like what we do with this other place over in the middle east so maybe we could draw some conclusions about who is actually behind this and what's actually being done here right in front of our fucking faces because to me it sure does seem like they're trying to wipe the men of Ukraine off the planet and replace them with somebody else who else who else who else is in search for a home right now well you've read your question man I think it's questions worthy of being asked and just because you asked questions doesn't mean you're anti this or anti that or racist or big it I'm done with all that shit so is everybody else fuck you we're gonna ask the real questions we're gonna point out the truth and that's what the fuck it is yeah 100% man and one last little piece here man that what what was Ukraine called before it was Ukraine what what was Ukraine's historical name why don't you guys go look that up why don't you guys figure that out yeah do a little homework we'll talk about them next show do your own research yeah but one one other thing man I want to point out because I think this is significant and it's not really gaining a whole lot of attention for obvious reasons they don't want people to know that this is happening but in in brand new news this headline reads US Saudi Arabia petro dollar packed ends Joe Biden's failures are bringing in to global dollar dominance so leaders from the bricks alliance met in 2018 including Vladimir Putin Xi Jinping the original bricks nations included Brazil Russia India and China and then South Africa right in March of 2023 South Africa's foreign minister Nalidi Pandor announced that Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Egypt Algeria Argentina Mexico Nigeria and other nations wanted to join bricks alliance that was this was a direct threat to the west and the US dollar dominance right and remember when this got announced it was a big deal people were like man what's going to happen what what what what is this going to shake right well last last week again nobody reported on this but last week Joe Biden allowed the 50 year old petro dollar agreement between the US and Saudi Arabia to expire tip ranks reported the term petro dollar refers to the US dollars role as the currency used for crude oil transactions on the world market this arrangement has its roots in the 1970s when the United States and Saudi Arabia struck a deal shortly after the US went off the gold standard that would go on to have far reaching consequences for the global economy in the history of global finance few agreements have wielded as many benefits as the petro dollar pack did for the US economy the petro dollar agreement formalized after the 1973 oil crisis stipulated that Saudi Arabia would price its oil exports exclusively in the US dollar and invested surplus oil revenues in the US treasury bonds and returned the US provided military support and protection to the kingdom this arrangement was a win-win situation for both the US gained a stable source of oil and a captive market for its debt while Saudi Arabia secured its economic and overall security but that's all done it ended completely done the petro dollar's expiration could weaken the US dollar and by extension the US financial markets no no it will not could yeah it will if oil were to be priced in the currency other than the dollar it could lead to a decline in global demand for the green bag this in turn could result in higher inflation higher interest rates in a weaker bond market in the United States Andy what bigot on this man well I don't know who's a member who's a main member of bricks Russia no the other guys oh it's my China yeah yeah it's using thing okay so there you go so he's the leader of the bricks alliance now what family has taken more money from this certain country than any other politician ever Biden's okay so who does it serve that the petro dollar doesn't exist anymore and that now it can be priced in other currencies who does that serve definitely doesn't serve us yeah no shit so basically what it appears that we have here is that we have a United States president who is taking money from China who is then allowing things to happen or in addition to doing things specifically intentionally to put America in the weakest possible place who is now like how are we not tying this together and why is nothing being done by anybody in Washington like we know this motherfucker took money he's made all these decisions that have fucked our country the migration the depletion of our oil reserves the leaving of our military equipment in Afghanistan that is now being used in the fucking middle east the six billion dollars they gave it to Iran blah blah blah blah blah the inflation we can crime fucking all this shit the woke agenda all this shit has been perpetrated by this man and his fucking friends and it is on record that they are taking money from the country that benefits most from those actions so anybody with common sense should be able to connect those fucking dots and what those dots connect to say is fucking treason okay so why is nobody in our government doing anything about it why is nobody doing anything why is no but why are these people that we've elected to represent us and serve us as servants not as rulers why are they not saying or doing anything if these things are true which they appear to be why that's a question we should all be asking how many moves is it going to take of him destroying the country like what is it really going to take for people to wake up and say holy shit we're being sold to fuck out by this fucking family and their fucking buddies and a little cabal of fucking Americans that have somehow worked their way up into a leadership position here in this country and are now destroying it because they can't hold on to their own fucking power and they have tons of greed and tons of evil tendencies they don't fucking like us the America people they look at us like cockroaches they think they rule over us when in reality the whole founding concept of the United States of America is they represent us they are working for us they are servants of us okay so we need major reform here this isn't this isn't oh we're going to elect a new president and he's just going to do things a different way our government needs to be purged of all of these rules and regulations and systems and processes that have allowed it to get fat bloated and basically become siphons of the American families income and then wasting it and then getting rich off of it like dude these things have to be resolved and that's going to require a major reformation rate major change but what they're fucking saying is he is going to reform the government the way that other people have reformed the government outside the rules of what is allowed which is going to fuck all of them that's why they hate him so bad so and so the thing is man it's like you know I strategic or reserve is depleted a hypothetical guesser what do you think the new currency they're going to use to trade petrol will be I would take them if I was a betting man I would probably say it probably be the end right the Chinese dollar right and so then we're having that we're going to be forcing Americans to purchase that at whatever rate that they decide and see fit because oh yeah Biden stopped us from producing our own it's a perfect listen yeah shit's about to get rough yeah real rough they've intentionally made it hard on that's just what you guys don't understand I'm not you guys but a lot of people when you go to the grocery store you go to the gas pump or you go to buy your favorite product right now you guys are being told like you have Joe Biden on TV saying these companies are gouging you that is not true at all every single thing that goes into making a product has gone up shipping has gone up fucking cost of goods has gone up the the value of the dollar has gone down there's all kinds of things happening at once that make the economy super hard on you the consumer and the reason that's happening is because this dude is taking money and making decisions that are not in the interest of the American people which is creating hardship and then that hardship is being blamed on the individual business owners for being greedy which is total bullshit and that's a communist move that's a communist tactic let's make it hard on everybody and then let's blame the the business owner so then that we can centralize all the business through the government and then we'll be in control and all these other people will have to do whatever we want that's what's happening yeah well we'll see man guys let us know what you guys think jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know and with that big set of skits we're third and final headline guys head on number three spoke in pride crosswalk vandalize days after teens charged with felonies for leaving scooters skid marks on rainbow pavement no I didn't I didn't fudge this and this is real this is a real headline so the infamous spoken LGBTQ pride crosswalk was vandalized again on Tuesday this time with paint the new incident occurred less than a week after three teenagers were charged with felonies for riding scooters over the pride crosswalk painted in the street and leaving skit marks on it cross seems reasonable yeah reasonable so so you have a road and there are skid marks on the road from tires being on the road which is the purpose of a road and we don't like where you left the tire marks so felony mm-hmm but if they were to do it off of it it was fine yeah right makes a lot of sense perfect sense the crosswalk is emblazoned blazoned blazoned shit man I fuck that one I've been there yes you did the crosswalk is emblazoned with the colors of the LGBTQ pride progress flag at a busy downtown intersection on Tuesday morning officials discovered yellow and white paint splashed on the crosswalk after the city worked to have it repainted over the weekend ahead of spoke in annual pride parade at the cost of forty million dollars yeah no shit yeah and who's paying for that you not gay citizens yeah all citizens I think it's funny how they use taxpayer money to pay for these causes that a lot of people don't believe in a lot of majority yeah majority don't even participate in you know I'm saying it's it's fucked up now here's a video from when the from the first issue well we got to get all these crazy people out of government all these fucking dogoaters all these fucking weirdos all these fucking idealists here's what happened we took our eye off the ball because the rest of us who aren't fucking weird as fuck we're out here in the real world trying to make it happen we're out here trying to make money at bill businesses you know create the fucking society that all of these weird fucks live in and seem to hate you know what I'm saying right like fuck you guys right we need to get these people out bro and fucking get our people in that's the reality like these people are insane like this overly woke shit it's like when Aaron Elmore was on the show and she's I said what are you doing she's like they're out they're trying to outwoke each other that's what's going on exactly when it is I'm more woked in you I care more about

covered here's a clip just saw this group of teenagers like deliberately making uh marks and scratch marks with their line scooters like just all around several witnesses confronted the group and called police we're not gonna sit by as we watch people deliberately commit a hate crime like right in the middle of the day after looking at security footage officers arrested and taken a picture to our minors and one is 19 year old rustlin turco you are charged with one count malicious mr turco had his first appearance in court this afternoon the judge released him under the condition he doesn't go near the crosswalk or the other teenagers prosecutors though had asked the judge to set a $15,000 bond since that's how much it costs to repaint the mural the community really came together to raise the money for them to be able to do it before the parade on Saturday now this vandalism is over after that repaint and only a few weeks after someone else set fire it sucks to be reminded in moments like this that there are still people out there that you know have hate in their hearts for other people so no bitch there's not some people out here to have hates in your heart the reason that people hate you is because you jammed this shit and everybody's fucking throat there should not be a fucking pride flag on the fucking road is there an American flag on the road right i'm fucking you guys get special privilege and then you fucking's claim you're fucking uh gable hoods yeah are you you're you're persecuted against no you are creating the hate like what is so hard to understand this that is not an appropriate thing to have anywhere for any reason we don't paint flags on our fucking streets we don't do shit like that we don't paint black lives matter on our fucking streets it's a fucking street okay so people drive on the street there's going to be tire marks on the street it is not a fucking hate crime for some kids that are tired of your shit writing their scooters on

depends you like Lizzie's that's what we call Lizzie yeah that's what that's what we call Lizzie's who's we bro you're you're in it okay that's why I thought yeah you're okay so I'm learning the yeah those new words dogs are glizzies glizzies yeah but there's a rule you know this yeah of course Joe I like them like I it depends bro you don't like them you can't say that you like them what do you got to say you don't you don't you just say no I don't fuck with glizzies you don't fuck with them not in public but in private either but you can eat it by yourself okay like if you're alone you're shoving it fuck yeah you you're putting a glizzy in your mouth bro I ain't that homophobic no I mean I'm just saying I mean it's a real it's a real concern in the community the black greenery it's a real thing so they don't want to put they don't want to be seen put in dicks in their mouth glizzies can't get caught where glizzies okay well I don't care I like the glizzies I like them when they're a little burnt bro yeah I like them off a Weber come on man with a great energy drink brother yeah that's right I like them when they're a little burnt though for real like a little crispy yeah I like dude I like those ones those are the good glizzies dark ones I don't like a boiled bro I don't like a pink you know what I'm saying keep them pink keep them little red rockets away from me yeah no red rockets yeah those will be in the sausages no I like them big and big be part glizzies that's right all right cool well speaking of glizzies hot dog legend Joey Chessnuts signs with vegan brand gets booted from July 4th competition should have just stuck with the regular glizzies man this feels this feels very unpatriotic yeah I don't know what he Chessnuts like dominant bro also you know this guy yeah yeah he's a fucking glizzy master bro yeah he uh I mean big just the Nathan's hot dog eating champion like over and over again 16 years in a row to be if yeah be exact yeah yeah and I don't know what he's what he's thinking so hot dog eating legend Joey Chessnuts signed with a vegan winner brand and now he's out of the annual July 4th Nathan's hot dog eating competition he wins every year California but well there's the problem they finally got him found him yep California born Chessnut who recently signed up with a brand called impossible foods won't be allowed to compete in the Coney Island tradition and defend the title he's 116 times including every year since 2016 the New York Post reported the food champ has completely dominated the competition earning a world record in 2021 with 76 glizzies and buns and last year keeping the crown after chomping down on 62 glizzies 62 winners he literally says keeping the crown after chomping down 62 winners and buns so yeah so the July 4th Nathan's competition has taken place every year at the corner of still welding surf avenues just steps away from the boardwalk since 1916 the representative for major league eating or MLE which runs the event for Nathan's told the outlet that quote the organizers bent over backwards to meet Chessnuts various other demands but had to a draw a line when he became the face of a different hot dog man with beef weeners it says are made by plants quote we are devastated to learn that Joey Chessnut has chosen to represent a rival that sells plant based hot dogs rather than competing in the 2024 Nathan's famous 4th of July hot dog eating contest a statement from MLE red MLE and Nathan's went to great lengths in recent months to accommodate Joey in his management team agreeing to the appearance fee and allowing Joey to compete in a rival unbranded hot dog eating contest on Labor Day the state had been added but they continue saying for nearly two decades we have worked under the same basic hot dog exclusivity provisions however it seems that Joey and his managers have prioritized a new partnership with a different brand over a long time relationship the statement continued so once we're told that the hot dog eating champ was paid $200,000 to appear in the contest last year and was offered a four year contract for $1.2 million going forward and gave that all up to be gay anybody got on this I think it's a very short term decision based on his part you know he's famous for being in the Nathan's hot dog eating champion there's not another fucking hot dog contest that people give a fuck about Joey so now you just eliminated yourself from the only thing that's made you famous for a couple bucks when the when the thing that made you famous was willing to pay a couple bucks too doesn't seem like you have some very good advisors sounds like he was just getting like brother sounds just like ego yeah he's getting you know when you suck the winners down like that you know they go to your fucking brain you know he's got too many too many winners to the dome yeah that's what it is yeah that's what that's what it is man have you like I've tried to watch bro though like that's just crazy having me fucking chopping down on those glizzies though yeah like I mean they just fucking shove them in there they get the bun wet like it's nasty it's nasty gotta get the bun wet before you get the buns wet and then you eat the winner and then you it's kind of like getting gang bang for my dog I don't know man you know what we're giving this man I say for Joey thumbs down yeah I don't think it's a good move bro it was a good decision man you know I mean I'm sure as hot dog eating champion you probably don't have the best advisors or agents around you I'm just being real it's probably like his cousin or something you know I'm saying it's cousin Tony yeah yeah never turned it though those are the dogs Nathan's they good if I was to eat those dogs I think so yeah I think that's a deal yeah I like ballpark dude I like the ones you get at the ballpark the they're not even I'm not the hot dogs but the bratwurst oh bros that are like white bro you know I'm talking
