I think that's how I can tolerate Being out in the world listen. I mean you do you got to prepare yourself. That's right. We're reality. Yeah Guys, we gotta help a show for you Before we get to our main headlines I wanted to bring something up that happened over the weekend Today's a big day when this shows being You get I was just checking to see if these little cover magnets was face the right way. Is mine. I yeah I noticed I noticed it on your side check mine. Oh, yeah, you look good What's mine say? It says really F. Oh, yeah You're supposed to ask which horse you know the movie what's mine say really? Oh, okay You know that's do word my car with it. No, yeah, yeah, but that was also a scary movie. No, let's do word my car They got tattoos. Oh, that was dudes. My they're making fun of dude wear my car and oh, got you got you Anyway, yeah, but this happened over the weekend. So today's a big day In the 2024 election cycle right got the Iowa caucus caucus caucus Caucus going on the caucus. Yeah, which I think that I mean it's such a weird thing But it is a very like it's an important Myelstone I guess in the election cycle right because this is pretty much It's not like the guaranteed for sure who's gonna win But it's definitely like the guaranteed for sure who's not Because everybody typically drops out of this thing if they don't do well in this um So over the weekend DT booked out put out a very very interesting truth. I wish to talk about Head on me. It's trump turns on Ramaswami disguises support for maga in the form of deceitful campaign tricks This was very very interesting And I would love to hear your thoughts on it. So let's dive into a little bit So former president Donald Trump unloaded on GOP primary competitive evake Mama swami ahead of the Iowa caucuses on Monday former president who was leading in the final Iowa caucus pole Took a shot at Ramaswami who sits in fourth place in the Republican primary field on social media Saturday evening So he put out this tweet I'm sorry this truth and it says uh the vague started this campaign as a great supporter Quote the best president in generations etc Unfortunately now all he does is disguise the support in the form of deceitful campaign tricks Very sly, but a vote for evake as a vote for the quote-unquote other side Don't get duped by this vote for trump don't waste your vote. The vague is not maga The Biden indictments against this political opponent will never be allowed in this country. They are already beginning to fall maga Um Very very interesting tweet that comes out right and then again this was on Saturday Um, they did get way pun to dig get a chance to talk to the vague about this um, and here's the video on his response What what your uh what's your answer to the response to Trump's truth posted I think I think I saw your I saw your twitter campaign advisors Is it proud i'm gonna put the managerial class around him was probably a little bit off the mark with it there on that strategy I think the truth is friendly fire isn't helpful, but i'm not gonna be criticizing him He's a good president and i respect his accomplishments for this country And i will continue to respect that as the next president But we have to open our eyes to the truth and sometimes the truth hurts This system and i've done everything more than anybody else in this race or out of it to push back against these unjust politicized Persicutions i wrote an amicus brief for the supreme court that I think maybe better than some of the arguments they're putting up because i feel an obligation to this country to make sure They do the right thing but at a certain point we got to open our eyes and see these people will stop it nothing And at this point i mean nothing to keep this man away from office and it's disgusting But we owe it to this country and to our founding fathers to make sure america first Doesn't end with Trump it didn't start in 2016 It started in 1776 and so we have a duty to this country To make sure we see this to another 250 years left That's why i have a duty to this country to stale stay in this to the very end But i think we're gonna be successful in leading this country to our revival. Thank you And very so he basically calls out Trump circle which we've talked about plenty of times on the show And it was very interesting because this morning um There was another follow-up truth Um, and this is what i said i said uh Donald Trump tweet uh truth this out he says vote for vaik is a wasted vote I like va vaik But he played it to quote unquote cute with us Caucus tonight vote for Donald J. Trump build up the numbers and November we must take our very troubled nation A nation in decline back from crooked Joe Biden and the radical left democrats and thugs who are destroying it macca What was your thoughts on this is this just like political play? I mean You know, I i mean can they both be right? Because what i you know, I i've seen this eruption of The vaik hate on the internet You know a lot of people don't trust him like it was the first question i asked him when he came on the show About being the you know republican obama. Yep. I think a lot of people you know this guy comes out of nowhere um You know he looks a little bit like obama, you know, he's he talks like obama he moves like obama Uh, the manorism's there huh. Yeah for sure and I by the way, I like vaik I'm just gonna say this as a dude like since he's come on the show We text regularly he text me like a normal human being he doesn't try to like Big leave me or fucking act like he's a big shot or something like he's a normal dude. Yeah, and uh, I like him. I like him I I think everything that he said about Them not allowing trump. I agree with that. I don't think they're i've said this for a couple years now. I don't think I think that we If we believe that they are going to allow Donald trump back into the white house under a quote unquote free and Fair election. I think that's a delusional belief Okay, we just saw what happened in 2020 and a big portion of the country Believes even people who didn't vote for Donald trump believe That the election was compromised and they believe that Joe Biden is compromised And so and these are people that don't even necessarily like Donald trump So there's a lot of people out here that understand that the election it was stolen or manipulated And I think to think that they're not going to do something like that again or worse is delusional You know what I mean? So We have to consider That I think Vivek is telling the truth there and I think everything that Vivek said is is is correct now and people say Well, yeah, he's good at saying all the right things Yeah, he's saying the right things and no one else has saved him and by the way, I'm not voting for him I'm voting for fucking Donald all right. That's reality um If they allow him to be on the ballot, but the reality is is like dude I personally think they might cheat tonight. I think they might cheat the caucus and and say oh my god Nikki Haley supporter showed up or you know the Santa's supporters showed up in mass or even you know There it's two degrees outside minus minus up there and I mean it's two degrees here in Missouri I was north of Missouri and it's my it's negative degrees there It's freezing cold over more than half the country right now. They understand that civil unrest is Highly unlikely when you go outside for 10 minutes and and your fucking face hurts You know, so like there's all these things that have my gut feeling that there's a potential that this could be Fucked with tonight instead of the main election. That's just something. I don't know like and maybe I'm overthinking it But Trump leads by you know a massive amount in the polls And if they come out and say you know, oh yeah, by the way, it's people didn't show up. I mean I think it's a possibility I mean a couple of things on this dude to you to your to your point about them not allowing it I mean what you're saying is we can't take it off the table is that like it's a real awesome. Listen It could listen There's so many ways That they could sabotage this guy all right and in my opinion For anybody who like is unhappy with what's going on in the world right now When you look at how hard they fight to keep this guy out and how much they do to really Mess with him That should be something at least to me. That's a tell-tale indication That this is the guy that they are the most afraid of I don't think anybody could argue that and We have a corrupt system we have an oppressive system and the way I look at it Which isn't the way that everybody looks at it is that that needs to be dismantled and I believe he's the only guy that has the ability and the motivation to actually dismantle I think if the Santis goes in I think he'll do some good things But I don't think he'll restructure the government because I don't think he lacks the fuck I think he lacks the balls to really do it Nikki Haley's gonna be a Democrat like she's gonna fucking run Nikki Haley will continue to push the globalist agenda the same way that Biden did in a less in a less obvious way um And continue to move the culture progressive in a less obvious way and remember coming this work like push push push push push Take a step back What they push push push push push take a step back And they're planning on taking a step back maybe If they can get one of these other people in but if they get Donald Trump in they understand that their game is over So when I hear what Vivek is saying I agree with the things he's saying But you got to understand Vivek is a very intelligent human being he's not a dumbass All right, you could not like him you could not trust him you could say whatever you want the guy is super fucking smart And Vivek understands math okay, and by the way, uh, there there is zero fucking percentage of my Being that says that Vivek thinks he's going to win the election Why the fuck would Vivek is smart he understands he's pulling it 4% he's not going to win the election It's fucking not happening So why is he campaigning and why is what is he doing? But why is so confident about it too? Hold on We have to ask ourselves if this man is intelligent and we can all see that he's not going to win He knows he's not going to win too. So then what is he doing? Okay, and then so we have to consider the options past that What Well, he could be who he says he is he could be a patriotic American Who wants to fucking dismantle this oppressive shit I mean, he's the only guy that said hey, we need a 10 10 12% tax. He's the only guy that has addressing the issues that we talk about publicly um You know, so he could be that he could be campaigning for the 2028 situation Who knows he could be trying to get popular because he wants to have the social cloud to do other things in life Who knows you could say all of these things, but the reality of the situation is He what he's saying is true Okay, and I agree with what Trump is saying like if you're a Trump supporter you should not vote for Vivek You should vote for Trump if you're an American supporter That's that's our opinion, you know, okay? That's our opinion and I agree with that. That's our opinion, but there's a lot of Americans that have other opinions um But the reality is is look where their opinions have gotten us So I'm just speaking from our perspective You know I don't know I I think they're both right. I think they're both telling the truth I think Vivek is trying to skate in on on the magout ticket But I don't think he's doing so because he thinks he has a chance I think he's doing so because maybe he wants to be the guy after Trump You know what I'm saying? And we could think of it like this too these people You know who control the media and the corrupt side of the government all these things They this guy he could be part of their plan for later to control things So we don't know what the fucking we don't know Vivek we just don't and I like him Fucking like him, but a lot of people can't identify with them because bro he came from nowhere It's he does say all the right shit and I think that freaks people to fuck out. Well, we really do need to candidate that Stands for the shit that he stands for now, but he doesn't have a chance in this election. It's not gonna happen So, you know, and I think Trump's telling the truth. I think if you vote for Vivek thinking that somehow going to help Trump You're a fucking idiot. It's not going to help him No, there's no division on the left right now There's no division on the right. There's people arguing for for DeSantis who are just they hate Trump, right They say they're not voting for Trump even if he wins the nomination. Okay dumbass. So what are you gonna vote for Biden? Right, you got people who love Trump and fucking hate everybody else You got people for Vivek you got people for Nikki Haley, which I apparently I've never met one like three of them Yeah, but There's so much division on the right and I believe that's intentional I believe a lot of these candidates have been goaded into running or pushed to run Because they want to divide that base that powerful Donald Trump conservative magna america first base into sections and It's working. It's divide and conquer dude. It's no different what they do to the population And we have all these influencers out here who are so certain about all this shit Who are sucking Donald Trump's dick for fucking years and years and years and years and now every bit of their content It's just Donald Trump hate. You know what I'm saying like they've become like the left. It's just it's It's We're too stupid, bro. Our side of the fucking the pro freedom regular american Section of the country is is they're they're too dumb. They don't fucking work together. They don't play together They they want to be right instead of getting the right result You know these social media influencers who came along in 2020 during covid Who now all have these influential followings are now, you know Uh, forgetting the reason they even started talking about this stuff, you know, it's become this thing for like shares Uh, by my shit, you know type content and you know They do it to be controversial and they've doing it for selfish reasons and then and very few of these people You know, this is their livelihood. This is how they make money now like this is not how I make money I make money in real businesses You know what I mean? Like I do this shit because I want to solve this problem and It's very fucking frustrating To look around and see all these people artificially dividing the right when in reality, bro for us to actually survive and create the best possible America We need as much unity as possible And not just amongst the center and the right but amongst everybody else too And we can't get that because so many people are so full of their own ego that they've made their brand, you know, to be divisive Uh around certain candidates that like bro, it's fucking shit up and I don't know what's gonna happen dude Yeah, yeah, we shall see man. Yeah We shall see I think it's I think it's I think it's bullshit That a lot of these people Who were irrelevant before 2020 now that have some sort of following because dude I what I I rearranged my life to do this I was at the top of this other segment of reality in the entrepreneur business development world And I fucking rearranged my whole life to come talk about this shit like it was it was It was something that I gave up and most of these people haven't given up anything Most of these people are now relevant because they talked about they spoke out during COVID And now they're selling shirts and they're selling merch and they're selling this and so everything they say Instead of it actually mattering anymore and actually being a team player and being for America and for the future of this country A lot of what they say is just so they can get clicks and likes and attention to sell shit And so like dude this is this is where we're at and we can't win like that We're gonna have to fucking unify. We're gonna have to get together. We're gonna have to fucking work together and um It's extremely frustrating to watch because That these people are gonna trade their country for their selfish attention. You know what I mean? So he goes. Yeah, that's right Yeah, well, we'll stay tuned guys. We'll we'll know tonight what what uh, well you guys are watching this We'll see who wins this cop is an iron more We'll see what happens. Yeah, we'll see what happens guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos Go to Andy for seller.com you can find them link there. Well guys, let's get into these headlines. We've got headline Number one Um, it's been a while since we covered it thought we give a little uh, just a little insight on our thoughts and speculations about what's going on um over in uh and Yemen and with the Iran and let's talk about a little bit So um this headline reads navy seals missing after going overboard during search for weapons. Yeah, they're dead I saw that update. Yeah. Yeah Yeah, they're dead. So so two of our special operators Have died in an operation trying to recover some weapons off of the ship. Yeah um Apparently from what and and I'd Improved some inside information. Sure. They were dead a while ago. Yeah. It wasn't just this is just now Yes, for sure 100 but similar to the submarine thing. Yep You know, that was actually I mean, that's part of the you know because you know, they're they're saying inciting operational security purposes And I'm releasing in the additional information. They knew that the moment to happen. Yeah, I knew what the moment happened Um, you know, but this is just one piece of what's been going on the last you know four or five days weeks really um with this You know the hooties uh, Iran backed hooties going on in Yemen um, we know that uh, I believe this was Friday There was a massive Air strike on in Yemen Um, the massive escalation January 12th US and British warplanes ships and submarines launched dozens of air strikes across Yemen against hootie forces and retaliation for months of attacks On red sea shipping of the Iran back fighters cast as a response to the war in Gaza Witnesses confirmed explosions at military bases near airports Uh, in the capital Sanaa and Yemen's third city Tais, a naval base at Yemen's and main red sea port ho data and military sites in the coastal hija government Quote these target strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel Or allow hostile actors to emperor freedom of navigation US President Joe Biden said Um, there's a couple of images from that strike Um, I believe all in total was 150 plus munitions that were used Um, there was a massive protest just a quick update. So a massive protest going on in Yemen. I'm a response to that Um, and then you got Biden come out and he defended the strike against them um Here's a clip of his response We will make sure that we respond to who he's going to continue his outrageous behavior Normal for allies Also He responded about that in the midst of sniffing another young girl. Yeah, they clip that out. I mean, this is Yeah, let's clip out he totally Fucking creeps out this like 10 or 12-year-old girl. Yeah It's very reminiscent of the uh Of the clip of George Bush getting the news about 9-11 was in front of the kids And just kind of like what you know what I'm saying reminds me a lot of that I think they are Yes I don't think it's a civilian casualties. That's another reason why it's a surprise Yeah, so double down on them. Um, and then the most recent update you got uh In the most recent update you got houthi rebels strike a US-owned ship off the coast of Yemen and the Gulf of Aden I was today, right? That was today. Yeah, raise it raising tensions So uh, houthi rebels fought fired a missile striking a US-owned ship Monday just off the coast of Yemen and the Gulf of Aden Less than a day after they launched an anti-ship cruise missile towards an American destroyer in the Red Sea the attack on Gibraltar Eagle later claimed by the houthis further escalates tensions gripping the Red Sea after American led strikes on the rebels Houthis attacks have royal global shipping amid Israel's war with Hamas and the Gaza Strip targeting a crucial corridor leaking Asian and mid-eastern energy and cargo shipments To the Suez Canal onward to Europe. And what we got on this Well, I don't think people realize also that the shipping canal they're talking about doesn't really serve the United States at all It only serves China in Asia. Yep, and we're protecting them with military strikes So let's do the math here just so we can Understand this Americans are contractually through a treaty obligated to protect the shipping lanes globally That's what their navy is for No other country including China has a navy capable of doing that China's navy is to defend China and to on and all the little islands and shit around there. They don't have a global navy Now they have some modern ships that are nicer than ours, but the reality is is They're very ill-equipped to do this mission. I can't do both So the United States is shooting missiles and destroying these targets in Yemen And killing pirates in the in this shipping corridor for the sake of China's economy just so we're clear I mean that that's what the bats say okay, so How's everybody feel about that that's what's happening Now Take into account all the information that we've talked about over the years About Joe Biden Being compromised by China taking money from China, right? The whole Hunter Biden laptop It starts to make a little bit more sense as to why this is going on so so here's what's interesting is that We could have a scenario where We are pulled into a world war conflict Because of this against China for defending Chinese shipping lanes How does that make sense? It doesn't So that's the first thing that people need to understand which they don't in order to understand that So Outside of this you know uh I think this is right along the lines of of What no because I just like There there's even more evidence to that that can clarify like can verify that this is real bro China China has a good relationship working relationship with Iran China could easily just pick up the phone. Hey, I ran like make sure my shit gets through yeah But no why not why not force the the the US taxpayers to to spend hundreds of millions billions of dollars on equipment weapons You know risking lives. Why not just make them do it and set I mean fuck man The right and don't the wall No, it's not in the wall. It's on the fucking paper in front of your fucking face But people don't want to admit that's what's going on and people are uneducated about the United States roles The United States Navy's role globally. Yeah, so um You know, that's how I see what's going on. I see this is us getting drug into a potential conflict protecting a country that will be fighting against us in said conflict and You know, that's that's disturbing and I think this is part of the agenda. I think this war will escalate and I think by the time election season comes around will be at full fucking World War III Um, and probably a bunch of other disruptions probably a bunch of other stuff, you know cyber blackouts power outages Some sort of pandemic again. I still think they're gonna try to do that. They still put out a article about it every week You know right now like Pfizer's running these Pfizer's accumulating companies that treat Heart Aridmias and and then they're putting out warnings the global health the world health organization and these other Health organizations are putting out warnings saying that this new this new super covid could cause Heart attacks Yeah, I'm sure it has nothing to do with the vaccines You know what I'm saying so so So they get you to take a vaccine which causes some sort of other And this is what people don't understand about vaccines either Vaccines are intended by these pharma companies to create side effects that then have to be treated with more pharma All right drugs are yeah, I mean the basis so So you gotta take this drug but then you gotta take this drug to fix the side effects from the first drug you took Yeah Yeah, man Caused massive mayhem for the next until until trumps out of the picture 100% Well, it's funny too because even going back to our intro conversation. I was gonna put it in it Put it in the headlines, but NBC actually just wrote out of an article Yeah, about how they're gonna take the military and their house you're talking about how they're gonna They are trying to maintain control of military over if Trump gets elected So they are legitimately saying out loud in the media NBC is saying that and they're presenting it as a good thing. They are saying that If Trump gets elected by the people of this country That there will be a military coup operation to remove him We'll link it so you guys have it. I was like I was going to include it But I was like I don't have the flows going where but yeah, dude, it's real shit. I know I got it's fucking treason dude They already did that they've already done the coup And now they're trying to say that Trump's doing a coup right you know, there was an article also Retweeted by Alex Soros that said Brazil survived a coup talking about Bolsonaro and how we can avoid the same mistakes that like Bro, yeah, these people are fucking fucks period Bolsonaro had 10 million people in the fucking streets bro Luna had zero The nobody voted for them. They cheated until the people of the world rise up and understand that unity's the only thing that's going to stop this from happening They're they're they're not going to stop they're not going to stop pressing. They're not going to stop cheating There is a fundamental difference of the game that we are playing between these communist people and everybody else Everybody else all the common sense people under like they are like This will all work out this so this so this is something something will happen It'll all be good it all and then you have the other side that's like literally standing on our fucking throats waiting for us to die They don't give a fuck they are not going to relent They're not going to stop they're going to cheat in front of your fucking face and then dare you to do something about it And until the common the other side the common people of the world who think logically and have common sense Come together and say we're not going to fucking tolerate this They're going to continue to do that. There's a fundamental difference between the game. It would be like What brother thing? No, it would be like this It would be like if I went out on the football field with fucking seven guys And we went out and on the football field was the University of Alabama And we're all like yeah, they're not going to hit us They're not going to fucking hit it and then they fucking crush us bro and they break our backs That's what we're dealing with And by the way, where the fucking guys on the field be like they're not going to do that They're not going to do that when they have consistently shown that they will do that And so dude the common Pro freedom common sense community of this country and all the countries in the world Needs to come to their senses of what they are dealing with in the game that they are playing They will crush you. They will kill you They will ruin your life They will take everything from you and they are not going to stop until they get their way And until people understand that and start playing the appropriate game they will continue to lose That's reality That's correct. We're playing a different game than they are playing and they are playing the game of We will do whatever we fucking got to do and we're playing the game of We're morally better and we'll take the high road and it'll all work out because god loves us God doesn't reward people who sit on their ass Okay, God rewards people who do do shit All right There's nobody there's nobody that ever want a conflict because they're better people That's not how fucking conflicts are one conflicts are not one business is not one because you're a good person They're one because people take action and they execute and right now the communists of the world the globalists of the world They are executing they are taking action and they don't give a fuck if you notice and they will take everything from you If you don't if you fucking let them and that's where we're at we're playing a different game than they're playing That's it's that's simple Guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think on this first headline Before we get to our headline number two Let's move on over to the comments got some good ones I've got a couple of them here actually for you. Oh, yeah, so this first one comes from at Nick Razinger 4645 he says I find it refreshing to know that Andy is not forsella. Oh Nick Nick come on here. Why DJ's jokes I know you did I know you did and then this one comes from zero gambit CW2HT Hey, by the way real America freedom gear has a drop this Wednesday at seven o'clock on the website real america freedom gear.com Go go to the fucking website. This this comment. I like this comment to you from zero gambit CW2HT say We should call it that the big show. Yeah, the big show a lot of comments on that. Yeah, a lot of comments um For those of you don't know what the big show is the big shows where we take Violent criminals and pedophiles and we put them on pay-per-view weekly and we run them through the wood shipper Disect them on public TV to give them the Braveheart treatment Cut their dicks off stuff them in their fucking mouths and then take all the money from pay-per-view and give it to the families that they hurt I think that's a fair thing. Yeah, the Retribution. Yeah, so that's the that's how we're going to fix the system the big show. Yep Tune in to it's not quite as extreme as the purge the purge comes next. Yeah Yeah, big show man. Oh, that's gonna be oh dude. That'd be great Um, but this final comment man. I wanted I wanted to put this out here because you know guys it really comes down to you guys sharing the show Um, and we definitely appreciate we see it. We know the message is getting out there Um, and it is refreshing to get messages like that um like this next one. Now this message comes from at Andrew Uh, Carmona 1056 it says The message is reaching far and wide y'all my brother recently took me to a pizza joint in the city When I overheard a gentleman a few tables away talking about the show me being me. I said out loud. Hey, don't be a ho And to my surprise there were multiple people that called back share the show It feels more than relief relieving to know that multiple people just in the pizza shop alone Uh, live up to the same beliefs and standards that you teach of and speak of thank you for what you do Know who pizza shop. I love it. It's talking awesome. Hey, man Real talk like I just gotta say this because you know, I don't think people connect the dots But why would you support a company or support an individual who's remained silent for the last four years Not said anything about what's going on and continue to try to sell you shit You know, why would you support that person? Why would you support a person who hasn't been fighting for your freedom or your family Or speaking out against the bad things that have been going on. Why do you support those people in business Take a good look at the products that we offer take a good look at the products that the other people who are leading this offer There's very few of them and buy those products instead of the ones you're buying Okay, these other CEOs these other people they're fun. They don't give a fuck. They're showing their true colors by their silence They don't care what's going on. They don't care about you. They don't care about your fucking family They don't care about your kid's future and you're still buying their shit. Why? Why are you doing that? Why shit from companies who actually stand for the right things these are things that are important if we don't have economic awareness about where we spend our dollars then We're missing a big part of the play. So that's my little pitch. You should be able to connect those dots. I saw a dude I saw a dude, uh, you know Using another company's protein powder and I'm like I ask him very simply. I said what have they done for you? What have they done for your family? What have he spoke out for? What have they done? What would have what were they what they do during COVID? What they do during all this fuckery? Oh, they didn't say shit You see what I'm saying? Like if you want leaders, bro, you got to support those people So I'm just going to say that we got to be smarter about that And if it ain't me then support someone else who's fucking doing that by their shit But don't be blindly being customers of people just because you know Fucking you've used their product for this or that or this there's plenty of people out here who are speaking up and using their platform taking risks That quite honestly deserve your business more than these other people And they make better products too All every single product we fucking make a first form is 110% money back guaranteed show me another company does that Show me a single one Can you find it man Okay, fine, but yeah, man, we appreciate all you guys. We really do Thank you for being real-ass fans. Yeah, so let's get back to the cruise We have headline number two. This is a very interesting topic And when I saw this it reminded me of that Leonardo da Caprio meme. Yeah You know, I'm saying yeah, um, so let's dive into this this headline. This is a daily Daily wire headline it reads FBI arrest transgender man who threatened to kill transphobes Suggest ties to alt-right extremism extremism. I can't even fucking get them a mouth. What? Yes You read that right So let's dive into this so Yeah, what I Don't understand what they're saying Yeah, yeah So this they're saying that an FBI arrest a transgender man who threatened to kill transphobes But that that man is tied to alt-right correct So the transphobes are on the left Right, so people on the left who support trans are actually transphobes right Hmm, yep, well, that's some mental gymnastics So mental fuckery. Yeah, like That's like the Rubik's cubes of justification. Yeah Hmm, interesting very very interesting very interesting. Let's dive in the story a little bit So federal prosecutors on Friday charged an Oregon man who believes he is a woman For posting to a quote trans woman support group That he planned to go out and a quote blaze of glory after a search of his home found 27 guns and quote tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition What's wrong with that? Nothing wrong with that. That sounds a little light. Yeah, I mean I think you should have 28 sounds a little like to me, man Elizabeth West Was charged with making interstate threats based on the September 26th Facebook post to the group quote trans women support group Which came as he said he believed he was about to be fired and was tired of quote trans phobic assholes Quote, I'm too old to keep looking for jobs and I've had it up to here with being bullied by transphobic assholes I am left with no alternative for West wrote according to court documents I've been preparing for this moment for a long time at least then I'll be remembered Know you well. I have no family no friends so there isn't uh, so there really isn't any point living anymore Uh, the FBI did not arrest West that's what happens when you cut off your dick, right? That's what happens That's what happens people look at you and they say you're weird and you don't have no friends and then you end up thinking How my life gets so fucked up? Well, it started with you cutting off your dick. Yep. Should I move into the scalp? shouldn't done it Yeah, but here's the thing so the FBI did not arrest West after the September interview That was ultimately used to justify the charges instead The arrested him months later after checks of his social media exhibit at racial hatred towards black people immigrants and Jews His social media bio according to the court documents was quote a Nazi dominatrix from hell Who is tired of the blackening of America and Europe and ready to stand up to the black orcs and the Jewish wizards Now, why do you why why do you not like black people? Is that a moscow of other races appears to be heavily related to West's gender ideology West hatred of black people is says in court documents is because they often quote misgender him And a group of black men once physically assaulted him for immigrants The hatred was because he learned of an immigrant Oregon's public health care plan who got free transgender surgery While West would have had to pay for his own gender surgery So for months the FBI monitored his social media and questioned him about his racial views on January 9th After agents monitoring him were alerted of a gun purchase and executed the search warrant and arrested West The affidavit references quote far right terror white supremacy and alt-right extremism portraying the madman as a conservative ah, so wait So when he was just a trans dude who hated people because he was trans and they he couldn't assimilate into a normal population He was allowed to continue to operate his extreme viewpoints And potentially talk about shooting people and murdering people But the minute that he started talking about he was all he was left up until then okay Now who were all these shooters that have done all these shootings this last few years oh you got this I love how I love how you make the show so I naturally connect the dots No, it's not in unison bro. It's the ebony and ivory. Yeah, all right. Listen. That's right. We're driving ebony and ivory Go together and perfect harmony. That's us. Yeah, they wrote it for us just saying bro Like and not only not only the act of shooters, bro. Did you see this like you know leftist dominate the FBI top 10 domestic terrorists So the top 10 domestic terrorists for the United States. There's not one right ring alt-right Supermega not one That's bullshit not one. I have worked long and hard To earn a position on this fucking list Not one and damn not one Not shocking Not one. I don't know if I'm more shocked that I'm not I didn't make it or that it's all fucking lefties I'm actually not shocked that they're all on it dude. It's not what look at these people man. Oh, do there's some crazy people on here Yeah, they're all crazy all of them. Yeah, the FBI bureau has sounded the alarm to communist three black nationalists One anti-war activist and a vegan eco terrorists sounds like sounds like the fucking expendables The weird thing where it was like a lot of these people they all fucking like hijacked planes and booked it to Cuba Like a bunch of them black man George Edward Wright black man who was convicted of murder escaped from prison and hijacked a plane He pretended to be a reverend and hit his gun inside of his bible Is spanic man hijacked a plane flying from New York to Florida he demanded to be flown to Cuba So I got all these people are just down in Cuba, bro. Yeah, because it's communist down there no extra edition What's he got there? What is that? I don't like those scorpions. Yeah, I mean, they're all right. I like the B and T's being T's are better They're definitely superior a little the the sig the MPX that's a good one. Yeah, that's a good one But B and T's like B and T's up there. Yeah, that's for our spooky folks. Mm-hmm. Gucci blocks. Who shoots that B and T better me or you? Yep Uh, yeah, man, I'm just saying like Hey It's there, you know, it makes sense man, you know, just ask them. They'll explain to you. It's like it's just so crazy Like it's just like they wait bro So they allow these fucking people to go extreme terror and fucking shoot up schools and shit as long but then when the minute they start talking about Jews or blacks or fucking anything else They arrest them motherfuckers. Yep straight to go straight to Jim I thought it was interesting very interesting God tell us what you guys think that headline like go back to the headline. Yeah, let's let's think about like Let's think about how first of all How stupid First of all, man transphobic assholes look dude You guys try to force shit on people that they're not going to be If you were just polite No, I feel real dude if they were just polite and didn't fucking try to jam that like forcing people to use specific bro, you're a dude those dudes did not misgender you you are misgendering you That is the whole problem here you walk around your six fucking three two hundred fifty fucking pounds And you you dress like a little child you don't dress like a woman These guys never dress like women they dress like little girls What do you think that means? Why would you as a grown man where a women's outfit but instead of wearing a woman's outfit You're wearing a little girl's outfit. What is that? No or you know they're dressing like rainbow bright You see what I'm saying bro like they tell on themselves if you pay attention So first of all you're the asshole Okay, second of all they didn't misgender you you misgendered you you're a dude wearing women's clothes And if you're a normal person who would like to wear you you're a guy you want to wear women's clothes If you act like a normal human being you're treated like one And yes people are gonna look at you weird because you're fucking weird Dude, I'm sorry It's abnormal. What's the definition of what's the definition of weird What is it You gotta go down past the picture of you Him and that dude at the fucking comment they're writing jokes together now Suggesting something supernatural uncanny. It's uncanny. It's uncanny. It's not normal You don't see it every day. You don't see a six foot three two hundred forty pound little girl That's why they like unicorns. Okay, cuz they also don't exist and then you're asking us to fucking pretend that that's not the case You tell me I'm like fucked up or bad if I don't yeah, I'm a bad person because I noticed that you're that you have a dick. Yeah, like This shit's absurd man. Listen dude. I'm sorry. I'm tired of it. Yeah, I'm fucking tired I don't give a fuck what you think and it's not homophobic. It's not transphobic. It's just the reality man Act like a normal human be cool and people will give you less shit if you are if you like bro trans people in their own worst enemies Because if they assimilate into culture and act like normal people instead of forcing everybody and demanding everybody and calling everybody a big it because they called you the wrong fucking Prona. It's an awkward situation man. You're standing in front of me and I know that you're a man And you know that you're a man and yet you get pissed off if I say bro like Am I online here? No, I'm just saying like to me. This is this is just awkward. It's an awkward thing so like You know Dave Shepelle has a great fucking joke about this. Did you ever hear his fucking segment on him look him meeting Jim carry It's fucking great. That's how I feel about trans people But it's the truth. He met Jim carry when Jim carry was playing Andy Kaufman, okay, and he's a he's a he's a I don't know what they call it But he's the kind of actor that immerses himself like a method. Yeah, a method actor, okay Think walking Phoenix is like that too a couple of these other guys. They're really good the picky blinder guy I don't know but Look dude So he meets Jim carry and Jim carries in the middle of this movie and and he's like fuck You know just plug the fuck a clip in here. Well, we don't have to watch it Just plug it in and watch it for yourself. Yeah. All right. Here it is And in this movie Jim carry was playing another comedian I admired the late great Andy Kaufman Yes, and Jim carry was so immersed in that role That from the moment he woke up To the time he went to bed at night. He would live his life As Andy Kaufman. I didn't know that when they said cut. Just think it was still Andy Kaufman so much so that everybody on the crew called him Andy. I don't know any of that I just went there to meet him and when he walked into the room where we were supposed to meet I screamed Jim carry And everyone said no Call him Andy We had to understand and then he came over and he was acting weird. I didn't know he was acting like Andy Kaufman Just like hey, how you doing? And I was like hello Andy now Hindsight how fucking lucky am I that I got to see one of the greatest artists of my time immersed in one of his most Challenging processes ever very lucky to have seen that But as it was happening It was very disappointed Because I wanted to meet Jim carried And I had to pretend this nigg was Andy Kaufman all afternoon And he was clearly Jim carry I can look at him and I could see he was Jim carry Anyway, I say all that to say that's how trans people make me feel Okay, you see that This is what this is the truth though. This is the truth. Did you hear everybody laugh? You know why they laughed because it's fucking true. It's awkward as fuck guys And if you're a trans person you do yourself some big favors by just being cool man Just being cool. Realize like dude. I'm not normal. I don't look normal And I can't expect the entire world to treat me normal. Don't dress like a little fucking girl If you if you're gonna you know what I'm saying like Dude, that's not biggest thing make a convention bro You go to Taiwan or something like that bro. You wouldn't be able to Well, I mean looks yeah, well, you know, those people are small and these people here are not small I don't even think it's about that bro. It is about that. It's just like it's not convincing You're not gonna go to fucking Taiwan look bro. You go to Taiwan. You see one of these they call them lady boys Okay, that's what they call lady boys or Benny boys. That's what they're called in fucking um In Thailand sing a foreign. Yeah, yeah, so but now let you know right up front to though. That's the other thing. Now let you know How do you know that? I damn it Here's the point. Yeah, the point is this uh-huh You you're you're like fucking Leia Thomas or when Michael Thomas or whatever the guy's name is the guy six seven or some shit Okay, man motherfucker Look at the minute. Do you look like a woman for real like do you really think you don't You know, bro, we're asking to we're at we're being asked to pretend and then and then if we don't pretend We're being called names and bigots and shit. It's man. It's not bigotry, bro You're asking us to lie to ourselves to what we know is true for your well-being That means that we are discrediting ourselves in our own confidence in our own belief in our own integrity To appease you and then we're also teaching you that you can get your way through bullying and then if we don't do it You say that you're bullied no you're bullying people and and you're crossing boundaries And then you don't like it when people say no I'm sorry. I'm one of those people and I don't have any hatred towards trans people unless you're fucking with little kids and doing that Fucking pervert shit you could exist you could be just like everybody else But I'm not giving you special treatment and I'm not giving anyone special treatment I don't care what race they are.

Well, are you yeah? No, well then what the fuck are you worried about? What I have a little bit. I know you are a little bit you are a little bit racist Yeah, you get what I'm saying though dude Hold on for real dude. Why why are people so fucking weak around this What the fuck is wrong with you all could they felt like I mean because it was like the feeling that it actually had power no No, no dude exactly Exactly ten years ago dude ten years ago if you got called racist bro and your life You might as well just go fucking kill yourself If you were a white dude and you got called racist and you got a group of fucking Carons on the internet calling you right you were done bro. You got fire from the job And that power is now exhausted. Yeah, it was exhausted because of all of the overuse overuse and the now We can't even identify real racism anymore everybody's racist. So nobody's racist. Yeah, if everybody's transphobic nobody's transphobic That's just that's just the way it is bro. Listen. I'm just to the point Oh fuck you. I don't fucking care. Yeah Like you know old people Get to that point where they don't give a fuck you understand like grand three. No. Yes. Yeah, or like yeah exactly like that Get off my mother fucking lawn bro That's where I'm at But see you know you don't want to figure it out. I was thinking about this because I definitely have that you know I have it. Yeah, like like my neighbor the neighbor guy was fucking fuck you man. Yeah fuck off. Mm-hmm Um I figured out why I'm like that at a young age because you know it usually takes people to like 70 to get to that point Where they're like fuck you a couple of diapers. Here's what it is. Well, here's what it is I could use some of those being real like all my rucks, bro You know what I'm saying like I get out there. We get far away.

Medis it was good for your brains good for a lot of shit bad for your bachelore You're bad for your toilet paper, but that's right So I finally figured it out because I've always wondered like why do I not give a fuck like an old person But I'm only like half the age Well, it's because I've worked that much in my life I've had enough hours put in because of business and dealing with human beings. Yeah, where my give a fuck is exhausted It's gone. You don't care. You're at that age. Yeah, I don't care anymore. Yeah, like fuck you. Yeah Feels good too. Oh with it, man.

I'm racist for pointing that for sure. There's no doubt about it. Um you are I am And and and what even that like I mean here's the more sinister part the really fucked up part about this whole scheme Um, and this is all been it's all in court bro. It's all in court Um, and that's how I got caught up because Nate the way is why foul for divorce And named fanny will is in the divorce as far as the that's how it came out. That's how it came out. It's just recently. This is just recently That's how it came out Right But all that sounds like a mess It's it's it's it's a dark black mess. Yeah But uh listen But here's the the really fucked up thing about it right and because stuff is starting to come out to light document to being you know unearthed right There was a couple of invoices that were put out um this invoice is from uh May 23rd of 2022 And this is Nathan J. Wait the law offices of Nathan J. Wait and the the the the the the the guy she was fucking He charged and billed folked county and its taxpayers two thousand dollars To go to the White House to meet with the White House Council now this is Months almost a year before any charges were even announced And this guy is going on Fulton counties dying paid by taxpayers To go visit a White House council and it wasn't just one time they did it again In November of 22 another two thousand dollars go back Okay Did it again I thought they submitted the exact same invoice twice. No definitely invoices This was just in November Yeah, so this this this this chick as far as that I mean uh Go ahead. Yeah, I mean is and like I mean to me this actually proved some corroboration Why would you be meeting with your opponents? Why would you be meet the guy you're charging? Why would you be meeting with his potential opponent for elections And meeting with their their like Because you're trying to sabotage the election and ruin your political opponents. Why did you there? Did you guys extend the invite did the White House invite you? How did that work and oh shit How did that work? Yeah I think that was an order Just what that's called of you you should be here at this time Just saying and guess what taxpayers are paying for it Um, so she responds to all of these allegations um Let's see what she has to say Only Isn't The race car when they constantly think I need someone from some other jurisdiction in some other state to tell me how to do a job I've been doing almost 30 No lady that's that's not and here why are why is it that these people get up and blatantly lie like this and then black people for whatever reason Just go along with it. Well, I was gonna say this after the video But because look at their look at all the people's heads here None of these people are that dumb they all know what the fuck she did They all know she got caught and they're like yeah racism Well, not to mention that you know the so the money the almost three quarters of a million dollars It was paid out to make the way they then use that money to fund lavish vacations To Florida the DR the Caribbean That's all taxpayer dollars. This is our boyfriend Right So surprise that a diverse team that I assembled your child Can't accomplish extraordinary God wasn't it them that attacked this lawyer of impeccable credentials The black man our chosen's been a judge more than ten years Run a private practice more than 20 Representative that dude right behind her He ain't buying it. No That's only got her to buy it Black man Was acceptable when a Republican in another county higher and paid him twice the ring I'm so sick of hearing this shit about black this Okay, like bro you're a fucking criminal Just because you're a black doesn't mean you get to get away with with that's not why you getting picked on if it was anybody doing this She's no nobody's buying this I've seen this clip all over the internet bro And they're getting destroyed in the comments. Oh, yeah, I don't think even black people are like bro This is tired. This is causing more racism. This you all are causing you're gonna believe it You're making it harder for us like black people are starting to realize that these people are fucking fucks And by the way, they are correct these people these are the people who fucking instigate and propagate racism in this country Because they make everything about fucking race. No, you are a criminal. You did criminal shit You misused tax dollars. You're a corrupt fucking bitch and fuck you And if you say think back you're homophobic I don't think I don't think this guy was buying it either like look at his face. Yeah guy Now you know why because he's old enough to have been through the actual civil rights movement He understands this is all bullshit. Yeah, it's complete bullshit Um, but speaking of DEI highs because that's what the fuck she is Did you see this FAA bullshit Biden's FAA is actively right? So you were serious about getting racist. Oh fuck Fuck yeah, this is a little bit Dude, it's all right every now and then you know what I'm saying well, it's like 13% of the time would you fly Hahaha Would you fly on a fucking plane? This is a real question answer in the comments Doesn't matter what your race is Would you fly on a plane Because someone was giving the job Because they like to have sex with a certain other kind of person or They happen to be a certain gender or they happen to be a certain racial background. Would you fly on the plane if that was the criteria for the pilot to meet? Nobody would. I'm not flying with a black pilot at all. Dude shut the fuck up. That's it, Andy, we get on the jet and there's a black, I'm getting off. Don't trust him. You're such a liar. Anyway, that's, I don't, the point is, it shouldn't matter what your gender is or what your race is. Oh, just don't fucking crash. Yeah. As long as you fucking can pilot the mother fucking plane bro. So let's ask some real questions of the people and I want some answers in the fucking comments here. Would you fly on a plane if the pilot was chosen based upon their gender, their sexual preference or their race? Would you have a surgery if the surgeon was chosen off their gender, their sexual orientation or their race? What would you? Yes or no? And if you say yes, you're fucking idiot. See, that's the problem with this thing, man. Like, you know, like, because there's a thing, like you can all the people that say yes to that should all go live in their own fucking work. Bro, you guys can have California. Fucking have it, man. The weather's great. The weather's great. You guys can have it. You can have it. You can walk around the street with your dirty fucking drug needles and the feces in the street. And your Starbucks pay for straws. And none of your shit will work because you promote people based upon what, what, who they like to fucking, what race they are versus a candidate or the job. You guys can have that. You can have California. And everybody else that lives in the real world will fucking continue to operate. You know, bro, like it's funny. You know, people get on planes. People get on planes. I just hope this plane gets there safely. You know, now they get on their fucking. I hope my pilot's not gay. Bro, bro, listen, dude, I'm going to tell you this. Like, dude, this is going to sound, this is going to sound totally fucking, I'm going to tell you this. I haven't flown fucking commercial since like 2013. Okay. If I got to a point where I had to fly commercial again, I'm fucking driving. Like that is real shit. I'm not flying anywhere. There's no fucking way bro. There's no way. And in fact, the fact, bro, the fact that this has become an actual thing. Now they're going to have to do something corrective to get the trust of the people back, meaning like, I'm going to have to see your fucking scores, bro. Like I'm going to have to know like where'd you fly? Like what, you know, what's your scores? Like, oh, yeah, dude, just look in the cabin. Oh, okay, we're good. He's straight white guy. We're good. You know that motherfucker passes test. But bro, the extent. I laugh, but you know, it's funny. I'm not, it's not that funny. Bro, listen. It's not that funny, motherfucker. It's going to be funny when motherfuckers are crashing and the fucking sky is bro. And people are getting their limbs, you know, they're right limb instead of their left limb, fucking amputated and shit. Like, I think I'll be funny. Yeah, bro, I'm telling you, yes. By all female engineering crew. Did you know that? Did you know that? No, yes. The door, did you see the door that flew off that airplane like a week ago? The motherfuckers that designed it was an all female team. I didn't make it up, man. It's fact. You can be mad at me all you want. It is what it is. I will turn this plane around. I've just said, and I do, and I'm, listen, I'll say this. There's probably a whole bunch of females that are great engineers and could have fought. But if you're putting people because they're female and not because they're skilled, and this is crazy. Now you're understanding what companies have had to deal with for the last fucking 15 years. Because there's been a mental social pressure to promote people based around things other than, are they good for the job? You know, like, dude, I used to post pictures on Instagram and it'd be like four white dudes in the comment. And this is, you know, the comments would be, oh, so you only hang out with white people. What are you talking about, dude? So I got to start thinking about this in every, you know, I have to be intentional about it. Dude, what's that is exactly, dude, that's racist. We don't take a picture. Do you want to come in real quick? Yeah, right. Stay in the picture. So we don't get yelled at. Like, that's racist, bro. We shouldn't be thinking about race. I'm not even listening to the picture because you're listening. Listen, dude. Listen, and there's a, there's a, there's a segment. We have to decide what we're going to do. Real talk. Okay. Are we going to say we are a country of people from all different backgrounds and all different races who unify and come together over the content of their character, how good of people they are and what they believe in terms of American culture. Are, are we going to be those people? Are we going to be what America was founded to be? Are we going to be this amazingly diverse country that provides the greatest technology that the industry, all these things that we've been in the past that we've let slip through our hands? Are we going to be that? Or are we going to be a country where black people run around saying, I'm proud to be black. It's my greatest asset. Asian people do the same. Indians do the same. Women do the same. And then white men say, I'm fucking proud to be white and fucking fuck you because like dude, white men are the only people that can't say that. Can I fucking say it? Because you're not white, you don't understand that. And by the way, I don't even fucking think that way because I've never been allowed to think that way. I've always believed the message of Martin Luther King, whether you guys say he was Marxist or whatever, what he fucking said, I believe. Okay. Regardless of what he did, regardless if he was an adult or whatever you guys all accuse him to be, I don't give a shit. I don't care what the fuck he did. His message is what I believe America should be. That's the truth. We should not be judging each other on our color. We should not be judging each other on anything other than are we fucking good people or are we not? Is it good versus evil? And the alternative where every social movement is taking us, we're taking us to a point where white people are going to have to start saying, no, I'm a fucker. I'm proud to be white and if you don't like it, fuck you. And then we have this situation where everybody's fighting like, you know what I'm saying? And dude, there is white people that think that's the way it should be. And I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that. I think we should be able, because what has it gotten there? Hold on. I think we should be able to celebrate each other's cultures and say, hey, this is really cool. Black people have this. White people have this. Asian people have this. Indian people have this. And we should be able to celebrate all those things without, you know, taking it to serious where we could tease each other and still get along for the common good of what we're trying to create. You know, and people say, well, that's easy for you to say, because you're white. Hold on. I'm the only, I'm part of the only racial dynamic in the last fucking 40 years. It's been legally able to be discriminated against. If a skilled white male and a skilled black male or a skilled black female or a skilled female is all in the same, the white guy doesn't get the fucking job. And that's legal. That's been legal up until recently. It's still legal. She's not legal on college campuses. So if we're going to talk about who's actually been discriminated against, I'm 44 years old. That means for my whole life, it's been that way. Okay. So let's be fucking real about where the discrimination is and isn't the discrimination is legal against white people. It's not legal against anybody else. And it should be illegal for everybody. So, you know, we got a, we got a decision to make about where we're going to be as a country or we're going to let these fucking communists divide us all up and make us think that our greatest asset is the fucking shit we were born with, which is our skin color, which is ridiculous. That's a ridiculous statement. Like if you're biggest claim to fame is you're proud of being what you were born as. That's a pretty low fucking standard, bro. Real talk. You were born with that. And that goes for every race. So we can need to be that kind of place where we can all fight and argue about who's this or that and fight for equal rights and this and go through all this shit that we've already figured out. Or we could go to what Martin Luther King's message was regardless of what you thought of him as a fucking person and say, dude, content of character, different cultures, celebrate each other's cultures, be friends, tease each other a little bit, get along. We're on the same team. It's called the American team. Those are the two ways we can go. And only one of those past produces a strong country under our system of how we do things here in America. The other path will eventually be conquered for sure because we're too busy fighting each other over shit that honestly in my opinion is irrelevant shit. Like we are Americans, we are fucking human beings. If you're not an American, you're still part of the human race. And we have two segments of the human race in my opinion. One is tyrants and two is regular people. And if we started looking at it like that, the tyrants would cease to exist. Anyway, don't fucking fly. You know, severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. That's probably what? FAA, that's who they're hiring now. Biden's FAA is actively recruiting people with severe intellectual and they're trying to destroy the country, dude. We're on the street as they reached out to that one lady for hire. Bro, shut the fuck up here, man. Is that a real headline? Bro, yes, it's on the website. No, the actively. Yes. It's part of the DII inclusion plan. That's headlines from yesterday. Mm-hmm. Oh, it's a real headline. Federal aviation administration places priority on hiring people with quote, severe intellectual disability. That's part of its diversity and inclusion initiative. According to its website, the FAA claims quote, individuals with targeted or severe disabilities are the most underrepresented segment of the federal workforce. So under its people with disabilities program, the agency says it quote, actively recruits, hires, promotes, retains, develops and advances people with disabilities. The FAA targets the following disabilities as a matter of policy. Not hearing vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric, psychiatric, dwarfism. No, psychiatric disability and dwarfism. Not psychiatric, dwarfism. Oh, my bad. This is the act of destruction in the United States of America and its infrastructure and our ability to travel and fucking everything. How? I don't believe anybody's with this shit. No. I think they've got us all fooled, bro. I don't think anybody's with this shit. If we walked around real talk and fucking asked any human being these basic questions, like, would you do, would you fly in a plane with that? Would you get surgery like that? Every single fucking human on the fucking earth is going to say no. Mm-hmm. I think they have us all fooled, bro. I think they've used the internet and technology to create a big enough bot network to make it appear like there's far more of them than there are of us. I don't meet anybody in real life that would fucking say, like, even the most liberal person I know and I know some fucking pretty ridiculously liberal people. They would not agree with that. Like, this is their... People got to come together, dude. They got to stop this shit. This is a big deal, man. Like, real talk. Like, what is this? Why are we doing this just to do it? Like, where... I want to hear the justification of this idea. Where has... At what level is it a good idea to do any of this? For what reason? What are we doing? This is for people's feelings? I'm apparently... Hold on. Real. I mean, it's serious. Is this for people's feelings? So they feel important? Would it... Or are they... Like, I'm asking you guys. No, I don't know, man. Like, is this... Or are they... When they say, like, we're looking for intellectually, you know, fucking damaged people, right? Like, are they trying to like get the first... Intellectually fucked up human to be a pilot? It could be for like, cleaning purposes or something. Like, not flying a plane. Well, you can't fly a plane. Yeah. But I'm just saying, where's the idea... Is... When they say inclusion, is that... Like, who feels good there? The people... So what we're doing here is we're continuing the participation trophy mentality from these people's youth. Is that correct? So we're taking people who weren't good enough to get in the fucking game and we're propping them up so they feel better in society. But now we're doing this instead of like, with little league fucking T-ball. We're doing this with like, flying an airplane. Is that... Am I understanding this correctly? That's my read on it. Okay. Well, all you fucking moms... All you fucking moms that fucking root it for this shit, fuck you. Look at our fucking world now because you fucking people, bro. Fucking... Oh, my kid deserves to play it. You don't practice with your kid. You don't fucking play catch with your kid. You put your kid on a fucking video game and they can't understand why he's fat and uncoordinated and can't hit a fucking baseball. Should've done really. Yeah, and we're not giving him... He's not getting... What's... Are we gonna do this for the major leagues? What are we fucking doing? So are we gonna fucking... Are we gonna take someone with Down syndrome and put them on an NFL football field to make them feel good? Let them fucking play, let them get killed. Would you do that? Would you guys be okay with that? Would you be okay with the fucking... With a fucking... You know, all the basketball teams out here having to fucking include a five foot six wide dude for inclusion? Are we... Is that okay? We gotta play it. Because if we're gonna do this over here, we gotta do it over here, right? We got no equity and inclusion in this country. It just hasn't been proper. Listen, motherfucker, you earned equity. Equity has earned. Okay, I've been doing this 25 fucking years. Nobody gave me fucking shit. I bled for this. And all of you, and anybody out there who's fucking entitled and says, you got it this, you have no idea, bro. You live in my shoes for one day with fucking crush you. You would crush you. This idea that somehow certain people have got this fucking easy ride or this free ride or this fucking matter, this bullshit. It's a bullshit idea. Joe Rogan put in a gazillion hours into his life. These people you fucking admire that you think are successful. They've put in a gazillion hours while you were fucking off and you were fucking drinking and smoking crack and fucking, you know, fucking eating fucking food and fucking playing video games. Those guys were fucking dedicated to their fucking craft, bro. I'm sick of this fucking diminishing of people's achievements because of some sort of fucking quote unquote privilege. If I had a privilege, you wouldn't take me 25 fucking years. I'm fucking tired of it. It's fucking insulting to people who have actually built shit and worked their ass off and sacrificed their whole life. You know, dude, I take it personally. I'm sick of my accomplishments being diminished because other people fucking won't get their fucking fat ass off the fucking couch and then say somehow they got fucking fuck. You didn't get fuck, bro. I did things that you weren't willing to do. That's it. I wish there was fucking cameras around my entire life for the last 25 years because I could promise you it's a movie that you wouldn't be able to watch. You wouldn't be able to watch it. That's how fucking brutal it's been. And to be sitting here and fucking saying, these people deserve careers because they fucking are this or that? Now, fuck you. Work on it. You earn your fucking skill set. You fucking do the work. You put in the work. You become that skilled. Then when the opportunity comes, you fucking take it. Nobody's been given any opportunities around. Like it's not opportunities given. No, opportunities are not given. They are taken and they are not lost. They are seized by people who are willing to do things that you just aren't willing to do. That's how opportunities happen. They do not get awarded by some opportunity award fairy. Like these are people who fucking take them. And if you want opportunity in your life, you're gonna have to get skills set and take the fucking opportunity. Nobody's coming to give it to you because you know why they're valuable. And you know what people don't do is give valuable shit away. They fucking take it for themselves. So if you want shit in your life and you want opportunity, you have to be willing to fucking get the skills necessary and go fucking take it. And if you lose an opportunity, it's because you didn't have the skills and you weren't willing to do what someone else was willing to do. And that is the way it fucking works. That is natural order, that is reality. That is the way it's always worked here. And I'm tired of this participation trophy generation fucking bullshit. To say somebody deserves a fucking job because of their fucking gender or who they like to have sex with or what their race is is insane. That's what I'm saying. What's the history? Like how do those typically turn out? How does that work for people? Horley. You know what I'm saying? Like when you just given the, like how does it work? And again, if we're going to do this, let's make a decision as the collective of what we're going to do. Because just like I'm saying, we can either be this kind of America where we don't see race and we work together and we love each other's cultures and appreciate the culture or we can all fight about which one's better. And then in that case, why do people get to fight too? So we can all do that or we can all do this. Would you ever want to let me know? That's what the fuck we should do. And in this situation, when we're talking about, you know, participation trophy type shit, are we going to do it like that? Are we going to do it like this? You see what I'm saying? Let me know what the rules are. Fuck. Because I'm tired of the rules being one side of it, bro. I'm tired of the rules being fucking all these double standards. I'm a fucking bullshit. Guys, jump in on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think. But that being said, man, let's close it out. We got our final segment of the show. As always, our thumbs up or dumb as fuck. This is what we're bringing headlines in. We talk about it and get one of those two options. And our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads, I try to help people. Man on a mission to insulate pipes for seniors, disabled neighbors ahead of freeze. To be honest with you, I don't know. I like helping other people. So in spring, Texas, in a world of bad news, it's refreshing to meet someone like Josh Ubein. The spring Texas man is about as regular as a Texan man can get. Hopping out of his pickup truck and work boots and a car heart jacket to the eye, he seems like just another guy. But it's what's beyond the eye that makes Josh anything by the regular person. On Friday, Josh made a simple post on Facebook offering to help any elderly neighbors in his neighborhood of spring insulate their pipes ahead of the big, arctic blast coming Saturday evening. Little did he know that message would have his phone ringing and vibrating every since he pushed post gauge. So how did you come up with this idea? Josh Ubein said, quote, to be honest with you, I don't know. I like helping other people. And that's exactly how he spent his day and will be spending his weekend. Josh has a stock pile of pipe insulation that he picked up last year after a freeze came through Southeast Texas quote, so we have a farm. When you have a farm, you have a lot of pipes. And a lot of like water lines said, Ubein, a lot of supplies already sitting out. So it wouldn't do me no good sitting over there. Dozens upon dozens of senior citizens and disabled neighbors took Josh up on his offer. On Friday alone, he insulated the pipes on five homes. He has a list of 40 more to go. And the list just keeps on growing. Thankfully, he picked up some help along the way. Quote, he wanted to go around helping people fix their faucet, the hose outside said, said, Isaac Hakeem, who's better known as the lemonade guy. And I was like, you know what? I might as well close out my lemonade stand and come along and help him see who can help. Together, they've been crisscrossing town to help make sure seniors who wouldn't have another way to protect their pipes have a fighting chance against the frigid code. Here's the original Facebook post. I'm a view bank and some pictures that he posted along with Isah Hakeem, who's been helping them. Yeah, that's cool, man. That's what's up, dude. That's what America's about. Fucking help each other. And by the way, if you're listening on audio, guess what? One of those guys is white. The other guy, guess what he is. Oh, he's black. Do you think they're sitting there arguing over who's fucking race is better? Or do you think they're just working together to get a fucking job done? Holy shit, this isn't complicated. And they don't look like they went to fucking Harvard. Okay, so like, I'm just saying, this is a simple concept. What I'm saying here is simple. What we're saying here is simple. It's fucking very easy, dude. We're all fucking people. We're all trying to be good. We're all trying to do good shit. I'm so sick of all this shit, dude. This race shit, this first shit. This, I get a pass because I'm this or that. No. And anybody who's with that, bro, you're fucking wrong. I don't think anybody's even with it. Now, this is reality, bro. This is the real world. That's what the real world looks like. Every day and twice on Sunday, man. Yeah, so thumbs up on this, right? Yeah, for sure. Sweet. Yeah, well guys, Andy, it's all I got. Man, I got a lot more. It's fucks wrong with everything, dude. Like for real, like what is this? Like think about how insane this shit fucking sounds. Like when we actually talk about it. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like here we are, bro. How, how, how, what's the anniversary today on Martin Luther King's death? How many years? What do you look at me for? I'm not waiting for me now to look it up. Why are you paranoid? Oh, he died in 68. So how long ago was that? 56 years. 56 years, almost 60 fucking years later, bro. Yeah. We're sitting here talking about the same shit. How about the same shit? That's what they want us to talk about. To get us off the fact that that they're through what it looks like. Yeah, and to get us off from the fact of what they're doing to us. This is why they don't want unity. This is why they will divide, they will create as much racial tension as possible in any way possible, including blowing out of proportion, certain crimes, including, you know, creating resentment amongst the races by giving certain races privilege over other races. That shit should not exist in 2024 America regardless of the race. I'm fucking over it, dude. I think people are too. Anyway, don't be a hub. Tradition.
