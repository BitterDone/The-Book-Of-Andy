We're gonna speculate on what's true and what's not true and then we're gonna talk about we the people and what we have to do to solve these problems going on in the world. Now I'm gonna skip all the rest of the stuff because this is the middle of the week but I am gonna remind you that we do have a fee for the show of the fee is not monetary. You don't have to give us money now you do ask a lot about how to support us the best way to support us is to go into your local convenience store into your local grocery store and buy yourself one of these amazing first form energy drinks maybe a first form meat stick. Little protein bar get yourself moving in the right direction alright but outside of that that will be the only ad that you hear that's not really an ad just a personal recommendation. We're probably the biggest show in the world that doesn't run ads guys I finance the show out of my own pocket. The reason I do that is because I don't want to have to answer anybody what I can should and I shouldn't say. So in exchange for that I ask very simply that you help us grow the show we talk about all the stuff we're not supposed to talk about we always deal with censorship issues shadow bands traffic throttling and all the other BFs that these people do so I need your help I need you to share the show there's a lot of people that listen to the show that don't share the show and I can't figure out why that is but I'm asking you to please do us a solid and help us grow the show by sharing it alright so if the show may be a little bit more interesting. So I'm sharing it alright so if the show makes you think if it makes your life it gives you a new perspective if it's information that you think needs to be heard do it's a solid and share the show alright don't be a whole show show alright what's up I really also harassing your local convenience store we'll get those products in that's right yeah they don't have them go ask them what the fuck

sideline moment during the red raiders win over Arizona on Saturday mm-hmm in the fourth quarter of the game the wild claps the wild cats were up in the fourth quarter of the game the wild cats were up 19 to 18 with five minutes remaining after a play Arizona I receiver Devon Hyatt crashed out of bounds and into the cheerleader yeah this is a great video now the cheerleader got up faster than the

coming back from Cali on the on the plane right home and like I watched it and I'm like this is complete like horseshit yeah well and I but here's a good thing it's great because the pool need a little fighters they're going to be completely unprepared they think that that's what is going to be like yeah you know so that's fine but yeah let's get a tour headlines man we got a lot of stuff to cover today as always remember if you want to see any of these articles these links pictures videos go to andyfacela.com you guys can find the mall link there in the episode with that being said hey for those of you guys to take everything we say serious this isn't reminder that half our show is comedy educational purposes only fuckers entertainment value only yeah let's get into it I love how people try to take jokes that we make and turn them into serious issues yeah okay might have to cover those headlines yeah all right let's go hell on number one let's dive into it obviously the big talk at the time of the day it's obviously impacting us it's coming it's happening it's a it's a big deal hurricane Milton all right let's dive into this a little bit there's some interesting things happening here and I want to pre you know what's the way I'm looking for help me Brian I want to prime you say prime I want to yeah I want to I want to I want to prime you guys what I want to fluff you guys I want to fluff you guys up what you're just you're fluffing them give me a sin in them for fucking prime fluffin I don't want to fluff I don't want to fluff anybody I want to it's a sitting in for prime fluff no not that prime you Bosnian what the fuck like I want to I want to I would like I want you guys to know something all right when it comes to this stuff again like we we we spend hours diving into this and we make sure we do our best not to just though bullshit up here right like we try to do our best to put verifiable proof and evidence and facts as we call them dots in here so just keep that in mind as we go through this topic okay so Hurricane Milton expected to be so powerful it could change Florida's coastline okay that these are the headlines that are coming out it's expected to be so ferocious it will cover nearly every beach on Florida's West Coast and forever change the Sunsign State's coastline experts have warned at least 95% of Florida's West Coast beaches are forecast to be indated or continuously covered by ocean water when the hurricane predicted to be one of the strongest ever is expected to make landfall Wednesday as many still we cover from lane the US geological survey now not only are they dealing with a hurricane down there okay apparently this storm is also throwing out tornadoes left and right if hurricane Milton wasn't bad enough monster storm is spawning tornado super sales to wreak havoc on Florida okay so they got these super sales going on it's a category four storm right now that's spending northeast at 17 miles an hour about 190 miles off the coast of Tampa Wednesday morning with maximum sustained winds of 145 miles an hour now the mayor of Tampa she did an interview with CNN she had this to say let's check this out this is literally catastrophic and I can say without any dramatization whatsoever if you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas you're gonna die wow I mean that is an incredibly blunt message and I know you have a lot of experience dealing with these storms you don't say something like that lightly mayor I've never said that and 10 to 12 foot surge I mean if this takes a jog to the south that's going to save us from the storm surge but it stays on the track that it's projected to be on right now or if it goes a bit north would be even worse some of the predictions are saying that panellist county to the south of us the entire county is going to be underwater so this is something that I have never seen in my life and I can tell you that anyone who is born and raised in the Tampa Bay area has never seen anything like this before people need to get out and your message is just this isn't survivable this if we have that predicted storm surge it is not survivable I can I guess you what that means for the general hospital there in Tampa because it's on a bit of issue she said it three times you're gonna die it's not survivable what does that mean you're gonna die it's going rain is pretty bad geez all right now just for context okay this is a picture for those listening to audio come check it out this is a picture yeah if you listen on audio you need to go over there and subscribe and watch some of these on video I think you guys like it there's a lot of context that you guys could get that would help but this is a picture of the southern United States it includes Florida the golf that is a picture that's hurricane Katrina I think it's huge massive this is Milton holy shit okay same I tried to like you know line it up about the same yeah okay Katrina Milton you can't even see Florida dude right it's massive yeah it's absolutely massive now obviously people are preparing for the worst a lot of people have evacuated as they've been instructed they're talking 12 to 15 foot swell storm surges that are coming in and we've been covering a lot of the ongoing community level the work that's been done at the local communities of just awesome Americans that are pitching in coming together uniting to help each other out we have been getting in a dated with a shit ton of emails from our people from listeners from from from people in this community the listen to the show every single day doing the work out there in the community that I just wanted to show quickly here this is one of the emails that we got in this is from Matthias he says hey Andy not a question but I wanted to share a picture with you a friend of mine Cody Kent strap this flag to the back of his goose neck trailer loaded down with supplies headed for North Carolina the flag flew proud all the way from Iowa thanks for everything you do and literally changing the lives of our friend group most of us have now complete at 75 heart with over 300 pounds lost combined your friends from the wit Iowa trying to live the standard and you submitted this picture man that's awesome it's fucking it's it's cool man that's awesome it's fucking cool it shows you that people are taking the message to heart yeah it's about action it's not about who I'm gonna vote for or this or that it's about changing the world through our example you know that's amazing it's fucking awesome I mean this guy guys this is just one yeah I got a lot to you got in the shit ton of tags DM I mean it's awesome guys now one of the things that we've been talking about but probably I think it was probably our most recent CTI we started diving into you know some people could call it tin foil right and I think on that episode we kind of concluded with like hey listen is this intentional we don't know right but they're definitely like the the results the actions of this government after all of this stuff is happening does not seem to be in the best interest of the people the delay in aid you know all these different things and I found this and I thought this was really interesting coming off of that conversation check this headline out here we go north Carolina officials change election rules in hurricane devastated counties that mostly voted for Trump fueling Republican election integrity concerns okay now we talk about you know these situations happening and how look above a deep state whatever you want to call it how they use these situations to their advantage this is a prime example okay let's dive into this little bit in the wake of hurricane halains path of destruction through the southeast including critical swing states like North Carolina state election officials have made adjustments to voting rules in response to the devastating impact of hurricane halaine the north Carolina elections board in a quote-unquote bipartisan effort passed an emergency resolution aimed at facilitating early voting in 13 counties severely affected by the hurricane notably all but one of these counties um buncom voted it's not buncom that's buncom why they why they spell it like that that's comb you just don't haunt read it right bun comb bun's correct I hate to live there well sorry guys if you live there it'd be but come this raises questions about whether the adjustments are truly about aiding displaced voters or if they are a tactical maneuver to sway the electoral landscape and favor of democrats so here are some of the the rule changes that they've implemented okay they've expanded expanded voting sites um so there's additional or modified voting locations will be made available to accommodate displaced residents they will be extending voting hours so polling places will have longer hours to ensure everyone can cast a ballot um and then there's this big one there's absentee ballot flexibility where voters can now submit absentee ballots to any counties election board rather than being restricted to their local board the deadline for requesting absentee ballots has also been pushed back to November 4th now what what day is the election on I think it's the fifth yeah so okay all right and then they also will be having an assistance team to help collect these absentee ballots now I think most people obviously okay like you know these changes on the surface they seem reasonable right there's a fucking hurricane you know like the polling places have shut down they're destroyed they're flat you know gone in the floods right like it seems reasonable on the surface right but there's something much more sinister here and I think that's the important parts are covered um Fox News Jesse Waters he waited in on the development uh during his show noting uh Hurricane Helene didn't just wreak having on people's lives it's going to affect the election waters introduced senior political correspondent Kevin Cork who detailed the major shifts highlighting how voters can now deliver absentee ballots to any county in the state um and how new poll workers will be recruited from various locations he says quote voters in those counties will have longer to apply for absentee ballots will be allowed to drop their ballots off anywhere in the state not just in their home county uh there also will be teams uh there will be sent to storm relief centers to help register more voters and you guessed it collect more ballots that Cork what's more the county boards will also be able to buy a part uh bipartisan majority higher poll workers from other counties and then move them all around the state to ensure there are enough experienced workers at each voting site we know if anybody paid attention to the 2020 election the ballots the absentee ballots the melon ballots that's how they were able to get close to these numbers uh where Trump was in these smaller places right because nobody expected it nobody believed it what they just did uh was basically made that a lot more possible to put the fake shit in there right because we don't know where it's coming from uh and not only you know there's not like they're just you know the surrounding county it's any county in the state could have an influx of absentee ballots and nobody would know and they're counting these things all right it's a major problem uh that does not keep the election secured um i think any reasonable person could look at that and like yeah that doesn't make the best sense it's a good idea does not work it's not what the people need um anything on that real quick i mean look dude you know i i'm i'm still a firm believer that all voting should be on the day of the election in paper ballots with evidence of the vote and citizenship huh and citizen yeah with ID like that's it super you know these people are people a lot of people don't understand there are initiatives that are being run internationally in europe in australia and other places with celebrity endorsements that are trying to register people to vote here in america so if people had some sort of previous american citizenship or some sort of uh affiliation with america they are trying to recruit voters who have either previously lived here or trying to live here to vote in this election with advertising campaigns abroad why would they do that it's insane yeah who do you think's funny that do you think it's the conservative side or do you think it's the communist side right it's insane so dude these people are all in on the cheat they're all in on voting uh having people who aren't tax paying citizens in this country who don't contribute uh who shouldn't be here vote and then they're trying to get people who aren't even here and have no interest in being here to vote to vote yeah that's insane man now now of course you know there's been a bunch of information that has been missed and dist around the internet um and uh good old Biden has started to address some of those fallacies that are being talked about um let's see what he asks to say this is a very interesting clip um and uh you guys tell me if he's if they're kind of telling on themselves and they're just using Biden to do it check this clip out there's simply no place for this to happen former president trump has led the onslaught of lies assertions have been made that property is being confiscated that's simply not true they're saying people impacted by these terms will receive $750 and cash and no more that's simply not true they're saying the money is needed to for the in that for this crisis is being diverted to migrants what do we ridiculous thing to say it's not true now the claims are getting even more bizarre it's like this out congressman marjorie tailored green a congressman with georgia is now saying the federal government is literally controlling the weather we're controlling the weather it's found ridiculous it's got to stop it's almost like this to earn no red or blue states there's one united states america where neighbors are helping neighbors volunteers and first responders risking everything including their own lives to help their fellow americans uh first of all nobody they voted for you is helping anybody so let's just say that secondly uh they're not they're just not everybody on the ground i'm into i've been in touch and donated with the multiple different groups they're all first responders they're all x military they're all police and those kind of people that give a fuck about our country and they're not the rainbow hair gender study fucking upper middle class white women uh who vote traditionally democrat they're on the ground voting it's all conservative it's all you know that side of it so your people aren't doing shit bro so let's clarify that uh secondly weather manipulation has been a thing for over 60 70 years okay it's been going on there's other countries that admitted openly china talks about it openly they ran operations in Vietnam to keep monsoons going and keep the rainy season going to to affect the war that this is all documented so there's like nine different ways because after we talked about it the other day i started really looking into it same do you got a bunch of shit on it i got a bunch of shit before i start talking just go ahead let's dive into it man because there's a lot of stuff happening we got these hurricanes you got north Carolina affected temples getting crushed um there's weird things i just want to say when he says there's one united states of america it's it's it's it's it's really rich coming from this dude who has done nothing but divide this country for the last four years no for the last 20 fucking years okay for him to stand there and say were united and were this and were neighbors taking care of neighbors motherfucker your people ain't doing shit okay that's real talk where where are these groups where's black lives matter where's uh you know all the specialized trans groups and the LGBTQ where is antifa helping all these people out it's not these are real americans he's right about it it's real americans helping americans your people aren't brought into that idea and you don't get to sit there being this probably not probably the worst president that ever existed in the history of our country and say that you're somehow uniting people okay you are giving them seven hundred and fifty dollars that's a fact and it is a fact that once their insurance claims come through they have to pay it back that's a fact too and let me read you a statement of what's actually going on from one of my friends just to give you guys some perspective on what is actually happening on the ground okay and i want to read you this i'm not going to say who it's from but i am going to read it because it's someone i know very well all right uh we are getting so much media attention that it's making her Kamala and Biden looks stupid as fuck because we are doing what they won't do we keep telling all the news outlets that show up exactly that so she's contacted the governor and told him to get this shut down so they can come in and look like the heroes we had a dozen or so police show up this morning we talked to them and explain what we are doing and how we have actual military guys on the ground running air traffic and this isn't just fucking joe bob's carnival they keep they talk to our guys and they said to keep going they were super cool i said okay thank you but and then he replies but we are hearing she's going to send feds in later this week i'm not sure if that's true or not the current situation is the governor is not happy with the nonprofit organizations and non-government organizations because of the possible black guy that he's receiving based on his response the Harris campaign is applying pressure to the governor because there's bad media coming out about them and their inability to truly respond to the space so he's getting the black guy from the operations on the ground as well as from the Harris campaign from the top luckily there's some good guys here on the ground that are working diligently to keep the space operational so that we don't shut down the civilian operations the belief of most of the special operations that are on the ground that aren't a part of the civilian effort haven't accurate assessment that is if civilian effort is to stop or may just slow down it will drastically disrupt our ability to deliver supplies in real time to the people in the mountains if that happens there is no knowing what the outcome would be but i can tell you it won't be good trump is sending down junior here in a few days so as of now we have some good coverage not sure what's going to happen just yet in the meantime all this is being done with volunteers and go fund me in private citizen work that's the true that's a guy on the ground who's been there the entire time that's crazy man it's crazy now onto this this controlling the weather thing okay because like i said it's there's some weird things happening all across the country right now you got wildfires in a Wyoming right now that have already burned through 75,000 acres with crews scrambling to save wildlife and communities i mean this is just one picture here from Wyoming all right you got that happening you got you got you got floods in the fucking desert right now in the Sahara to be specific desert is struck by its biggest deluge for decades with water filling lake that have been dry for 50 years after a rare massive rainfall out of nowhere you now have lakes in the middle of a desert now did some digging and did some research because it just doesn't make sense right like i remember this graph from like fucking kindergarten and they show it's called the hydraulic cycle right like the precipitation cycle and how rain starts right and like you know rain is rain and it goes in this fucking flow i'm sounding like homolo jesus um but it has to come from somewhere where the fuck does water come from in the day is desert to be able to precipitate right has to evaporate like i just started looking into shit man it is weird because i found i stumbled upon this pad okay this is an actual patent it's verified we leave the link for you guys on the on andyfursola.com it's an actual patent that was published uh july 9th of 2009 okay here's the full sheet now when you go to the inventors portion all right there's a nice little list here of people all right let's all this name there William H gates the third i'm like no i can't possibly be oh bill no it is bill gates is William Henry gates the third that's this guy who has this patent now you go into this patent it dives into a couple of different things talks about a method uh is generally described which includes environmental alteration the method includes determining a placement of at least one vessel capable of moving water to lower depths in the water the wave induced downswelling now the method also includes placing at the at least one vessel in the determined placement further the method includes generating movement of the water adjacent the surface of the water in response to the placing um and he has these maps with all these little dots this this is a real document guys like it this is real and that is the actual Gulf of Mexico by the way with all these vessel dots that are in the golf right um and in this when you dive into this patent it talks about a couple of very interesting things um weather management hurricane suppression hurricane prevention hurricane intensity modulation it goes in deeper saying because hurricanes and other tropical storms derive their energy from warm ocean water it is logical to harness the great energies of the earth's fluid envelopes to suppress or alter hurricanes or other tropical storms and or to employ the powers of motion within these envelopes over long time intervals to modulate at least one property of an envelope that is exploited a much shorter time scales and or much more limited spatial scales for energizing a hurricane now this has been talked about hold on do you even know the next stop do you know what the next start is do you know the biggest investor in real estate in Tampa Bay is do you know who's revitalizing Tampa Bay hmm yes black rock Bill Gates Bill Gates hmm interesting how would you get that many people that economy that infrastructure out no shit that's what I'm saying I mean like how would you do that in a very quick efficient way right and like I said this is not new bro the UAE they make it rain all the fucking time they literally started this thing called cloud seating over there right and then when they put too much fucking silver iodine in the sky uh it causes floods but they say it's not because of them cloud seating right like that doesn't make fucking sense uh or let's go back to 2018 when the director of the CIA wanted to have a little talk about geo engineering check this clip up another example is the array of technologies often referred to collectively as geo engineering that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change one that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection or SAI a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat and much the same way that volcanic eruptions do an SAI program could limit global temperature increases reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels this process is also relatively inexpensive the National Research Research Council estimates that a fully deployed SAI program would cost about $10 billion yearly as promising as it may be moving forward on SAI would also raise a number of challenges for our government and for the international community on the technical side greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany SAI to address other climate change effects such as ocean acidification because SAI alone would not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere on the geopolitical side the technology's potential to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp opposition by some nations others might seize on SAI's benefits and back away from their commitment to carbon dioxide reductions and as with other breakthrough technologies global norms and standards are lacking to guide the deployment and implementation of SAI and others that's interesting coming from the CIA director look bro yeah now last little piece on this is interesting because every time I found something then there was this other article talking about yeah I know we said that we could do this we don't do that it's not possible it's not that easy to do now you know it's interesting and every person I mean there was a there's a string of this every person that has come out and tried to say something about you know shit like this happening or the effects of the like the real effects of the environment you know what happens to the Mandy magically they probably die they fucking die like a Georgia county official dies after giving testimony about a hazardous chemical plant fire this happened in Georgia about a month ago you know this is all over the fucking news internet this this chemical plant that magically combusted since all of this shit into the fucking air cover the entire town right the guy who is a soil and water conservation district supervisor went to testify yesterday alongside other business leaders and owners and he was frustrated by it and he talked about the effects of what that fire was going to do this was a month ago guys stay with me and guess what happened after he was walked out of that hearing he fucking collapses in the hallway according to the Georgia House Democratic caucus 62 year old Johnson quote complaint of shortest of breath and subsequently collapsed in the hallway right after the meeting and one of the state reps who was also a nurse he had managed to CPR he was rushed to the hospital where he later died and guess what happened to that testimony Andy it's not released no plans to release it so it's very interesting that all these things are happening got patents filed from people who directly benefit at what point I mean at what point does this stop being a coincidence that the same fucking dude is involved in all of this shit he's involved in vaccines he's involved in uh the the WHO he's involved in rural economic forum he's involved in weather manipulation he wants to block out the sun who the fuck gave this guy the permission to play god with everybody else in the world at this point in time I think it's very clear none of this is a coincidence this guy is a fucking psychopath who's made more money than you know pretty much anybody on the planet with the exception of maybe four or five people and he's using that to pretend like he's doing us a big service and instead he's fucking the entire world up at what point is this man going to be held accountable for what he's doing okay it's not a coincidence it's not in our best interests it's not something that you know just happens naturally all right there's no coincidence in my personal opinion that this guy's revitalizing Tampa Bay and has talked about Tampa Bay and now all of a sudden we're gonna get a 15 foot storm surge right into the bay perfectly aligned people don't understand why the surge is going to be so big Tampa Bay is in a bay okay and it's closed on three sides and the way that the hurricane is swirling which is clockwise is going to push water up into the bay which is going to create a 10 to 15 foot surge which that's what they're saying not what I'm saying and if you've ever been to Tampa Bay you would know that the water is like three feet below the houses that means all the houses that means all the downtown that means all the shit is going to be underwater all right what better opportunity to insert my personal plan as mr. Gates then to you know say hey Tampa Bay just got wiped out by this coincidental event let's do this instead yeah they make I mean at what point are we gonna stop this shit and start calling this dude for what he is this guy is a fucking international tyrant criminal who is now creating situations that are horrible for humanity and he's doing it over and over and over again and it's the same group of people over and over and over again and for you guys to sit there and say oh whether manipulation is a conspiracy theory you're uneducated because they've been bragging about it for fucking 60 70 years they've used China talks about it openly they talk about it open they don't try to hide the shit they're like yeah we we we uh we kept the Bay Bay we kept the Beijing Olympics dry through our web weather manipulation program they it was in the fucking news okay if you don't believe me go look it up all right this is real stuff it's really happening they are doing it they talk about hurricane tensinine modulation do you think that means just turning it down or do you think that also means turning it up right do you think these people after all they've done over the course of time the course of history that we've watched them do over and over and over again do you think that they are above morally weaponizing the technology that they have to get what they want I think we all know that they're willing to weaponize the technology to get what they want and I would bet that between now and the election we see even more of this because the average person in this country thinks that that's a conspiracy they think that that's crazy shit they think that if you talk about weather manipulation you're you're a tin foil hat weirdo well remember guys we were tin foil hat weirdos all through covid we were right about all that we were tin foil hat weirdos through Ukraine we're right about that we were tin foil hat weirdos through black square we were right about that we were tin foil hat weirdos through fucking everything for the last five years and we've been right about all of it that's the truth and I'm telling you right now weather manipulations are real thing do I know for a fact they're doing it or not no because I'm not in the meetings but I'm also allowed to draw speculations and conclusions and offer my opinion and my opinion is this is awful coincidental considering we have an election in less than 30 days which is going to disrupt two major areas that are Trump areas and then also create a situation where the the areas are so destroyed that they have to be completely rebuilt in a new manner not dictated by the citizens of the area but by the people with the most money all right so yeah I mean look could it be coincidence could be do I think it is no I don't yeah I mean to me I think that's always been the common denominator with these situations is like and there may be why it's so hard for people to pinpoint because these plans these things that happen I'm calling it a benefit but a benefit to the cabals it checks a bunch of boxes off yeah COVID checked a bunch of boxes off of them right the vaccine checked a bunch of boxes off the black square checked like they all check a bunch of boxes off it's not like they're just doing this to gain one good fucking win it's wins across multiple different areas whether it be the voting demographic whether it be the grab on the fucking real estate yes it's multiple boxes they're winning yes you know I'm saying and that's been there's there dude anytime that there is a major catastrophe it's always the same group of people winning it's always the same group of people winning why is that at what point are people the general people going to be able to connect the dots you know once could be random twice coincidence three it's intentional now you can't tell me that these same people haven't been involved in literally everything right and all of the bad shit and all of the chaos all of this forcing of agenda 2030 down our throats the green deal down our throats the vaccine down our throats remember Bill Gates being on TV saying you're not going to have a choice to take the vaccine you guys act like you have a choice you don't have a choice well apparently we fucking do because I didn't get it and how much other people didn't get it I'm sick of these people thinking they can just push us around and do whatever they want because they made a lot of money I think this guy's like the ultimate like villain bro I think he's the fucking antichrist that's my opinion saying but like you know like like he has a villain story no bro he was bully growing up and yeah and he's never been accepted in coolest public and now you got money and he's making this payback yeah I think so too dude like he's never he's never been loved he's never been accepted in society he's never been celebrated as a hero and I bet on the inside of hit he's like dude what these people don't appreciate me I invented technology I did this no you didn't fucking Steve Wiseny I can benefit technology mother fucker and that's probably why he's so insecure because he didn't even invent the shit that he says he invented it it's crazy man yeah and then he goes around like this dude's the ultimate hack job like you you you created something that's not even yours not in reality you you and it's a it's an inferior product you're not liked by the public you've never been cool you've never been loved by the public and he inside of his inside of him thinks I should be the man look what I gave all these people they don't appreciate me and that's how I see that I really do see that this that is this playing thing those bro yeah doing thing those guys I mean his own wife fucking sees what's happening you know and dude did you see Elon call him out on the fucking Tucker interview oh to bro Elon goes about the Epstein list yeah Tucker goes he goes so what do you think this is he goes I think all the big celebrities are are backing Kamala because they know that Trump gets in the Epstein list is gonna come out and then he went on to name a couple dudes and then he was like and Bill Gates he said Gates is real worried about the Epstein list coming out and like dude you don't that's why his why his wife says in public that that's why she left because of the friendship that he had with Epstein so you know it's gonna come out it's at mainstream now and like I've been saying for years guys these people are gonna do everything and anything they can to not be held accountable for what they've been doing they're all in they're all in and we better be all in on protecting this country and getting it back that's reality because you you are insane if you think that they're going to announce on TV that Donald Trump won the election no doesn't matter what happens doesn't matter what how first of all everybody needs to vote if you don't vote you're a fucking piece of shit you need to get out and vote you need to get all your people to vote if you don't go out and vote and get all your people to vote you're a failure as an American citizen all right I don't care what your views are because the only chance this country has a surviving is if Trump gets in he's an outsider he's not part of the the the establishment that's what people can't understand they can't understand how how this dude is not like it used to be the left were like the rebels and they were like the fuck the man fuck the court and now they're like cheering for the machine fuck of the machine yeah in anyway the point is is that these are bad people and they're gonna do very bad things to make sure that they maintain control and power including the destruction of whatever they have to destroy that's the reality you know guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think how that being said let's go cruise some of these let's cruise the

says hurricanes are your October surprise we'll find out I don't think so I actually think there's I think there's I think there's something more coming I think I saw Hillary Clinton blame China for stealing wiretap information and talk about Kamala having some very negative information she's talked about it a few times now so what I actually think happened I think there's some information that these people have uh that is wiretap info or some sort of secret shit about Kamala that's gonna come out that they're trying to brace for or prepare for or like like what I don't know I mean I think they got her on video or camera saying some really fucked up shit about America so something that'd be crazy yeah well guys we appreciate you for being real ass fans keep liking commenting and subscribing and uh make sure you guys hit that bell notification and stay up to date with the latest episodes from real AF with that being said let's keep the screws moving headline number two um this one's interesting remember that video of Kamala during that 60 minutes episode that uh we were like that made no sense yeah right mm-hmm well it's interesting why it didn't make sense is because they were editing it they were editing saw that whole man yeah uh election interference fake news 60 minutes caught editing Kamala's nonsense of quencer with previous sound bite to make her sound coherent and normal video released this is the definition of election interference this great article from the gateway pundit uh reads apparently Kamala's interview with 60 minutes which much worse than we first thought fake news 60 minutes was caught editing Kamala's answers to make her sound coherent and normal in fact it was so bad that 60 minutes spliced her nonsensical answer and replaced it with a completely separate sentence she said earlier in the interview uh they cut Kamala's nonsense answer on Israel and replaced it with a completely separate sentence she said earlier in the interview mixing and matching questions and answers this isn't journalism it's fraud it is it's actually treason i mean you're lying to the american people about the reality about the reality of the biggest decision that they will make as citizens of the country which is not in their interest at all it's against their interest and you know it the collusion between big media and the democrats i mean you know we could sit here and say we something has to be done but honestly i think they're doing it for themselves they've their credibility is shit their viewership is shit we get more views the most of these networks do you know think about that they got billions of dollars in ad revenue behind them and they can't get more views because they're so biased that people just don't trust them and don't believe them that's crazy yeah it's crazy let's check this clip out so uh first is the actual way answer that she gave um and then second is what everyone else saw let's check this out but it seems that prime minister netanyahu is not listening well bill the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region but it seems that prime minister netanyahu is not listening we're not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the united states to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end now neither one of them made fucking sense all right but it is sickening there's the official transcript worked for word there um but you know everybody knows commas with that to your point if there is something that comes out about comola that'd be great you know i'm saying but like she's kind of destroying herself of course herself yeah um she went on uh i mean even social media is tearing apart right now she went on to even co bear um with a brand new accent did you see her did you see her in him try to drink a beer yes

i am then maybe you are listen you can be whatever you want Amy apparently i believe you know All right, now that wasn't the only interest in, you know, talking front of press Biden crashed a press briefing. Did you hear about that? No, you walk right in the fucking room and spread out some nonsense. To the point, that's like your grandpa comes out of his bedroom at 11.38 night at his underwear and starts just talking some shit. But it was bad because at the end, like he spoke for like 15 minutes, right? The audible all together, Biden spent about 15 minutes in the briefing room. As he exited a reporter asked whether he wanted to reconsider his July decision to drop out of the presidential race, Biden quickly turned around. Quote, I'm back in. The president quipped before finally departing. That was interesting. I'm in other news. Does news support for Comma? Ooh, triple X, baby. Triple X. Oh, the porn industry, of course. Yeah, porn industry launches at supporting Harris campaign. Yeah, of course. The porn industry has entered the 2024 presidential campaign with a $100,000 ad campaign targeting what it claims are proposals to ban pornography. The hands off my porn campaign will run in seven swing states with the hopes of convincing young men to vote for Comma Harris. What differences to make if they ban porn, dude? Only fans is making these girls more money than they made in fucking porn. It's true. Imagine jerking off and then you get the five second interview and it's fucking Comma. Oh, man. And you're like right in the bro. Yeah. Bro, you ain't seen that one yet? Yeah. This is the website for that campaign. All right. Don't let that control what you watch. Conserved as a planning to criminalize porn. Stephanie's mom's only 2.3 miles away. Yeah. Yeah. I will fight to protect my right to privacy in my own home. Yeah. And you can donate fuck out of here. You can come check your guns. Yeah. You can talk about privacy about porn. Yeah. That's for sure. Yeah. No shit. No shit. You're a come look at my guns, but you don't want to see my porn. If you come look at my guns or show you my porn. Yeah. That's my fun. Am I doing the porn first? I'm saying I'm saying I'm a fuck dude. Bro, you have to get the fuck out of here. Yeah. You can donate. Get your money. It's going to. Act blue. Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, they got a bunch of warnings on this. This is serious. Serious. Serious. It's twisted dirt. I guess that's what you are doing. Well, one of the other headlines on the site, it was, it said, like, you know, watch black Abbie destroy the fucking country. Oh, man. There was a big meme going around about a picture of Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and the title is from a screenshot from you porn and says watch an interracial couple fucked the entire nation. That's fucking true. That's true. And it has 87 million views. 87,000 million, whatever that is. Like you put this crazy shit out. There's also a fun fact for you, Andy, just so you know, watching porn doesn't make you transgender. Well, I'm glad you clarified that. Because I was really worried. It's just it's all scary in America watching porn doesn't make you transgender. What's wrong with being transgender according to you, fuckers? All right. I thought it was fine. I thought that was the thing if it is. Yeah, if it does. So why why why should we be scared? I thought you said it. It's okay. Right. It's okay to, you know, to have 14,000 children in America have their fucking genitals mutilated, which is a fucking actual number, by the way. Yeah. Don't be scared of it because it almost makes you think that porn does make your trans. The fact that they're even saying it. Why even say it? Yeah. Maybe it does. I mean, it's just to me, it's just crazy that like the reach that these people have, like what they have to, like this is what, like these are the straws. Well, these weirdos want to scare America and write pornography manifested today in the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology. Well, I'm not going to say it makes you trans, but it certainly makes dudes not want to go out and find and be successful because let's be fucking real, dude. Why does any straight man want to do anything? Because they want to find attractive women to procreate or practice procreating with, right? For their whole lives. Okay. I practice all the time. Every fucking major feat of humanity that comes from a man somehow leads back to their approval. They want from women. Yeah. Like it's a primal desire and urge and pornography takes that away from young men. And while I'm not going, and I don't think it should be outlawed or this or that, I think government should be very limited. I think people should be mindful about what it actually does to the youth. Yeah. You know, when we were young kids, of course we looked at porn. But we had magazines, bro, and we had a like, hi, them and like, go on a fucking vision quest to find them. And then we looked at them and you couldn't beat your meat because your friends were right there. Right. So like, you know, the pages, you had to just like memorize it. And then like, you know, like do it the old way. Like now these kids are fucking inundated with tits and ass everywhere they look, bro. And then they wonder why they can't get a boner by the time they're 17. You know, so like, bro, it's not good. It's, yeah, it's not good. It's not good. It's just not good in that regard. But I mean, I don't think the government should be getting into private industry like that. I think there should be some regulations to keep children from consuming it. But what? Children from in it. Yeah. Oh, yeah. No shit. But, and I also think that, you know, whatever an adult decides they want to do, they should be able to do. You know, as long as it doesn't like legitimately physically harm people, you know, like convincing kids that they are transgender when they're four years old and stealing their childhood and all this shit. That's criminal shit, bro. But adults watching porn because they want to watch porn, that's existed for fucking thousands of years, man. So, you know, get the fuck out of here. I don't like the progressive left, but I don't like the alt-right conservatives either. As, bro, they want to control just as much shit as the alt-left wants to control. And they need one of them can see the hypocrisy in their own stances. Like America is supposed to be free. And we're supposed to have a basic set and guideline of moral standard that we operate from. But it's not up to you just because you have personal preferences to dictate that on to other people. You're going to have freedom. That means you're going to have to tolerate what other people choose to do as long as it's not hurting you. You're going to say and disapprove of what other people do and you're going to have to accept that. The problem that we have in America, dude, is that everybody's trying to force their own beliefs and their own viewpoints and worldview onto other people. And that's what's creating the polarity and civilization. You know, we have to get to a point where we understand that if we're going to live in a free country, freedom actually means that we are going to have to tolerate things and ways of life and behaviors that we don't necessarily agree with. Now that they're outside the agreed upon moral standard, such as pedophilia or such as children mutulating their genitals, that's a problem for everybody that we all need to address. Because when we allow freedom, there are going to be people that take that three or four or a hundred steps too far. And that's happening right now. We have people who are, you know, like we've talked about a gazillion times on the show. We have people on the progressive left who are dressing up as women and they're legit pedophiles and they're dressing up as women. Remember, we never see women dressing up as men doing this shit. It's always men dressing up as women and they're in women's locker rooms. They're in women's sports. They're in, you know, kids' schools doing dances. Why aren't you doing dances at old folks homes? Why aren't you doing dances at the bars where you're supposed to do them, the gay bars? Okay, that's no kids there. Yeah, no shit. And what the fuck is up with you parents like loving it and cheering for it? Okay, you're fucked up too. But the point is, is that then we have the people on the alt right who, you know, if you don't go to church every Sunday and Wednesday night, you're the devil, right? So like there's got to be a place in the middle that we can all agree where it's common in the sense where we aren't all up and each other shit. You know what I mean? 100% man. So yeah, so this campaign pushed, there was another campaign push that came up. I don't know if you saw this one either. Do you see this campaign push from the, uh, Kamala campaign, this one right here, Afghan national arrested for plotting an election day terrorist attack? Oh yeah, I did. I did. And it's getting pushed by every media outlet. That's weird. That's weird. I know, I know. Yeah, well, the what I. I got more on this. Yeah, I mean, just a little background for those of you guys that haven't seen it. Yeah. The Justice Department announced charges against a citizen of Afghanistan, residing in Oklahoma, City, Oklahoma for conspiring to conduct an election day terrorist attack in the United States on behalf of the Islamic State of Iraq and Al Shom or ISIS, a designated foreign terrorist organization. And according to a criminal complaint filed today in the SAR Ahmad Tahiti, uh, 27, conspired and attempted to provide material supports and ISIS and obtained firearms and ammunition to conduct a violent attack on US soil and the name of ISIS as part of the plot. The defendant allegedly took steps to liquidate his family's assets, resettle members of his family overseas, acquire AK 47 assault rifles in the ammunition and commit a terrorist attack in the United States. Now they put that out. I think interest in background now that sounds very similar to what I predicted as the attack as well. Very, very, very similar. But it's interesting because this guy, he's an Afghan foreign national. Has he been here for 10 years? Has he been here for the last 15 years? No. He came in pretty recently under the exact border crisis problem that they created in 2021. This guy came in this country on a special visa that dig this, the State Department itself has already announced that they only give out 50, typically 50 of these visas a year. And he got one of this guy that's a fucking foreign national that is talking allegedly about creating some type of terrorist. Now do you think that I don't know. We got all these school shooters who were on the FBI radar every single one of them. Now do you really think that this guy was flying under the radar and had never had a conversation about terrorist attacks in the United States before 2021? Right. You see what I'm saying? Let alone three weeks before I come in. You think he just came up with this just now? Right. Right. What I'm getting at is he was talking about before he came here. They knew he was talking about it most likely and they let him come in anyway. Not only let him come in, they fucking brought him in. Now what else does this do though? Well, people see this, right? I mean, we're three weeks out from the election. What else? Why now? Why would they make it so public? Why? You know why? Because they don't want people fucking vote. So now only do we have the hurricanes going on. Yeah. We have all these natural, they're fear mongering to get people to stay home. Let me say guys, let's get to our third and final headline headline number three. This is an interesting, another interesting topic that has came up that I found very, very interesting. Today, a study was released and let's dive into this headline number three reads, how wave of heart attacks in young people may be fueled by COVID and just COVID and nothing else just COVID itself. People who get sick with COVID are at a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes years after clearing the infection. A major study suggests using data from over 200,000 people from the United Kingdom with an average age of 67 who caught COVID in 2020, researchers found the more sick someone was, the more likely they were to develop heart problems. Overall, being affected with COVID doubled someone's risk of a heart attack or stroke, at least three years after the initial infection and patients who are hospitalized because of the virus were four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than those who did get it. This new research comes as other doctors searched for clues as to why fatal heart attacks and people under 45 have been increasing. Some point to the COVID virus as a cause a whole lot more are point to the COVID vaccine as the cause. We don't talk about that. But that's not in the, no, you know what's crazy, dude? It's crazy how people still won't talk about it. They won't say it. They still won't say it. It's like, dude, look at the amount of people, young people that are falling over fucking dead athletes, young people, otherwise perfectly healthy people that have fallen over fucking dead in the last three years. And whenever it happens, if you ask if the person to have the vaccine, people get offended, it's like, dude, why don't we just tell the truth so that we can know what we're dealing with? It's like all the people who got it are somehow like indenisble about the entire thing. It's like, bro, there were lots of people out here trying to tell you what the deal was and you'll call this all crazy, okay? There's people like this, let's check this clip out. So you're a point. It's people like this. This is a 24 year old woman. There's still people in the comments sections when this comes up that are like, you guys are fucking great. It's like, bro, you, you're saying that because you're scared and you're afraid and you don't want to admit that this is an actual thing. That was the fucking truth. Check this out. I had a heart attack at 24, part one. I just want to preface this story by saying it is so important to listen to your body and advocate for yourself because as you're hearing my story, I was told by the EMTs who took me in the ambulance that this was a panic attack and this was a full-fledged heart attack. So basically what happened was I was sitting on the toilet just like Elvis and I got the craziest sharp shooting pains down my left arm. When I say I had sharp shooting pains, it was the worst pain I've ever felt in my entire life. I was hyperventilating, panicking, screaming and cold sweating, ripping my clothes off. When I curled into a ball, I knew something was severely wrong and everybody thought that I was having a panic attack, but in reality I was panicking because I was in so much pain. So within 45 seconds of all of this happening, thank God I was home with my mom and brother. They called an ambulance and the EMT arrived and he completely invalidated me. Go to part two. And it's interesting because not once did she address whether she was vaxed because I feel like that is an important question to ask people no matter how they get offended because you can't address the problem if you're willing to skate over the possible variables that produce that problem. Nobody wants to talk about it. But there have been people around the country, people around the world that have been talking about this. Now more in the study, they just say that it's the COVID infection itself that is linked to this long-term risk of heart attack. Is there a data point that they ran the study that showed which percentage of these people is vaccinated versus not? Nope. Yeah, okay. What a convenient thing to leave out. It's funny you say that, and because that's actually what other people have been saying in the comments as well. Crazy. Another thing about the vaccine, that study, they say people treat it for COVID but aren't clear on the treatment. And that pharma intervention caused the risk, doesn't say weird, huh? You think it would be important to mention how many of them had the jab? You know, or there's other comment. You know, hopefully they segregated the Vaxed from the unvaccinated in their control groups. I think the powers that be are trying to hide just how bad the jab is to which somebody else replied, no chance they did that. Now they say that this is mainly affecting people with the blood type of O where people with blood types A and B and A, B, they're fine, right? Now they put this interesting graph out from this study, okay? And this is a graph that shows the heart attacks and people aged 18 to 44. Okay. Now you see that chart. You see in 2020, the percentage of the population, it was, you know, 0.03%. And then in 2021, it jumps up, takes a little dip, and then jumps back up in 2023, right? It's an interesting graph. I've never seen anything like it until I started looking and I found something else very similar. I found this graph. This is the vaccination rate dosage over a course in period of time. And I thought it was interesting because when I was looking at this graph, I said, huh, that looks pretty similar to this heart attack graph. And when I laid those two right on top of each other with the timelines, holy shit. Yeah. Yeah. And that interesting. Shocking. Fucking shocking. Now you search this code heart attacks and they got all the study blasts at all over the fucking place, right? And I say in Google search, definitely nothing to do with the vaccine. Search vaccine heart attacks. People who have accidentally against COVID-19 also have much lower risk. How would we know? How the fuck would we know? Andy, what do you got on this man? I mean, I got the same thing we've been saying for the last four years. We don't know. Look, man, you got the dude, you got gates on stage at a TED talk talking about reducing the population through proper vaccination. Okay, openly talking about it. You got Georgia guide stones who say the whole point of the New World Order is to reduce the population from 8 billion people to 500 million for the sake of the environment. Now we have all this AI coming out that's going to replace humanity, replace jobs. It's going to be combined with robotics, blue collar jobs are at a risk. You guys all think they're not, but they are. And they have no use for the peasants anymore. So their goal, reading between the lines is to reduce the population of the non-useful contributing people, meaning exterminate them from the earth so that they can have the earth for themselves. And this is actually happening. They talk about it openly. And a lot of people just think it's total BS and they still think it's total, there are then books published about it. Multiple books published about it. You know, you got Klaus Schwab, the head of the World Economic Forum, writing books about it. These people are evil and people refuse to believe that there are people this evil because most people can't fathom that level of evilness because they're not that way. But there is a group of people, in my opinion, from the evidence that I have observed from doing this literally almost every day for the last five years that are intentionally trying to destroy humanity. They are intentionally trying to remove what they consider to be the peasant class. That's us. That's you. That's me. That's us from earth. And when we look at all these things and we say, why did they force this vaccination that was not tested and all, bro, it all lines with all their goals. And they all talk about it openly. And so like to try to explain it to someone that doesn't get it by now is just, it's pointless. They're not going to get it. Right? And the people who got the shot instead of saying, hey, I regret getting this. This is fucked me up. Some people are saying that we have more of those people saying, you guys are still crazy. You were that, bro, what are you talking about? Like have you not been paying attention to what's been going on? You know, you're giving them saying it's not misinformation. These are real studies conducted by real people. And it's very obvious that this COVID shit was engineered intentionally. That's been proven. The vaccine. Dude, I don't even, let's say to the point, bro, like again, it matches their plan. I know. I know checks multiple boxes. Right? It was the biggest wealth transfer in the history of this country in the matter of months. Yeah. Like they got to get rid of over 60% of fucking small businesses. Their plan wasn't just to get everybody with this vaccine, dude. They were going to eliminate the resistance, the people who didn't get the vaccine. But people wouldn't allow it. All right? Remember Trudeau saying, what are we going to do with these people? Where are we going to put them? They're a dangerous society. Biden saying, we got a pandemic of the vaccine, of the vaccine. Vaccinated. We got Michelle went on TV who's now changed her tune because she knows she's guilty of crimes against humanity. Saying that people who haven't vaccine, she lose their jobs and lose their ability to be able to live free in society. You have Australia putting people in camps. We were this fucking close to literal death camps over COVID, but people wouldn't allow it, especially here in America. So their plan is not just to get people to take the shot. It was to eliminate all the resistance by making them dangerous to society and to humanity and then eliminating them through a genocide. I'm convinced of that. I know a lot of people think that's crazy. It's not crazy. We were one or two steps away from that. One or two steps. Certain countries were putting people in fucking camps. Australia was doing it. They were doing it. Yeah. Not talking about that. Yeah, they actually did it. Yeah. So guys, we were very close. Two close to a genocide of people who would resist that narrative. And if they were going to genocide all the centers and people say, well, why didn't they do another country? Because if they would have done another country, people here would have started killing people. We would have killed people over that. That's the fact, man. That's the fact. Guys, jumping on this conversation, let us know what you guys think. And here's the bottom line. This is your, I'm sorry. This graph was crazy. Yeah, it is crazy. We're watching on our listening on audio, which our listenership is 50 times as big on audio. You should go watch this on YouTube, this part, especially. It's insane. But the underlying point to all of this, dude, is that these people, their narrative, their initiative that they are fully committed to is falling apart, which makes them extremely, extremely, extremely dangerous, especially over the next 90 days with the election and then, you know, whatever's going to happen post election in terms of transition of power, which I think the amount of chaos they are about to cause in one way or another is, has never been seen globally before ever. And I think people need to be prepared for it. Yeah, man. Guys, let us know down in the comments what you guys think. With that being said, let's get to our final segment of the show as always. We have Thumbs Up for Dumbest Fuckers. We're bringing a headline in. We talk about it. It'll get one of those two options. So with that being said, my thumbs up are dumbest fuck hell I reach. Cookie Monster. Bizarrely caught speeding on traffic cam, but cops were not amused. Cookie Monster. It seems eating isn't the only thing Cookie Monster does too quickly. Police camera captured the bizarre moment a motorist spared through an intersection in Germany while dressed as the blue biscuit loving children's character. Quote, the fun of wearing a mask from the Muppet Show can quickly turn serious. Police spokesman Peter Banderman told News Flash while describing the incident. The pic snapped in the western city of Dortmund, Westphalia on September 20th shows the Google Eid character driving an Audi at 60 miles per hour, which was 10 miles per hour faster than the Post-it-Speed limit. The combo of the speed and the ridiculous costume led police to believe that the Cookie Monster cosplayer whose identity wasn't yet discovered, whose identity wasn't yet uncovered, deliberately got themselves caught on camera for a brazing gag. However they feel the stunt is no laughing matter. Quote, it won't help the relatives of a person who has been killed if the person who did it, took the mask and court. If authorities do track down the shaggy, suit it troll, slap him with a $50 fine. No cookies for you. Here's the picture. That's pretty funny, dude. That's funny. That has to be a real gag. I mean, or he was trying to rush to a kid's birthday party and shit and he ran a little late. Bro you ever seen somebody driving down the street? Dressed up as a clown. I had. Not a clown. I saw who was. It was like one of the fucking... It was like one of those mermaid movies. Like dresses and the crap. He had a little placard on his car. A car and shit advertising does. Birthday parties and events. Yeah, dude, fully dressed. You've never seen like a clown driving smoke the cigarette. It's a weird thing. It's weird. Clubs are weird, man. I don't like clowns. I'm not a big fan. I'm not a big fan. I've never thought they were... Like I don't get it. No, I've never been a fan. Yeah, I mean either. Huh? Yeah. They're not funny. Clowns aren't funny. No. No, I really don't like them. Yeah, it's fucking weird. I'll shoot one in the face. Oh really? I don't know if I hate them that much. Nope. I mean if they try to fuck with me, you know what I'm saying? Like the fucking honing shit? What? The honing. I don't like it, bro. Yeah, they do seem to zero in on people they don't like. That's what I'm saying. They're not doing their PR any help. No, they're fucking crazy. Give me the fuck alone with your clown shit. Yeah. Yeah, this is good. Cookie Monster. I'm giving it thumbs up. You like it? Yeah. Once the cookies man. No, 50 bucks for this though. I mean worth it. That's so worth it. Well worth it. Definitely going to teach you that guy a lesson. Yeah. Well, I mean no more weatish knitzel for you. Yeah. Bro listen. I, you know. That's a whole nother topic. I'm just going to keep my mouth shut. I'm going to thumbs up. I like it man. I like it. Well guys, Andy. That's all I got. All right guys, don't be a hoe. I'm trying to show. Yeah. Never sleep in on the floor. Now my jury box froze. Fuck a boat. Fuck a stove. Counting millions in a coke. Bad bitch. Booted slow. Got a own bank row. Can't fold. Just a note. Here. Shot case. Close. Close.
