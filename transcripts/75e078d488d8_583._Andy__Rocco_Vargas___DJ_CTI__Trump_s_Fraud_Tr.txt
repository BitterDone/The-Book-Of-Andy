Mm-hmm. This is real science. Oh, I got it for Fauci Anyway enough about that We do have a fee for the show the show the fee is very simple Please share the show we put a lot of time and energy into the show we try to help you guys And we have this little thing. It's called don't be a hoe sure the show all right now We do have a very special show today. I've got a good friend of mine. Mr. Vincent Vargas veteran Hollywood actor author who has written this new book Borderline based upon his seven years as a border patrol agent You might recognize him from the Mayans. He was just telling it a very Very fucking humorous story about how You killed someone on the Mayans and the internet started hating you. Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting It's interesting that we live in these times, isn't it? Oh, man. Yeah So you so let me get this straight because this is something that captures my curiosity so You're on the show. Yeah, all right and on the TV show your character kills another character assistant killing Yeah, and the internet decides that they're going to hate you for it. Oh, absolutely And give you death threats. Oh everything. Yeah, so you're a fat piece of shit fuck you you fucking ruined my life You Is Heart, bro, I thought I got it bad Bro, the TSA dude on my way here said the same like bro, why do you have to do that shit? When actor he's fine. You know, he's good Dude we can FaceTime Easy tell him you okay Everywhere go Now we've been friends for I don't know what probably ten years. Yeah, I met you through Derek, why don't you? We I think we ended up getting pretty drunk at my house. Yes, we did yeah, and it's been a while so Let's see you yeah, thanks for having yeah, so Bro tell us a little bit about your book. Why'd you ride it? What's what's going on with you right now? And yeah, man, you know, just been in the years of doing the whole show and Hollywood thing and watching What's happening with the border and watching kind of the the the screw nids happen for border patrol agents, you know It's fucking frustrating man watching all the shit talk that the agency of the career gets for people that don't even fucking understand what the career is Yeah, and so you know, I thought like I have a little bit of a platform I know what my career was and so what I did was pretty much write my career in this book to hopefully humanize the The agency to humanize the career field and explain it to motherfuckers Don't really get what it is dating and day out. Honestly, I believe that career is the it's the first line of defense against any kind of Terrorist organizations or anyone trying to come through the border that's your drugs that's terrorists that's the list goes on and on and People fucking tend to think that the border patrol is the ones who make the make the fucking policies like no Absolutely not yeah, the ones who like all the fucking shit that they want to blame on them It's genuinely has nothing to do with them And so I want to do it my best to hopefully write this in a way that's digestible for the average person who doesn't understand the career Field to read this is like oh fuck what they do is actually dope as fuck they stop more drugs in any agency They fucking save more lives than any other agency like they should be someone that is held on a pedestal like thank you for doing what you do Do you think that people now normally I would say bro There's no way that people actually blame the actual border patrol agents for what's going on at the border But after hearing the story that you just told me about somebody wanting to kill you because of something they watch on TV that was literal fiction I Guess that makes sense. I guess there's probably is a lot of people who are looking at what's going on right now and they're saying The border patrols not doing their job not understanding that they're completely handcuffed By the administrations that they serve to eat to do what is required by those administrations. Yeah, absolutely Is that the truth? Yeah, it's absolutely the truth so like I don't care who you are in the border patrol someone else is paying that Right signing those checks the border patrol. It's just like a sheriff doesn't determine what the speed limit is The state does right in the policies. Yeah, border patrol doesn't make any kind of policy changes or doesn't update them or change them They just continue to follow what is put into law. Yeah, and that's all they do so like when you see all this stuff happening right now The border patrol is getting hit all day long like all the border patrol So there's a picture of the border agent on video they're cutting the barbed wire and they're they're helping them come across right What most people don't understand is the border patrol career field isn't an aggressive posture It's actually more of a humanitarian posture if you've already made way and land onto America It is our job to make sure that they're safe and we apprehend them and bring them in for processing That is the job at no point you see is pull out a gun like hey get back to Mexico That's not the job. It's never gonna be the job if there's a threat where it deems I need to pull my rifle my pistol at that time then yes that we're still long for sure But the first job we have is to apprehend these individuals and once they've made landfall once they've came to America It is our job to keep them safe until we can get them through the process What is the responsibility though like for example? Because I understand all this right but like when I've and this is gonna be a little bit of a You know connecting of dots here so follow me, but like when I watched during 2020 how they try it and this goes with for I'm talking about police officers right and I watched how police officers were enforcing things that were Unconstitutional mandates that weren't laws, you know going to the beach arresting someone on the beach because of a mask Because they weren't wearing a mask or they weren't supposed to be there You know the paddleboarder guy right like they flew out on the boat and they got this guy like At what point Do the men and women of our Service a sector, you know, which I would consider like police board patrol You know military like all of these guys that the United States taxpayer is paying their salaries at what point should these people Take it upon themselves to say you know, this isn't right I don't agree that this is happening and I don't understand the point completely yeah that you know Their jobs are on the line when they speak up right? There's a probably a whole lot of guys in the border patrol or like holy shit We're being invaded, but they can't fucking do anything about it because the minute they do or say anything about it They just get replaced by some other robots absolutely so like what is the solution here because I've always supported the police You know are one of our biggest charities that we donate to here At first form is backstoppers, which is a charity that takes care of fallen officers families We're very passionate about in fact we have an event here tomorrow night To honor a friend of ours who who was killed in the line of duty Blake Schneider that we've done every year since that's happened and I love these people these people have you know I respect them. They have one of the hardest jobs in the world. They get paid shit for what they do But at what point in time because you know We're dealing with people who are doing things that are un-American and they're like hurting our country So at what point in time or what's the solution for these men and women to like hold that line as opposed to Just kind of go along because they're afraid for their own their own income I mean, it's a difficult situation. Yeah, it's tough because like everyone wants to keep the lights on You know, right? It's a career for the people and then why did they join in the first place because they're very patriotic for this country Right that is one of the most patriotic careers you can find in America for sure And it's hard because all they can do is what they're told of them to do and so like right now I'll say this the more out for the border shows the lowest it's ever been they actually have the highest suicide rate per capita for long Fortunate right now, and it's it's sad and it's because like the demonizing the the politicizing of the career field Yeah, that people are looking at them saying why are you doing this why are you doing this or why you're not doing this both sides of the fence Right you got the left and right giving them shit from no matter what yeah, and so it is tough The one thing that they do their best stuff is be a deterrence be there and be a person on the line to hopefully deter Go somewhere if you can do it. You're not doing it here and a lot of guys are taking that position of being very active on the border being actively Putting their truck there putting the lights on like you come here. You get stopped the unfortunate part of it is that even that alone gives him like well, let's go straight to him and say hey, I'm here And so it's like almost even if you're trying to do your job What is the job of the border trade is to stop people from entering to America outside of the port of entry right So anywhere outside of a port of entry if you enter their job is to try and stop that or deter that They can sit there with the lights on and the vehicle as a deterrence which usually used to work And it doesn't happen anymore. So well cuz these people have learned that they're not going to be high back or send back right because There's no fear because they've been incentivized right and so now even you do your job to the most what if I did that in 10 they would never come they was like fuck that that guy's gonna stop me He's gonna arrest me and there's gonna be time and jail right because that's what was in place at the time as the administration This journal bomb right who who was very strict his his policies were very strict people were going to jail right and so the fact That is incentivized now even if you're doing your job to the full capacity It doesn't matter and that's what's hard because guys who still try and do the job It's it's irrelevant as hard as they want to do the job. There's no I can't sit there How come all these guys like the police the border patrol because I know these guys right like and I agree with you These are made up of veterans and people who care about the country and you know most police officers and border patrol guys They're not doing the job because of the pay. They're doing the job because they believe it's important that somebody needs to do it It's a job of service that they happen to get paid in my opinion probably you know 25% of what they should get paid right in reality but How come these guys don't get together and say you know what This is this is hurting our country. Yeah, this is not okay Like how come that like what's stopping that from happening? Well, I think is their pay you what's gonna happen with the government can easily just fire them and go find someone else to fill that role Right and that's the sad truth of that like it's their hand they're genuinely handcuffed. Yeah, that's the there's no Okay, someone whose patriotic does a job. Okay, well you don't want to do the job more fine We'll find someone else who's not patriotic who's yeah, but they can't do that if everybody acts together That's true. That's true. Like what if the entire border border patrol and the entire police force and the entire military said We're not doing any of this shit for these people. Yeah, what happens then Those people are fucked is what happens. Yeah, you know You know in our our last line of defense as citizens that we count on are these people yes, it's it's the police Like in 2020 bro when I saw the police doing some of the shit they were doing like arresting people who were trying to keep their business open So they could eat yeah or arresting people who were in public places um It disgusted me bro. Absolutely. It was disgusting and I always felt like a sense of safety in this country knowing that The veterans and the military community and the police if it came down to it They would stand up for us because that's what but that didn't happen. Yeah You know what i'm saying and it didn't happen the way that it should have happened and it's still not happening the way that it's supposed to happen and you know I think that that's more of the frustration that we're feeling At least for me personally maybe it's different for everybody else, but Yeah, I don't blame the border patrol agents for the border being open I blame the administration and the government and these old elite tyrants up in Washington DC But where I do have a problem is that like They're not stop they're not trying to stop this or you know what i'm saying and maybe maybe maybe it's so overwhelming that it's impossible for them to even Think and it looks like it is that way, but at some point in time we have to be real about That's our money. We pay you guys. We pay you guys who are police officers. We pay you guys who are a border patrol We pay you guys who are military and you guys look out for the interests of the government and these elite tyrants And not the interests of us people and it's becoming a very dangerous situation To be in the middle of for those people right that's kind of what's happening like it's so if you watch the social media right now And you watch like just the comments of everything that's what you have you have you know the liberal side of it Very liberal side would be talking more like oh let them in you know, you're like oh fuck that's where you're right yeah Then the more conservative side is like well fucking border patrol is helping them And it's like man, it is really hard. I don't I haven't heard anybody say that I have a lot of guys in my thing. I think it's like why they're just letting them in why there's let oh it's because they're Their handcuffed it is it is a really shitty situation because that's the pressure also border patrol feels They feel the same to like trust me dog. I want to do more But if I step out of line I lose my job that my kids don't eat and so that's a challenging thing to put them through That's the stress that why there's so much so sad why the more I was super low why they want guys like you and other people to show them Just say hey, I see you and I get it yeah It's tough and I think where now the the best thing we have is that there's an election coming That could potentially put someone in place that would actually see them what they're doing and allow them to do their fucking job And I think that's what everyone's kind of waiting for there is these kind of waves of the border patrol and how policies change and shift and and stuff And you know, they're trying to write out that way because man look at I respect them so much And I know what it's like to they you live paycheck to paycheck is going for sure. Oh, yeah, there's no doubt and so like if they're That's fucking bullshit by the way Absolutely, and they don't want to risk the fact of losing their house their family the kids And so yeah, they're willing to sit through and they keep those people They just like they do with most citizens with the tax rates And the way they tax the the companies and the citizen they tax people right to a point Where they make it like extremely hard to operate But but you can operate and that's how they pay these police officers a military and and border patrol guys They pay them just enough But not a penny more to where they they're like almost a slave to it. There's no room for Absolutely, I was ever able to walk away is that I had a successful business that was that was making me Yeah, or else I would have been slave to that. Yeah, and that's wrong It shouldn't be that well. Yeah, it's our police officers. We should reallocate a lot of that tax money that these politicians steal And a lot of the money that we send overseas to places like Ukraine or Africa That should be reallocated towards the salaries of our police and border patrol and military Yeah, it should it should be dude. It's real shit. But anyway um I mean, I feel for these guys too, you know, I get it. I'm just playing devil's advocate because we have an invasion happening And like did you see that story up in Pennsylvania where that dude We covered it that guy that killed he killed somebody and they went on a man up for 14 days The vortex named him up right right my dudes. Yeah, so broke, but here's the thing It took 30 dudes two weeks to it took 30 guys two weeks to catch him. Yeah, okay. Now we've got six six million of these dudes Yeah, like people like I don't know man. Maybe I'm hyper Maybe I'm hyper aware to it or I'm I'm alarmist to it, but to me It sure does feel like and it sure does look like they're sending their their military capital to our country right now We're like yeah, come on in man sit here and like we're gonna look the other way and we're gonna have a fucking knife in our throat Yeah, I think there's gonna be a definitely a repercussion that we got to look out for in the near future um What's what's crazy that Some people you know, I guess the administration doesn't see it the same way right they see it almost and then it's like oh humanitarian And I'm like dude, no, I don't think that I think they sell it as humanitarian, but they know exactly what they're doing Yeah, you know, that's my commoners on bro. Yeah, it's crazy. They're communist bro and they're trying to de uh Americanize our United States, America With all of these migrants so that we have less of an identity to fight for how much less American do you guys feel now than you did 10 years ago Because I feel a lot less I think that the society feels that yeah, and that's that's the intent of the demoralization You know if we take a country that's filled with a certain kind of people not race but ideology right And then we flood it with millions and millions and millions and millions of people who have a different ideology or different worldview um Now we're talking about diluting the culture. Yeah, that makes America what America is and and everywhere I go like just being real It feels less American than it has at any point in my life Yeah, you see that in the masses, which is the American flag we're talking about at at lunch is that just the American flag now to some people is like as a threat Yeah, I'm like wait now hold on that's actually that that American flag should constitute everything that America stands for every color every race every every culture It is the sign of freedom and then when you turn it into like oh no, that's a sign of racism The fucking starting this room. Yeah, you know what I mean? Well, those are those are people that have an agenda dude It's not it's not just an accident these aren't just these aren't just people who Are you know hyper Left or progressive these are communist who legitimately want to kill America and they understand that the way you kill America is not by Bombs and missiles and guns. It's by destroying the culture that America has always had And so what we're you know, it's demoralization and the next step is destabilization and then the next step is literal conquering And we've already worked through demoralization and we all just admitted the three of us and I'll we're there that we feel less American than we did 10 years ago And then if we look at the migration coming across the border or the crime in most of the cities right or the poverty that's happening or the homeless situation That's that's happening at scale at some of these Democrat states you know We're entering destabilization now or at least you know partially through that process because When we consider like the financial implications the average cost of living the the inflation the buying power of a dollar versus just three years ago You know, we're not far off from one or two things that were legitimately sent to a country down the tubes Yeah, and so you know when I look at this I don't I don't look at it any other way like I decided a long time ago That I believe that this was a communist Insurgency subversion That is very real and it's and we're in the late stages of it And it's a it's a communist revolution when they write about what's going on A hundred years from now. They're going to either say it was an attempted communist revolution or it was a successful communist revolution And we're in the middle of it and they're not going to come out and say yeah, that's what we're we're installing communism in the United States but if you take away The name communism and you look at all of the elements that are happening It very clearly is the same thing and so when I look at the border situation You know most people may look at the border patrol and say well the border patrols doing a bad job That's not I never think that that's not what I think when I do think is why aren't the border patrol and the police and the military Standing up for this country like they took an oath to But I don't blame them for being in the situation. I blame our government Which I think is but I don't know like that's me. You know, I don't think most people are I think most people still aren't seeing it the way I see it. Yeah, I think a lot of people are still seeing at surface level and you know what maybe I'm wrong Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe we have an election and a new leader actually gets elected and things change But I actually believe the election is so compromised. I don't think there's any chance that anybody but Biden's going to be president I don't I don't think there I don't think I don't think Donald Trump because listen. He's going to be the candidate And he's gaining more and more and more steam. He's 10 points ahead of Biden He was never ever ever ahead of Biden and the same exact poll He's 10 points ahead now and I still think they're going to fucking cheat the election Oh 100% and I think they're going to put this dude back in and Americans are going to have a real gut check moment like are we going to tolerate That because this is what's happened in these communist countries like Venezuela and El Salvador and these other places Where there was a long lines I mean bro, it just happened in Brazil It just happened in Brazil with Bolsonaro and Luna. Yeah, Bolsonaro has two million people at his rallies Luna has zero All right, and then Luna wins the election and then they have a riot the same fucking kind of thing they had here And now instead of January 6th it's January 8th It's the exact same play they're running in fucking Brazil that they're running here in the United States right now And so on this next election We're like I think a lot of people are looking right now and they're saying yeah Trump's gonna win because he's 10 points ahead And you know everybody's behind him. I mean bro even the the even the black inner city voters Who were like fuck Trump are now coming around if you go on a world star post and they talk about Trump bro It's like all pro Trump. Okay, so All of these people are now looking at this guy and they're saying all right. He's coming back But what happens if he doesn't? What happens if they flat out steal the election right in our faces, which by the way that's the ultimate demoralization Tidiot in writing your face. Yes, and that's what they've been doing That's why Biden goes up on TV and smirks everything he does like these guys know that they're doing this stuff right in our faces And there's nothing that's going to happen to them And so my opinion is that over the course of the next year and a half Trump is gonna continue to gain momentum momentum momentum because people have decided that they don't care what he's done They don't care if they persecute him. They don't care if they bring him into court They don't care if he whatever they say they don't care. Whatever they say they're gonna assume was a lie And it's gonna add power to him no matter what no matter if it's true or a lie and If he's that far ahead in the election cycle and then he loses You see what I'm saying that's ultimate demoralization and they're and dude they're we're gonna have a real Gut check as American citizens especially the men as to what the fuck we are actually made of Yeah, well, I mean do do it to your point. There's some interesting stuff going on So I don't know if you guys have seen this right but um this past Tuesday Kevin Matarck Carthy the former speaker. Thal C's out right um And that mostly in thanks to the work that Matt Gates has been doing But here's the thing a couple people have been putting their their names in the hat for this new more than a couple more than a couple Right and select one of those for example Jim Jordan right um he's dropped his name in their Steve Scalise. He's dropped his name in there um But Out of left field So I left field Donald Trump's in the in the running right and like and then they've been talking about it So then this is actually an MSNBC article he he is expected to announce that he is putting his name in it officially on Tuesday He is he is he is and so and so does this is MSNBC article reading Does Donald Trump want to be speaker of the house? It's a question that is emerged in the chaotic afterglow of a collection of house conservatives Succeeding and ousting house speaker Kevin McCarthy so far the former president has done little to downplay the political intrigue So let's watch this video. I got this clip. This is from when he left the court building I'm gonna address the news cameras. Let's see what he had to say real quick A lot of people have been calling me about speaker All I can say is we'll do whatever is best for The country and for the republic in mind we'll stay up to great people We just want to say we have some great great people Would you take the job? A lot of people have asked me about it. I'm focused. You know, we're leading. I don't know. I'm sure you don't read too much The papers for the lady by like 50 points The president You know my focus is totally on that. If I can help them during the process that we do But we have some great people in the Republican party that can do a great job of speaker To help So then even the White House responded Right so so KGB She was asked to say that's what her name should be. It should be KGB. You know, this was should be yeah So let's see what she had to say for the White House Any of the meetings about this in the last 24 hours has anybody in the West Wing heard anybody talking about the possibility of speaker Trump This is something for House Republicans to figure out. This is something for them to fix We're not going to get involved in the speakership We don't care who they who is in the race or who is out the race That is not for us to figure out The president doesn't have a vote no one here has a vote. They have to figure this out Thanks tell me you're nervous and scared shitless without telling me you're nervous and scared shitless Bro, that was crazy Responded that considering all the clips that we've watched her respond bro like bro. She's nervous No, that was fear not only did the reason the reason she did not say anything with her normal smart-ass mouth Is because she's afraid he might get it well, dude what what the speaker of house will give him bro Like that's starting line of succession. They already got open indictments or open impeachment and queries going on against Biden bro It would not be very difficult to fucking clean house. That's the easy route into the fucking presidency Very easy out and then think about it. They give them that that would give them five years if you ran for a little You'll continue to run for election now you got five years Wow It's a wow. I don't know. It seems like way far outside the realm of of reality But you know, this has been tossed around over and over and over again for years for years and The first they seem kind of far fish, but now like do this is a real possibility It's a real possibility. I thought it was crazy to hear that they're they're starting to build the walls again Right. Well nobody wants to talk about that like like bro. The that that whole thing there. I got that. Oh, hell yeah We'll wait to that. Yeah, I got a lot to say about that. Yeah, that's insane But not insane. I'm glad they're doing it. Yeah, but like the hypocrisy. Yeah, definitely You know look man. Here's the thing people don't understand the structure right? If house if he becomes speaker of the house They could impeach Biden and potentially impeach Kamala right after him and then he would be president That's what I'm I know that but what I'm saying is there's people listening that Arguing with me over my opinions about politics and but love my business advice and then you know Love my politics and hate my business advice like there's very few people I hear that actually understand how this works. Yeah, I was gonna ask there's a lot of people here that think that Vincent actually killed A guy on TV Okay, so I have to explain it. Yeah, right explain it to me explain to me because I'm not too clear about so So how this works is if Trump will position if Trump is voted speaker of the house By congress which they have the power to do like if all the Republicans who are members of congress voted for Trump to become speaker of the house He would become speaker of the house and there's nothing the Democrats can do because they don't have enough votes to stop it Not only that there's no requirements that you actually have to be a congress person You don't have to be a member of government to become okay, you could be a prop they could elect me. Yeah, all right, so If they do that, let's just say they did that Trump then presides over Congress the House of Representatives all right They can then impeach Biden and if they then impeach Kamala He's the third in line to become president. Jesus. Yes So and so the House is like I mean do like so the checks and balances of our government the House They're a position they have like some I mean it's an extremely powerful position right like all of the investigative Uh committees that's all in the House representative so there's a lot of power and sway We already have the Senate for the most part so it's like it'd be like it's a very very realistic situation. It's also one way to get around what I was just saying before which is the gut check moment that's gonna come Because look dude and I say this not because I wanted to happen because it's it's real If it is very clear that this man is you know one the vote and one the people over And they steal the election. It's gonna require violence. Oh, yeah It's going to require violence and all these border patrol people and all these police officers and all the veterans They're all gonna have to decide what team they're on. Yeah, that's where it's gonna and that that is the precipice Point of violence that I see in in the near future When countries who have dealt with this sort of um tyranny tyranny or or or or rebel attempted coup because that's what this is okay If it comes successful coup it what well I think the coup actually happened in the 60s But the point is I believe personally that the election was already highly manipulated Just like it was I mean if you watched the Arizona election that just confirmed. Yeah, what happened So and we can argue that all day like we can argue that Trump did 30 rallies with 30 days into the election where he had no less than 75,000 people in each rally and Biden was in his basement smiling because they knew that he was going to win All right, we can argue this all day, but my personal belief is that it was already stolen And that's the belief of a lot of people a lot of people feel that way all right because every fucking person they know voted for him like Every single person that I know with the exception of like a few like Far left weird-ass mother fuckers that I happen to be friends with and y'all are still weird I love you, but you're weird as fuck and you should probably listen to your cousin Andy a little bit All right real talk what the point is is that Everybody fucking voted for him the first time with the with the exception of the Hollywood elite types or the far left progressive communist blue hair people and And even so the people who didn't vote for him who voted for Biden are now shifting because they're like holy shit Look at what's going on. This is crazy and they're waking up at mass And so if all these people are looking around and we're like oh, yeah, that's our guy. That's our guy And they steal it again This is where those other countries like Venezuela and El Salvador failed and this is the point of Of contention where they legitimately failed as citizens to defend their own country against this communist movement And so in my opinion I believe that if the election is blatantly stolen it's going to be a time to decide for American men And American veterans and police and military do you believe in American freedom or are you willing to let communist take over And and that's going to require violence. Yeah, and and bro I'm all about culture revolution because without a culture revolution We will never have American culture that needs to be strengthened that you know when we talked about not feeling less American The reason we feel less American is because when you and I were growing up we're the same age um We we were taught, you know That people who won in life and did good things and built things those were people were like celebrated And now it's the opposite right and so we have this cultural ideology of no excuses Bad-ass American fuck you if you don't like it right and it's been replaced with I'm a victim. I'm sick I'm tired I don't want to work. Give me your shit. It's a totally different mentality And so that ideology difference is massive and If we if we don't restore that culture it won't exist anyway, but there is going to be a point in time That comes in my opinion where violence is highly likely and if it's not executed There's a good chance that we go the way of of Venezuela or al Salvador or one of these other countries Where they just go total communist, you know, and al Salvador is back on the right track again because they got somebody in Who was willing to fucking clean house The only thing that gives me hope is they seem to be real afraid of the elections Because of the way they're persecuting this man politically, but no It's a different it's gonna be an interesting time dude and like I'm just gonna be real like I think it's a good idea for any of you guys who are patriots like for real to like get your shit together man because like I don't I don't I don't think they're gonna not steal the election I think they're gonna steal it right in front of our fucking faces And I think there's gonna be problems. Yeah, and I think these millions and millions and millions of fucking migrants Coming across the border have the potential to be militarized against us the people In defense of them, so how are you doing it bro handing out badges in Illinois? Huh? How are you doing that? What do you mean? They're letting they're letting illegal migrants be police officers in Illinois. Yeah, hey seriously Oh, really? weapons and arrest American citizens They just passed a law Pritzker past it. Mm-hmm. Who's the governor over there in Illinois? Yeah, that's right So what's the next step? They're already asking you to pull them into your homes. Yeah, okay? So the next step is gonna be they take you're they're gonna fucking go on the emergency alert They just alerted yesterday and say We're what else did they do? Oh You might have this in in the topics, but they just categorized Maga as an extremist group. Oh, I see. I mean, did you have that yeah? I got it. Okay. We'll talk about it but the point is The these people will come on the alert system and they'll say we're under attack by rebels We're under attack by people who want to tear our country down And if you believe in America, you've got to pick up arms and defend it And it's gonna be all these migrants, bro Because what do they also give all these migrants they gave them what phones phones money More more benefits than they're giving our own veterans from they have served I mean, how many veterans do you know personally not not with names, but they're struggling. Yeah, they have been struggling They're struggling far far more than they ever should struggle for what they've given to this country Absolutely absolutely right it's wrong to get the benefits that they deserve well, dude You got a fight for them and then you got these dudes coming across being handed a stack of cash in the cell phone say see in 10 years Yeah, you know Go rape our women Like bro, it's fucking real shit. It's happening It's real shit man But guys, let's get into this cruise So remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you can find them there If you're watching on youtube check down in the description below And you find the links there as well. So with them and said man, let's get into our first headline first headline REIT Trump's man had in fraud trial interesting day four So let's do a little follow up on this there's some interesting stuff going on so Everybody knows how Trump is he talks a lot of shit. It's great He recently showed a clip of a g latiche James calling him an illegitimate president Now that's a good clip, but there's actually one that's better. There's been circulating around um and on top of the gag order that the judge gave him I thought this was a really really interesting clip Just to show the people exactly what we're talking about here So let's watch this clip here the president of the united states has complained that I'm engaging in some sort of political Which hunt that I've got some personal vendetta against him that I campaigned against him that is not true That president because he's not my president. He's an illegitimate president His days are numbered He's got to get ready to mobilize And we've got to get ready to agitate and irritate Until victory is won for more importantly until Trump is defeated We will all rise up and resist this And ultimately while printing him down This illegitimate president I'm going to give you the same level of respect that you gave To president Obama and that is absolutely no respect at all So let's fucking be honest Obama didn't deserve any respect Obama was actually a very hopeful candidate when Obama got when Obama got inaugurated in 2008 When they actually announced that he won the election and he was in Chicago and it was all over TV bro Like I mean getting goosebumps about how I felt then like I didn't vote for him But like dude like I felt very hopeful for America I said bro, this is great like it's our first black president It's going to unify people Like this if this guy comes in and says what he's actually about it's going to be amazing And what do you do? He came in for eight years and fucked our shit up And now he's still fucking it up with this old bag of shit Joe Biden Okay, so like let's be real Obama started with a very high level of respect and he quickly deteriorated and nothing to do with Donald Trump And most American citizens feel that way Yeah 100 But with all of this going on something this clip right here Do you remember that bro when you got elected? Yeah, it was it was I think it was like a good unifying feel for a lot of United States Dude I felt that way too and I remember I was dating a girl at the time who Was very pro Obama and I was not yeah and at the end of it I was you know, it was a different time then too dude like could you imagine like dating One of these fucking people now holy shit, bro Everything's weapons must have been hard times for me Look all the sadist this all of saying is we didn't hate each other. I just looked over and I said hey I hope you're right. I hope you're right like this looks good. It sounds good. It feels good I hope you're right. I hope I'm wrong But I was right. You know, I mean Trill sent me him you don't remember dude because you were pretty young. Do you remember? Yeah, absolutely How are you now? I was in eighth grade. Yeah, I mean were you hopeful? No, I mean dude I thought it was cool and like I even just seen the videos like I mean, bro Millions of fucking people like shit. This is pretty cool. Yeah, you know, but I wasn't like oh, yeah It's a black president. I can be black. You know, I'm gonna be president one day I didn't feel like that was take it that way, but DJ. I didn't even I don't even feel like that was the tone I think there was way less racial contention than there was now absolutely like like dude And young people aren't like these 20-year-old kids. They don't get that Like back in 2005, bro. We're walk everybody's walking around cool. Yeah, like we're making jokes about each other We're having fun. We're celebrating each other's cultures like we're black dudes are going to country shows White dudes are going to rap shows. We're all fucking hanging out. Nobody gives a fuck. Yeah, Eminem yet broke nobody But dude real talk like these young kids don't they weren't around during that time so they don't understand You're trying to solve a problem that's already been fucking soft, bro The context of what of the time before I don't know had yeah, but but I want to bring up something that's really really crazy Man and Andy you kind of alluded to it, but we got to talk about it. So newsweek magazine they did this exclusive Report Um, this head on reads exclusive Donald Trump followers targeted by FBI is 2024 election years This is a real thing. Yeah, it's an absolute like listen guys like we've all joked about it, right? Like I got my FBI agent who targets us I'll talk to him. He's cool. You know, but we always joke about it like and and this is real Like this is a real thing that they are no longer hiding, right? So if you associate this is intimidation too 100% They're just leaking the truth, bro. That's all it is so that so this has been going on for a long time But they're leaking the truth Because they want people to be afraid to support Donald Trump. Yeah, that's what this is about 100% This is no different than whenever during 2021 when they came out remember we were up at Ian Smith gym and it was like August 2021, I think And they were having that event and that was the first time they released a domestic terrorism watch list No, remember that we were there and all of us because like that was where all of them worth the that day Like mask We were all there like we were like we were all kind of secretly like Fuck dude like are they coming for us now like what the fuck like we got a little nervous, right? But a couple days went by and we're like, you know what? Fuck these people But like dude that what this is this is because the silent majority Strategy isn't going to work anymore, right? The first time They tried to make everybody feel like there was virtuous to say silent That's not gonna work anymore people have realized that they fucked themselves by doing that So now people are getting loud and you even have the black communities coming out in support of Donald Trump Which dude like I love seeing that um But what I believe this is is this is like hey you better not publicly say you support Trump It's a way for them to control the the energy. Yeah, that's how I do it It's a dangerous thing too because when people have to understand the moment that they say something is Qualifies as a domestic terrorist the amount of resources that that opened up A little bit of Fies of warrants and all like I mean dude. It's insane and just by labeling this Is domestic terrorists right if you follow the certain the amount of of invasion into your life that you'll be completely unaware of Which it's already at a masculine, but this allows them to take it a hundred thousand steps further Like it's dangerous. Yeah, the other the other scary part is that people that are That are easily swayed and easily convinced read that like oh shit Is that and they believe that it's not like they don't have a thought process right It's all these people they read the title and believe everything that now is like gonna confirm their own beliefs that that were now Concrete to them and say people like I wouldn't say my mother per se but people in that age demographic Who just like reads the reads the headline and goes oh shoot now they're gonna believe it or it's part of that psychological operations Right that they do yeah, bro. That's a really good point I hadn't thought about that like a lot of people are still in that Place where if they read a headline and it comes from newsweek or it comes from MSM that that supersedes all the other Yeah headlines and it's actually the opposite right their arrow was right news was real It's now it's not and there's a reasonable expectation by them and everybody else right that what newsweek or what the New York Times or the New York Post or The Washington Post or any of these places CNN Fox. They're all guilty of it And they've become a propaganda machine versus an actual news, but when we were growing up bro It wasn't like this and if it was we didn't notice it right like now it's overtly like right in our faces And um, there's a lot of people man who still haven't unplugged themselves to realize that like you're this isn't the news anymore This is an agenda that you are being fed and that's a really good point I forget that a long time for me to convince my dad mom like hey stop stop reading these right stop doing that It's like reading the acquirer when you're a kid when you're young, yeah, you know it's bullshit They still don't and you have to tell them like stop like like really start educating all these topics start making your own decisions Like don't do that yeah because just consider I think a good way to interpret uh Most of the MSM or when it comes to Trump especially because they hate him so much Is that literally almost everything they say about the dude ends up being the opposite right and so like when we when we interpret And by the way, that's no like plug on Donald Trump like Donald Trump doesn't do himself any favors by the way that he carries himself, you know like if Donald Trump it came out and for for four years and You know instead of like jousting with the media Presented himself with a message of unity like hey instead of saying yeah, you know Whoever Jake Tapper you're a piece of shit like you're fat you're this like instead of that shit How do you come out and said now guys? I know that there's a lot of buzz around these policy decisions Let me take a minute to explain him to you This is why I decided this I decided this because I think it's gonna bring us all together so that we can move forward as this And he actually like took the time to like Be a real leader in that way because I think his policies everybody agrees times were better right? But You know he he he he fucks himself with his communication a lot of times. Yeah, the lack of professionalism It was I think it's funny So like we have all of these misunderstandings. I'm no stranger to him I understand so like when I see Trump come out on the on the stage and he just starts rippin on these fucking media outlets I'm like get him. Yeah, I love it and I laugh at I think it's funny But I can also detach myself from that because I experience that right To understand how that comes across to someone who's who's not experienced that yeah It's the first time in our in our time that we've seen a president kind of step outside of the professionalism Yeah, and just kind of address people with humans And I think it threw a lot of people off and that's why he had so much to stain towards him because yeah Like that's not a president act like yeah, I get it but like I mean a lot of the shitty said was like on point no It's all point. It was just Yeah, yeah, my point is like like you're just sitting there like yeah, but you know it's one of those things And I do want to have a president has a little bit more protect in his office of the president It's important to have that because we have to understand that There's people that are a hundred listening to you. There's people that are 80 there's people that are 60 Countries people that are 40 there's other countries and these people all have different worldviews So like this is why like as much as I joke about being president like I like to joke about it all the time I wouldn't make a good president because I would go up there and tell you to suck on my fucking balls Okay, like real talk. I can't help it. It's who I am now. I'd be a great strategic guy I'd be a great personality on the internet But like being an actual president. I probably have the same problem that Trump has okay No, I'm just being honest man. It's just real shit so But like I I loved it like I love the way he is because I'm like fuck dude this guy's awesome like I bet like dude I would love to hang out with him and fucking talk shit and like I bet we would roast each other to be fucking hilarious Let me tell you something. Yeah, all right Bro, and I met his family too, and they're fucking great people. They're great people dude and um So I really I get it and I like him, but I also understand Why people don't like that and and uh I think it's a strategic mistake that he's been making that yeah, you know what I mean? I'd agree Maybe not though like the guys the guy is so hyper intelligent I mean he might see a bunch of shit that I'm not even seeing I mean the guy's twice as old with all this experience. I mean fuck he might have this shit all figured out We don't know shit. I'm just saying that's my take. Yeah, I love what he says. I love what he does I think it's hilarious, but I understand why like, you know Maybe your mom might not right right right right right right. I don't like it. Yeah, right Or like that lady from last night that we had a like you know, jeez. Yeah, that lady That's that's a story for after the show dude Um Yeah, well guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments Has Chad coming for you. Let us know what you guys think. So with that being said, let's keep this cruise I say come and get it. Come and get it. That's what I say Yeah, come and get it bro I'm looking at this like like the net like I'm looking at this next year and a half kind of like this could be it Now I'm being serious like I'm driving all my nice shit. I'm wearing all my nice shit I'm fucking going out and eating the nicest shit. Well, let's be real. I did that anyway. No, but the truth is like I'm starting to think like all right Man, this could be it like it's making me appreciate everything else a little bit more. It's definitely a scary time And then I'm kids. I'm always like oh fuck did I fuck up and bring them into this crazy shit You know what I mean like I think that's funny You say that I'm a platoon over there. I do and hopefully they're fucking low max when I need it It's funny that you say that because I made a comment on the show just the other day Basically saying like Dude if you're 55 or 60 and older like you guys fucking failed your generation failed and so many people got pissed off about it Oh, you got some heat but yeah, but you know what bro? Here's the thing That's no different than me saying well my generation has failed by allowing this discussion of Mutilation of genitals to happen to grade schoolers like I should have been more vocal five or 10 years ago about when it This shit started to come around and I wasn't and so That's not an attack on an individual I'm sure that a lot of you guys that listen to this show you did exactly what you were supposed to do But I'm saying as a people as a group as a team We have failed and not only has your generation failed but my generation has failed too So I have responsibility in that as well So those of you that fucking you know hated me because I said that That's what I'm communicating like I'm not sitting here saying I'm doing it perfect because I'm saying we fucked up And that's that's something that we have to address before we could correct it right and that's all I'm saying Oh, that's real shit me. Yeah, but guys before you guys did fuck up All right guys before we get to our second headline we're gonna take a time no cruise from comment all right That's what comments. I wonder if I got a death threats for Yeah, we shall see so this comment is coming from at definitely not madat Shit's funny, but DJ ain't you got as many trophies as Biden has accomplishments in his entire political career This guy's hilarious Yeah, I get this guy trophy. No, that's that says definitely not mad But I will fuck you up. That's not madat It says it right there. It says not madat right nothing I am right Yeah, that guy's funny though whoever he is Yeah If not madat was here, I'd give the trophy But I don't see him anywhere. Well fuck you not madat Uh, yeah, so guys appreciate you guys commenting guys use that comment section engage. Oh my god Don't forget to like I'm gonna start picking up. Oh, this was a real person Oh, you okay. Well definitely not that's all definitely not madat gets trophy I like I like the original name actually at Buck nasty back Well that's reflective of our listeners. I like it. Yeah, well, I like it with the deplorables over here guys headline number two headline number two reads By netman waves federal laws to allow border wall construction and tech is another NBC article yeah, which I thought the I thought it was racist there was racist I thought there were putting people in cages. They were It's crazy. I'll speak a little bit on like it's crazy that people would argue the wall when they don't understand How valuable the wall can be right so like I'll just put into perspective you got 20,000 border trajans just about right and but you have three shifts of border trajans And so you got a morning shift mid shift night shift right then you have people on admin So you at all times maybe have somewhere around three thousand five hundred guarding our borders. That's all the way from North 3500 yeah, that's not enough. No, no, it's not at all. So you have about so just one sector say eagle pass You got about maybe 20 people on a shift spread out through 200 something miles right and so Why the border was valuable is because what it did is at least funnel traffic to go to areas that are probably easier access Right like the path of least resistance And so it helps in some of these areas that are sometimes I'm two hours two and a half Three hours from my actual station That's how deep you have the drive just to get to your point and it's only you and maybe one other dude So if you have bodies coming across and it's like 20 of them It's like I'm not gonna happen 20 dudes alone in the middle of the night. I'm gonna call the home There's nothing you can do right. It's such a hard thing So when you add a wall at least it creates the funnel effect to areas that you can actually kind of guard better So there's value to it if you want to help with that the wall was important And so when they stopped construction on the wall It was kind of like confusing for a lot of the ages to like dude. This shit makes it hard Yeah, because they're assuming that the people that they work for have the interest of this country at heart And they do not yeah, it was a mistake. They're making it was a mistake everybody's make out Bro in my in my America bro, we have a wall With like literally like a catwalk on the top like just like prison bro like dudes with guns like I'd have some of them automatic Like heat censored like many guns, you know, they rotate around like the shit they put on a ship Yeah, you know what I mean? It's a missile out. Bro, they would be heat activated It would be so fierce that people wouldn't come within range of the wall like we would own the two miles into the wall Like because it would be so hardcore. That's what we would do and like It would only take a day of that operating for people would stop No comment. I'm just saying We we would only take a day. It would be over. There would be nobody coming here I'm all four people coming here like this guy came here. He comes here from Bosnia Does all the classes does all the paperwork? Yeah, does everything the right way. I'm all for that But when I'm not for is being invaded by migrants not of by the way I'm not talking about people from Mexico. I'm talking about I'm talking about the Chinese military age males I'm talking about the African males I'm talking about the the people from these countries that are 50 countries away from us are on the other side of the planet They're being shipped here. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I actually I actually I think the process for actual Mexicans to come to America should be expedited because our cultures are aligned We all you know what I'm saying like absolutely. It's a good thing So I mean, I just want to clarify that but like dude if you know, I don't know like my thing on this board the wall bro though like Like well, I mean if you if you have no comment. What do you think? What's your opinion? No, I think like I said earlier. I think the wall was valuable. I think the wall is very valuable Like why wouldn't we have a strong like doesn't that why wouldn't we have that? It helps the the lack of individuals we have actually doing the job. Well, why would we have any gaps in it? Right, I don't understand it either you know the argument the argument that was crazy was when when Trump said it like in like I don't give a shit but wait When Trump said in people arguments like the money It's like that's a crazy argument that the money and in why I think it's crazy is that what we're spending currently right now And just I'll give you just one example. There's one Processing center in eagle pass Texas currently right now that spends 24 million a day processing illegal immigrants right When you process them someone comes across and just to understand the process They come across to get apprehended to come in we do fingerprints We do identify there. They're right we do all the things you would do almost and going into prison So there's a database of everyone that comes across that we actually apprehend and for the most part Just walking up to us anyways, so it's an apprehension and so 24 million dollars a day And this is only one processing center and there's probably about five or six of them And so just the money alone just then maintain that is crazy And then you talk about how much it would have cost to do the the the wall like shit We could have built that wall many times over and which would actually have helped the influx not to be so bad So it was just it was a great I think the the amount if I'm not mistaken and I could be you guys could Google this up But I think the amount to finish the wall was like five billion dollars right and So when we spent over we spent sent over a hundred billion dollars to Ukraine What I mean that that one processing center alone if you do them do the math on that one He's come down to someone like eight billion something like that so like you you've already paid the wall once Yeah, one year and you would have actually deterred a good amount just in the fact that it just makes it Well the only logical Conclusion here is that they want those people here exactly and I think that's the thing I think this is actually a sign with there when they're changing tactics on this and the Poggy's the alone there's something deeper and I think that But With them changing completely doing a 180 on this topic How I see this is that the people that they wanted in this country to destroy it already here Like the damage is done so you can close the border wall now all you're doing is just locking us in You know, I'm saying I think the damage is already done That's that's an excellent point man I don't I don't know that I can disagree with that like they could be saying okay We have enough of these people here to do what we need to do. Yeah, let's lock it down now Yeah, you know, they get some pull some of our voter base back Because we'll appear to be handling the problem It's gonna be interesting to hear what all these Democrats who You know, it Thanksgiving dinner are gonna have to say about you know the wall being racist and the wall is a wall still racist Yeah, right is the wall still racist is it still kids and cages is a OC still going to the border to cry for a photo I photo up and okay is that are are is that all done? Are we moving on to something else now? Like at what point in time are the American citizens going to wake up and realize that you're getting played by all of the shit It's all theater. Yeah I And events I want to I want to check in them with you on something too like you mean with your experience Boystar agent. I mean you guys got to do some really really heavy heavy cool shit Well, what was your what was your experience like dealing with a cartel down there because like so this this and I bring I have to say there was this daily meal article that came out Todd Benzman um He just did an eyewitness report about the battle between the Mexican cartel and border agents down there Um, where was that at and this is insane. Yeah, so um article reads in the early dawn's orange glow of Texas Rangers commander briefs a heavily armed evasion force They're preparing to seize a remote 170 acre Mexican cartel controlled island in the middle of the Rio Grande River overlooked by sniper nest And potentially booby trapped um, so Bringing this up right by front in Texas. Yeah Um, apparently there's just like 170 acre island that is a stronghold for Mexican cartel They found weapons cash they got uh, you know little Boulders where they're digging holes under and hiding magazine ammunition um all along that Interesting. Well, I'll say this um Yeah, it's obviously all the trafficking that's happening in the borders is is controlled by some some cartel another right like There's someone in charge every area has a specific cartel that kind of runs that lane Um, and everything you see from human trafficking to drug smuggling is controlled by someone Uh, I don't know much about this story at all, but it's not uncommon every apprehension You make every kind of like all the intel that we gather and we start doing specific hits on on target houses It's because you know, we know there's some informant or someone who's flipped For the DA or whatnot and given us the information to go ahead and apprehend them And it's all connected to some kind of cartel and that's I think that's just uh, that's just the facts of it It's I think it's totally ingrained into our government somewhere some some way shape a form because how much money is involved in smuggling And so it's a big big part. Oh, it's a very very shady scary kind of environment And that's what you do down the border if you're apprehending dope bundles it is attached to some kind of cartel Well, it's also attached to our own three-letter agencies. Let's be real Fucking you don't just say anything The CIA pretty much put fucking Pablo Escobar in business and then decided he was a problem They got rid of him and we can go on and on and on about a bunch of shit like that. So Yeah I would build a bigger wall So I'm gonna start this thing if I were president after every segment, okay? If it were me We would have a wall that was at least four times that high and ten times that thick with our best Automatic heat sensing people annihilating people vaporizing mini guns That were automatically on the top of the wall and then I would give all of the border agents They could maintain it that way we can maintain that whole structure with the little manpower that we have But would it work? All right, that's what I think that's what I'd be doing vote for me I'm all four immigrants. I'm all four people coming here. I love cultures. I think it's great I love the Bosnian culture. I love the Italian culture. I love you know The Asian culture. I love the black culture. I love the white culture. I love all the cultures I think they all have things to offer and I like I think that's what makes America amazing Yeah, you know, I'm all for it But like when we're bringing people here by the millions that do not want to partake in that culture and want to bring their culture here That's a problem for us because that delutes the entire soul of America in a very real way Yeah, so you know ask your guys self do you feel more American or less American now than you did five 10 15 years ago I'm giving honest answer Well guys is giving to our third and final headline of the show headline number three I'm a three reads women's tech conference overrun by men claiming to be non-binary draws a mused reaction I love this have you seen this? No, I have no man. Listen these these people are wild, but this is like a backfire, right? Like this is what it is So a tech conference for women and non-binary workers in in the field last week was overrun by men Where an organizer said some unwelcome guests fosterly claim to be quote non-binary to make it in and some onlookers Watch the ensuing out cry unfold with amusement and a lack of sympathy quote You have to admit it's pretty funny watching a dude yelling about dudes being dudes I said outnumbered guest bin Ferguson on Wednesday Indeed Colin white chief impact officer of the group that organized the seminar a need to be Chast ties to 10 D's for Having lied about their gender who are they to judge someone's gender? How do they assume that they were not as out of unbinary in the non-binary binary system? What I mean who are they to assume someone's gender. That's what I'm saying As I'm saying maybe their gender fluid and today they felt like Just for the seminar they felt like switching it. Yeah. Yeah, right. It's weird. It's wild. It's weird how they don't want us to judge them, but they they're so quick to judge Yeah, so It continues to says quote yesterday it became clear That there are a far greater number of cis gender men that we anticipated simply put some of you lied about your agenda when you registered white Said at the conference outnumbered co-hosts. Oh, hold on. Yeah, before you go Well, if they're lying then what are you doing? Yeah, right How what makes this what makes you the the judge during executioner on gender identity? Right if they're lying and they're saying that they are something that they are not How do you know that they actually aren't that? Yeah, what makes the person like what makes them When I'm buying you Like bro the conversation like that this whole situation is so fucking good. It's great. Like this is what needs to happen more of it. Yes, you want to go do it? Yes Yes, I do. Yes, I do Yes, I do and Anisha. Yes, no Andy when I Yeah So it continues says outnumber co-host Emily Campinho said she didn't feel any sympathy for anyone at the conference who complained about men gaming the system quote What do you expect? Yes Of course you're going to have the whole camel eventually get into the tent because you have been totally fine with this nose going in there So here's a clip from the the seminar Um There's a shit set of dicks in there. This is amazing What is this event why why are they all why is everybody Uh from India. Yeah, I think it was a tech event. I'm that's I'm pretty sure I'm being for Vegas must have more balls than actual Americans bro Yeah, I think it was some sort of tech event so so there's actually a tweet here from uh Avney barman Um she tweeted quote Shocking to see how many men showed up to a women in tech career conference claiming non-binary on their GHC registration status shoving bullying and bribing the women there Yet I still get comments all the time quote I thought we solved the women in tech issue a long time ago Sad to see how low people are willing to go in the tough job market. What do you think we should do? Um, and then she tweeted this picture. I guess she got a message from another woman that was at the conference saying Uh, she the messages read it's crazy this year. I got shoved by a guy into a door frame a guy sold his one on one spot to this girl for a thousand dollars I was talking to a recuder a recruiter at hpe He whipped around me and started asking questions because he didn't want to wait in line Yeah, I mean listen Where do we start here? I mean, let's be real. Okay, like This is feminist this is a result of feminists. What you want it? Okay, this is what the fuck you guys wanted All right, you wanted to villainize man for every single thing that they've ever done and every single place They've ever existed in society and we have all every time the men said hey, we want an only man event We were called misogynist and fucking all these other names, right? So you do a women only event and people show up and women show up There you go and you get mad about it Like this is absurd shit, right? Men or men women or women it is what it fucking is. They're okay to have men only events It's okay to have women only events Whoever's better in the workforce you get the job That's how it should be if you're a woman and you happen to have a vagina Because you're a woman and you happen to be more skilled than the dude who is has a penis no matter how small Yes, you can get paid more than that person and have that job like that like This shit has gone so far overboarded. This is what we're resulted with and this is what's gonna bring it back to Reality, so hope spare I'm curious how many of these dudes just use the non-binary thing to try and get ahead in the in the career field, right? Like oh, this is there like anyone Yeah, but they're forced to have to right? Listen, it's bigger than that though. Yeah, because for years and years and years and nobody wants to admit this But I will say it is that Men who have been skilled at a at a position who have been higher skilled than women Have not gotten jobs because they're trying to do diversity and inclusion inside these companies Okay, and so there's all there's these differing points of view Uh, you know women can't get the same pay as men That's not that's been shown through research multiple times to not be true. Okay, so when we have the situation of hyper feminism And we have the situation of men who are lit and particularly white men who have been Uh denied jobs even if they're the highest skilled applicant in favor of women or other races Okay, you're going to have people start to cheat the system because they got a fucking eat No, all right, so that's what we're talking about here. This is real shit And this idea of diversity, equity and inclusion and giving people jobs because they have a certain skin tone is bullshit That's un-American in America in their legs or whatever or who you like to fuck or any of this shy you like to fuck them Yeah, bro, it's it should be meritocracy Who is the best person for the job who could do the job the best if you happen to be black and you happen to be a female Fucking great, man. Can you do the job right like that's what the fuck America's built on America's not built on Giving people shit because they were born a certain way That's like I can't control what I was born did you did you get to have a meeting before you came here? Instead choose who the fuck you were because I must have missed that motherfucking meeting Did you get one? Okay, well, I didn't get these guys must have all got one so like you know now it's their fault because they were born a certain way Okay, it's nobody's fault. They're born a certain way and we're living in a society that punishes people In many different ways for being different than other people And so we have to have a scale on which we judge people which is called meritocracy How skilled are you if you want to know what meritocracy looks like Look at a football game look at a baseball game. Okay, who's on the field The best mother fuckers in the world. All right. Well, there's no women on the field Well, no shit because women can't play fucking NFL football because they'll get fucking killed Okay, this date for that specific job those are the best people for the job and by the way the NFL is majority black Okay So what they're still the best dudes that could do the job. No, just meritocracy man None of that shit matters be the best if you ate the best stop the fucking bitch and get better dude That's it man like that's the whole entire game of everything. It's natural order dude And by the way, that's important society like there's a there's jobs that are important society Depend on strong men to do yeah, I think too many people are afraid of competitive nature I think that's so valuable to have that's why you raised my kids in sports Because in life you fucking compete the best wins And that's everything in life, you know, I'm saying but when you start doing this thing like well, it's not the best It's just the person that fits the bill then you start having you know sub average people doing jobs that are supposed to be like high experts It's a big problem in certain scenarios. It's like I understand the good what I listen. I could say this I understand Why people think it's a good thing. Yeah, like I understand that I do I really do I understand why people think okay Well, we need to work to get some of these people who may have lagged behind in other places into these field I understand that and I actually you know, there's no ability in that thought that I mean I think that's a good thought But when we're talking about That versus reality, right there's just certain jobs that have to be handled by people of certain skill sets And like if we're going to You know apply diversity equity inclusion to let's say being an airline pilot That's probably not really good for everybody flying on the plane, right? You know what I'm saying like in surgery Yeah, that's right. You gotta have open heart surgery. Yeah, really give a fuck. I don't want the guy to hit a D That's right. Yeah, I want the A plus guy Yeah, man, you know what? I was reading the reviews and you know this surgeon He he got straight A's and was the top of his class and but this guy's not the other guy. He's non binary I'm binary, you know three pronouns three pronouns. He's probably the guy. You know what? I mean the maim I'm sorry. You want to expose the hypocrisy of gender ideology Ask someone who they'd like to have operate on their fucking brain Would you like someone who was the best? Would you like someone who scored the best and you had the best track record or would you like the person who has pronouns? And graduated 75th out of a hundred To operate on your brain, which would you rather have? And anybody who says the person who is skilled is telling the truth and anybody who says otherwise is a hypocrite They're lying for sure they deserve it and it's natural slant. I'm operating I want the best and even if that best has three fucking pronouns are you the best? Well then you get there And that's the other side of the coin. The problem is It's not always the case Well, it's not you know why that's not happening because the motherfuckers are so worried about their fucking gender identity They can't put in the work to actually become skilled at what they do that's why they rely on the gender Yes, so they don't have to rely like if you all didn't worry about this shit like who you have sex with or what you think you are And actually worried about getting some real skills you wouldn't have to hack a A conference To get an opportunity, right like dude these things This is obvious stuff and it's like almost painful to the societies like this now Like it's just like imagine Asian teenagers, dude. I'm having explained to them. Do I do? Dude, why do you think I come in here man? Why do you think I do this? I don't come in here because it's fucking fun, bro Like you've known me for a long time. My life is pretty cool. Yeah Like if you what you guys are gonna see I'm posting day in the life starting on what Sunday You're gonna see some of my life It's awesome, but when you look at it Understand that I'm sacrificing a lot of that cool shit that I could be doing to come on here and do this show So that your kids don't grow up in a fucking shit hole And they actually grow up we're having the opportunities that we had do we make the most of our opportunities I don't know I tried pretty hard you tried pretty hard. We've you know what I'm saying? Yeah They deserve that opportunity and that opportunity has to be preserved by people like us. Yeah, so And it's not just you know Militarially like people have come up with this idea that preserving our country Only applies when we go over to Iraq right or when we go to Afghanistan Preserving the country actually comes from within and it comes with how we live on it every single day basis Are we living the life of an actual American citizen? Or are we not? Are we living a free autonomous life and deciding that we are free humans? Are we making ourselves healthy? Are we making ourselves Intelligent? Are we making the best of our opportunities or are we taking it for granted and letting it disappear? Because if it's not lived if the American dream is not actually lived Then it's going to cease to exist for the next generation And that's why I come in here every single day and fucking say this shit Like bro, it's not fun to go on the internet and say my opinions about all this stuff and have half the internet Legitimately every single day like dude. I could I could make the most beautiful Awesome motivational saying and it goes mega viral and I have for fucking 10 years Okay, and you'll have comments in there. I love this, but that guy's a piece of shit Like you know, it's like fuck man like I'm a piece of shit why because I I doing what I believe to be right You know what I'm saying? I'm standing for all of us like Dude if we don't live the American dream It's not going to exist and you guys out here who are thinking like what I can't do anything because I'm just a poor little me That's what they want you to think yeah, they want you to think your powerless They want you to think nothing that you do matters And if they want you to think that's so bad. What do you think the truth actually is the truth is actually that it's the thing They're most afraid of that's why they convince you that you're irrelevant They know that you're relevant if you started to believe that you're relevant things would change really fucking fast It's real shit man guys. That was a third and final headline You remember jump down in the comments. Let us know what you guys are thinking using hashtag. It's maim maim and let us know what you guys think bro. I want to do that do what you do I'm do I'm down. I'm gender fluid Sometimes I sometimes I feel a little bit feminine. I'm not gonna lie man. Yeah, well like I made you know Maybe it's always been in me. Yeah, you know, yeah, I don't know anything with a knife. That's right I'm feeling it coming out man. I'm starting to like evolve. I could feel it happening You know Apparently I can get a better job too bro. Nobody would say shit because I like how intimidating you look in part like they would even fuck Okay, all right Andy come this way Bro, I had this dude. I had this dude message me on the internet yesterday who knows me in real life And he's like bro these motherfuckers have no idea how big of a human being you are in real life And I'm like I Thanks Well, they wouldn't say it's your fucking face. No, they fucking bro. That's cuz the internet but dude the internet was saying 99% of the shit that's set on the internet would not be sudden person. Oh, dude We were younger. You say some shit you get smacked now. You don't get smacked So it's like they had the balls to say when guys are age will smack each other. Yeah, yeah Like if you dude you and I could be sitting at my house smoking a cigar like hey, fuck you It'd be fuck you and then we could fight and then 10 minutes later we'd be like bro. That was stupid Like that's the generation that we grew up in yeah, like my best friends that I'm like the best fucking friends within the world Are literally the human beings that I have fought the most physically in my entire life. How fucked up is that? Yeah, like I need some fucking therapy bro My best friend is my brother in my business partner and we've gotten in fucking probably two thousand fist fights That's fight closed shit. Yeah, but like bro. That's how you bond man. That was like the real shit Respect his bill this whole this whole pussy ass shit of guns and knives and thinking you're hard and shooting people out in the street Bro, you all a bunch of bitches like for real Real people real man go out and fucking box it out and then drink a beer afterwards. That's real man shit Okay, cuz respect is built that way. You know what? I better not say that to Vince in the next time like that Fight I don't want to fight a 250 pound gorilla bro. I'd rather not I'm probably gonna hold my tongue We should start hosting boxing here bro. That's what I'm saying. No, I have this amazing idea for this business concept I can't say on the air because it's so fucking good, but it solves this problem But for real talk dude like think of your best friendships that you've had over your life These are people at some point in time you've like really got into it or they fought with you in a battle Yeah, right. Yeah, and you know they're down to fucking throw down. Yeah, dude, and it's like It's it's it's sad that like a lot you know a lot of people are bitching about the young men in society What's wrong with them? I think a lot of what's wrong with them is that they're never able to participate in male rights of passages such as a fist fight Yeah, like it's not a real thing anymore It's exercise violence so the violence went away. Yeah, like dude I raised wrestlers The closest thing you can get without getting a trouble of engagement of of one-on-one engagement and him feeling the fear You learn a lot. Yeah, you learn a lot for wrestling And it's the one way of doing it legally where and there's nowhere to hide right if my son got a fight in school right now He'd be kicked out of that fucking school. He loses the option to be playing sports And it's a whole different world for us You get a fight gets in home in two days later your back at school no big deal Well bro and culture anymore these kids can't fist fight anymore because the dude one kid brings a gun to shoot them Because they get caught on the internet. Oh my son got in a fight and right away. I called the lawyer I'm like they're gonna sue me. Yeah, I was like oh this also culture Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the other side of it. You know, I mean like fuck that bro And if you think about that like if you think about that at scale and just think about that lawyer thing It's closing in our freedoms in Many different directions now because all of our laws are made by these lawyers Everything is over litigious Everything is being sued for and nobody wants to stop it because the people that can't stop it are also lawyers Benefit from correct. So there's that's a big correction, you know if I were president All right, I throw these motherfuckers in jail or the woodchipper and we would ease this up a little bit It's real shit. Oh for me You know what I really do what I'd stop graduating new attorneys I'd put a stay on it for like 10 years So you would you would you would lessen the amount of attorneys, okay? Because many would retire The ones in the middle will grow their careers. They have less competition They would love it because they're like, okay, we don't have to fight with all these young guys Yeah, and it would remove this over litigious nature that we have from too many lawyers See that I just figured that out in like three seconds. You think I couldn't figure this shit out You actually voted for me. Well for me So let's dive into this thumbs up guys our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads Cuba's iron man beat himself with a sledgehammer and survives unscathed Wow, just just off-dumself I guess that's just right off the cuff man So let's go over to Havana On a leafy bull of Arden downtown, Havana a man is beating himself with the sledgehammer on his risk Elbows and forearms drawing a crowd of pacifiers Who gathered to film the spectacle with their cell phones Was shocked the crowd is not the apparent self-mutilation, but rather the fact that he appears to come away unscathed Cuban iron man linoe Thomasin Said he wants inspired to be the next mic Tyson training to become a professional boxer By subjecting himself to millions of blows with the hammer and eventually moving From the Caribbean island to fight in Mexico City quote I had 27 matches one by knockout, but I retired because in the last of them I fractured the skull of my opponent and he died instantly Uh the stocky Thomasin recalled in an interview with roaders in Havana quote I gave away all the money I made in my fights to his family He said estimating the sum to be over a hundred thousand dollars a huge amount of money Promose residents of Cuba and quote I vow never to fight again Now time is in his sense written off fame and fortune and makes a far more modest living on the streets of Havana And nearby beach communities collecting tips from impromptu shows on a recent sultry summer morning The squat lean 32 year old chute on a half smoke cigar and wild a crowd by doing push-ups on his bent wrist With a full grown man on his back and then returns to beating himself with his sledgehammer Studiously pounding every joint in his arm on the wins of all Lucas here's a video Ah He is jacked he's yoke Ah shit Oh, man, but dude did what some people said.

It's not like it's like here. Yeah, it's a different thing As a little street magic to that there is for sure, but I will say It doesn't look like I would not hurt at all. No, that dude looks tough as fuck That big knuckle bro, that's a brass knuckle on his pants or a massive bro You ever notice like like why is it that all the guy like the fighters and stuff have huge hands like that Is that like a thing that happens because they fight I think it's because they fight or is that a thing that happened There's that will make someone good fighter.
