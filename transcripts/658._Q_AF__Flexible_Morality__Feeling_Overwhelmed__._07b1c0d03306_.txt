today we have a little midweek version of q and a f all right we're gonna throw you a little short one none of us like to throw those short ones you say we're gonna get you one this week because I actually have stuff to do I got a meeting right after this so we're gonna try to get you a little 30 minutes maybe a little 45 minutes get you some knowledge and get you moving on your way but this is q and a f and if you would like your questions to be answered on the show you could submit your questions a couple different ways the first way is guys email those questions into ask andy at andyfacela.com or you can go on YouTube in the comments section of the q and a f episodes and ask your questions right there make them good too let's get some good stuff going so if you want to know what the show is all about go back and listen to the previous however many episodes you want and I'll go through the intro but today for time I'm just gonna get right into it so what we got today you got three good ones for you I know you do guys andy question number one andy in a world where most people want a flexible morality to support their own poor behaviors and choices how do you explain a more objective morality on which to base personal excellence as a way to operate your life a tire of dealing with those that believe that they can do as they please and still expect that they deserve good results or even those that know they should be doing better but can't submit the skills or willpower to put it all together I believe that having a strong more foundation underpins the success that I found in life I appreciate your insights here and I feel as it's a critical concept that many people miss look here's the thing all right all of us have made mistakes all of us have live lives all of us have done things that we're not proud of and then we've worked to change the behavior so that we can become the kind of person we want to be there's tons of judgment in society but what you have to realize is that if you don't set the example for what you think the world should be it will not exist in reality it will never happen it's not about what you preach it's not about what you say on the internet it's about how you actually live and how you choose to represent what your moral code is in your life and that doesn't mean you're going to be perfect okay when I was in my 20s I was very judgmental because I hadn't lived any life when I was in my 30s I was less judgmental because I had a little bit more experience I could recognize some of the mistakes I had made when other people made them and I give them a little grace now that I'm in my 40s I can understand where you're going to fuck up your shit because guess what I fucked up everything all right so we're all going to make mistakes we're all going to have situations where we do things that we're not proud of the key is for us to learn from those things and to move forward knowing that we shouldn't do those things that's how strong moral fabric is developed a lot of these people like to come out and they like to preach and they like to talk and they like to tell you that you're a shitty person because you want to be successful or you want to build something or you're not living to their code the reality is is those people aren't even living to their code those people are fucking walking out of church at 400 fucking pounds bro they're not setting any kind of example for anybody they're not showing anybody what it means to live a real standard and that's the most important thing we could do it's not our job to decide where someone's standards should be it's our job to help guide them to where their standards should be through our example and when we do that things change they do not change any other way so yeah bro I can understand you get annoyed when you meet people who don't hold your standard but the reality is is you should have some grace for them and show them what it looks like to actually hold a standard because it's not that most people want to be pieces of shit it's that most people have never observed anything other than that so if they've never seen anything other than that it's your job to show them that and bring them along and yeah there's some people that want to be a piece of shit they want to have low standards they want to sit on the couch all day and consume Netflix and eat bullshit and beat and just waste their life away those people lost causes you cannot spend your life concerned about those people you have to help the people that at least have the drive and the will and the want to be better and the only way for us to do that is to live that in everything that we do so when I think about what the moral code should be in society it depends on how old you are because when you're 20 you don't know shit when you're 30 you know a little bit you've made some more mistakes when you're in your 40s you made some more and I bet when you're in 50s it's even more than that I don't know yet because I ain't there but the point is is that we should learn to have grace for others and realize that others don't have the same perspective that we have and as long as they have the drive and the want and the will to be better then it's our job to craft them into the right game because the problem is most of these people don't understand the game they they think they can win with their personal game being half-ass you can't win that way it's too competitive all right so we show people the way and then they follow but we don't tell them the way telling people the way will never help them get there it's always about showing them and you show them through your example so you know I don't think there's a there's a definitive answer where everybody should be at one given time because that would mean that we all live by the same experiences and that's just not true it takes lessons to get better it takes mistakes to learn the lessons so if we don't allow for that to happen because we're too busy judging everybody or canceling everybody or fucking disowning everybody because they don't live to our fucking standard how can anybody get ever better ever can't happen so that's my take on that bro I'm not the moral police I made a lot of fucking mistakes but I do the best that I fucking can every day to help people along show people what it looks like the best I can't I'm still not even close to perfect but people get improvements in their lives every day because of the example that you set or I set or anybody that chooses to hold that high standard and that's what the fuck we need to do yeah I love that man I love it guys is gets a question number two hey Andy you operated at a very high level with sharing what that looks like is incredibly helpful so thank you for that I'm wondering if you deal with feeling overwhelmed or ever get concerned about crossing the line into burnout if so how do you go about helping these kinds of things to stay at bay thank you for all that you do brother I remember what it was like to be poor I remember what it was like to be broke I remember what it was like to be fat I remember what it was like to be a loser and I don't want to be any of those things so when I start to get burned out I start to be grateful for the opportunity even be burned out I started to say fuck yeah this is hard but it's so much better than what I have before okay so we have to keep perspective real dude yes it's hard yes it's not always going to be fun yes it's going to be difficult yes you're going to want to quit over and over and over and over again but the difference between people who actually build shit and people who say oh I could have built shit if I really wanted to is the fact that they don't quit with shit gets hard okay so this whole idea and culture about burning out and needing to change and all this shit that's fine dude if you really are burned out and you're not happy with your life and you need to change it fine change it take a Mulligan make the change but I could tell you this if you take that fucking Mulligan every two years when things get hard you're never going to achieve anything in your life because it takes longer than that if you go two years here and then say oh this isn't for me whether it be a relationship a job anything a company whatever and you say oh I'm here for two years this isn't for me and then switch for two more years oh you know what I'm tired of this this isn't for me oh and two more years you know what this relationship's not for me anymore I don't feel the same way as I did in the beginning like dude you're gonna spend your life in two-year increments never accomplishing anything real because you're not putting in the time required to be an expert at your craft you can't master a skill in two years it's fucking impossible it doesn't matter what the skill is so if you can't master a skill in two years how are you going to build anything relevant if you switch from thing to thing to thing to thing to thing to thing I'm not saying you can't have a do over I'm not saying you can't change your relationship or change your career I'm not saying you can't do that but what I am saying is if you make a habit out of that you're gonna fucking lose okay so we have to understand that that is the reality of the game we are playing it takes time it takes effort it takes time to master the path forward for you to even create anything so when you start to get burnt out and you start to be overwhelmed you got to remember hey this is part of the this is part of the journey this is part of it there's gonna be times bro where everything's going wrong there's gonna be times where the works not going good you're not kicking ass things are in a look they're in a wall they're not great and you know what you got other problems on top of that you got problems in your relationship you got people in your family who are not doing well you got all these problems and bro it's overwhelming super overwhelming but if you quit it's all gonna be for nothing everything you did everything you put in everything that you attempted to do is gonna be for nothing so there's nuance here I'm not gonna see here and say you can't ever quit something sometimes the best thing you can do is quit something but if you if you make a habit out of it over and over and over and over again because you're quote unquote burnt out by Instagram standards which by Instagram standards every mother fuckers burn out for like having to tie their shoes okay it's you know I got my shoes got a double nine I couldn't untie it I got to have a mental health day like bro this is where the fuck we are in society and if that's where we are and you're gonna buy into that and subscribe to that I promise you you're gonna fucking lose you're not gonna be able to you're not gonna be able to build anything great because every time you're every time you're faced with hardship you're going to fucking say fuck dude I'm overwhelmed yeah I'm overwhelmed the burn out I need a mental health I fucking I got a quit and bro you're gonna spend your life not accomplishing anything and here's the here's the problem you're gonna get to be 70 60 years old and you're gonna say holy shit I fucking wasted my whole life based upon this bullshit so eventually look there's a time coming where everybody that buys into this is going to realize it was wrong that that's that's it and you want to avoid that because it's not true okay you're gonna be overwhelmed you're gonna get burnt out you have to push through and yeah if you need to take a breather take a breather you need to take a couple days take a day you need to take a vacation cool that's part of it but the reality is is that burnout is way fucking overhyped in society right now and it's causing people to miss out on big picture goals that they have for themselves because they're buying into victim culture that's going on they're saying oh you know this isn't for me you know every time it gets hard and if you shift from you know hard to hard to hard to hard to hard to hard to hard to hard to hard and you never pushed through the hard how can you ever get anywhere yeah you can't it's impossible I want you to think about this if you quit everything you ever did in two to three years which is the average job cycle for a fucking young person okay how can you get anywhere you cannot do it it's impossible because they repeat that cycle until they're 40 and then and then they're dude and then you got to work a job that you don't like just to survive and then that's where most people end up in their lives bro yeah and and if you're young and you don't want to end up there don't listen to any of these guys on the internet bro that's right let me actually this because I had a mentor when I was like coming up going to college and stuff and he told me and I remember because I remember telling him like I want to win on my man I fell overwhelmed and he said you're not overwhelmed you're inefficient right and so like I mean what's your take on that because in the way he explained it was like you know listen like when you start feeling overwhelmed that's a sign that you just ain't got your shit together you're not being organized you're not being efficient with your with your time I got me what what's your take on that it's hard to feel overwhelmed when you're kicking ass every day this is why I like the powerless system yeah okay because every single day you can feel like you want all right this is part of the confidence building aspect of the power list that we don't talk about very much there's a reason why we go day by day and there's a reason why we mark the win or the loss it's because you can flip back and you can actually see the streak so when you start to feel burned out and you start to feel like things aren't happening you start to feel like you know you need to change shit you can actually open up your notebook and say wait I won the last six months in a row like this is actually going pretty good and you can remind yourself of where the fuck you were you know before and by the way to your point you're effectively crossing off critical tasks that you know are moving you forward you're doing things that other people are not doing even if you aren't seeing the fruits of the labor yet you can look back and say well I planted that seed I planted this seed over here I've been watering these seeds and you know that they're going to sprout yeah okay and once you have a little success in life like once you get into your 30s and you start to realize whoa this is the way it actually works now you don't have any doubt you don't like when I when I set a goal and I start chipping away I don't doubt that it's going to work out because I know it's going to work out because I understand that this is not magic it is inputs and outputs it is math it is one plus one equals fucking two that's what we're talking about here so if you continue to chip in you're going to get out on the other side all right plant plant plant plant plant harvest harvest harvest harvest harvest and if you're effective in doing that every day it's kind of hard to feel overwhelmed because you know you're effective yeah and then vice versa when you do fall over overwhelmed and you go look back all the shit and and what happened hold on do this week yeah okay so you go back you feel overwhelmed you look back you say fuck I didn't even do my power list right I didn't even and now you have an understanding of why you feel that way which you can then correct so that's that's what I think I here's what I think I don't get burned out bro because I don't want to go back to where fuck I came from I don't give a shit what it takes like dude y'all must not hate where the fuck he came from as much as I do that's real shit y'all must not hate being broke as much as I did because I hate it so much bro that I don't fucking care I get up and I do what I got to do that's it's fucking adult shit it's what I could do yeah yeah I'm under no illusions bro there's no there's no illusions that my life is like there's no there I'm not I have there's nobody coming to save me I'm very aware of that I'm very aware that it's on my fucking back every single day I'm nobody's more aware than me okay I have lots of people that depend on me lots of people with families lots of people that fucking have futures and dreams at careers and I take that shit real fucking serious bro so it's really hard for me to understand people who say oh I'm burning out bro you don't have enough shit to fight for you don't have enough shit to care about because if you actually care for shit more than just yourself you wouldn't be burned out you say hey bro I'm getting up and going to war for these motherfuckers you see what I'm saying it's hard to feel burned out when you're fighting for the person to your left or the person to the right and if you're not doing that I can figure out how to make that your purpose because dude when that's your purpose like a lot of you that have kids you understand I get up every day and I don't get burned out because I got these fucking kids okay if you don't have that you need to figure out how to create that it's not about you it's about the mission it's not about you it's about them and if you could create that in your brain burnout really doesn't exist it's only exists when you're selfish and you're thinking about yourself guys 80 question number three third and final question Andy I remember you talking about having core values in your company and hiring and firing based on them I've implemented core values as my company about four months ago three years in and there's some adjustments for sure my question is what's the best way to help someone course correct when they've not been operating within the core values so not necessarily hiring or firing they're here I'm struggling with an employee right now I feel like they are aware and understand what the core values are but the core value and the core values aren't overly complicated they just aren't getting it any any thoughts or advice on this well I mean you can't make people abide by shit that they don't want to believe in you know if your core values of your your company and who you are which should align right because you can't make core values for a company that aren't allowing who you are because eventually it will expose you for not being that person and you won't be able to authentically connect with anybody because people will know it's not genuine so if you have value system for your company and people don't fit it and they refuse to learn it then you have to remove those people because what'll happen is those people start to undermine those values with the other employees so we have a way that we do things and if you don't want to do things that way that's okay you just can't work here and that's very simple it's not a it's not a I dislike them it's not a I hate them I hope they go on and do amazing things but that is something that if you want to if you want a quality culture in your company it's going to be very important for you to hold that standard and a lot of people compromise that standard they will put up with someone who who does not align with their value system because they sell a lot of shit or they will put up with someone who does not align with their value system for some other reason right you will yeah and the problem with that is guys is that that will erupt and spread into a cancer where everybody will start to you know be affected by that so it's a very important to understand that you know there are situations where it's just not a good cultural fit I mean that's reality like some people want to play baseball for the Cardinals because they do shit a certain way some people want to play for the braves because they do shit a certain way some people want to play for the Yankees right but nobody wants to play for these other shit teams they have no culture so like it's okay to have a different culture and understand that not everybody's going to vibe with it and there's going to be times where people don't fit and you know it shouldn't be a personal thing it's just reality now if you want to get them to flow into it you know those are conversations that's that a lot of people don't do the training right when it comes to culture they don't hold the standard right you know like when I communicate with my people I usually speak in terms of core values like if something's going on that is wrong I will say okay well this this is this and this and this are the three core values that this is violating right now and we need to fix that and they'll sell that makes a lot of sense right and they'll work on that but dude the reality is is like there's only so much coaxing you can do there's only so much coaching you can do some people just aren't aligned and it sounds like if you know this person knows the value system and they just aren't doing it that means they're making a conscious decision not to buy in and that means that they're probably not a good fit for your company let me actually this on on this topic because he mentions that he just implemented him four months ago but he he's been in business for three years is there something there with grace because he's been so long with sure you know what I'm saying like I mean you sure years without him and now you're expecting everybody in four months to just get it's going to take longer than four months yeah it's going to take a couple years to get these in so you're going to have to be patient with people you're going to have to coach people you're going to have to see you're going to have to learn to communicate like I just said in core value code right like when I'm teaching a lesson to the company I usually talk in terms of you know this value or that value or this value or this is what we stand for and I guide the behavior along those values not not based around you know abstract shit it's shit that they can see it's actually on the wall of our main auditorium so that I can literally point to it and say this is what I'm talking about right here so a lot of times when people put core value structure into their business they don't learn how to communicate properly around the core values and they just think that they can throw up a sign and everybody's going to this has to become an ecosystem bro you have to hire by this you have to fire by this you have to communicate by this you have to teach lessons like this you know like if I'm walking across the warehouse floor and there's a mess of there's a mess on the floor uh you know and I go back there and I start to clean it up what do you think happens what happens yeah everybody runs over okay everybody's all right exactly a couple dudes will run over and they'll be like no I got it I got it I got it no you don't yeah and I'll say to him I said no I got it I got it don't worry about it and I'll go and I'll put the trash in the trash whatever I'll clean it up right and those guys are usually standing there and by the way this never happens here anymore I'm talking about back in the day this never fucking happens now our squad our people here are fucking straight killers okay so I can't even tell you the laugh because I know you guys all listen so I'm not talking about you guys but back in the day okay and so I would correct that and then they would be all standing there and I'd say hey what core value you think that is what is that right and or I would say what's up with that why is that on the floor and they say oh and I'll say wait a minute what's that say up there on the wall it says take responsibility what's that one right below that say that says take initiative okay that means that's your problem to fix and that means you got to take the initiative to fix it okay you understand what I'm saying and I tell the guys that and they're like yeah dude totally you get it and it starts to teach little behaviors that then everybody does and the rest of the team starts to follow so you know a lot of these guys put these systems in place thinking that like a poster on the wall is going to somehow fix their company culture it's not yeah and it's going to take time it's going to take trust building it's going to take communication it's going to take you know reps it's going to take you understanding how to communicate so I do think that four months is way too soon for that for that kind of I actually was zoned out when you asked the question so I missed that I missed that four month part but yeah there is some grace there but then later you know go play this question back put the back part at the front in the front part at the back and you'll have the right answer okay later as you start to get proficient with this and you get good with this there's going to be people that just don't fit and that's okay man it doesn't mean they're bad people it means that they're just not a fit for you and they'd be happy they will be happier somewhere else and you will be happier with them somewhere else and so will everybody else around you so you know listen I could talk culture and teach culture for literally a week straight 12 hours a day and there's still be a fucking a month left to talk about it but that's the summary of the answer yeah you've got you got it you got to set the values you've got to hold the values of utmost importance you've got to reward your people around the values you have to communicate in terms of values you have to correct you have to hire you have to fire and that's a skill set that an operator needs to understand it's not just throwing a poster on the wall that everybody runs out of locker room and touches and thinks that that's like what it is it's not that bro it's a total ecosystem of communication and when you first implement it you're going to have pushback you're going to have people to say bro I'm not doing none of this shit and you know what cool go do none of that shit somewhere else but we here are going to do the shit this way and dude people appreciate that even if it's not their way because at least they know what the fuck it is you know most places have no culture at all bro it's carrying in the kitchen on the birthday hey everybody wants a birthday cake today yeah it's fucking horrible you know what I'm saying like if you want to build a company that people you know and by the way that doesn't cure all the problems bro it doesn't mean that there's not going to be hard times it doesn't mean there's not going to be difficulties but what it does mean is that when you guys face those difficulties people are going to work in cohesion to solve them as a team not just say ah fuck that's not my problem right so it's a big deal there's a lot to learn there if you want to learn more in depth about how to build culture that's why we do our to syndicate so we this is what we teach we teach how to operate companies top to bottom it's not a seven hundred ninety nine dollar course to make money bro I'll teach you how to run your fucking company and so what and that's what we do so well guys Andy that's three yep go pay to fee oh
