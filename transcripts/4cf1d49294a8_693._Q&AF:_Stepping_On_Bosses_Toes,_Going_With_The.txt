and like what what type of poop are we saying like my normals no like a nugget just I'm just like just a little nugget yeah I mean I'm gonna need I'm gonna need something I'm gonna need some I'm gonna need some coins where is it what is it oh it's like I'm gonna need at least a like you gotta give me like at least 10 million bro 10 million somebody that's a big number man it's a million I mean that's the reasonable 10 million to eat a piece of your shit your own shit like three inches not even a big okay now you're increasing it no like this little nugget like this like your six inches like that size what would it take I'd say for every inch it'd be another 10 million so that's 30 million 30 million dollars bro bro I need a three inch piece of poop for 30 million that's what I'm saying I don't like no question yeah I do it I know how hard it is to make that shit with the poop no it's like a 30 billion yeah sometimes the poop too anyway you get to wash it down yeah hey this is this is we're getting right into the personal development this is it we're all this show that goes from capitalism yes from eating your own poop to talking about how to be better yeah that's it yeah well let's do so we're gonna make you so wealthy that you don't have to eat your own poop that's a tagline right there it's good there yeah I like it well guys Andy let's get into it guys Andy question number one 80 I'm an entrepreneur at a medium-sized company a few Q&As ago you talked about how entrepreneurs should be striving to create value and how the really great ones take initiative and fix issues on their own my direct leadership has been slacking in a few areas there's been some grouse in the team and so I took some initiative and addressed a few things for the team and the team absolutely loved it fast forward a few days I get called into his office and was told that I stepped on his toes long story short I've vented about what what it was causing in the team and how I take responsibility for it and what my intentions were and he wasn't trying to hear now there's a few people above him in management should I consult them do I try them in the trust and kiss ass this dude's a pussy and I'm just trying to win what's your thoughts well look this is a legitimate question because when you are trying to make a difference in the company and you take initiative especially with leadership and you have someone that you report to if they're not a strong leader if they're not a if they're not a very confident capable strong leader there will probably be some defensiveness from that person because what they'll see it as is this person's trying exactly like he said step on my toes steal my thunder undermine my authority when in reality you're just trying to do your job so that we can win so go get fired it's not about getting fired bro it's it's you know there's there's just management and certain companies who have the wrong attitude they have the they have the attitude of I rule over you instead of we are on a team and we need to win and a good manager someone who is competent and capable and understands that this doesn't take away from them when they win they're going to celebrate initiative they're going to be happy for initiative they're even if it's wrong they're going to say fuck dude I appreciate that you took initiative but next time let's do it like this because they understand that that doesn't make them look bad it makes them look good when they win all right so you might have an issue here with someone you know who is insecure because they know they're slacking and they don't necessarily want to own up to that so they take it defensively and they believe that you are trying to undermine them and in that case there's a couple different options one you can have a more conversation with him and that's not kissing ass that's hey bro listen you pay me to help you win okay that's what I do here I'm trying to help you win you asked me to help you win you're paying me to help you win I want you to win that's all I'm trying to do and and that's sort of conversation where you kind of stand up for yourself can go a long way with people like that I'm not trying to undermine you dude I'm trying to help the team and I know you're busy I know you're trying to do your thing you know don't call them out on his slacking you know what I'm saying but say hey I know you're busy with other things I know you got this going on let me fucking step in and do this and the fear on their point is that you will become so good at what you do that it will be recognized that you are better than them but in that scenario it's good that you take the initiative if you're in the right company because it'll progress your career and it'll also make that guy start to move okay the reason that these managers get complacent and they don't move is because they don't have people underneath them pressing them with the results that they're producing so as someone who's subordinate to an insecure leader like it sounds like you are you need to push them to improve with their performance by having great performance yourself now that's one way to handle it now if you went around the office and you said well fucking Joe is not doing his job so I got to do it yeah you are undermining him and he does have a right to be pissed those conversations need to be happened in behind closed doors not out with other people because that makes you a cancer if that were happening my company I would fire that person immediately no matter how true it is yes because it's cancerous okay or now you can go out and you continue to do what you're doing you keep getting better and if this guy steps in your way again you can go to someone above him and say hey look I'm having a lot of trouble man I'm not trying to throw anybody under the bus I like this guy Steve he's all right dude but I'm trying hard to win and I'm I'm being told to not do these things and you know that's that's a way you could go but there's going to be in some situations there could be some backlash to that in reality I don't think that's a bad thing because if you that if you're initiative and you're driving your want and will to win isn't appreciated where you are then you need to be somewhere where it is appreciated so that you have upward mobility for yourself and your family all right so you this is this comes down to just doing the right thing working as hard as you can being professional handling things like an adult and if it's not welcome bro it's time to find a place where you would be welcome I can tell you this initiative is one of our core values okay the three most valuable skills an entrepreneur can have is the ability to sell the ability to lead and the ability to take initiative and move a project from concept to completion without having to be told exactly what to do if you have those three skills and you're good at it you're going to write your own check in almost any company that's hungry to win and this goes for a lot of you guys a lot of you guys that are entrepreneurs you need to understand that not every company is trying to grow not every company is trying to be big enough to where you can actually build your career inside of it you want to get within aggressive company you want to get where the company that has huge plans and huge dreams and then back set up with action because what that means is that you will have opportunity to build an amazing career underneath that and dude a lot of companies just they like that so you got to have the acuity to be able to observe and sense are you with the company that's going the right way are you with the company that's trying to win are you with the company that's trying to become so big that you can build your entire life within that framework of that company and dude the answer for most companies is no most companies want to be medium-sized companies that's all they want to be the owners want to collect a moderate check and they don't really give a fuck about growing the careers of the people that work there you know for me dude I could have quit trying to grow first form and s2 and all the shit we got going on years and years and years ago but I figured out along the way that that wasn't okay because I have people who have invested their whole professional lives since they were 19 years old inside this company that deserve to have a chance to build their dreams and that means when they invested up there in the beginning and they believed in me and then I just get to the point where I'm good and then I fucking bolt what kind of person does that make me that's an unloyal disloyal mother fucker bro and I think that I think that kind of person yeah so I come in here every day I give everything I got so that the people in this building can build their careers as well and that's another thing you should look for your leadership and your ownership should give a fuck about building careers for their employees and if they don't you need to find somewhere that does because you'll waste your whole life there yeah and let me actually this because I feel like you know I don't know how old this person is but I feel like there's a there's a lot of people out there that just have a problem just simply standing up for themselves right just simply handling those hard or tough conversations right like do you have any tips or tricks or things that you've learned you know going because I mean did you started in business when you were 19 where you know the world might look at you as this young person right now really take you serious how do you handle those different conversations how do you handle that conflict resolution how do you handle that dude look that's a that's a skill in itself okay well you have to realize is that you are in charge of your own progress and if you lack the ability to give feedback or have difficult conversations what usually ends up happening with those people is they start to observe a bunch of things they don't like I don't like this I don't like that I don't like this I don't like that and because they lack the courage or the understanding of how to address it properly meaning going to your leadership sitting down saying hey this is this is a problem this is a problem this is a problem you guys aren't seeing this you know whether you got HR whoever your direct leadership is you go to them you sit down you tell the truth what usually happens to these people who bottle everything up as they start to get bitter and they get resentful and then they come in one day and they're like fuck this place I fucking hate this place and they fucking leave and like they leave without ever bringing it to the leadership thinking that we can just guess on what the problem is you know what I'm saying like my readers yeah bro and nobody is and so you have to understand that there is no value and just shutting up there is tremendous value and speaking up and telling the truth to HR are your direct leaders because most of the time the problems that you're having are oversights because everybody else is worried about what's going on in the playing field so it's hard to see holes when you're worried about offense and you're worried about putting points on the board it's hard to see those so if you are an entrepreneur and you can bring those issues to your leadership tactfully as a team player not as a bitching high maintenance nag employee but as a contributor hey here's a couple of problems I noticed I've experienced this I've experienced this I think we need to fix these things so that we don't cause an issue with the culture and there's also this other little thing and you know I'm not upset but I want you guys to know and I think we do need to fix it because it's starting to get a little chattery all right that kind of feedback is fucking immensely valuable because most of the people that are running things they just can't see that shit you know what I'm saying it's like it's like I'm the general right and we're at we're in battle and you're fucking 30 miles out there on the fucking line you know way over here and you're getting fucking killed right but because you don't want to bother me or you don't want to give me feedback or you don't want to report back bad news you just continue to get killed and we lose the fucking battle you see what I'm saying so feedback back and forth as a contribution and a team is super important and if you can be an entrepreneur that can have you know they're not difficult conversations dude yeah these are just conversations you got to stop prefacing this thing is like difficult conversations they're not fucking difficult they're fucking factual okay so have a factual conversation don't bring drama don't bring gossip don't bring bullshit bring fucking facts and bring a solution to the problem if you can become someone that does that your value goes way the fuck up because the leadership says hey that guy's bought in that guy cares that guy looks out for the company and when the time comes for you know the conversation about who the next leadership is or who who can be trusted to do this or that that person gets talked about and eventually if their skill sets good enough they get to move so there's this false idea of being stoic and not complaining that actually holds your value back because it's not complaining and it's not a difficult conversation it is a factual conversation and we bring solutions to try to make the team better and dude how do you do this you just fucking do it you you you you fucking do it you go do it you sit down the first time you're gonna be nervous and don't do none of this shit either where you go well no trying to you know like complain and I'm not trying to you know blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah well then don't complain and don't bitch just say the facts hey here's a hole in the game here's a hole in the game we got to fix these holes and you know I just want to let you guys know yeah yeah I was thinking too you know you're like those people that you know bottle it up and then they just walk in one day and like oh fuck I feel like that's that's what happens if they're lucky I think what a lot of people happen to is they bowled a shit up and then they just learn to accept it well no dude and shit about it not only that dude here's what happens they start because they're fucking pussies they start talking to everybody around them bro they start complaining to everybody around them and they start trying to destroy things in the company because they're too fucking pussy to have a conversation that's exactly what it is okay so the reality is is dude if you can't have difficult conversations quote unquote difficult conversations that aren't even difficult you lack the ability to succeed and get paid that's it yeah I love it I love it guys Andy question number two Andy I hear people talk about how important it is to be flexible and to go with the flow I've been told to be more easy going and I should try to take it easy let it go or worry about it tomorrow maybe I'm not quite understanding what the message is but I have a but I definitely do have a difficult time just going with the flow there's been times we're being flexible slows down my progress and also times we're not being flexible may have worked against me I love your opinion on when it's time to be flexible in life when pursuing great health and success go with the flow what you wish it was you take on that 95% of the time it's that's something that's said by fucking lazy loser people who don't want to be held to a standard that you're holding for yourself so you're out here trying to hold a high standard you're trying to work hard you're doing all this shit and they're saying oh just go with the flow man don't work too hard here they don't it's loser shit those people will always be broke and let me tell you something else bro if you're going to build anything great in your life it's going to be through fucking force it's going to be through complete rigid dedication and discipline to move forward and when the people come and they get in your ear and they say take it easy you're working too hard you got to you got to learn to go with the flow just know that if you listen to those people you will be exactly like those people do you think fucking Kobe Bryant went with the flow do you think Tom Brady went with the flow do you think Muhammad Ali went with the flow do you think any fucking person Elon Musk any person that you look up to went with the fucking flow no they didn't they said I'm going here and anybody who gets in my fucking way I'm going to run him the fuck over that's what they said that's the attitude they have and that's the attitude of champions so that's how I look at those kind of statements go with the flow take it easy now are there times where you're wrong and you do need to go with the yes 100% but you have to have the ability to audit yourself and remove your ego you need to be able to discern between am I stuck to this idea because it's my idea or am I wrong and these guys have the best idea you see what I'm saying and if you can't evaluate that by removing your ego and honest you lack the ability to lead you lack the ability to progress but 90% of the time these people who say this shit are completely weak they're super lazy they're never going to amount to shit and they're going to fuck your life up if they get in your ear so I would ignore them I would look at them and I would say what do they look like what kind of money do they make what kind of house for the living what kind of car do they have what kind of life do they live and I'd say do I want that and then if they tell me to go with the flow and I don't I'd be like fuck I didn't go with your flow yeah right what's their flow look like yeah right it looks like shit 95% of the time yeah all right so are there times when you got to give a little bit yeah are there times when you got to you got to concede that maybe you didn't have the best idea but somebody else did yes that's called being a smart guy don't you want to win you said oh being go with the flow help my progress back why would you fucking let anything hold your progress back if you know you're not supposed to go with the flow don't go with the fucking flow it's that simple dude yeah become the flow shit well dude that's the thing your job is to be able to walk in the room and influence the fucking room because you have a consistent track record of willing things and forcing things into reality and when you've done that for a number of years you won't have to convince anybody anymore because they will look at you and they will say DJ fucking gets it bro I think we need to listen to what he's saying you see what I'm saying no no but most of that shit's loser shit I wouldn't listen to anybody about fucking anything that you don't want their life for real yeah that's real shit that's real shit well guys Andy our third and final question Andy the question number three Andy this may be more of a thought provoking question for you but I'm really curious to hear your thoughts on this at this point in your life 25 years in all the work the blood the tears you've put in do you still have any anxiety bigger small that it won't work no I've never I've never thought that it won't work I've never thought that even when I started I never thought it I thought we'll figure it out we'll make it happen that's what I always thought dude and that's the attitude you have to have okay you're not gonna get something given to you it's not gonna come easy it's not gonna be stress free it's not gonna be anxiety free it's not gonna be frustration free that's the thing you guys miss about going out here and building success nobody's bringing it to you it's not coming to you you don't deserve it it's not fair you you're you're gonna have to earn every fucking bit of it and bro quite honestly you're gonna have to go fucking take it and you can't go take it if you're worried about it not working okay because it takes a hundred percent of your energy to go out and make shit happen and if you're spending 10% or 20% or 30% of energy afraid that it's not gonna work you can't put the proper amount into moving forward into giving the right amount of offense which is the key to getting this built okay so you have to force this into reality the internet has made business and entrepreneurship seem and success seem like it is easy and it's abundant and it's for everybody and the reality is it fucking isn't okay there are limited spaces at the fucking top there are limited slots on the fucking playing field for you to get a starting position bro just because I want to be an NFL football player doesn't mean that I can fucking manifest myself into an NFL football player there is a limited number of spots and I've got to compete and be great to be in one of those and your income bracket and your position in the world is the same exact way and we have all these fucking knuckleheads out here on the internet talking about how it's unlimited success and you could do bro no it's not okay you are competing with actual human beings there are limited number of spots if you want to be in the game if you want to be on the field if you want to be an all-star if you want to be a Hall of Famer you are going to have to get aggressive and you are going to have to force your will into existence into reality there is no easy way there's no quick way there's no risk freeway there's no anxiety freeway and when you think there is you're setting yourself up for failure this is why this idealistic viewpoint of entrepreneurship and business is so damaging okay you see all these dumb fuck coaches out here selling programs who've never done a motherfucking thing who have never built a business who have never truly become successful outside of the money that they make selling programs and they are telling you all this crazy shit that just isn't fucking true you need to come to terms with the reality and you need to learn how to listen to people who have built real things that are teaching you you guys need to quit listening to these internet dumb fucks who don't know what they're talking about they never built anything real outside of selling you a program about how to do something that they never actually did and if you don't learn how to vet people and you don't learn how to ask do they have a business do they have customers do they have employees cannot buy their product how long have they been doing it how good are they at it what's the business do what's it worth how is it is it dominant is it shitty can I even see it or it was one of these magical things that doesn't exist oh you know I made a hundred million dollars back in the day no you fucking didn't you didn't let's see it let's see your career right okay and then on top of it I don't get anxiety because I have a very comprehensive understanding of what the equation of success is it is inputs and it is outputs it is math it is two plus two equals motherfucking four and that is as simple as it gets okay so when you understand how it works and you remove this idea that it's not competition and you know you're gonna eventually make it just because you want to and you know successes for everybody and you get your ass to work the way that you need to work and you understand that the inputs you get in the seeds you plants there are going to produce fruit in time now you're on the right track but but dude if you understood the formula you wouldn't have anxiety I just understand it better than you because I've been down it and a lot of people don't a lot of people listen to all this idealistic shit on the internet and they get the wrong idea and then when they get the wrong idea they go execute on the wrong idea and then when they execute on the wrong idea they don't get any results and you know what they end up doing they end up saying fuck it's me I don't have what it takes no you it's not that you don't have what it takes is that you're following a bad plan that's told to you by someone who doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about and then you believe that it's you because you know apparently everybody else is winning with this when isn't even true in the first place you guys got to stop believing the shit on the internet this bullshit this is why I've started to like flex my actual companies a little bit because you all need to know what real motherfuckers look like versus the internet it's a big difference but at the end of the day here it is it's real competition you better go hard or you're not going to get on the fucking team you're certainly not going to be an all star and you're not going to be a hall of Famer and you know what a hall of Famer is that's someone who makes millions and millions and millions of dollars which is I assume is what the fuck you want if you don't want that maybe you could be an all star but that person's still pretty fucking good and if you just want to be on the team bro you're not going to do very well you got to be great and you got to understand that you're in competition and you got to understand that what you put in today will produce results tomorrow 90 126 months a year from now which will be reflective and in proportion to the effort that you put in day by day by day by day by day so whenever seeds you're planting today whatever seeds you're planting tomorrow whatever seeds you're planting the next day those will bear fruit out and over the course of time in proportion to how much you do now and that is it dude there's no other magic to this there's no secret formula there's no hack you can't speed it up it just is it's when it is it's it's it's is like gravity is that's what like the sun is okay it just is and then lastly you know why I don't have anxiety because what the fuck else am I going to do I don't even have a college education bro I want to make it go dig ditches I'm not digging ditches I'm going to make this fucking work so if you take away the options of failure and you take away the options of it not working out you have to be all in because it's the only option and dude when you start a business when I started my business it was the only option if I didn't do it I would be work at construction bro no offense to construction workers I respect the fuck out of them but bro I didn't want to do that hard ass work my whole life yeah I know my my family's from construction bro I know what 40 years of construction does to someone it's hard on them bro and I respect the fuck out of those are real men but dude I'm be real I'm too soft to do it I didn't want to do it my whole life so to me I didn't have a fucking option my option was go fucking make it work or do something that was unacceptable for me to do that was it and and dude as you get down the path as you become more successful and you do have options you have to figure out ways to make it feel like and seem like you're you don't have any more options which continues you down the path so like bro I don't I don't deal with anxiety in that regard the only anxiety that I deal with is when I'm not executing at that pace and I'm not going hard and my body's telling me man you should be doing this because that's what anxiety really is anxiety is is an indicator a physical manifestation of an indicator that you need to do something that you aren't doing and because I am one of those people who is built for the fucking game I am built for the fight anytime I try to go on vacation anytime I try to take it easy anytime I try to go find balance I am fucking miserable and dude that might not sound okay to you but there are people that are different not everybody's out here trying to go on picnics and have lemon I don't give a fuck about that I want to fight I want to win I want to kick ass that's who I am and if I'm not doing that I feel like shit okay so I go do it and I think you'll you'll feel the same because we as human beings need a purpose we need a mission and all these motherfuckers out here are complaining about their mental health their biggest problem is they don't have a big enough mission they're not committed to something they're searching for the meaning of life instead of creating the meaning for their own life okay so no I don't get the anxiety you're describing I get it for other reasons I get it because I'm not going hard enough or I'm trying to take a break or I'm trying to put myself in a box at all these other fucking people on the internet do when we're when we're bombarded by you know self care and victimhood culture and all this shit it creeps into us and we start thinking like damn dude you know maybe there's something wrong with me for going hard maybe there's something wrong with me for wanting more but dude I'm gonna tell you right now that's bullshit because the world fucking needs it the world needs people to go out there build companies provide careers create success sponsor little league teams take care of the community inspire other people with the lives that they live and create a ripple effect that other people want to follow and without those people our culture is fucking dead we need people who are straight up motherfucking killers going out and building amazing shit so that your neighbors and their kids and your kids and everybody sees it and they say damn dude that's possible I can do that he did it I know that guy he's just a normal guy puts his pants on the same way I do look what he did the world needs that shit more than it's ever needed it so dude go fucking hard stop listening to these people who cry and complain and bitch about everything in their lives and realize that the happiest you're gonna be in your entire life is when you look back on it and you said god damn dude I fucking did some real shit I helped some real people I inspired people I built shit that matter I provided this and this and this for my community those are the things they're gonna make you proud and you're not gonna die with a bunch of regret like 99% of people I love it man I love it well guys handy that was three yep don't be a hoe shut the shut in the cold bad bitch who did slow gotta own bank row can't fault does a note here shot case clothe clothe
