Let's just start you know When you were young and we'll get to where you are now. Yeah, just kind of give people a background. Yeah, so I grew up I was born in Oak Ridge Tennessee or next to Knoxville grew up in San Francisco Bay my dad is a race horse veterinarian My mom actually got her PhD in environmental science at Berkeley and Golden Gate fields a race track in the bay at recently closed down really sad deal, but you know grew up there Huge 49er fan. We were a dynasty. We I wasn't a 90 but But you know Montana rice Roger Craig I got a Montana and rice here at first one. Have you yeah, I'll leave both of them. That's that's a fair one or two Oh sweet. Yeah, I mean there I mean that they're back Yeah, yeah, just haven't got over the hump so you're gonna put it together. Yeah, we'll get there. Yeah, we I keep saying we they like who's this guy but yeah, and so football with my favorite sport growing up all my heroes were athletes, you know When I was little I played soccer then I played baseball then I played basketball and I just never played football part of it was just getting hooked on those other ones young and I Think being a little smaller. I was always a late bloomer It was like well, I don't want to get cut. I don't want to ride the bench. So I just didn't do it Get to high school their high school I ended up graduating from didn't even have a team And I just never played and stuck with me that regret for years so fast forward graduate high school Move to San Diego worked on a fishing boat for about a year and then moved up to Los Angeles with an interest in Film a TV and stuff like that and then 9-11 happened not right away but soon after you know join the army and the military special forces and I'm in Iraq in 2009 Watching the Texas Longhorns make a championship run unfortunately lost to Alabama in the Nadi but Made the decision to finally go to college, you know and and leave Active duty went into the guard so I go I the only place I in in listed only place I what do you call applied? Yeah, it was a Texas because You know, I wanted to go I thought Texas gonna be a cool place to go as a veteran Austin was an awesome town and I just was like well, that's where I'm going. I'm just gonna figure it out. So got in walked on the football team joined the Texas National Guard and So then while I was playing ball Every summer I was going back over to Afghanistan and kind of just living this I don't say double life because it was I was the same guy But this high octane. Yeah, you know up tempo life of like football Take your finals early go to Afghanistan come back for training camp, you know do it over again, and it was awesome That's a fucking wild. It's awesome dude. What you guys do for summer? You know, yeah, I spent the first summer in Austin and you know, everybody leaves because it's hot and schools out and I worked at a bar for a little bit and I was just like man I miss I just missed the fight. I missed the guys. I miss the mission, you know, all that stuff So when that opportunity came around I was like, I you know, I'm doing this So it was it was a good deal and and you know Mac Brown and Admiral McCrave and both were like on board, you know to like make this happen because everyone McCrave was a so Con commander at the time and he actually went to Texas and so they kind of helped orchestrate the situation So I'd come back in time for football, but I was volunteering. It's like yeah, I didn't have to go over there But yeah, I was like I mean I would love to I want to give somebody a break. That's an opportunity. Yeah That's cool. That's awesome. So you just so so it's humid in Austin. You know, I just want to get out of the yeah It's a dry heat in Afghanistan. That's yeah, so so Look first of all, I don't think it's a secret everybody who knows that I'm a huge University of Texas Longhorns fan So you just decide I'm gonna go play for the fucking long horns At and then I'm gonna try to yeah, but yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, that's fucking great. Yeah, that's awesome So you did you end up playing past college? I went to the Seahawks for about five minutes. I don't know if you remember this, but you oh, that's a take that picture down That's the worst picture. What happened to you then that move? What you get what you get stunned by some bees there, bro You're on that DJ diet program I Wade about seriously take that down Everything DJs that he's taking back No, isn't that Thank you There's better ones you can find if you got a dig No, so I yeah, I don't know if you remember this, but I yeah, so I was a long snapper. I got to Texas I walked on as a safety the only reason I made the team is because I went hard as hell On every drill I was getting run over but I just bounce up and you know, let's do it again And so they're like oh, it'll be good to have them in the locker room My sophomore year I start long snap and cuz it started graduating and I was I pitched in baseball at a decent arm Figured out how to long snap and won the job so did that for three years and when you know when college ended I I played in college at like 190 195 and I got to play in the senior All-Star game in Charleston the Medal of Honorable the Medal of Honor Society actually hosted the game Which is really cool and there was NFL scouts there and they were like You got to put some weight on but you can snap it you should give it a go and I was 34 at the time But for that position that's crazy a little older like it, you know, you can do it and And so I did I put on 30 pounds as that picture shows in like four months and sorry take it down And it was it was terrible like terrible weight but necessary weight Yeah, I mean you're in the NFL the difference in college. You're a free-releaser on punts So basically you snap it you don't have to wait to the balls kick you can just go down field as a gunner And the NFL only the gunners can do that so if you're online as scrimmage and You snapped it I had to like you know shuffle and block. Yeah, so I'm block my first ever Puntsnap was against the Broncos and I and I look up and see Von Miller like Luckily, I didn't have to block him who's a fucking specimen monster That would have been blocked immediately But yeah, so you had I had to block so I had to put that put the weight on and but yeah, you You sent me a little first form care package back in 2015 and I'm not just saying this I said this before before you even came in the room, but it was best protein I ever had So that's awesome. It was I was psyched man. It was it was cool. But yeah, it's a Just getting that opportunity a full circle bro played in one game and got to Got just like in in college, you know the equipment manager comes in the locker room before the game and I'm nervous because it's the NFL you know what I mean Yeah, and he comes up to me and he's like hey, I noticed in college You led the team out of the tunnel with the American flag for for every game, you know Do you want to do that today? Oh, I was like yes? Kidney and so I lead the team out of the tunnel and you know I get on the sideline anthem starts playing. I freaking start ball and you know thinking about bunch of stuff Yeah, it was cool and then I got cut three days later. Yeah as it goes, but I'm so grateful I was so grateful for that opportunity. Yeah, that's incredible. It was cool. Yeah, that's incredible 34 34, you know shows you do don't don't don't quit You know, we that was a big that was a big turning point in my life to what I was 34 36, okay? Yeah, I oh when that at the same time as your two years old. Yeah, when I was it was just It was I was fucking 350 pounds, bro, and like Everything changed, you know, like I was about to post this last night like my my picture now versus my picture when I was 36 just to show people like a lot of these dudes that are 36 are like oh, I'm old my life is old bro You don't even fucking started yet. Yeah, I'm saying so I've read somewhere a while ago like By 2050 in America if you're a healthy American like a lot of people will be centurions, you know a lot of people will make a hundred So if you're 36 you're a third. Yeah, no the way there. Yeah, so yeah, come on. It's crazy what you know, just Moving a little bit eating some good food will do for you exactly make a young man exactly and that's something that's interesting about veteran and athlete community And you know, I got a charity that I co-founded with jagalais are called MVP merging vets and players and you know We bring together combat vets and former pro athletes and help them find purpose and identity when they lose a uniform but typically You're in your 20s or 30s and That you it's over, you know, you get you get cut or the military Maybe you can still serve in the military, but you won't be you know kicking the door down anymore whatever and you're so young But you you feel like you've peaked, you know, and you'll be great again So like that that's a really common occurrence in the military so 36 you're like, oh, I'm yeah, I'm trash I'm old man. Yeah, you know, I'm done. Yeah, dude. It's it's super I spoke into a number of groups about that same thing It's a it's a common passion for me to is helping people find purpose after they transition out of the military Specifically in entrepreneurship. I've given a number of talks to a number of groups over the years about that topic and You know to anybody out there. I mean, we're you know I'm with the show here in just a second But I think this is an important message, you know Anybody out there that's you know in their late 30s especially man and you're like dude I don't do listen you got to find a purpose, bro Like this is why you feel off just try to yeah the reason you feel down the reason you feel off the reason you feel depressed Has to do with you were a big part of a team and a big part of a purpose and a mission whether that be athletics or Serving or whatever and you got to find something like that, bro Like once you find a bigger purpose and a bigger mission again You're gonna feel at home, dude, and that's something that you know I think all of us need reminders of from time to time because dude as as human beings in our nature We're not selfish people. We're actually servants and that's what brings us, you know It gets us out of the dark place totally, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, no, I mean we're and we're pack animals Yeah, for sure like a lot of I see a lot of guys in the vet community a lot of athletes I think it done whether it's on their own terms or not usually it's not sadly and They're like they want to distance themselves from that thing. Yeah for multiple reasons sometimes it's like You know that it was hard. Yeah, and it was just like or I feel awkward kind of so in that community So they they they push away and kind of try to do everything alone Mm-hmm, it's like a weird Letterman's jacket. They were like they don't want to wear it at all Yeah, well bro isolation, you know, there's a reason that isolation has been used as the worst form of punishment for thousands of years It's a good point. Yeah, I mean it's not because it's good for you Yeah, you know, and I know a lot of people these days like to say including me that you know I like being alone, but I like being alone as long as I'm still around a lot of people For like a time. There's a time and like every day like some alone That's what I'm saying and I mean people when I say that guys you need to understand I'm around hundreds of people all day long every single day and you know when I've struggled with anxiety and and dark times in my life the one thing that always made me forget about it At least temporarily was being around other good people. Yep, so I think finding that purpose and I think that's a noble cause is what I'm trying to Get to appreciate it. It's awesome. Yeah doing that. Hey, I mean I need it as much as anybody else Just like the Bosley hair thing, you know also a client. Yeah But But it's true like I need I need that I need the I need that group I need something to fight for you know, I need a mission. I need all those things and That's an athlete's uniquely those careers do they do they end young There's a lot of sacrifice involved in being elite. Obviously. It's different sacrifice war sports battlefield ball field different places But they look up to each other. There's that mutual respect because you know how hard it is to do what you do It's full commitment. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, you also Got into some acting and been able to do some of that tell it tell us a little because you were actually one of my favorite favorite movies I know which one you're gonna say which one? Den of these Theses fucking great movie my favorite movie of all time, but you better really really really It's like Christian Christian Goodyga's the director. He's awesome It's like the new heat bro. It is yeah, yep, dude. It's such a good movie. There's a second one I think is coming out soon. I know they shot it already. Oh, yeah, there's dentists too coming But you you've done you've done some act 12 strong another great movie You've done the how is that oh yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I was The story like they write in the whole 13 hours. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's another 13 hour. That's a great movie Tell us a little bit about that man. How did that because I mean you said I guess coming out of high school You wanted to kind of get into Hollywood a little bit and then so is that like another full circle thing for you as well? Yeah, like coming right out of high school. I thought I wanted to be a firefighter Mm-hmm, you know obviously a noble job. I went down went took some firefighting classes. I'm like I'm not ready for this Yeah, that's a lot of responsibility So that's why I started working on the boat and then I don't even I started going to the movies and just was like I think part of it was I didn't like my story and I didn't you know every every Teenager person in the early 20s. I mean, maybe not every but a lot of us, you know You struggle with identity and who you are and like what? Feeling like a good enough or feeling like you you know you've earned this whatever it is especially being American I think It's a it's a lucky handed to draw and And so I just kind of I don't know I was like maybe I should just tell other people stories instead so that was initially what that interest was and Then you know military football that but I get done it now I get cut at 34 and finished my master's degree I didn't internship at Film 44 which is Peter Birch production company so he did like loan survivor Friday night lights a lot of football military related stuff And I'm making coffee getting lunch, you know doing all this stuff and he's just like It didn't I know your story and we started talking and so he let me sit in on some pretty important meetings and learn about all the developments I knew I wanted to eventually make movies and then Had a few opportunities to do some hosting and do some acting after that finished and eventually MVP that first one there that's based on the charity. It's based on the genesis of merging vets and players So I co-wrote directed produced co-starred Post production supervisor. I didn't have to pay any of those people to make this movie So did that movie and I encourage everybody to see that one above all the Mattown Paramount Plus Prime Apple TV, but that's awesome. It tells a story of how we started. It's a marine living in a homeless shelter and a former NFL player first You're out of the league Black guy white guy nothing in common right society tells you They're going through the same shit or the same guy, you know, and it's cool. You're read the book Brian's song I know I've seen the movie. Yeah, I've never read the book. You're ready. It's awesome look bro It's about Brian piccolo and gale savers. Okay, you know gale savers is that's running backs ever in NFL. Okay And he was he's black guy Piccolo's a white guy and he piccolo ends up getting cancer and it's a fucking great story His piccolo was he was was he a running back as well. I think so they kind of compete. Yeah. Yeah, they didn't like each other first Right. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, they became like super best friends great. They it was it's a great book I'm not seeing the movie but the book is amazing the movie is James Conn and savers plays himself. Oh really? Yeah, oh that's cool. You should check it out. Yeah, I will yeah dude One thing before we get started. I think that's worth noting is First of all your story is incredible dude. You should never feel like it's not enough. That's an incredible I know because When you have a story like a per you don't think it's shit like right because people are always know yourself Yeah, I'm just a fucking regular dude bro. I need you people say yeah People I know how dumb I am yeah, and but dude I try to tell people that right because I get a lot of stuff about my story as well and I'm like Dude all you got to do is just be a not afraid to do new shit and and that's that's you right now like you know You're talking about special forces playing football and doing the fishing boat You know the movies the acting dude that's incredible shit now. You're doing a documentary on D day. Yeah, yeah, talk about that for a minute. Yeah, so But that all comes from not being afraid and just say hey if they do it I could do it. Well, I'll say this for real quick because when you say that it makes me think of like my dad told me After I made it at Texas. He was like if you would have played growing up you'd played high school ball I don't think you ever would have tried this because you would have known too much. Yeah, how hard this is Yeah, like the fact that I just I value a little naivety. Yeah, I mean I think you should you know be stupid or just let yourself not be educated, but We psych ourselves out. We look too much into it. We read too much on it. We're like and we over prepare In some ways and it psychs us out and then we just don't even try and those you know limitations the number one limitation Out there are ones you put on yourself like that's it like people just don't They don't go for it. They don't put the time in they don't just try and then they regret that It's just like just fucking go. It's one of the problems I think we have with the overabundance of information that we have access to now is that people have gotten so comfortable Like you said just analyzing and analyzing and analyzing and analyzing and never going and The truth of the matter is is that no matter what it is whether it's sports business a new career a new hobby You're not gonna know shit until you go do it real exactly like you aren't gonna know anything like you can watch as many YouTube videos about Business or read a PhD. Yeah, and just you do it dude listen that was a big problem I had with college I was going into these business classes and I was listening these guys were PhDs But no business and I'm like and then I go out in the parking lot and I seem dry off in a fucking shit box And I'm like what the fuck does this guy know about business? You know what I mean? Yeah, and dude you guys got to understand man When you hear stories like Nate and what he's done Dude you have that too you like you have the ability to go be who it is not talented dude. I just don't care Yeah, I don't want to die with you don't yeah, and you don't care about fucking look at stupid in the beginning exactly Yeah, exactly. No, that's that's a super power. Yeah, that's a big super power Yeah, just yeah, but it's true I mean everybody is so worried about what everyone else is gonna say your dad. Yeah, you know, I get some shitbag today yesterday Just texting me hate, you know, I serve with the guy. Yeah, he's a chef guy, and he's not about he's got a good heart He's just not in a good place and it's like Oh, yeah, this is this is this is what people this is what will deter people from trying. Yeah, I'm worried about this And I said I don't we're both gonna die and it's gonna fucking that's it. So who cares anyway D day dark Yeah, so when I was playing at Texas The practice fields are named Frank Deneas fields Frank Deneas was Four-time Silver Star recipient in like a six or seventh month period from D day to battle the bulge And I know your grandfather You know was around in that in similar circles. Mm-hmm. So Frank Wow, the practice fields are named after him, but when I was playing he was in his late 80s early 90s And he was at every single practice on the sideline That's bad. It's standing there watching. He just love football And you go up to him and talk to him and of course the most humble person the planet like you hit you have to like dig and dig to get anything out of them And then he passed away in 2019 and I had gone out to the Iwo Jima reunion in DC recorded some of these guys stories and Was gonna do something with history channel like a podcast series COVID killed that right and so that was like that bothered me Right and then Frank died never got to really like get his story out there and they're he wrote a book and there's stuff You know, but getting these guys Straight to camera just telling their story however they want to tell it one last time was important to me And then when the 80th anniversary of D day rolled around in June I was like I'm just gonna go and whether I if I'm getting it on my cell phone great But if I'm lucky enough to cobble together a few bucks. I'll bring out a crew and you know we we we raised a little bit of money I a lot of it.

I'm gonna boat the boat goes up with the water So even if the boat goes up 100 feet in the air I'm gonna be up 100 feet in the air with the water. So it's really the safest place in the world to be is on my boat And I got room for one more female How many you got one more right right that is that is that is Noah if Noah and AJ McAaron had a baby Yeah, my brain. Jay McAaron's tats That motherfucker is Florida man. Oh that is that is pit of me. Yeah Florida man And he didn't leave his boat he stayed in a temper mayor Jane Kaster claimed that Tampa police quote just saved Lieutenant Dan during a press conference on Wednesday afternoon Quote has been rescued and he is now in a shelter as well if we can get Lieutenant Dan to go to a shelter We can get anybody to do that. She told reporters there's Pictures of him being pulled from the boat out in the aftermath. I'm coming out of it Completely alive and fine There was some other Florida activities going on during the hurricane as well One man went back to his house to find a unsuspecting guest there This had my rich Florida man finds alligator in his house during hurricane videos terrifying So a man of Florida got the surprise of a lifetime after Hurricane Lane The state of Florida got rocked starting Wednesday night by Hurricane Milton and the destruction is absolutely devastating houses are destroyed Rose the wreck boats are thrown all over the place. There's immense water damage and In the road to recovery will likely be a long one The state is also fresh off dealing with Hurricane Lane and it turns out some animals needed to seek refuge as well during the disaster So imagine going back to your house after that and checking this out Oh Now for Gator What's a big fucking Gator dude that is a big gator that's probably at least 12 feet I mean he looks like he just ate a person. Yeah, look how fat his belly is Probably the dog. Yeah, I mean that's good. No, no, there's obviously the destruction is terrible There's a lot of things you know wrong and fucked up obviously, but I thought that was just interesting to see the Florida still gonna be Florida We know what I think it's cool about Florida, bro And people like the tease Florida a little bit, but the truth is the truth is we all admire them That's the truth. No, we do you know why because they always have their each other's backs, bro They always take care of each other. They don't take it too serious They all realize hey man. We live here as part of the deal They make little jokes about it. They keep it lighthearted and even when people are in the hardest of hard times They don't freak out. They handle their business and dude. It's admirable. It's it's really honestly It's what America's supposed to be and I think what's cool is over the last two weeks even though it's been tremendously Horrible destruction in many different areas of the country. I think we've seen the American spirit really Start to come to the surface where people are you know looking out for each other and and and that's the real America Dude, that's like that's what this country is and we see so much Negativity and so much divisive shit through the media and social media too and even we're guilty of it sometimes where we get so Demoralized. It's just like man fuck everybody But the truth of the matter is you know when the rubber hits the road This is the greatest place in the world because people take care of each other It's really amazing to see and I haven't felt the feeling that I feel right now about people coming together in a very long time Unfortunately, it takes this kind of shit right because you remember how it was after 9-11 I was just gonna say 9-12 is one of the reasons I joined the military like how much we came together 9-11 Horrible obviously, you know what I mean? But the way that we came together put a shut put aside our differences like everybody just kind of said This is this is what needs to happen right now, you know for for people affected for those not affected people are scared But instead of You know buying large people just worried about themselves. It's like let's let's let's figure this out as a community Let's be there for one another. I remember living in Hollywood and there were parades down the street people dressed up like Uncle Sam Like yeah, I was like damn this is cool In your tax dollars right there on the spot. Yeah No, but it was I mean, but for real it was just like damn We're they're having a you know there's people parading after this happens and it was just like there's a big middle finger to those that did that But also just like we're not Backing down like you didn't just beat us, you know, and yeah, like you brought us together. Thank you Yeah, you know, yeah, and I also I also think it's cool too that like People are starting to remember what that flag means, you know because for the last number of years People have been hesitant to fly that flag I think because they felt like it represents our government just so we're clear That flag is our flag that is the people's flag that is not the flag of tyrants that is the flag of unified Citizens, all right, so when you fly that flag remember that we are not supporting the government We are supporting our brothers and sisters our neighbors our family our friends the people have come before us And the people who are gonna come after us to make this country great and that's a very important thing to remember when you fly that flag We're not supporting tyrants We're we're the antithesis of tyranny and that's why it's important to be proud of that flag and fly that motherfucker every time You get a chance it represents everybody that's right. Yeah, people you disagree with that's right on every level Like that's still represents them and like when we took the oath in the military You know, it's to defend the Constitution and it's to defend what that flag is supposed to represent Period, you know people are like oh, you know, what what why'd you do what you do? And I'm like well I fought for you too right and whether you you know You you you burn that flag in front of me and I still fought for you Yeah, I fought for your right to do that. I don't like that. Yeah, but like that is that's that's that is freedom and like this is what That flag represents like no other place to me. Yeah, I agree special thing man. I remember like in football. I was thought of this Being down on the field what's so cool about sports Was it was just a great representation of America because you look up in the stands super diverse people from all over the map You could spill a beer on the guy next to you in the first quarter and y'all are hugging in the fourth quarter And you might never have a conversation outside of this place You might have nothing in common, but you're pulling for one thing together. Yeah, I'm like that was very American to me Yeah, I think that you know that kind of stuff is just lost these days, you know and understanding that we're in this together And we should disagree on some shit. That's how we find the best answer. Yeah, we need to like Figure it out together and yeah, just like ride each other off and I also think it's important to remember dude that being a patriot does not mean They've twisted it they You agree man. Yeah, they've twisted it into this thing where it means you're supporting our actions overseas I don't support the actions of us in all these unnecessary wars But what I do support as a patriot of this country is what this country could be not what it is I am a I am a I am a dreamer and a idealist Probably only in this way of what this country should be and that to me that means something You know when I when I fly that flag and when I say I'm proud of that flag I'm proud and I'm dedicated to building and doing my part into what this could be not what it is now Yeah, and I think we need to all take that attitude because dude We don't have to accept what they dictate to us the people have the power not them And so when we all get together and we are unified Similar to what's happening in North Carolina and Florida and all those areas right now. Yeah, we there's nobody that can stop that They can't stop that and that's where that's why they work so hard to get us fighting and get us divided and get us at Contention along every single line. You know, they want us that they're they're fucked. Yeah, they if the minute we fucking come together, bro They are they're done. Well, they you know, I love to push this It's narrative that You know conservative values are patriotic and liberal values are open-minded or whatever and that you you know You're either one or the other. Yeah, it's like you can be open mind. You should be open-minded Yeah, listen at least listen and respect everybody else and patriotic at the same time because just like you said like what what it is to me is like We're never gonna get there. There's no there is no utopia, but the pursuit of it. That's why it's the pursuit of happening right and it's the pursuit of you know up Of being the best you know being the greatest country in the world and being the most the most unified and the and the strongest You know and the safest and all these things like we'll never we'll never be We'll never actual as that actualize our our full potential totally, but we should make a commitment to as men especially and women To lead our country into a better place than where it is now I feel and I know you feel this too or you wouldn't be doing the work that you do But I feel a tremendous amount of responsibility as a Forty-something-year-old man to to do my part in that. Yep, you know And I think if we can all get together on that page man I think we're gonna get this this country back on track. You know 100% man or another point two on this Florida thing You know that you mentioned and like that that is unique about for they also don't let nobody fuck with them You know they might let some jokes pass, but they definitely defend their own for sure DeSantis the governor did just that Not sure if you guys saw this he Was questioning about because there's been some ongoing debate I guess you know whether you know Kamala Harris and stepping in hell up and doing all this and he finally shut it all down for once and all in a statement While he was being interviewed Let's check this let's check his response out Hey governor could you just help clear something else up that happened earlier this week and we were actually debating it at this table So I got to ask there was some praise that came your way from President Biden And said that they had spoken you had spoken then there was this brew ha ha over Vice President Harris apparently reaching out to you or and maybe and not taking the call and this whole thing Accusations this at all become politicized. Can you just speak to what happened there? I am working with the president of the United States. I'm working with the director of FEMA Martialing all my state assets. We've been doing this now nonstop for over two weeks between Haleen and this and so if there's anything I can leverage to benefit my people I'm gonna do it the fact of the matter is they put out a story saying I didn't take I didn't know she was trying to reach me But she has no role in this process and I've been dealing with these storms in Florida under both Trump and Biden Neither of them ever politicized it and in fact all the storms I've dealt with under this administration Although I've worked well with the president. She has never called on in Florida She has never offered any support So what she's doing is she's trying to inject herself into this because of her political campaign So is the governor here who's leading this? I don't have time for those games. I don't care about her campaign Obviously, I'm not a supporter of hers, but she's not she has no role in this process and so I'm working with the people I need to be working with we're leveraging the resources. I need to be leveraging and for her to try to say that my focus should be on catering to her rather than roaring about my own people just so she doesn't understand What it means to respond to these natural disasters? So yeah, you should that now. That was pretty cool. Well, I know what I love about the Sanchez Unfortunately, he doesn't really do well with speeches and you know Being in front of debates and things like that. I don't think I don't think that's a strong suit That's weird boom. He's a great operator. Mm-hmm. It's a great operator 100% And so far like something they the day basically what he's saying though if we're gonna translate this fuck Kamala Harris Yeah, and a very in a very political way. Yeah, for sure Um now I mean again like you know, this was supposed to be a really really bad storm Definitely call some damage As of right now time of the recording. There's at least five people that have been confirmed dead From the storm. We got over three million people without power right now And here's the interesting thing. I know we covered yesterday in CTI You know the you know some storm manipulation weather manipulation shit It is so interesting how there's more coming Apparently there's another massive tropical storm that supposed to be approaching Florida here shortly We also got talks now. This is all over the headlines These severe solar storms Uh that are coming out now. We had a big one back in May of this year Um that took down A lot of our cellular functions For a lot of a decent period of time people were freaked out a little bit over that apparently we got more coming in I'm expected to come in uh throughout today and tomorrow Um, and apparently there's already some effects going in got some different carriers are down spectrums Wi-Fi and internet's down Verizon's down It's just a lot of weird and interesting things happening um think the perfect perfect opportunity in time Um, and they're also doing a massive recall as well on uh 10 million pounds of meat So I mean, I don't know if this is scrambling I don't know how much of it is intentional But what we do know for sure that we've covered on the show is that These people have no problem taking these opportunities as they come and using to their benefit So what else you guys got on this? Well, I don't I mean like First of all these networks man. They they're gonna politicize anything they can because that's just What they do you know, and that's what they talk about and that's So it's that's frustrating when people are hurting and people are you know and they're They have an opportunity they get him on there and then that's the question they really want to ask They don't want to you know talk about what do you need what's you know? What's the situation on the ground or whatever it's like can you respond to this? You know, which is just trying to get him probably trying to of course. Yeah, the new was nervous Asked in a question because I feel like he knew to sense it was he didn't ask you very well He was like well, so Yeah, yeah, well, I also think these people understand that people are done with the shit Because every single time one of these stupid interviews comes out it gets posted and those people get blasted. So You know look man It's what the set what the set is true She's trying to pretend like she's the president already and she's you know got her big swinging Fuck and dick or whatever right and She's gonna run in and we're gonna handle shit. Oh, she doesn't give a fuck look what she just did in and what they just did in in Ashville and then and then also I'd like to point out It's interesting how she continues to talk about all these changes she's gonna make on day one But yet when she was asked on the view and she was asked I think it was Not Jimmy Kimmel the other guy Cobra yeah, we should drink the beer. Yeah, she was on Cobra and she was on The view and she said they asked both of master. What would you change differently? I can't think of anything all right, so which one is a lady you can't think of anything to change or you're gonna change all this shit on day one Which one is it because those two things don't go together and it shows you how Deceptive these people are being because all they're doing is giving you lip service And I'd like to warn you to make you understand That Kamala Harris is a fucking communist, okay, and you guys say well she doesn't talk about it no shit They never do they work their way in through subversion and lies and then when they get in power They they change everything and so when you guys see her changing all these politics from You know what she supposedly believes to what she now is saying to potentially get her elected You know, I've adjusted with the times No, that's inaccurate. They have no problem lying because she knows exactly what she's going to do when she gets in power which is Communist shit, all right, so you guys need to Everything that comes out of their mouth you have to understand we're dealing with people We're willing to say and do anything To grasp and hold on to power over you and when we look at the cyber solar flares those are sort of solar flares, okay It's no coincidence that now we have all this shit in chaos and by the way I think somebody's been telling you that was gonna happen and it's gonna get way worse There's gonna be way more shit if they have to they'll shut the power grid down They're gonna do anything they can to make sure that they maintain power because dude you have to ask yourself if you Were on the line and your ass was facing accountability for things that you've done All right, what would you be willing to do to make sure that that doesn't happen to you in the answer for every single human Is anything required? All right, and that's what we're dealing with we're dealing with dangerous people who are backed into a corner Who are willing to do anything they possibly can to make sure that they maintain control because they've gone too far down the path to come back So that's how I see the situation You guys are free to disagree, but You know, we just get we got to start over man. Yeah, we got to burn these two parties down I'm sorry. Yeah, there's just too much special interest is too much money the amount of campaign financing lobbyists special interest It is it's all theft bro exactly. It's that it's like I think democracy is incredible and we fought for that in the Middle East and work It's tough, you know Because I mean That's what it's all about should be about the people it is this has nothing to do with people Yeah, it's not it's just people in power like you say and it's it's government and it's people that have been in politics our whole lives and Super entrenched and grained and and then they're willing to make everybody else life harder to leverage power for themselves Bro, we deserve better than that we the people deserve much better you imagine like this I mean like because they didn't do this isn't not that not that long ago 9-11 hurricane Harvey like this these were not the things they were they were asking you know president Bush for instance It was just like what do we need to what's going on here? Yeah, we fix this problem. How do we come together? How do we? Probably like we're trying to do But then when it gets in with the you know the rise of cable news and of course they've got their teams everybody's on a team and It's just like yeah, it's sick man. I don't know. I don't know what the answer is but I Think total destruction of the parties. I don't know. I know how to do that, but I think grown men that have the right selfless values uh In terms of being a patriot of America Have to step up and do their their civic duty to serve Within our system that exists and then work to make the changes that we need from the inside because And I think we're good. I think we're I think we're moving that way like senator Eric Schmidt from Missouri Attorney general Andrew Bailey these guys these guys are buddies of mine from Missouri Josh Howley not a friend of mine. I don't know him I mean these guys are these guys are patriots dude. They're not taking money They're they're doing good work and I think we're getting more and more of that But dude, it's gonna take a massive downsizing of the government a massive reduction in actual tax revenue a massive realignment of where that money spent and the the work that it's going to take to make it right Is is a lot and it makes you think like dude I don't know if we can do it without totally starting over right it's seriously feels like that I know it just does it just feels too it's like too far gone Yeah, but you got the vacant there who's gonna be a part of Trump's cabinet of Trump wins who say and hey We need to reduce the government by 90 80 90 percent ring taxes. I mean he had it on we had him on the show Bring taxes down at 10 percent. I mean that's that's the kind of reform we need yeah for sure Guys jumping on this conversation.

Um little Andy Domus action Little Andy Domus action. Yeah, I can talk about it. This is I can miss I can't I'm not gonna say it's crazy It's not I knew it. You knew it We knew it. Did you guys know this? Let's dive into this FBI arrests Afghan man who officials say planned election day attack in the United States now we talked about this yesterday Just yesterday not even 24 out there 24 hours ago. We talked about this And uh, you know, this was about the story of this Afghan man Um, who the FBI arrested did you see this Nate? I did okay, so um Who officials say was inspired by the Islamic State Militant Organization Inspirational organization. Yeah, so inspired so inspiring Um, and that this man was cried Uh, and that this man was plotting an election day attack targeting large crowds in the United States Um, the Justice Department said Tuesday Naseer Ahmad Tahiti 27 of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma told investigators after his arrest Monday that he had planned his attack to coincide with the election day next month And that he and a juvenile co-conspirator expected to die as martyrs according to charging documents Now we talked about yesterday how this man entered Um, the country back in 2021 on September 9th to be exact so like three weeks after The Kabul yeah, uh, what am I trying to say the uh abby gated tag right lost 13 Marines and 170 Afghans right Um, he entered and he entered not not you know under normal circumstances He was one of 50 people that year to receive a special visa from the State Department to come into this country Now in his plans, you know, he tried he liquidated his family's house to Uh, afford some of these tools and things that he was going to need for this attack Um, he bought all of his family members one way tickets Uh, to to Afghanistan Um, now the FBI said in the statement yesterday they said terrorism quote terrorism is still the FBI's number one priority And we will use every resource to protect the American people that came from FBI director Christopher Ray Um, now Here's the anti-domus part, okay, because stuff always happens Stuff always comes out and we we have covered so many of these type of stories on this show um, and the we know what the common denominators are Right we talk about them Whether it was our own through letter agencies knowing of these people ahead of time and not doing anything during those those that time period Um, now this one was a curveball because not only did our people know about this guy he fucking worked for him this guy worked for the CIA Didn't I say that or something like that? Yes, it's a fact Hmm you worked for him Uh, let's dive into this so that that same afghan migrant, okay, I'm gonna see a toedie Who's accused of planning to launch this ISIS-inspired election day terrorist attack used to work for the CIA And bombshell used to yeah, right used to use to there's no such thing as used to work used to once you're in you're fucking in bro Um, and of course the CIA did not immediately respond for a comment Um, but yeah, apparently he was a security guard for the CIA. Yeah, I guess security guard gets a Special 50 person visa and a first class ride in the United States, huh? But this is wild man. It's wild. So again, he entered the United States on September 9th 2021. All right Now in a statement from speaker my Republican house speaker Mike Johnson um He made the statement about this guy and he said quote following the botched afghanistan with draw more than 7,000 afghans were given humanitarian parole with little to no vetting and no intent to know the whereabouts Republican house speaker Mike Johnson wrote earlier this week when the arrest was announced quote nazir amat Tahiti the terrorist plotting an election day attack was one of them So we have 77,000 other ones. Well, he wasn't just one of the 77,000 He was one of the 50 that got a special riding special visa to come here What does that say to you? What is that? Let's connect the dots here You got him working for the CIA over there. He gets a special visa here We got all these school shooters every single one of them Okay on the FBI's radar the potential Trump assassin the first one on the FBI's radar And now it comes out this dude worked for the CIA Do you guys get it yet? You fucking get it Okay These people do not have our interests in mind they intentionally create chaos they intentionally create division They will fucking kill you to create Problems in this country they don't give a fuck and the the people who say oh you mean they knew about these school shooters And they just let them do it and then you think that they really just let them kill kids yes That is what they do and until we come to the realization that that is what is happening and that and I'm not saying the entire FBI or the entire CIA or any I'm saying there are elements in the leadership that know what's going on and allow these things to happen for political reasons period It's the truth you know, but you go to the CIA's website and this is what they have nice big bold letters on the front of their screen We are the nation's first line of defense and I just I don't buy that man. I don't I don't at this point now And then they I would love your perspective on it I know we have a bunch of bunch of we have a bunch of friends that you know special forces Veterans people that have served people that worked in this day. We got friends over there right now real talk We got people in these agencies that fucking tell us the shit straight up. Straight up. Okay. They say hey There's civil war happening inside these agents every single home office They're a Patriots and then there are corrupt people right and the patriots are trying to fight the corrupt people inside these agencies And dude y'all better just start blowing the whistle. That's what I gotta say you want to be a patriot for real come tell the truth and and have some balls and do it in public Yeah, but but to that point Nate because I feel like for a lot of veterans You know who served I'll spend time in Afghanistan. I think the Afghanistan with draw was a major eye-opening You know revelation for a lot of veterans because you know for many of them who joined post 9-11 You know the the reasons why they believe they were going to fight. I think at this point You know a lot of them have come to terms that were like fuck man. We were lied to we didn't go over there Those were not their correct intentions of why we were going over there They lied to us about why we were over there. I think a lot of people have come to that. Did you What what's your take on all of that man? It's definitely it's definitely nuance. I mean Look first of all for for anybody that did You did everything you could you went for the right reasons. Yes, you know, I don't I maybe not everybody but most people And we need you and we need you now more than ever to like be willing to do that those kind of people So like I'm not saying I'll be the first to tell you that like we we still need The right young men and women to step up take the oath and defend this country because there is hope for it I do think we're gonna flip this thing around and get it figured out right that being said There is a lot The CIA the military all these things they are part of the government where there is special interests And there are these other things that play and there always have been and it's getting I don't think it's growing You know, maybe getting worse and worse so like that That sucks and that's scary because at the end of the day like when you're over there We fought alongside and special forces we fought alongside the Rockies and Afghans were good fucking people And care about their country and wanted to be better and wanted freedom I wanted rights for women and all of these things right they wanted to be Like this idea of America Which isn't perfect as we talked about but still they wanted that and that's what a lot of us signed up to do to help Defend and preserve and hopefully create in these places But there is a lot of other Hands in this pot, you know, it a man and it's not fully up to us and I will say this about the bit the To Afghan thing that's really frustrating to me is There are a lot of Afghans who fought for Afghanistan joined Units like the Kiteha's who you know special operations unit over there that we stood up and we were trying to develop and form And their warriors and their badasses and they can't even get over here You know, I mean it's really hard for a lot of them to get over here And then there's other people that didn't do that. I don't know how that works or where that comes from or you know It's just frustrating. Yeah, when it's like they fought alongside us for years a lot of a lot of interpreters too and that's the story we hear more But there's a lot of soldiers fighters, you know what I mean that we made promises to as well That that has not got left behind Yeah, the promise wasn't honored and that sucks It's terrible and when that thing and when this thing you know the way that we You know it happened in Iraq too and that was the that's sort of the rise of ISIS, you know when we left it's like In my opinion there is a shit ton of American special operations Soldiers and not just soldiers soldiers is army, but you know what I'm saying special operation fighters warriors That are that would love the opportunity to still be in the fight over there So if we just would have left even a few hundred of these guys, you know what I mean to still work with the Iraqis and Afghans and try to continue to build something It's not it's generational. It's not gonna happen quick Um, I think that that would have been the move personally and I do I'm not a big isolationist personally. I do think At some level like we should be involved. We're the most charitable country in the world like we're the most diverse country in the world We are you know all of these things and We have people that are willing to stand up and go fight and die for another country and other people in that country It's not just defending America and that's huge Um, so anyway, I It's just sad. It's just sad more than anything That this thing, you know that this stuff happens and that you know So a lot of times the wrong people are allowed in and the right people in my opinion don't have that opportunity and would die for the for one day here You know, I don't think that's an accident bro. No, I don't think it is and and I I agree with almost everything you said um You know, I I'm glad you pointed out like this is what I say those things that is not I'm not talking about our soldiers I'm not talking about the good people in the FBI. I'm not talking about the good police officers or the good CIA I talked to those guys like those guys are like bro. We don't know what to do the best thing you guys can do is tell the truth Real talk, okay, and I know it's scary and I know it's hard and I know it's your career on the line But at this point in time, I think our country's on line too um, you know, but in our the one point that I do disagree with Is I think I think there should be a 20-year stay on us sending any money or any people anywhere until we have our country in order and It's hard for me especially being from St. Louis Where there's a tremendous amount of hardship and poverty with American citizens, you know, we're the murder capital of the United States Crime is everywhere people are suffering here. It's hard for me To and you have a different perspective because you've been there, right? But it's hard for me and you see him as you're a humanitarian like you see them as human and everything It's just hard for me to get behind us sending Anything anywhere when I can drive down the street and see the shit that I see here I mean I agree I agree with that. We need yeah absolutely more focus here. Yeah However, when I think of World War two and I think of like Where we're headed right now like You know my argument would be if we if we stay just here Bad things can happen bad things can happen. I think they will you know what I mean? So it's like it's it's a tough one like if Pearl Harbor hadn't happened I don't know when we would have stepped in and maybe it had been too late like it's a real discussion It's crazy, you know sure and like you said it's nuanced is super nuanced and it's tough and like you know We're in crazy debt We've got a lot of people here that are homeless that are sick that are poor that can't afford groceries Yeah, and they're taxing us to death bro Like the you know you have Kamala Harris and Biden saying the rich got to pay their share bro They ain't talking about like me rich They're talking about like me rich. They're not talking about the dudes who are worth a hundred billion dollars That headquarter their shit in Ireland so they can escape United States tax code, okay? The reason that the middle class is tax so heavy is because the richest people in the world pay almost nothing and But that's not your local entrepreneur. That's these guys you see on TV Okay, and and a lot of them that you see on the Forbes list and and all those guys know how to get around that shit That's why they're on that list and if we're gonna have a real tax system You know we could lower the tax rate for everybody else if everybody paid right if everybody paid 10% fucking everybody if you make If you work at cook and french fries you pay 10% if you own NVIDIA you pay 10% if everybody pays 10% We're gonna have more money than we have now and not only that if we then work on where we spend it We we could have the most beautiful successful Prosperous country in the world if we didn't have these people stealing all our money and and working kickbacks and special deals and feeding the you know military industrial complex and all this shit and You know, it's just It's man it goes back to what we said. There's just a lot of stuff and he's be cleaned up Totally. Yeah. No, it is Yeah guys are going guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think With that being said, let's get to our third and final headline. Let's talk about some tyrants here Uh headline number three reads M-Haft Tim Walls walks away from cafe counter without paying Someone will be up here to pay. Do you see this shit? No So they ordered some some some fruit fru lattes I just walked the fuck off man. No way. Oh yeah, and like I mean I think on on the surface of it right I can get it, you know things are happening my people are gonna pay your people. That's what it is right like you know But I mean no, they didn't even fucking acknowledge them Um and I can get that right like I mean these guys have staffers all all around them and shit, you know I'm saying it could be awkward, you know pulling out straight like I don't like when we go travel, but I don't I You know, I don't let you pay unless you pull your wallet. Yeah, you know, I'm saying it I it's not that you ain't got it, you know, I'm saying but it's more of a security thing I get that But on the other end of it though, we've also seen plenty of videos of Trump and these restaurants and stuff and he pulls out his shit straight from his pocket You know, I'm saying or at least makes it like he doesn't walk away from counters. Yeah, we'd free shit That's not how it works Um, and I I mean I think there was I think it's just showing this like, you know, tyrantical Uh, mindset these people fucking it's an elitist attitude. That's what it is. Yeah. Let's check it out So uh second gentleman dug m. Hoff and Minnesota governor Uh Tim Walsh walked away from the counter at a cafe without paying with Walsh's daughter revealing that someone will be up to pay The video footage posted to Twitter appeared showed Uh, the two men walking away from the counter after Walsh's daughter tells them that she will wait for the tea And the farms are worker behind the counter that a campaign staffer is coming to the counter to pay Um, let's check this clip out So that's Walsh's daughter right here Oh Thank you so so much and um, someone will be up here today So right now, well, no, like thank you so much You know, for someone who's Politicking uh, it's not probably not a good look to just walk away from the people serving you and not even acknowledge them We say thank you. So I'm saying it's not like hey nice to meet you You know like if you're truly in the public eye you you should be treating everybody With respect. That's what I saw and you know, it just don't look I mean look dude They're douchebags I don't know how to say it any other way. I wonder what their coffee order was Bro when we go out to eat do I take a extra time talk to the wait staff and the bartenders and shit and whoever's talking to us all the time I love it. It's great And they would have got a kick out of it Even if they're you know Well, I think they're not fans. It's like I waited on people to build this shit like I did bar business You know what I'm saying like I know what that's like you get zero respect you get fucking yelled at you get blame for everything The least that we could do as humans, rather you Tim Walsh or fucking Doug Jerkoff or whatever the guy's name is Is to fucking treat Waders and waitresses with with courtesy and respect basically Baristas, okay, dude. I'll be real man like I have a bit you know this. I have a huge pet peeve Like if I go to dinner with someone and they're rude to a waiter or waitress I will fucking cut them out of my life I will not fucking talk to them ever again because like dude it tells me everything I need to know You know what I mean? Like unless you can do something for this person They're gonna say fuck you and like I don't like those people. Yeah No, it's a huge silt also. Yeah, I mean that's a bit. That's the best way to judge somebody else's character like Watch them around other people not you. Yeah, and watch there's a saying right Pay attention to what they how they treat people that can't do anything for them Pay attention to that and you'll know someone's character bro. Yeah That's real shit, but that speaks volumes. You know, oh, we're gonna sit bro You guys couldn't say thank you. You guys could I mean look. I know we're being petty here But I personally think this is a deeper I am like if you're watching this on surface level you can be like all guys you're just being too hard because you don't like them Well, I don't agree with that because I believe that that is a very clear indicator to someone's character is how they I That's a volume character test. Well, if you don't treat service well, I think you're a piece of shit No, well you're say your Texas fan. Yeah, so imagine your Mac Brown fan. Yeah, so Mac Yeah, I love the thing about him Mac was unbelievable with everybody Everybody's treated the same and this is the same with uh you didn't have it up there on the list, but I in the list I'm a I was in the terminal list too for a couple episodes right and Chris Pratt's like that on set Mac and Chris That's why I read laws Chris because they treat everybody the exact same and they and they mean it or at least they act like they mean it If they don't and that's a no no bro. You can't say that but sometimes yeah sometimes you're just like your tear tire Yeah, you know, you don't you know, just like I want to go home but still do it mac wood mac wood You would remember everybody's mom's name everybody's brothers name, you know, and yeah, you're recruiting or whatever But everybody's treated the same. There's walk-ons and never played it down that text him today that played from 15 years ago And he gets back to him and he's like what do you need? How can I help and I one of the reasons I wanted to go to Texas was because I heard a story of him You know, he went on one of these like us. So trips with other coaches, right and The helicopter was taken off they're trying to get them at their like coach We got to go and there's still a bunch of troops there and there's no cameras or anything like that And he's like I'm not I'll get the next one like I'm not leaving until all these guys get to spend a minute with me If that's what they want like look what they're doing over here But he would do the same thing at a cafe or whatever, you know what I mean? He's just that does take discipline Leave that when you're tired as fuck bro exactly. Yeah, no, but I mean the the thing is with this though. It seems to just be a very common theme With people over there and like I mean again, whether you want to say it's just throwing you know throwing throwing shots Whatever you want to say is whatever, but like they keep doing it, you know, I don't like I got this another clip here, man This is probably the wildest thing I've seen here in a few weeks at least Wilder than a fucking 10 foot alligator in someone's living room. Yeah, okay. Yeah. I mean seriously Actually kind of pisses me off. Um, did you guys see this? He gets pissed. It's real They got to bring out sugar after noon Sugar after we don't want to get to sugar night. No, you don't want to get shot. I'm right at sugar after noon though Yeah, you get to check her and shook sunset first and then it goes to sugar night. I'm a sugar 603 Black female dim CNN strategist tells white male pundit she won't be lectured by some white man Do you see this shit? Yeah, I saw it. I did not know. Oh, it's disgusting. Yeah, it's very fucking video. Oh, fucking others video. Yeah, let's yeah, let's stop it into it So this is a democratic strategist and CNN pundit Aisha meals Responded to a story about former president Donald Trump questioning the gene quality of convicted murderers By comparing the Republican presidential candidate to Adolf Hitler falsely accusing him of supporting eugenics After these comments meals played the race card when she lost control of her rhetoric and founded hard to counter the arguments of Republican strategist David urban um, quote, I'm not going to be lectured by some white man who has no idea what he's talking about. So let's check this clip out As a black lesbian who Donald Trump doesn't believe has genes as good as his is he going to attempt to exterminate me? Why do you believe that? I said it because he's damn near said it. That's why David that's why he because he's Okay, and I'm not gonna be lectured by some white man who has no idea what he's talking about And it's trying to rewrite history here. I am ashamed of my ratio as an American and of a Donald Trump presidency And his actual quote I'm not because I take him seriously and I think that he believes what he says and that is why he is a danger and a threat to America Oh Aaron Aaron you can't have a This is disgusting man This is first of all how fucking stupid is this woman? Okay, what she's referring to is what Donald Trump talked about When he was talking about all the migrants coming across the border and he said there's some bad genes coming across the border that is a contextual statement that means the culture of America is being fucked with okay, he didn't literally mean You have inferior genes to me as a white man, right? This is being twisted in Like always into some sort of racist shit. I mean, it's total bullshit and bro for you to sit there and say this lady To sit there and say I'm not gonna be lectured by a white man What if I were to say I'm not gonna be sitting here in a lecture by some black dude doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about you guys would call that like That's yeah, right in bro just like that would be a racist statement That's a racist statement and we have to get away from the shit this identity politics this fucking You know black-wide gay straight left-right bullshit It's stupid bro, and like and the thing is it's like dude. I'm just saying like no one gets a fuck if you're a lesbian man No one gets a fuck if you're black either no You give a fuck Because it gives you privilege of power to shut people to fuck up. That's the thing and that's how you know when they were Revered to that type of shit. She knows you lost the argument. Of course. She knows you like when they start calling you name That's all they can do is listen when people start calling you a name you want you want. Yeah, you won 100% man What do you think about this? Yeah, I think I think she's a fucking idiot. Yeah, I think she's a black lesbian idiot Yeah, me too. That's what you identify an racist. I'm using her words. Yeah, I had a video that's some racist stuff I'm offended. Well, that's I mean like you know, they I'm not gonna be like black. Let's be People have said like you know, that's When when no person of color is there is no reverse racism You judge someone legitimately. This is a legitimate statement. I don't care who you are. I don't care where you come from I don't care what your past is. I don't care In 2024 if you judge someone on the amount of melanin in their skin or where they're from Because they look different than other gender. Yeah, you you're a fucking piece of shit, okay Period like that's it your world class piece of shit. Hello. I cue. Yep 100% dude Um, that's stupid. Yeah, I don't I I don't know you know, that's how I feel man. I feel like racism is racism If it's if it's look we can't deny that there's a tremendous amount of anti-white narrative in the in the fucking news cycle, okay Fucking white men and white women are the only people in the world that can't say I'm proud to be white If you're Mexican, you could say fucking Latino pride If you're black, you could say black pride if you're white and you say white pride, my fuck you're going on a list You know said so like let's be real about the anti-white narrative that's allowed There's a huge double standard in society Other people that aren't white can say anything they fucking want about white people white people up until recently can be denied a job based on their skin color They're the only race that can all right. That's changed now But if we're talking about real racism bro the country the only people that are actually legally able to be discriminated against by the law up until they just changed it Our white people, okay, so I'm not feeling this shit all right, and I'm not gonna see here because I don't give a fuck that I'm white I'm not gonna see her and say white pride. I'm gonna give a fuck about that I come from the belief that the United States is a place for all people and that we align under a culture that we all agree on And we might have differences of opinions, but at the end of the day we're Americans We're not black Americans. We're not white Americans. We're not Asian Americans. We're fucking Americans bro And that's where my belief system comes from and just like when we had hot news some on back in 2020 You know as white guy I've never been able to say that I'm proud to be white. It's never something that I you've never been able to say Hey, I'm proud to be white and because of that Like I feel like We don't have our identity based in race like I don't even fucking think about that like I never think fuck dude It's so awesome to be white like I don't think that I think like There's DJ DJ's got a little tan, you know saying like there's there's say oh there's a shot No, I don't say that I say he's got a little he's he's breaking the stereotype to white people small as dick ever You know and and you know dude it's we make fun of each other we have good humor and like I'm just sick of people like this trying to stoke this racial fire I mean, that's why we that's why first fall From a young person perspective. This is why sports are really absolutely you getting a locker room Everybody looks different from different places. Yeah, don't give a shit because you go out there All you care about is to do that's where I'm to like run through a wall. Yeah, you don't really care about anything else So that's a big one because there's way you know there's let kids aren't playing. They're not outside They're not on sports are on these things. Yeah, and they quit with desegregation programs for for so like when I went to school bro We had desegregation so like they purposefully blended the schools with black and white children So that we would learn each other's culture and then they stopped that here in Missouri So you know if you don't ever It makes sense why the young people are so sensitive to race because they're never interact with people from the other race Whereas like when I grew up I went to you know schools that were Half black because that was the programs that we went into and dude, you know you learn real quick There's a culture and then there's your culture and we figure out how to get along and play on the same teams and be buddies And that's missing in society man. Yeah, it's the same in the military. Yeah, we Your best friends, you know, you'll show you'll be the best man and some dudes wedding That's from a completely different part of the country or maybe the world. Yeah, you know different race religion doesn't matter You just it doesn't matter. Yeah, it's all bullshit and then you know you you look at like Hollywood right and Then Things swung so far one way right because We're just in this place where we're walking on eggshells, you know, and you can't say anything like you said like it's like Be the flag is is an evil thing and then whatever, you know You know white person is like inherently bad or something like that right and And recently I've I've heard and you're seeing it more where Um, there's just like push To court sort of like Recreque because we over corrected like big time and I just saw this this clip recently of Oh Kamal Nijani, I think his name is the actor the comedian. You know, I'm talking about Um, he's in the ever see the big sick the main dude in that Taking the superhero movies too, but anyway He was up talking because he's you know, he's like a Middle Eastern heritage or Indian I can't remember exactly and he gives this talk at this uh, you know like a word ceremony about how like Like I want to play bad guys too. I want to play terrorists, you know, too Some of us are good some of us are bad some of us are this some of us are that and it's not a political thing He's doing he's just talking real. Yeah, because it's like we're in this place where From a you know film perspective. It's like if you're not You know if you're not gay you can't play a gay character. Yeah, if you're not you know Of this exact nationality. Yeah, I play this thing and it's just like What happened to art and creating and actors and like like story telling and like Just figuring it out Together like yeah, we were just like we're just siphoning and and uh segregating within These groups and and just Making it really hard to communicate. Yeah, I'm really hard to feel like you can just speak your mind Say something like yeah, but then you get you get behind closed doors, bro, and everybody's normal exactly That's like I tell a locker room. Yeah, in the locker room, you know, it's like tiles off Nobody gives a shit and it's why I was I thought that was awesome. I don't know what his politics I don't really care. Are you like swinging you dick around a locker room? No, no You said he couldn't everybody can't guess what I'm getting at here. I'm gonna catch him in a lot of swings. Oh, yeah Fuck it swings in like I Licks thinks you got Alex thinks she's a lesbian Dead is girl. Yeah, her is boy. What is it? One of those names that's right. That's right. All right Yeah, dude, you know what though. I think you know here's what I like and this is why like I really want it I really want to swing our show into the comedy sector Because you know, let's be real. We're funny as fuck.
