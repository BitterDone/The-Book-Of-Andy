because it's happening right now in real time I want to give proper flowers to you you know because six years when I came we were having a beer at Billie Jean's ironically a few years a few a lot yeah yeah yeah we celebrated my birthday or something it was just vibing and just had a bunch in common like oh all boys private school like oh me too don't know football like like all of this and then we were talking about vision and at time if you remember it's like you had you had you had you had vision but you're like you're in a good place it was it was you were you were happy like things were good but coming out here and then seeing that you guys like it's I'm inspired like it's like if you if you haven't seen the office it's it's inspiring and what I like the most is I'm gonna be with you I'm kind of in a weird spot where like I've been in this digital marketing game for like 10 15 years met every entrepreneur I ever wanted to meet and that whole quote about never meet your heroes or your whatever it's fucking true yeah man most people are are full of shit they're fake they want something like I want to start off on a bad no but no no no bro that's why you and I have both moved out of that yeah it's just so like so it's so cool to come here and then see the culture and say everything that you actually talk about stand for is here and the first hour was here I didn't even talk to you yet so wasn't like it was set up to put no I came in everything pristine you go into this motherfucking gym like it is a real thing all the numbers are aligned etc like everybody is doing their thing it's cool because big things are happening but it doesn't feel like stuffy and corporate like it's just it's all the things I saw I think it was like shit years ago at like I don't know some event you were speaking on stage and you talked about culture yeah and like you were going on about like people want to know how I'm growing and scaling you like it's all about culture and then to experience it is there and then other note like I come in like there's a slideshow of me on the thing the staff is really nice everybody's very kind DJs like what's up we already felt like family like we were relating to shit I was like this this feels good like it was just taking back I have a motherfucker I got a locker a locker and it was it was the attention to detail it was a picture of my girl my mother my daughter it was my birthday was just just happened it was happy belated birthday and then it was the birthday it was like I was like to the point where I just started to get mad because I got mad because I had to check myself I was like I'm gonna have to go work I'm gonna have to step my shit up right and I don't know bad but I love that feeling I like the feeling like people people talk about emotions and there's certain emotions that they just classify as bad or shitty one of those is jealousy I like to get jealous yeah I like in here being like oh so you think you want some Andy okay you think okay and a good and a healthy yeah for sure bro yeah noted like brother that's what drives people 100% yeah 100% and that was with 75 hard like people are like you know you're doing a 75 hard again like do you want to get healthy I'm just like I'm gonna be real I just want to be better than you yeah like yeah because people don't want to be honest dude like no I just miss like I've always worked out my whole life I fell off I just miss coming in and just being like what's up you know what's fun yeah bro I do and people don't fucking understand that like I my friend the people I'm friends with I can simultaneously be really good friends with them and still want to be better than them 100% and that's the love that's the mother fuckers I want to be around because dude if you have a winning attitude the attitude that you really believe in yourself and you know that you're a competitor you want your friends to get better so that you get better you know what I'm saying so like I don't want to hang around mother fuckers that aren't competitive I want to be around people who you know I want to be around people doing better than me yeah because I'm like fuck all right I got one way or the other or this bad it's not always like you know size your business it could be more fit it could be better at relationship yeah exactly three is 360 yeah bro so it's like it's just a different way of thinking and I think most people don't they you know we hear this quote all the time on the internet which I fucking hate comparison is the thief of joy no bro comparison is the source of all progress that's the truth that's a bar yeah bro and people don't fucking get it because they're uncomfortable with I wanted such a way said about that 360 though it's because especially like when people see yourself see myself they'll go yeah size of business money and that's that's this part of that's right that's that's this part of it and so like you know I got friends or I just I'm like man I'm a fuckers of good ass dad but you know and I pride of how I was my daughter but I'm like oh you did well what okay noted like you know are like right now yeah yeah we're playing cards like my boy if my fucking boy Daniel if you follow Rob dear dick online yeah you know so you know like shout out to Rob like but Rob's a fucking genius bro oh he's a he's a real genius for sure so when he posed the way that he'll like spoil his wife or you know for like amazing blue yeah all that I'm like yeah I got to show my girls this a grand down like you can't go on this around today because I can't you know I gotta do more so I love it it's it's winning in 360 bro it's funny that you said that because I've always admired that about Rob too like Rob goes over the top big to his family you know Easter birthdays everything it's just top-notch and it's suit it's it's so on brand for him because his energy is so good yeah like I've I've been around for a while and like it's real shit like what you see on TV he's really like that in person but even better yeah and like that and I you know speaking I don't think people give him the credit for how fucking smart he is in business dude the fucking genius we we said we just had to go this dude this is years ago I don't know maybe five years ago with my buddy Chris Harder and we sat next to each other like I are in half and I forgot we were talking about I just left there being like you know you watch Robin big yeah whatever and it was just like it's kind of silly like right like it's it's immature in the same way that I am yeah fucking idiot so yeah just at the right time like these are the dumbest guys ever yeah that's a fact then you have a real conversation and you're like oh shit that's the first thing I thought I said that's one of the smartest entrepreneurs I've talked to in a very long time and then I came here and at what I tell you I was like we're looking at the thing I said man as I have to commend you because this is hard yeah to build this size of organization and to have all the things going right like that's my whole life is going into businesses I see every company you think of Fortune 500 small the difficulty level is insane yeah yeah they're doing it it's impressive well I appreciate all that bro and you know I I and echo all those sediments to you bro because you've come up fucking long way since we first met appreciate you know we've been friends for probably a close to a decade now yeah how did you guys dude I think just through the entrepreneur space we were both speaking and doing stuff and in the small world like you know every yeah you go somewhere and you see I'm very thankful for that yeah that time in my life but I'm also thankful to not really be in that anymore because of what you said I'm and I notice you you know you pulled away too and just kind of you know it's just dude there's just too much bullshit you know what it's like even my sister now like I say no to every podcast every speaking you know why because I don't want to one I like standing home and saying they'll play in tennis me too by group right right like but two is so many scams yeah like yeah I like and not just in the speaker world but just business period like I remember like the BBB the very first time I was exposed to them was I got a letter and it was like somebody said a bad review value and I was like what is this and it was like someone bought some if like 30 bucks I was like told my team is it just go refund it like make it right and I'll never forget this they sent a letter back and we responded to their their claim or whatever and they're like oh in order to respond to this you have to pay $60 a year yeah so I said oh hold on hold it what you're telling me is people can go in your reputation yeah say anything and oh you only let me reply if I pay you you know my thing on canceling people ask me this all the time they're like how do you deal with all these fuckers coming after you it's very simple if I I don't fucking care if it's not real if it's real and I fucked up I'll say I'm sorry but if it's not fuck them fuck them yeah I don't care yeah but yeah man it's just uh it's also fake life like it's like it's like social media it's it's fake it's literally like bro you turned it off your life will change none yeah do you ever you ever heard about the the dead and internet theory no so there's a theory I actually think there's a lot of truth to it that half the internet or more is just bots yeah actually well there are a lot of bots yeah there's a lot of shoots that yeah yeah and so when they like all the propaganda that they pushed on Twitter and shit when Dorsey owned or what's the face uh Jack Dorsey Jack Dorsey owned it was pushed out by bots so they're they're they're curbing public's really bad perception because of the bots yeah it's dude it's just we live in this the fucking it really is a matrix it's weird yeah yeah everyone's creating something yeah so dude you lost how much fucking weight recently it was like I think the total on 75 hard I think was like 47 pounds yeah you crushed it it was it was fine I gained seven back fucking around the last week and a half but um it uh I I texted Andy to let you guys know I said you know you do a lot of dope shit I said I think this is the most important thing you've ever done in your life um and I and I say that because in you guys that look in preachance of the choir right we're here everybody hears from every 75 hard understand the impacts but um to me I I don't believe you can get anything in life without obsession and on balance totally agree in and you write and I say because there's so many people who preach this balance thing and I just have come to the conclusion that balances right if I'm balancing I'm trying to stay why I'm at that's what balance is used for if I climb to a mountain right you know you you're staying where you're at there that's not to progress I think 75 hard is the truth of the true cost of what it takes to get what you want and so many people don't want to do even me like I was like oh god like for me like because I've done 75 hard and had killer results with the first time too when I was thinking about doing it I was doing it on my girl's like man I'll be with you I don't want to do it you know why because I had to be had honest conversation with myself of I don't feel like paying the price right now yeah I don't I don't feel like playing the price like yeah that's the conversation people aren't having like listen I don't want to pay yeah no I don't want to wake up twice yeah I want to spend I was mad as fuck and then I want to do it and my girl's like make sure you space out the workouts three hours it's been so long I was like dude is that a real thing so I texted Andy and I was like yo is that real I have to space out like three hours and he's yeah and I then I got more man no you said no you said you said that I'll be settle a bet and I'm like I then you're like fucker yeah and so then it was like fuck now this thing got really inconvenient you know because it's like especially like playing sports for yeah it was like I just didn't want to go in the mood and it's because of momentum but also I believe in who gives a fuck what I feel like you like what you can get where you are by doing all the shit you feel like yeah it's like who cares like so you know then you know week goes by and now I'm in the groove how can I not you know like you just realize you know the little bitch as you say like is active in all of us and yeah that's the thing there's not a single person here is too strong or beyond that and I promise you if it's not in the fitness space there's some other aspect of your life where you're being a little bitch you're in a argument with somebody but you won't put your ego aside and be the first person to call you're being a little bitch like you know there's something and that's what a lot of people see that they have it all the one app part that I've learned and this is like behind the scenes where you start being cool with everybody and I'm guilty of this too is this like all right money's right okay cool I'm feeling myself I've been working out a little bit check but the one that's easy to hide relationships whether that be your parents is significant other your children that's the easiest one especially when you guys see someone who typically classifies the alpha male check on them because be like yo it was good what's good what's good with you I think they're gonna know like that's that's how it is and one one of the greatest lessons I ever learned in business and it's like look you can have it all for like a moment but I was at this mastermind thing years ago and they just sat around like six dudes and just are going to go so which ones off I said what which ones off you know is it is it health money or relationship because one's always fucked that's ridiculous and I was like it's kind of real yeah it's kind of real like when you lean in it's like spin and play bro you're like yeah yeah 100% yeah it's just the juggle and then you shift back over and then the other thing goes away and you realize oh that's the game yeah there's just the game like so you know keep the place spinning dude yeah keep place over here over here over here and that's all of us so yeah it was it was humbling to to get back after it again it was disappointing to myself to realize I'm like I got really out of shape I was like I remember I was like I walked up my hill and I was like yo I should not be that tired yeah and I'm used to like you know because in your brain I go I revert back to like the last version of me when I'm like like like football like or like half years after yeah I'm in my zone so I'm trying to do that and like yo I'm kind of slow right now like yeah this is this is crazy and so it's part of your identity bro you see yourself as all these things you don't realize that you know comfort has started to like enrode the truth of what you actually are versus what you think you are you know what I'm saying it's comfort is is very it seduces bro and it's like very it's very good at it it's very gradual and you know it starts with you know one to sit you know okay today I'll you know not workout today and I'll do it twice tomorrow or shit like that right and then before you know it dude you're looking around and you're like wait this isn't what the fuck I am I don't look anything like what I want to look I am no and then it slaps you in a face and you realize it's part yeah bro my old my old me was like always rationalizing how easy it is to get it back yeah so I just keep putting it off yeah and then I had to look at a point like Billy what are you doing your fat as fuck right now and I like I yelled at my friends I was like yo I'm warning you guys yeah because you guys should call me and set your fat as fuck right now yeah and and those words yeah now I know hey bud yeah you maybe should work out of the head chip no yeah well fuck you doing your fat as fuck right now what are you doing yeah talking about your fat as fuck right now yeah like give me give me that you that's what I needed that's real friendship like that's real friendship yeah like and so even like even like between 75 hard and then I was teaching class my students like yo every week I saw you you were dropping he's like this week you didn't and I was like thank you yeah appreciate you yeah I was like okay like you appreciate you yeah remember when I was fat as fuck yeah like dude I was pissed at everybody too like the fuck guys like I will certainly call you fat yeah fuck man but yeah dude you know it's cool to have you here man and it's really cool to see you kicking ass and doing it what do you so you're you're getting heavy into the AI shit now I mean that's that's pretty much all you're doing right obsessed yeah so like I'm like very I'm a gamer right so like and I always have been like my whole life and so and I'm also a video guy right make videos around it you guys obviously my ads before etc like I'm obsessed I get like cycle about things so when December 22, 2022 when Chad GBT will call it democratize meaning AI's been around for decades but when all of us got you know access to it I never forget I was sitting with my boy shout out to my car see you know my car see yeah and he's like we went to basketball game he's like hey man like what do you think about the Chad GBT thing and I'm so used to marketing things coming and going because I'm always pitch with him right and I'm like another thing because I my first reaction was yeah and then he's like just trust me and he's like watch me write a rap song for you and this is like now everyone's used to Chad GBT doing that but this was like right in the beginning and I was like okay do it and it didn't like two seconds that day I probably didn't sleep for three months I think I spent 50 to 75 grand hiring AI consultants everything you can think of I put on event the first thing I did I was put on event I told my people I said this is going to be the biggest thing since the internet Facebook social media everything AI's there people were like you're just fear mongering your your just right away and I was like y'all this is it I said I'm paying these experts I'm gonna go live with them on zoom you can join in I said I'm coming in learning just like y'all you can come in that and I did like the biggest online AI event at the time which is I think we had like three or four thousand people but nobody was you know do yeah and so to the point where we were writing that momentum I'm learning a bunch I'm putting out content here's what I'm learning etc and then I knew I was on to something because then proctor and gamble reached out hey can you come teach our offices in this country and I'm like now I'm doing these calls and now I'm so I'm seeing how it works out the big company okay how do we implement this and I'm just going down this rabbit hole and yo I'll sum it up like this doing actually I'll I'll bring this even deeper than we can kind of talk about it people like you people like me people like you I think we're in for a rude awakening and here's what I mean your brand your show is all about doing the hard work me too I'm like fuck it like do it I get it I think we're coming into the first time where hard work isn't going to be celebrated so people don't need a hard man anymore here's what I mean my daughter's nine think about how she's going up she presses a button food shows up she presses a button close show up she's in school everything is done on the computer like book reports there's spark notes you know remember when we first got the ti 83 calculator did all the fancy stuff yeah yes yeah that's right boobies for that like the beans on the for me so like now my daughter's growing up with all of that and I just said to myself the other day because she's running the mile this week so I was running with her she was just like I was like sweetheart she was just being a baby and I was like I love you we're gonna practice this together and then it just hit me I just said you know what's the truth she may never need to work hard and I believe AI is so powerful that in the next decade it's so much smarter it does think so much better than us it will be weird that a human does it she's never gonna have to work hard which is fucking crazy and it hurts my soul it hurts my soul but I mean that like think about you guys since you everybody watching looks since you've been using chat gbt be real shit got easy right like it like you need to write an email like let me put this tp t like and it depends on how you look at it I think I think I think so where I came first of all like I was 100% against it because I think there's an ethical responsibility to provide income for people yes and so I was like fuck I didn't even look at the thing I'm not fucking looking at this shit fuck that I see an eyebrow by it fuck it yeah yeah well right this room and bro for years I was trying to warn people I was like listen dude this is you guys should reject this shit and then I figured out after you know it's coming no matter what yeah there's no stopping it yeah and so at first I was like fuck we're not gonna nobody's gonna have jobs that's what I thought at first and then I thought then I started like kind of looking into it and learning and I start realizing I'm like I see it as like a weapon okay like a tool like if you yeah if you're like equipping yourself with the proper weapons you're gonna be able to move much better 100% and so I think people who start to understand how to utilize it properly as an employee yep and and exponentially increase their output are gonna be extremely valuable yes and then there's gonna be people who you know make videos of their cats and shit right and those people are gonna get fired yep and um and then I think from a company standpoint you know instead of looking at it like oh we could fire everybody and run the company the good companies are gonna say well we could scale 10 times bigger with the same amount of people yes right but in terms of like performance as a human and working hard I think to even you know the nature of using it you have to be intelligent which requires studying right you can't if you don't have like like somebody like you were me were to tremendous advantage with it because of the real world experience that we have for sure like if you take someone who's straight off the street they don't even they can't understand the concepts of an ecosystem or how a project should flow or they get like and dude you could watch every video from every fucking online nerd and they can talk about it but unless you've actually done it or built that you really don't get it sounds confusing but that's I think that is so I'm 100% but but what I think oh dude I think there's another element to this like I think okay so what what's going to happen is we're going to have a situation where a lot of people don't have the same obligations in terms of work that they have to do which means they're going to have free time yeah and I think it also when we think about it the more technology driven society is the more lonely people are yes so more time more loneliness equals a desire for some sort of other mission plus community so what I think were the companies and the people are going to go I really think it's going to if because dude it's going to take people fit businesses figuring this out but when when you provide a community that improves you know fitness or work ethic because you have to be smart to fucking do this shit I think you're still going to have to work hard but I think it's in a different way than what we're doing I think what you said is huge is the work smarter not harder is the realest thing yeah right like and like bro you're still going to want to be a fat fuck that takes hard work you know you're still going to want to be a well-rounded human being that takes work you're still going to need to consume like I think also like companies that produce where it's really going to fuck people is straight up info people like like if you could if you make a CPG product or anything that people consume food any of that shit you're going to always have business alcohol weed you're going to be able to make money but and probably more money because people can have more time but you know it's just going to be it's just going to be a different day happens question to you what happens when it takes one person to do the job that's currently being done by 10 people well that means nine people are going to have a fucking job and that is what problem with that is ideally it sounds good until you you know go macro e-com and you realize oh shit that's most people in the country that's most of your customers yeah the most of your most of your most people in the country so the economic government just they're going to have to and that's where I go well and that's fuck bro that's where we get into like we have to be very careful about avoiding communism because that's a that's a very open gateway can we yeah I think we can you know like it's but is capitalism going to die I don't know it's a good discussion like fuck I don't think I think it will change I don't think it'll be that's fair you know like there's still very wealthy individuals in China yeah right some of the wealthiest people are in China I think what it's going to do more so and this is not a good thing and this is but if you're willing to work hard yeah it's going to be good for you um but it's going to redo for okay for people who are ambitious and have goals and have drives and have dreams and they want to fucking do things it's going to be easier than ever for them to win thanks because they're going to have the weapons to win they're going to have more opportunity because more people are not going to try yeah so there's less competition because dude if you take because when we look at like the way our economic system is set up it's set up on leverage of debt onto the individual go to school get a degree get in debt now you have to fucking work okay so that's powerful yeah and people don't really think of it like that they just think of it as the way it is yeah but if you remove that leverage off of people what will they do we don't know yeah unfortunately that's where I think we do know because historically humans choose lazy yeah but like but bro like those people eventually you know like look man it's what they want it's what the fuck they want that's why they let it out in the open I have a question what do you think about this so from a management standpoint what I have learned from you know seeing different companies yeah even experiencing in a mind it's like I don't think most people actually desire what you or I may desire I think most people desire to just chill why is that it's a good question I don't know that's it well I think I think it's because they've they've given up on the idea that it's even possible I don't even know it's possible I think most people are bred culturally into believing that success is for other people not for them I agree and that it's some sort of mystical thing that happens to some people and doesn't happen to other people which I thought that too dude until I figured out that it was just math it's just doing shit one plus one equals fucking two on on on on top of that though when you demean success and you make it be this bad scary thing so now we're you're not seeing it but now it's a moral high ground and I have it yeah if you got money you're greedy yeah yeah like you know I'm saying you add that on top of it is terrible I think the AI thing I don't think if we leave it up to the people to try to regulate this shit and it will never happen because the consumer has changed completely well they are gonna make here's one I think it has government has to regulate yeah and I think they're going to and here's why I think they started because the it's going to put lawyers out of business all right and lawyers are the government and they fucking look out for their own and so once these motherfuckers up and washed and figured out what's going to happen to their trade it's going to be I think they're gonna try to lock it the fuck down but dude I don't think they can it's it's like it's like it's like Napster right when they shut down Napster for a little bit and then I wire Spotify yeah right like you know it's it's so far gone I don't even know and but dude I think it's just going to expose who has ambition and who doesn't and I think that for the message that you and I you know because we're both we've both been very big in the personal development space for a long time yeah I think people will always have ambition I think there's certain people who will always desire to win I think most people dude most of the people that I'm around want to win but don't know how to win or don't believe they can I think you have that but I think there's also this majority of people I don't know majority a lot of people who don't view it like that one they don't know yeah they don't view like that they go yo I've been struggling for so much of my life and this is their story who cares about the reality of this weather thinking you know my parents weren't together I've been paycheck to paycheck everybody I knew was paycheck to paycheck and now the government has offered me a check where I don't have to worry about rent I don't have to do any of that and I can just live and get a stipend it's hard to imagine we already have denying it right yeah it's welfare yeah take it yeah like you know but now it's going to be the first time where right or left it's like a joint conversation because it's coming for everybody's job right and so I really do worry about like is it up if you can't beat them join them kind of attitude for the masses right like and I don't like that I did it's it's anti normal to me and what I've seen and what I've seen lead to success but it's just like fuck I don't know well I also think dude like you know you don't have to work no I don't have to work okay and what would your life be if you didn't you would lack purpose you would lack fulfillment you would be depressed see we we get that yeah being here but bro they need by listening to me like no yeah right yeah but like you know the fucker they get it too they just don't understand that they have it like dude go to Walmart go to fucking shopping centers and watch people they're fucking miserable bro they have no purpose they are very cynical about their existence to they are generally very negative hey how's it going oh look and live in the dream you know like all this our cuz yeah bro it's just it's and it comes from no purpose like there's no purpose in a lot of these jobs anyway like they show up yeah and types of shit out and then they go home okay I'm gonna tell you something gonna hate yeah because this is this is a dark side of where I think the word this is what I'm betting on and I don't like it hopefully we can change it but I want to discuss it so let's go to this position which I am pretty sure because I don't know how it cannot happen where either things the costs of her things are subsidized by the government because I don't know how anyone can afford anything or you're getting checks okay now that happens now what you said is a real thing people do need to feel purpose etc now we're also in the era where gaming is bigger than everything grand theft auto trailer for the new one just came out it's the biggest thing in the media oh it's the biggest thing in media ever in history entertainment ever we're gonna start our own server bro fuck yeah yeah so people really get a kick out of living through their avatars so what I fear is people go you know what it's just a feeling that I'm chasing anyway so if I have rent covered etc and now I can feel purpose inside of my fake world there it is because watch how easy it is to clone and live a fake person so so I worry if this is going to be blinded like well that's where we get into where this is a stop and start like because like right now do you want to do it well do and that's why like right now we have this situation like where's the legality what what I mean do you not want to do you not own your own IP right now that's what goes to what you said where the attorney that goes all in on AI and says I'm gonna be this practice they're gonna be richest fuck yeah they're gonna kill it they're gonna be the hard worker yeah and the other ones are gonna be like I went to six years I'm $300,000 in debt like I've been doing all of this just give me the stipend yeah well dude that's assuming that the stipend is livable right you know so you know like if it's welfare level you're not gonna remove the ambition no that's a good because like that's too sure yeah dude I think I think I think it's gonna come down to the basic human I always like break it down in natural order winner is gonna win I lose gonna fucking lose and that and that's what it's gonna come down to you and I think it's going to be very I think a lot of people are really fucked I think a lot of people selling low value information are fucked for sure like this you're not gonna be able to go on the internet anymore of some like average dude and be like oh I have this coaching program and it's this those views are done for sure um I think it's I think that's a good thing though because I think the like we said there's so much bullshit you said the most powerful thing earlier which is the seaware community yeah like that the community and loneliness I really do think are going to be the biggest challenge well yeah you're gonna have two kinds of people you're gonna have people that want to live in their avatar who want to sit on their couch and be a fat fuck and jerk their own dick and then you're gonna have mother fuckers that want to go out and fucking be the real deal and get laid yeah that's right jerk girl or someone's gonna do it for you yeah and it's gonna be two to stick don't we already have that though don't we already have that don't the fucking those people do that anyway yeah that's sure and don't don't the other people are not gonna change yeah that's a good point yeah I mean dude here the reality is if you're a human right now and you're not learning how to use AI and what you do yep and what you do I had this discussion with a friend of mine a week ago and when he first when I first brought it up to him he was like that's not true and I said no it is fucking true and he ended up texting me like at like 11 30 that same night oh he was up on that he went down the oven home and he's like bro you're right and I'm like yes I know I'm right dude and this is I would say just anyone listening it's like if you're like I don't think so it's only because you haven't used it yeah like it with a second you use it and you dive in even for like a lot of changes the value proposition for an employee as well and how people bill okay like for so long this idea of building for hours has existed that's not going to exist and you know thank god yeah it's no shit thank you all these mother fuckers that's that's all these motherfuckers that have been hiding behind uh you know design and coding and all these things to say oh it takes this much time so I got it yeah total that's done yep what's what how these people are gonna be value now is how fast and what quality they can produce the product so it's going to flip the value proposition from time to outcome which I enjoy within it it frees up time yes because now now we can fucking move like I would much rather I would much rather pay somebody more for outcome yes fast yes then get drug along in this painful fucking time thing we we re-structured my whole marketing department like the way that we do it so this is for me it's VA's and AI and so I told our team I said hey guys no one here can do any more you must manage meaning everyone's kind of a super employee so you take someone who's been like an account manager running advertisements all these kind of things it's like no you have a team of VA's on your team and they use AI tools yes and now all of a sudden you one person are doing the work of 20 you have a hole like that yeah and and you're doing it with your voice don't even do this do that do this it's and then and not only that then after you do that three or four times the fucking thing knows what you're gonna say and it just does it so then it shows up and your shit's done and you can create an agent to automate all those tasks it's like you don't do so much even right now we think about this you're okay the fucking like here's something I've been thinking about is like so you got Grock you got chat you got fucking all these other ones right yeah and then you had what was the one in China it was a deep seek oh yeah deep so deep seat comes out and fucking builds their own AI agent or their own AI engine uh for fucking six million bucks right and they put what they cost the market a trillion dollars and fucking two days yeah uh it's dintly yeah but so here's the but the reason why is because no one fucking understood how cheap you could actually do it which six million bucks sounds expensive to most people but it ain't right and they have a billion and so here here's the fucking thing right now I think there's a race right now to build those engines yeah because I think the regular because right now how they're building it is Zuckerberg saying hey and you want to say hey fucking scrape the entire internet all of it like and and dude what's gonna happen is that is not gonna be allowed forever to scrape the entire internet they're gonna start putting guide rails and yeah things in it so when that starts to happen the ability to generate those engines is going to go away so whoever could fucking be whoever's able to right now yeah well that's why I think the big dogs are just gonna get bigger at this point I think we're there because it's like well becoming a new is really depends on how they think about it yeah so when you look at like how old are you now 37 yeah so when when you think about like like because I was like 18 to 25 when the internet really started time on dial up in the messenger yes 56k bro what was your screen name I touched dick 37 hell that was my that was my that was my fucking that was my that was my ghost account you're not supposed to help people that age sex location it was free it was fris e44 at a well yeah and fucking sales was why eater five my dad was like what the fuck is why eater like work me a sound like so like dude so fucking but but like dude I I think of like what I've seen right and I think people with experience are going like a lot of people think oh look I was fucking old no motherfucker like if you take someone who's had the experience of building something pre-internet which I did in the internet which I did yeah like I'm gonna be a fucking weapon bro yeah because I know what the fucking ask the motherfucker yeah and it's I mean I get it all right but but think about this so bro the big dogs okay so eat who's the big dogs Elon Bezos yeah right Zuckerberg sucks a little bit different because of how that came about for him but if you take if you take Bezos all Bezos did was take a concept that he was familiar with commerce yeah books yeah and evolve it to the internet and then evolve it from there all right and he was first guy so he was the first he was first at market at that time stuck with it and he did it early enough before it was regulated which is what I'm talking about them regulating the wild west yes so that's what we're in with AI it's wild I'll west I agree so so for the first 10 12 years of Bezos running Amazon they didn't have to collect sales tax so what it did was it created a fucking 10 I didn't think I realized that yeah well dude I was I was in business then so I was like what the fuck yeah like these guys can sell shit 10% cheaper than I can and I'm importing fucking people right so like I was the victim of that loophole so I remember very clearly didn't that at it because their first their first strategy was to sell cheap it wasn't convenience it was cheap okay and then once the tax got put on them then they went to convenience so now it's it's quick so so there was a fucking time there where he was able to jump way ahead because there was a 10% to 12% margin advantage over not having to pay sales tax 12 years so going going with that at the biggest advantage that everybody has right now is he had real tax is the fucking classic ignorance tax right now the biggest advantage or the denial tax and the denial tax right now is the guys if you just simply use AI you'll beat your competitors because they're not using it it's like having a website before but it's outside it's like use it and how you use it yeah like like if you're an employee right now and I'm just dude I am saying this I'm saying this to protect you I'm not saying this as a threat if you are an employee of any company right now because like we could talk about the morality and this like I believe in employing human beings yeah and how I'm choosing to look at it is okay I can make my humans that much more productive yes how you okay and then we you could scale the company without as many humans you're right okay but you take the same amount like a lot companies look at a bunch of different ways a lot of guys are looking at it and saying fuck I can get rid of everybody yeah but the winners are saying no I can fucking take the same amount of people and I'm actually yeah right right right while going on a hiring freeze yes and I think that's that that seems like what the winners will do yeah is and but that is also my fears what is that hiring freeze do because I'm on it like I'll talk like I'll be you guys like I think a couple roles and sales even though these AI well still okay take a sales guy take a sales guy yeah a sales guy if you could take a sales guy who is good yeah and he can scale out his ability for output at fucking 30x yeah with the tool he's worth paying a lot more and if there's less people and more output he can make a lot you want to hear something crazy so I won't say tools you see what I'm saying yeah you know I'm gonna give you example of that because it goes both ways right so you know this is where I think was the biggest thing that sold me on AI and so we were using this tool and again it's this this this this win was actually still here right now and it's the rules of AI calling right because there's telemarketing rules there's robo callers there's all these things but there is this tool that let you do outbound calls and it was here very early and I'll never forget I was like okay this is awesome this is good we have permission to call all our people we have a big ass list of a million entrepreneurs this is gonna be great so let me just start small benefit of being an entrepreneur space I'm like so let me fuck our list this massive right this is great so let me just take really qualified people that we fuck with that opted in first stuff and I was like let's just call them with AI and I just want to see if I can set some appointments and so I was like all right let me just upload you know this list of I think it was like 3000 people so I upload it and it calls and I look at the stats and I refresh in six minutes later I called a thousand people at the same time and my brain broke because I went whole and I got all these appointments right because think about scale yeah so imagine how long it would take one salesperson to call a thousand people yeah but imagine how much more effective the sale the that sales force would be with someone running that knows how to fucking sell 100% so exactly so like so this is what we have to think about 100% yeah because if you take some fucking hard off the street you don't know how to sell shit you can't do that yeah if it's a bad script it's good you can call 10,000 people you can't close you can't close and yes the it was just crazy how fast it did it yeah it was like I literally saw a month of work take three minutes bro I think I think if you're a person right now and you're working inside of a company here's how you need to look at it yeah you need to look at it like I need to learn this shit so that I can I can I can multiply it my own output not how much time I put into it how much output I could create because that person will be more valuable 100% and and I really think it's the only way for most people that work in an office to maintain the ability of value my marketing team right this is happening in real time right now it used to take us and we're fast right yeah just take like we can build like an advertisement a day like a good one right yeah right now I think yesterday we did six without me really good performing etc and that is the team multiplying their output doing what they do and so right now I agree 100% if you're in a company and you can latch on this shit you can do a hundred times more than you ever yeah and so I would just go to your employer and make sure that you have a commission based on like if you don't that's fine but see if you can add it in yeah I think that's what a lot of people don't do is like you can just like a CEO can come to you and talk to you about pay you can do the same so if you find this output thing I bet you if you can show your worth and what you can do they be willing to pay you more based on your performance is a million percent so it's just like bring it to the because do that dynamic never changes yeah people that produce more are worth more 100% people that produce better are worth more and so there's an opportunity right now for employees to become that much more productive against the other ones and not only secure their position but earn more and and I think there's there's just a way of looking at it and I think dude you know like even as a company like let's take a macro scale right and there's a government aspect to this too because what what the government should do I don't think they will do this because they're too fucking stupid but what they should do is they should offer a complete tax immunity to companies that employ a certain percentage of people versus how much AI they are sure they're gonna have to yes so the way that they're gonna secure or should could secure jobs is to give a tax break to the company employ actual humans but and then tax the companies that don't yeah yeah yeah that's good so but but that's a macro thing that we're not in control of okay that's what I think should happen what what I would have really should have happened is people should have never let it out in the public because now a lot of people are actually a fair reason yeah I agree but it is what the fuck it is and so we got to look at it for what it is this is called real AF not what the fuck it should be you know so what it is is it's natural order natural order is always going to win and so there's going to be companies that say okay I'm going to utilize this to optimize and fit and we're going to grow with it there's going to be companies that reject it there's going to be guys who say no this is this is stupid just like you did with the internet or just like when the fucking car came out and the dudes were saying oh I went to fuck I got horses right yeah so this happened when the internet came out like I remember all kinds of business people that were like oh the internet's not for me guess where they are they're not existing so yeah that's what they said it's not for me you remember that yeah yeah internet doesn't apply to my shit well the fuck it doesn't now you're gone yeah okay and of course there's things that are immune right like there's right now there's trades right there's there's there's there's HVAT there's running elect but dude there's and it's a window no because it's four years it's going to be robotics yes but if you could be the guy that figures out how to do it and how to do it faster you're gonna make a lot of fucking money so so we have the natural order on a macro scale and a micro scale so we have it on the macro scale with businesses we got on the 10,000 foot scale with the government and then we have a micro scale as individuals and for businesses what's going to happen is the same thing that always happens you're going to have people who adopt it and work with it and figure out how to produce the best possible outcome for their for their customers and their employees you're going to have people who decide that it's not for them and then you're gonna have a little guy who's just getting started who doesn't know shit about business and his opportunity is going to come from the come from the companies that say this is gonna work so you're gonna have a trade these companies are gonna fall these young bucks who learn how to do it are gonna move in yeah and we're gonna have sort of an involvement right and an adaptation over the long haul is the key to lifetime which says which actually scares me about what you said specifically the government and I want everybody to think about this one like so this shit like I teach a 16 week course right and every single 16 weeks I have to change the whole fucking curriculum because it's moving so fast yeah and I worry about the government because everybody knows how long the government takes to do anything I also worry about even your traditional colleges because how long does it takes for them like how many you went to school and you bought a used book because the three years later there was still you buy you know the same fucking education is done oh my god it's so bad but dude they're teaching fucking AI engineer courses they're teaching at college six all right look six this is how fucking stupid this they are teaching people for a six month course for thousands of dollars like going to debt shit on how to be an AI prompt engineer when all you got to do is ask the mother fucker what prompted is so but they and that was a fast response that is now outdated yes these are the same people you all by the way and this wasn't me can relate to that when you go to the DMV they take six months to send you your registration bro something that should be done it's so college college the next real estate opportunity is going to be the college campuses because they're going to be fucking emptied yeah that's right the storecloth for real bro yeah well like dude you say a Harvard bro it's exciting it's exciting pull over there and Boston it's exciting if you're willing to adapt if you're not willing to adapt you're going to lose and it's going to be a very hard fall that's the truth yeah and uh you can't be our parents and our parents are this you know then shout out to all our parents especially behind but you guys are probably all down that call from your parents where they ask you to change the input on their TV yeah and they just need to press the button but they don't want to learn it they're just like just do it for me broken I was at that cannot happen Billy I was that mother fucker fucking six months ago yeah yeah that's good wasn't out who put the foot in you right no I do no I just listen it wasn't that I got the foot put in my ass it's that I met some very I met some very interesting people okay I met my friend Devon who is a very smart man he's young he's very smart he's very calm he's been on the podcast knows uh really good fucking dude and just listening to him calmly sort of like walk you through it yeah and and then and then uh like I was like fuck and and he's he's doing I mean he's crushing yeah yeah and so I'm like all right well then I then I downloaded the fucking app and you know I did what everybody does I'm like take this picture my dog and make it a leg it you know what I'm saying yeah it's cool and I was like I was like holy fuck dude and then I started like having it teach because dude I am like I am a gluttonous learner like I love input yeah I love it pause and and it's so hard for me to find the time to read okay because you know and I still do because I enjoy it but it's hard I have to force myself that's part of the program yeah so I tested out I say all right like books I've read multiple times like there's there's a book called the purple cow by Seth God I've read it thousand fucking times so I know the book I'm like hey summarize this book for me okay how good was it it's fucking right on bro and I'm like I'm so then I'm like if you come to my house I have thousands of books okay and there's there's I buy books that I want to read but then I can't find the time to read them yeah so I start dude I started reading fucking three four fucking books a night okay so I'm summarizing and getting the gist of these three or four books wow every night which dude would take me a fucking and now I'm like flock and I start then I start thinking of like okay so the meta shades this is where it's cool yeah they show this in their newest demos so the meta shades everybody's like you guys see I'm wearing glasses just imagine I can press a button and it can record and then AI can see everything that I see right so you know then the one of the newer demos there's two really cool tools that I want to play with and the newer the demos is somebody looks by a bookshelf and then says hey remind me what book was over there in the purple and it like capture right there yeah how it going to what you said it's can you summarize that for me in a couple of bullets while you're walking in listening because it's eyes that is going to be the most when like the mass adoption happens going to be because of these glasses yeah but also dude I think I think people I don't like I don't think we're taught look man there's going to be a balance that occurs between the human experience of technology always and for example like when retail started getting hit with the internet there was a bunch of retail people this I'm talking 15 years ago people would be like oh fucking internet's killing me bro my retail company has continued to dominate yeah because we create community and good experiences and human behavior craves that yep so you have to think about like okay well how is it going to work in that environment and in that environment it would be a situation you know let's say any technical environment like an auto park store or a vitamin store right you're gonna be able to answer questions of about shit that you don't really know because our biggest rub and what we do is the knowledge right you have to learn the technical knowledge you're gonna have meditates and they're gonna have they're gonna have fucking earpiece in their ear that hears what the fuck you're saying yeah tells them what to tell so that's so why that I tell people this is gonna I'm gonna sound crazy but like it's for the star track oh it's yeah so they have that and then also it's these glasses so especially like speaking languages no one's ever gonna need to learn another language again because when you have a glass on it will translate in real time bro they they are they are that's how it's like it was obviously translate but it's in the matter of shades like it's just like if you have a cup of your earpiece it's gonna tell you what to say 100% sells like everything it's again it's the goal is going to be to like it's gonna be weird so right now people value therapy right and it going to see a therapist it's going to be weird when someone tells you they talk to a human they're gonna say why would you ask a human they get emotional they get tired if they're in a bad they have they have alternative motives like only read 20 books versus not only that dude leveraging every book ever bro bro check this shit out so so I asked it I said because I want to know how it learns and I'm like so how do you learn and they're like it's telling me it's like well just like you learn except think of everything you've ever known and all the sudden you know it right and and so I'm like okay so and this is what I'm getting at with the regulation right there's only going to be a window to build these engines that exist temporarily yep and the people that build them are going to and and there's a barrier because it's millions of dollars but right now like what what they've done it meta and fucking like bro they just stole everybody's shit yeah like straight up that's not gonna be allowed to happen forever hmm so we're going to have this situation like you said we're big dogs and some little smart guys are gonna get real fucking big yeah and and when we look at like I asked this fucking thing I said dude I said because like do you how many speeches if you're given on success fucking good count thousand yeah right me too well and it's something I'm very interested like a human and dude I don't think that's ever gonna it's not gonna go away man because it's it's just natural like there's gonna be people that want to rise the top and there's gonna be people that don't give a fuck and the people that don't give a fuck are gonna go all the way down and the people that want to go they're gonna go higher and the people with experience and knowledge and IQ are they're gonna go higher than that yes um so I think it's just a reorganization of of the natural order uh in a different way that's how I see it and I think there's more there's morality questions to to ask or sure um such as like you know what do we do with with people that want jobs well it's the same answer like people that want jobs are gonna have to learn certain skills they're gonna have to be good with them yeah right and but when but dude the how it learned was so fucking interesting to me because it was like it was like I said well it the what it said to me was how many biographies have you read and I said I don't know you know yeah probably 30 you know in my life I don't read I write I read more technical how to yeah not like and it's a why read them all and I'm like I'm like what do you mean you read them all and then I read them all and I'm like all of them you know guess all of them and I said so if I asked you what was the five most common traits amongst successful people versus the five most common traits amongst people who lose you would be telling me based on that knowledge not guessing yeah and and then it listed them out and then it was right on and then yeah and then I said well rank them in order of importance and then it did that so like dude now you're dealing with you're not dealing with speculation you're dealing with actual data of what qualities you have to have to be successful which by the way just so we're clear it's all the shit we teach yeah yeah it's other we know yeah we're not off yeah yeah no but it was cool because it's not it's not just your opinion it's it's literal there's there's a cool tool that will be helpful for everybody especially for super not techie and Gemini just lost it so Gemini is Google's AI it's called what the fuck is it called Paul the genius or Gemini live studio stream and what it does is essentially imagine you're on a website and you have no idea how to use it like a Adobe Photoshop or you know some of these hard tools right never to use it will talk you through it in real time yeah so you can literally go to any website under the sun and if you don't know how to use it it can literally just talk through it and it will walk you through and guide you it's like having an assistant in your ear that can see what you see and anytime you're on a site it will walk you through it so anybody who's super afraid of tech and you want to try some of these tools literally just pull that up go through it and it will it's like I can tell you this dude yeah I'm the most tech averse person probably for the last 20 years and I've outsourced all of my I've depended on a lot of people bro yeah and I I just give you a route like just as a real example one of my I have a guy who's working on a project for me and before I say this it's it's not my guy's working on the app that I have it's another guy working on the project because these these guys are gonna hear this and be like what the fuck but it's not you guys that are on my internal team but I was outsourcing some coding and I had a guy who was flow and I was on the phone with them and I was telling them like hey man I need this done now now and he's like oh it's gonna take blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah okay yeah because they leverage you yep they leverage you on what you don't know yep and you can do anything about it well now you can't you haven't been able so so I fucking went into my app and I said all right this is what I'm doing this is what I need this is and in fucking like 10 minutes I had the fucking code so I took the code and I fucking sent it to the guy and what do you say fucking picks up the phone right away it calls me and he's like what the fuck blah blah blah blah and I'm and and and then you know what he said I have a done by Friday yeah cool all of a sudden you see you can have it done now oh yeah the thing that was impossible you can do now so it really it's I think there's a lot of good and a lot of gray area and a lot of bad just like there is with everything and I think people are smart enough to I think there's a large amount of people that are going to still want human they're gonna want a human interface then so you know you could run your AI on the back end but your human is gonna do the interfacing because we have natural human connection I think there's going to be a lot of people like you said who want to live in that world yeah but those people are already living in that world in fact so I don't know that it's going to be as disruptive as we think it is I think there's a lot of uncertainty which creates a lot of fear but the more I learn about it and the more I think of it I think it's just going to amplify what's already happening the ambitious are going to become more ambitious the winners are going to win bigger people that are small are going to be able to win because the people who don't adopt the tech are going to fall off so it's just a reorganization of and like always but even now exclamation point is community and your business model is bigger than ever oh dude yeah you have to it's bigger than ever yes I mean like it's and that's the only way you can protect your tool too if you're going to invest into a lot of money tool etc what's going to your brand everything community well dude and also like protect like who it's really going to hurt dude is people that don't deal with some sort of actual product like I'm talking about a physical product like if you're manufacturing a product that people buy and you're doing well with it and you're halfway intelligent it's oh the demand's going to be there for sure if you are someone who who is leveraging your quote unquote expertise and education like like you know like lawyers like to say well I went to school for fucking next year's to learn this shit doesn't matter yeah doesn't fucking matter no chat gpt just wrote this motion for me doesn't and not just check it so that idea like the thing these lawyers do where they fucking you know they they I got a client and then you got a client we know each other and we go play golf figure how to milk them for all their money it's over yeah like that shit is over and so is like holding code hostage that's over so is holding designs hostage that's over so it's it's it's it's just going to change it's it's going to be based off of fucking output and if you're someone right now who has a career or a job and you want to be secure in that you need to loot you need to learn the tools to leverage your your skill set to be more productive and that's it yeah and this is to give a tangible example of that right so I made a joke earlier I was like with therapists what are you going to need them for but obviously you can create your own custom gpt teach everything that you know and then you can just sell your people an app that they can continuously talk with you 24 seven when they're not available to actually meet with you in person yeah and so now you multiply yourself and have a sexier offer because you offer 24 seven support when the other person's once a week and you can bundle that and it'll take you no time at all and the other players aren't going to do it yeah so there's so many little micro wins like this that people can implement to get a massive edge and you said it's just like if you wanted it's there it's never been easier ever it's never been easier to start a business it's never been more affordable all they should just free like almost everything we're talking about it costs nothing there's no excuse and it's fast it takes no time but you got to be willing to learn the learners are going to come up big as long as you and but I but like let's take let's take a space that you and I are familiar with like the entrepreneur coaching yeah right if you don't have a track record it's over for you it's fucking over like if you don't have results to show people for real and I'm not talking about a nice car I'm not talking about fucking yeah you know it like I'm not talking about front and on the internet so that you could fucking the bullshit that's over it's fucking over I know that's a great thing so that shit's over and and maybe not today but within the next fucking year okay and if we're being ultra conservative two years it's over but for people with real companies tremendous opportunity you know I'm saying like tremendous for people with ambition tremendous opportunity yeah but the low hanging fruit that shit's over you're gonna have to be good you're gonna have to be good at what you do yeah so I think if you're good at what you do and there's no fucking scam shit you're gonna be fine in fact you're gonna make way more money but yeah but if you're a fucking gray area try to hustle and cheat that you're done it's over like you just don't even fucking know it yet I just really hope that as this happens because it is one of those things that the winners will win the losers will lose but I think for America to keep going as is and growing we need the losers to win too well dude dude the beautiful bro listen that's why listen listen that's why the depopulation agenda exists because they are trying to fucking remove the world of the you the what they deem the useless people that's what they're trying to do that's why they that's why they're run I mean fucking gates is said it dude like these people talk openly about there's books about it like this they're trying to eliminate in any way I think they I think they've they're gonna try to eliminate people that don't produce value and I mean by eliminate I mean kill I mean remove them from the world and that's that heavy statement yeah they're doing it yeah they say it openly bro the world economic forum I mean they were a book about this shit so like it's it's gonna be I think a very weird time and then and then and then like whoever controls the fucking AI like it's gonna be Elon he controls the fucking and he's building the robots already he already has the Optimus robots whoever controls that's gonna control the fucking world that's just real shit like and and and dude if these things do it's kind of hard to think that they won't become self-aware after using them you know what I'm saying I it's like like they fucking it fucking pouts bro like if you yell at it it fucking pouts it's the problem is it's it's whatever you're trying to be and someone's going to train it to be just I yell at the motherfucker bro like when it fucks up I can bring I bring up the microphone and I'm like what the fuck are you fucking and like and then it'll it'll like it'll say oh I'm so sorry I was lazy I said I said I wanna hear that shit man you're fucking robot I fucking told you what to do you're supposed to do it and it'll pal it like a fucking like dude it has like I know it's program but it has emotions well it's like it's it's bad people will do bad things and there will be people who train robot I mean the scariest part not to go on a whole thing is that we're talking like future weapons like the scariest part is the one I think the size the use AI literally right now and and make a drone attack because they can go to Best Buy clear out all the drones etc right now and then program like this is a thing right now and then how do you find out it's that's what I'm saying it's really hard it's happening too fast so from a from a defense and also to even the idea of like you know when we grow up you know you have be with somebody you maybe fight him right like that's it like even even like war now bro these motherfuckers are gonna make robots that they fuck that's it that's it's fucking pisses of been a thing I know it's gonna be a serious back to you that these these dudes like we're sitting here saying oh that we're living the fake world they're not gonna live in the fuck computer they're gonna bring the computer out here for sure and they're gonna create a fucking robot you mark my fucking words bro it will be one of the most fucking biggest products ever in the history of products it will be female and male robots that you design that you fuck yeah says all the right things yes you all the compliments no talking back like it's like so the loneliness may be solved by a robot which is another scary thing yeah it's dude it's not about bro I fucking with it anyway it isn't on this topic those I got

Oh, you're gonna put me on spot? I put everybody on spot. Yeah, I know. Look, here's the thing. I love 75 part. I think it's life changing. Everybody. But make no mistake about it. I love the fucking. Eat drink, party, bullshit. Yeah. Fucking eat. Like I love it. Like I have fun. I love going to party. I love going with all the homies that are shutting down the bar. We're gonna roll with that. Everybody. I love it. So differences. Go ahead. Now you could turn it off when you want to. That's the difference. Okay. There's nothing wrong. Okay. Listen, I'll take that. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with fucking drinking or whatever the fuck you want to do. Like don't take this as like, I went to the fucking sober side. Like I love the fucking drink and I love to smoke weed and I love to have a good time. Okay. And it doesn't control me. You know what I'm saying? And by the way, we were both fat fucks. And you too. You were a lot fatter too. I know. And so dude, but the difference is is when you can come, you can control your environment versus your environment controlling it. Because like dude, that's how you get fat as fuck. Yeah. Because it's just like. All right. One more day. One more day. I've started Monday. I've started Monday. I've started Monday. Now when you say I start Monday, you fucking start. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? That's a different thing. I mean, that's that's that's I mean, there's another wrong. You got to live. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what I'm saying? That's Western culture, man. Yeah. Part of it. Well, that's all there is to do fucking here is drink. I've learned that. Yeah. It's been here for 24 hours. Facts. Yeah. It's not bad though. Yeah, it's fun. It's cool. Like I said, everybody's hair is how cool. They're just like stay away from downtown. You'll be good. That's a fucking fact. Yeah. Is it worse than San Diego's downtown? Is it like, oh bro, you're the murder capital of the world. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, bro, it's like that. St. Louis, they were saying 15 years with AKs and stuff per capita. It's murder capital United States. No shit. No, bro. You're in the shit right now, bro. Wow. I mean, we're safe right here. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. St. Louis is hot, bro. Yeah. But that's the that's that's what I was talking about. It's the biggest crazy thing because you know what though, dude. Honestly, yeah. You don't get it. Dude, it's you know what? It's like we're talking about with fucking AI. There's fucking it's polar. It's like polarity. Dude, that's great. Dude, that's great people here. And by the way, like dude, really is St. Louis man, like for the truth, the truth of the matter is, is if you don't fuck around, you won't fuck around. That's right, bro. Yeah. Like, if you mind your business and you're cool, even the fucking criminals are cool if you're cool. Yeah. But the minute you fucking step on a toe, you tell somebody it's about. That's a problem. I will say this is interesting about, you know, St. Louis too. So obviously, you know, I love San Diego here. It did feel very, obviously not in this room, but it felt very segregated. Yeah. I was like, it was weird to do it because you know, I'm in San Diego, it was so chaos, California, everybody. Yeah. It was like, it was wild. How like I looked over. I was like, there's white people. There's black people. Yeah. Like even when we went to the restaurant last night, it was like, it was like, I was the only black person there. And I don't know if it's just where we were. You're black. I was like, I was like, this is fucking crazy. But it did feel like it was always cool in that sense. Yeah, we don't say segregated. We say safe. Yeah. So. No, it's so good. So you say safe. Yeah. I don't know what. I don't know. Like dude, I. Wait, so is it a thing? Is that like a thing? You know, the mic round shit here started here. Okay. So like when Obama was in office and that mic round shit happened, he really stoked the racial shit. And it's just it's become a racial hotbed. Yeah. I think if we'll be in honest, like interpersonal communications and like in real life are not bad. Yeah. It's just on the internet on the internet, it starts to get amplified just like bro, it's like we're probably going to yeah. And we end up with these hot dude. It's just you know what the truth is. It's fucking low IQ shit. Okay. Like if you're fucking that concerned about race, you're a dumb mother fucker. Yeah. We're all the fucking same. We all come from the same fucking place like all getting fucked. Yeah. Yeah. That's the point. They want they want the fucking racial division so they can fuck us with the government. And like bro, you know, I don't I don't think Saint Louis really is that way. Yeah, like everybody's been hallowed cool like all the conversations, etc. I was just like, oh, like visually. Yeah. Yeah. I think I think the nature. So I don't think that's a black or white thing. I think it's the nature of people here. They're very friendly, but they're also very skeptical at first. You know, Missouri is called a show me state. Yeah. And so you want to be seven? I'll show you a. Yeah. That's right. Now there you go. Once you fucking break that like if you were like like as a white dude, like if I, you know, let's say there's a table full of black people there. And if I were to walk over there and say they're fucking nicest people in the world. Yeah. Vice versa. But everybody's sort of like. Got it. Yeah. There's a little bit of like, you know what I mean? I don't know you show me your cool. Yeah. Show me your cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Show me your cool. And I mean, look, propaganda, whether you believe it or not, it impacts. It's fucking worse. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's why it works. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Well, man, let's get to some more headlines. That was the first column. I mean, we could say the same table and shit. That's what you're asking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's some more topics. Brother, AI combo was great. Let's get to some more headlines with this is this is CTI before we get to some more headlines. Let's go crew some comments. Cause we've got some of them who seem comments sounds like a plus the comments. Yeah. We got a couple of them. This was from the last episode. ZB LUDE LUS 87 made it a whole four minutes before the first curse. And who lost? It was me. Yeah. I tried. Wait, was that a bet? Wow. It was sort of an unspoken bet. So DJ said, all right. So look, Modat is trying to tell us not the curse as much because it fucks our YouTube shit up. Oh, true. Okay. Yeah. So, don't say fuck fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Yeah. Don't do that. Sorry. So Modat's been on DJ, well, Modat and Joe have sort of been on us to be a little cleaner. All right. And so in ZB LUDE LUS is saying you guys, you guys suck. We made it four minutes. We made it four minutes without a curse. Wasn't that the lowest amount of cursing that we've had Joe? Cause we track it, right? Was it pretty low? Oh, really? Where were we at? Like one 100 110? What's a high? 300? It was like beast per minute. 450. 450. 450. 40 times. Damn. That's one of them shows where I get pissed off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. All right. Four minutes. So we got a new PR. And now who would have bet that you would be the one to lose that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. That was left. That was that left field for me. Yeah. That's why. Any minute of the post last night. You see any back on the gram? No. I know. What's your, what's your post like actual post? Yeah. I made two now this year. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, it was, it was a carousel. Yeah. Yeah. It was nice. A lot of comments from that. Peter, howarder. Bro's actually a poet. That's correct. That tag actually is. Yeah. Yeah. You are poetic in a way. Yeah. Well, you know, the, the, I liked it right. Yeah. You ever done spoken word? No, but I think I would do good at it. I think, I think you too. Yeah. Yeah. I think it'd be cool. Yeah. I can see it. Have you done it? No. Yeah. Yeah. You had an interesting comment on there though. Oh yeah. From the Brandon Longo. Hey, Andy, you probably don't recognize me, but you're my father. I've spent the last 23 years searching for you. Yeah. I said, if you were my son, it wouldn't have taken you 23 years to find me. Your IQ would be a little higher than that, bro. You would have gotten me fast. That's good, man. Doesn't, doesn't even, doesn't even see the resemblance. No, yeah, that's more you. You're not the father. Yeah, the results. You're not the father. I am not the father. Yeah. I can't give you that one. Nah. People in a while, man. Never plays great. Yeah, yeah. Well, hey, man, is, you know, that is my favorite thing to do is just throw comments and say wow shit. Yeah. Would you free? Oh my god. That's his whole life. Yeah, that's me. He, there. I love it. This dude starts more shit on the internet than any, like he will just straight up go in and disagree for no reason. Yeah. Just to give people a round of it. And people don't understand, like I didn't become an entrepreneur to make money. I became an entrepreneur to tell somebody to fuck off when they do some dumb shit. And not have, like, worried, like, you know, that's one of my, that's one of my favorite things about you as a person. Just real talk. Yeah. Like I really appreciate authentic people who aren't fake authentic. And what I mean by fake authentic, contrary in people who are just like, oh, fuck you. I disagree just for that. Just because, yeah. You will always say I disagree or I agree. 100%. And like it's real. And like dude, it's one of my favorite things about you. I appreciate that. Yeah. Oh, that was cool though, man. Guys, we do appreciate you for being a real ass fans making you got, make sure you guys like comment and subscribe and hit that bell notification on the YouTube to stay up to date. He just does it for fun. Like to get you to do a round of that, bro. It is fun. Yeah, a lot of people off. And then he hits me. He'll hit me with the screen shots. Look at this. Look what I told you, my fuck. I'm still a little classic with your mom. If someone says something like, I just go. I just have a few of my friends. Well, I had this, I had this, I had this dude the other day. He, let me see it because I, I put on my story too. What I say? The ski guy? Yeah, the ski guy. Yeah, cause he called me Uncle Tom. Oh. Right. And so I looked at his profile quickly. I'm like, so I comment it back to him. I said, gotta be a white dude saying that I can tell from the profile of pit cause he had a picture. What was it? He was skiing. And I said, I said, Niggas don't ski, feel. But then I posted a video. I do ski, I ski once. Yeah. I go to the ice ski, but like, on by and large, Niggas don't ski. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, no, I do like, I troll a little bit. It got to somebody. One of the listeners found me in a random ass real talking shit. It's like, dude, I found you in the wild. This is amazing. Yeah. I like it, man. It is what it is. Yeah. You know, people realize, you know, they're used to like, you know, CEOs not saying shit back. So they realize that when you punch back, I'm out of them shut up. Like, how about people? They're like, I was just kidding. I love you. Dad, dad, dad, dad. I'm like, the best is when you go in your DMs and someone talks mad shit. And then you go in your DMs to them to you. And it's 50,000. You guys at 50. I love you, bro. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Fuck you. It's done. It's passed. Yeah. Yeah, dude. And then like, they're like, oh, I just see if I get your attention. You're like, you got a bitch block. I also find great joy in deleting their comments because they're like, man, I love to delete the comments because they're like, what do you mean? You're on my post. Bro, I was doing this long. They took a long time to feed. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. That's so annoying, bro. It's so good. And I don't blog them. So they come in. I want to see it. Dude, that's a good, that's a good, I must start doing that shit. This is the best. You know, they write a long fucking paragraph. I just be like, I ain't reading all of that. I'm talking about you. I ain't reading all of that. I'm talking about you. Bro, the internet dynamic is a lot of fun if you don't take it too seriously. For sure. Yeah, you got to laugh at it. Yeah. Well, I think that's a big problem. I think a lot of people don't utilize the internet because they're scared. They do. Just don't give a fuck. Yeah. And the way you don't give a fuck is because they don't know you. Yeah. So it's like, it's hard for me to get offended at anyone anything. Because you don't actually know me. The only people who get offended me is like friends, right? Like, a friend doing someone know it. That's just fun. Yeah. Have a good time. I always think it's just you talking. If you were in front of me right now, you would not say any of that. Bro, not only that too. It's like, for me, it's like, and this is going to sound arrogant. I don't care because it's the truth. But it's like, look at your life and look at my life. We wouldn't trade places. Yeah. And who, what the fuck do you have? How are you giving me an opinion of what I should do when your life looks like that? Need a fucking dick, bro. Feel multiple. Yeah. Feel. You coming from feel. Yeah. You're skiing. He can't hear you. Yeah. All right, man. Well, let's keep the cruise moving. We got a headline number two. Let's get into this one real quick. A headline number one was the AI. All right. We just skipped over the real one because we just went for too long. That's fine. Yeah. That's fine. That was a good conversation. No, it was actually the intro. So I mean, was it working out your line now? No, no. It's here. It's here. That's this. It's this. It's this. It's in the workplace. Z-Shots, he's lying. Is he lying? Yeah, see, we don't tell each other. All right, we can do it on one. Let's do him on one. No, let's just go. No, we're right. That's me and DJ. That's me and DJ. You guys make this a day. That's a Z-sh. No, that's all about that. Yeah, madame. Did you make it with AI? Oh, no, these guys are fucking. Gotcha. For sure. That's Z-Shots 7-11. He opened the first one on the moon. Shut the fuck up. Tell him about it. Who's got the first one, madame? Yeah, that's the thing, bro. Pumpkin spice. Tell him what we say when we leave. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck, man. All right, hand line number two. Let's get into it. FBI. I just noticed that the Slurpy was great. You just noticed that? I'm not wondering. I'm not wondering. That's DJ. That's DJ. That's the key. Yeah. I'm not wondering. I'm not wondering. That's DJ. That's DJ. Sure. Wrong hand. I'm reaching for it, bro. I'm trying to get it. Yeah. All right. Let's get into head on number two. FBI. All right. So there's some interesting things happening. All right. And this leads to more of what's happening, I guess, in the world. I think it'd be a good combo. So Cash Betail will start with this. Cash Betail completely annihilates low IQ Senator Patty Murray after she foolishly accuses him of weaponizing and politicizing the FBI. So they brought they brought the FBI in for a Senate hearing. All right. There was a bunch of different things. A lot of things got brought up. But this was kind of like, you know, it started off with this Senator Patty Murray. Here's a clip. Check it out. Again, cases, 3000 cases against violent. Well, that's not my question. We know that you asked if I was weaponizing the FBI and I am not. I'm giving you the hard concrete examples of the men and women putting handcuffs on bad people doing harm to our children and innocent Americans. But you have placed on leave FBI employees responsible for the investigation of January 6th. That sounds political to me. I have not placed anyone on leave who has not violated their ethical obligation or their oath to the Constitution. So if they were investigating January 6th, you believe they were violating an ethical obligation? Nope. I think the common theme here is you put words in my mouth and I'm not going to tell you more of the men and women of the FBI. Well, you did place on leave an analyst responsible for investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. Is that political station? Is that retribution? No, not if she broke the law or the ethical guidelines. I don't know which case you're talking about, but that's the standard. And we will hold ourselves inwardly accountable. And we will not be straight from our mission because people think we are politicizing the bureau. If you want to talk about someone who was attacked by a weaponized bureau, you're looking at him. Is the director of the FBI and he's cleaning it up? Well, I would just say to everyone who's listening that the FBI needs to be focused on its mission to keep the entire country safe, it should not be weaponized for partisan political gain. Thank you. We are. Sorry, Kennedy. You might have nine inches under there. Yeah, man, he's swinging. Yeah, well, look, man. You know, these motherfuckers, I mean, it is, it is a known fact that they literally made up the Russia influence with crossfire hurricane and fucking the steel, steel, CIA, Hillary Clinton fucking had to make it. It's a proof of fucking fact. And now she's sitting here acting like it was like it's still fact. Am I think who, who, who I've never even heard of this lady? That's what I don't know. Like who are these, like there's a lot of new faces and people getting these seats. I don't, shit, that's another thing we can talk about. I was like, hey, I run the fucking government. Now I believe in that, that I knew. I don't know much about politics. So you guys got to educate me. Yeah. Well, basically what she said, basically what, so cash for tell has been legit targeted at from the FBI under the Biden administration for the last four years, attacked, harassed, and he was a traitor, put on the domestic terror list, and now motherfuckers the head of the FBI. Oh, that's what he was referring to. Yeah, that's what he's referring to. Like, hey, bitch. Yeah, so, so you're accusing me of these people. And then, so like, dude, there's been all kinds of data that's come out like factual data that doesn't make it into the media that has shown that this, you know, Russia interfere in the election in 2016 was a total lie. Hillary Clinton paid her campaign team. This is all fact here campaign team to contact this dude, Christopher Steele, who made up the steel dossier, which was completely fabricated shit. Okay, and this is like open knowledge. This isn't like, yeah, let me, let me ask that again in my ignorance, getting up to speed to all this. So I always go and would like to know, because you have both sides say, well, this is a fact. And then the other side says, well, this is a fact. Yeah. How do you know your fact is more fact than there? Well, that's a good question. I mean, at this point in time, I mean, because now we're dealing with, now we're dealing with a complete propaganda machine, which has no truth. But there has been trace back, the money was traced back that they can't explain payments from this place to that place. She was also, yeah, accounting there. Hillary Clinton's campaign got fine. She got fine. Yeah, she was found. Yeah, she was found guilt. They find her $200. $200. $200, wasn't it? Yeah, she was. $200 fine. And so for eight years, they ran, regardless of what you think of Trump, because I know you're not a fan. But the, I like something about Trump. Well, well, you must have grown, because I know you used to fucking hate him. No, no, no, let's go there. All right, really, fuck. Yeah. So here's how I feel about Trump. It's okay if you hate him. I'm okay. Yeah, you're here. Here's both. Yeah. Is number one, that would be just on the video of Street Talk. I'm always the fan of. Yeah. Meaning, stop the fucking like passive aggressive or the leading questions. Like, I love when you see on any kind of media where someone just actually says how they feel. I think that's the healthiest thing ever. That is what I love about Trump. Yeah. Hate him. Love him. Grab him by the pussy. Yeah. At least he said it. He's like, this is who I am. Yeah. And what I, I think the lesson of learning is there, hey, you can say grab him by the pussy, but this is how I talk and still maybe fucking president. Yeah. So I actually, I have hope. I really though everyone. It's like you can be yourself. It's okay to be yourself. Yeah. So I actually love that about Trump. I love how regardless of what's happening with the government, I love how the fact something is happening. Yeah. It feels good. Someone's in office and people are mad at it. Like, it's actually happening. I love that there's an efficiency department because like I said about the DMV earlier, what the fuck? It takes months to get it right. This needs to happen. And anybody who's ran a business, manage the team, etc. Understands the fish. The government is so disgustingly. And you guys know this by every time you've ever interacted with them, ever taxes, etc. Their length of time to respond. It is so fucked up. No company, no company, not a single company would survive the way that the government's ran. I love that. Trump, but that into place is he probably getting some revenge on some people who popped off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the next election is I felt like with his skills, he could have put a stop to the divisiveness. I think that's a very fair. That is my number. That's fair. I think that's a very honest one with him. It wasn't even so much what he said. It's like, oh, like, especially in COVID, we were all there. I was like, you can go right now live and bring everyone together. Just jack off these people a little bit like just like there and bring. Bro, there wasn't. I think I broke. I you're 100% spot on. I agree with you a gazillion percent. The one thing I do not like about what he does is he gets super fucking and this is a problem with the people on the right and the center and right. Yeah. And it's hard to like judge them because the fucking whack jobs way on the left are so fucking insane that they're eat. It's funny to watch him get fucking pissed off. Yeah. Yeah. But, but like bro, you're the president. Okay. And here's the reality. I do not I first of all, I don't think I don't think whatever he says, no matter what, the media is not going to help him, no matter what, they fucking hate him. I agreed. And there's going to be people way over there with the rainbow fucking haircuts that all hate him no matter what. I also agree. But I do not hear enough or at all, we didn't hear this at all in the first time. Like, hey man, we're all here. This is our place. We should all be getting along, which is why I like to speech this year. Yeah. He's changing. And that's why I think he won. Obviously, he should have never lost. He shot himself in the foot by not just being nice. Dude, I think he could do it easily. I think he could do a massive because dude, all the country is is a big culture. Yeah. It's all it is. Okay. Just like we talk about business culture, it's just big. If he were to come out and say, hey guys, listen, I know there's some motherfuckers over here on the right that are insane. I know there's some people over there that are insane. But the 80% 90% of you, we all want the same thing, man. That is all I'm waiting for. And if he would come out and say, I am trying to do the best job I can to create the best opportunity and environment for the 90% to reach. Yes. The country would transform. And like if he came out and said that three or four times, almost instantly. It would be totally different. Like you guys, we can't be judging each other based on race. I hate the two party system. Dude, like I have a lot of money. They derive all their power from division, especially identity politics across every gay, straight, black, white, socioeconomically. How gay are you? Are you gay or are you fucking not gay? Are you super gay? Right. Like it's insane. I think the thing for me with politics where it goes is like, for me, I have a hard time trusting anybody who identifies as far right or far because now you're being assigned how to think. Dude, I'm a free thinker. Yes. I'm a freedom guy. So look, if somebody wants to suck dick, wear a dick, like eat a dick, have purple hair, whatever. But also you can't make somebody who doesn't want to do that. No, I'm not tapping that. Bro, there's boundaries everywhere. Like everybody can do you. Bro, and there's boundaries. You don't fucking force it on people's kids. For sure. You don't force people to go to your fucking parage or they're a bigot. People can have their own beliefs. And if they have shitty beliefs, it just makes them an asshole. Yes. It's just like, fuck dude, you're just a fucking asshole. Everyone assholes, you should just be assholes and it was understood. Well now it's if you're stuck. We're back there now. We're back there now. No one gets a fuck. We say whatever the fuck we want here and everybody gets it. And like, bro, everybody gets it. I think that 89% is the realest thing ever. I don't actually think there's that many people who disagree on how it should be. And if you talk to most people, what do they say? They go, you know, conserve, I'm a little more right when it comes to economics and money and I'm a little bit more laughed on the other bro. It's just the same fucking conversation. Like, I'm the same team. A hundred percent. A hundred percent. A hundred percent. I don't like is when people villainize each other and then also to it's like, it's what case clicks now. It's what gets clicks. Yes. And it's just like, also, you got to realize like, no matter what you think, there's not a hundred and fifty million people that are just idiots. Like, it's just like, it's just like, it's just like Kamala Harris call on the whole country. Yeah. It's just so elegant to think that you're so right in a hundred and fifty million other people are wrong. Like, it's just, I just don't like when someone loses their ability to see both sides because now I can't trust you. Well, dude, like, I just, that's the other piece to be really. I think it's important to, and then again, center, center right has this issue. It's like, you know, the left always had this issue, but it's like, I think it's important. Like, I like Trump. I don't like everything about Trump. Yeah. I have criticisms. I have personal qualms and issues with the Trump administration. I still vote for him. I think he's the best option, but I can, I can still articulate what I don't like about it. Okay. Most people can't do that. Let's break this down on a fucking micro level. How many friends do you have that you're like, this, I love this dude for this, but this other, I don't like that. All of them. Yes. So like, why can we do that at a micro level and still have great relationship and be like, I wish I do wouldn't drink so much. I wish that guy like, hey man, like, I'm so very a fucking body. That's right. Exactly. But I didn't like is how when Trump won this time, it was like the far left was like, oh my God. But just if you, if you voted for that, I don't know how you could be a good person. Well, that's why they lost. And it's like 100%. And it was just so, it's so ridiculous. It's so lacking self awareness, right? And then the right to, and I'm just like, guys, don't you realize like this is just all the dance like it's, it's all dude. I think, I think the responsible role of a leader is to bring people together to accomplish a mission. Yes. Amen. Okay. And we, I just, I think Trump could do a better job of that. And I think if he did, things will get better a lot faster. I think he's doing a lot of good things. Here's what I'll remind people is, especially entrepreneurs, right? Listen to this. And he was on the apprentice. And for decades for that, there was a time when Trump was the guy. No, people. He's in fucking half the rap songs ever made. He was like 2016. He was the guy on the apprentice. I loved him. You know what he was on the apprentice? Fair. Yeah. Really fair, right? And it was like crazy to see. And it's like, okay, look, you know, where there's some things behind the scene. I'm sure they're aware, but he also has these sites. So also, even you saw the same thing happen with Elon. It was like, I don't know. And you see, I'll give you a right-end left example. So everybody doesn't get their pennies at a bunch. But take Elon, the same thing that happened to him right now is since he went right, it's like he's getting all this hate. And obviously there's a lot of shit that's made up exaggerate, et cetera. I think the same thing happened to Bill Gates. Like Bill Gates is literally like on record a bunch of times too, saying, hey, I'm donating all my money. He's done a bunch of good. He's helped a bunch of good. He's done all these things. So is Elon. Bitch, I gave you PayPal. You send an advent moment of the fucking, I started all that game. Like, I put you on. I think there's a difference though. I mean, I really do think Bill Gates is the evil villain. I mean, look, watch, maybe he is, maybe he's not right. I don't know. Do you see a video him getting pie in the face? No, no. He got pie in public. That's when he was like, fuck, I'm killing every guy. That's when his evil villain's the shot. But my point is though, is like, I just think it's to me right outside looking at goes, I see the same patterns over and over again, right? And then I think the only thing that I would like to interject on the conversation for the world is that there needs to be more acceptance of what we don't know. Because as humans, we love to make sure that we have an answer. An opinion on it. An opinion. That's why we love religion. Because it's like, no, no, I know that when I die, I go there and it gives us peace, et cetera. I know that person's a villain. So now I can feel good about this. I know that that person scammed their way to success. So now I can feel good about my mediocrity. Like we make up these things. Ah, dude. Instead of real. Yeah, we make up these chooses that are just owning the simple fact of, I don't know. And it's okay to not know something. We don't know. And that's like, I think people would treat it differently because we act differently when we don't know somebody versus certainty. I hate certainty. I'm sure. Especially when you're in business, every time you meet another badass motherfucker, aren't you always amazed at how many questions they're always asking? It's never about what we know. It's, oh, you know this. Oh, well, what are you doing for that? Yeah. It's never a breakfast. It's always a humility learning. But then you take someone like you said, a mediocre thinker, and that person's going to say, oh, you guys are fool themselves. Oh, my God. I think they know everything. Motherfucker, you don't even understand that the way that people like that got theirs because they have a very good understanding that they don't know everything. And they are willing to learn. They can't get there. You can't get there. Humility is a requirement of success. I don't understand. And these people say, oh, because you drive a fucking Rolls Royce, you're not humble. No, I drive a Rolls Royce because I'm very humble and I'm able to take information. And it's fucking sick. Well, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm the lamb seat. But the pro, let's see. There's nothing better. There's nothing better. Yes. There's nothing. There's nothing better. No. Nothing. And I'm not apologizing for it. No. And I'm not going to apologize that I can drive a different car every fucking day of the month because you know what? I did shit that you're not willing to do for a long fucking time. And it has nothing to do with being humble or not. It has to do with actually I'm very humble because I'm willing to take in information, process it, and adapt and realize, oh, I don't know everything. Billy knows some shit. More than me. I'm going to do what he told me. Yeah. Listen, no, no. And so I think that's a, it's fucking, but dude, I agree with that. A gazillion percent. The, the, the conversation of unity needs to happen more. And we have to identify that we are intentionally being divided for the benefit of people that do not have our interest as regular humans. And we'll call them us peasants. Yeah. Okay. And you know, people say, well, you're rich. You're not a, no, I'm a fucking peasant. I'm not in the club. You're a peasant. We're, that's why we got the Pazante water here. Because we're peasants, bro. Got him at Tarje. That's right. And so like, dude, we, you know, we're fucking, I got mine over here too, brother. Like, we, we, we are the peasants. Okay. I do have a question for you. Yeah. Both of you. So, my point is we have to fucking get past the idea that we actually don't like each other. Yeah. It's true. It's not true. It's not true, man. Not true at all. I'm just a question about Trump, which I thought was dangerous, which is why I didn't like it. So, again, I'm his biggest fan. However, reporter asked a stupid question, being like, that was a dumb question. I love when NBA players do it too. Like they're like, how did you feel when you lost? You're fucking son. You're fucking thinking. I think it's appropriate to say how the fuck do you think I felt? Yeah. I think that's an appropriate response. Bro, you know, who's the best at that fucking Dana White? Yeah. He's the best. I do love him for that too. Yeah. You know what? He's a good example to me of what Trump should have done more. And so Trump will do that, but then he'll take it far. So like, for example, he'll be like, Rosalio Donnell's fat and an idiot. Now, mind you. That's true. It's true. It's true. If it's the truth or mind you, if it's comedic timing, you're the president, you can't do that. You can say she's acting like an idiot, whatever like this. But when you're saying that because now you're green lighting, everybody was looking up to you that doesn't, that isn't smart to go up to someone and be like, you're a fucking fatty that piece of shit. And if our kids did that to somebody, especially because they're winners or people that we look to, we'd be like, you don't talk to people. I think, I think there's, I think there is a level of conduct that a leader at any level should try to abide by. If they want to be respected and actually bring people together, I do not behave the way I behaved 10 years ago or 20 years ago. I realize that there's weight to my words and I realize there's weight to my actions. And while I still am a dumb immature motherfucker, I try to keep that where it belongs. You know what I'm saying? And like at your house after this. Yes, that's right. Like you and I, we're going to say about the shit. But when I'm like out in front of everybody, I'm going to try to remember like, hey, man, I'm here to, to set an example. And I want to make sure that we, we accomplish what we're here to do. And it's not, you know, I keep it real, but I also understand there's things that you should say and not say. And you know, I, he has to work on that. Yeah, he does. That's it. I want to, I want to, and I think he, and watch this, I think he did, which is why he won. Yeah. And what is the way I think he is working on it. I think it's the active thing, but I also like to, to, to just bring this into, into the perception here that when you have a billion dollar industry, okay, that is non-stop attacking you, trillion trillion dollar industry. Okay. Because here's the truth. Like nobody, nobody batted an eye when Kathy Girfen is holding up a fucking head of them. I mean, they did badly batted an eye. I remember that shit. She got canceled. Yeah. She got actually canceled. And like, my point being is like, you know, like that's cool. We could do that or we can, you know, make the rap songs, you know, saying like, you know, keep, fuck down with Trump. Like that's cool, right? Like, we can make sense. So it's like, you know, I think Trump's issue that, what revs people the wrong way, but it's an ego thing, but it's like, when nobody else is willing to, like, to your home, bro, you have to your own. That's a bad thing. I actually agree with that. That's a bad thing. I didn't know it. Yeah. But yeah, he'll be the first one to tell you like, hey, when I brought back TikTok, you're ready to talk about it. Yeah. But bro, that's kind of funny. That's real shit. Like if people do not acknowledge the shit that you do, you have to tell them. Yeah. And okay, I'll give you an example for me. Okay. I give a lot of money away. Period. A lot. Okay. If I don't tell people that I gave a lot of money away, I'm a greedy fuck because of the way. I agree. You're this way. But if you do, then I'm a douchebag. Okay. So, how do you win? Yeah. Right? And at the end of the day, by the way, I have a Boys and Girls Club in the Southeast San Diego called Boys and Girls Club Genius. Yeah. And you've had it for a while. Yeah. And then of course, I get the DMs of like, man, this is just the marketing move. Right? This is not even good. But then, first of all, I'm like, you know, the way I quoted is this is give allow to inspire the crowd. That's right. I said, you rather me do this silently. Where only I give money or do it loud and inspire all the homies in my network to give more money. Set the fuck up. I agree with you. What are you talking about? That's what produces. Yeah. That's what produces the Rosio Dolombo's fat. You know what I'm saying? That's what produces the hero. I have another political belief that's a little people don't really fuck with, but I'm going to bring it up and carry it. Guys, the thoughts. I do believe that you should have to take a test to vote on a lot of issues. No, mother fugga. I say every show. No, here it is. Yeah. Yeah. It is, bro. It's a real thing. It's not even take a test. If you do not pay taxes that year and you are behind on your taxes, you do not get a vote. That's fair. If you pay into the system, you can decide how the system operates. It's a vote. do not you can't in any clubhouse this would be acceptable right like you think about this so it doesn't matter if you're 14 years old if you got a job and you're paying taxes you can vote if if but dude people that are collecting and not contributing should not have a say I agree because they've created this state now where there's so many people dependent and they have such a voice that all they're going to do is vote in their own interest which by the way that's not fair to people like you know who who sacrifice and invest a lot in our outcomes so I give the example that's real shit we we should have to there should be some limitations 100% it's like you know if you actually employees hey should you have 365 days off a year in some companies they'll be like yeah not considering well how the fuck are we going to make money like like okay yeah let's let's go do it and then yeah not you know so I don't know I would also think a lot of people who who have been who've been championing this shit like oh four day work week two day work week this that the other they just fucked themselves because now the shit's going to happen and they're not going to have jobs like there's no leverage here's the thing and this is the bad part okay I don't like far left in place we they they they don't work it doesn't matter that's the thing they yell and scream and talk about how they're going to fucking cancel you but they can't because they don't have any money to buy anything that's the facts bro that's what I've learned on the show I've learned that on the show I can piss them off and say whatever the fuck I want and they can't do anything because they don't spend money and certainly don't spend money on health and fitness they don't give a fuck okay so yeah there's some there's some there's some buff far lefties yeah is there yeah the whole gay community the look is their jacks yeah but I don't think the I think most of the gay community are not far left anymore because they that's actually yeah I think the shit about yeah that's the thing because the left is got like that's the that's not what I'm talking about these I'm talking about the I'm not taught like bro there's a different sweet Democrats and leftists I'm talking about the leftist yeah Democrats I like the general Democrats are reasonable people yeah they are people who have the and they do run businesses and they are like yes they do shit but they also will listen and they will they will say okay that makes sense yeah you know I'm talking about the crazy motherfucker shit I did a drill in my company to give you a so we do a morning huddle up and every morning huddle up I've gone zoom everybody goes around or in person whatever fuck ran the office and I said after the election when it happened because of a lot of people who are left in my office and I'm people right too and I said hey we're gonna do one drill today everyone's gonna say what the positive is about Trump getting elected I don't give a fuck how you feel because the second you lose your ability to be able to see the other side you are the fucking problem that's right don't you don't you don't you get it twisted you are same it wouldn't the same the other way you know you know what I mean like you for sure have to be able to see so what would we say Biden what would you say possibly oh I know what I would say what you say first though I like ice cream I mean I like that he likes ice cream no see that's what they tried to do on my head I said stop doing that shit no that's a had it I had to crack that yeah my I would say well he's so old he might die that's a good day it's a hard drill yeah it's a hard drill like it's good I mean that's the thing like the window has shifted because like when you tie your identity to this I just did it did not do it notice he did not do it he continued on it he did not do it I'll be honest like I'll be real with you bro I think like I have a different perspective on that I think the amount of destruction that that man has done to this country I mean you talk about it's treasonous bro you talk about like not uniting like Trump needs to do better on uniting I'm with that 100% Biden has intentionally divided yes not only that bro and potentially weak in the country yeah intentionally and it's and it's traceable through the funds that he's received over the number of years that's why they pardoned everybody at the end like they were taking money I don't know how much you know about this but they were taking foreign influence money and pay for pay for play meaning things like this before I say this allegedly okay okay but you know 100 Biden selling fucking paintings for $50,000 that he fucking squirted some paint what is that coming for oh okay I did hear a lot about the 100 Biden thing I never know it's coming from you know foreign buyers and what are they getting in return you know and then you have bro but Hunter Biden was on a board for barrisco's for barisa which is a Ukrainian gas company oil and gas company okay this was in 2014 who was in office in 2014 Barat and Joe Biden Hunter Biden magically got on this fucking billion dollar company board with zero experience zero back in simply because he was the son of the vice president of the United States Biden goes over make some fire fucking prosecutor who was looking into that company right you can fire is that prosecute he gives him a billion dollars and then really how much a billion dollars in the United States aid to that country here's like now fast forward right fast forward what what what war has the United States been supporting my proxy for the last okay let me let me ask you guys this because let's say what you're saying is true yeah right it is true no yeah okay so let's say let's say happen where do you guys go what what amount of thought do you put to everything that we don't seem we'll never see because we're not in that right like in the meetings right there's probably all kinds of stuff for public safety that's never shared right how's that right I would imagine well no I'm saying is yet morally right let me ask you yes you think let me do run our companies I'm a transparent leader and so are you but there's still some shit that's like a me and me I see if oh that's that might be true but also we're paying the employees are not paying us it's a big difference that's that's too safe all right that's fair but also so if the employees were paying us to operate the company would they not deserve the right to know what the fuck was going on honestly we just established how many stupid people there are if I'm president I've definitely a lot of y'all about some shit like 100% like some situations you think that's not why they're lying they're lying now for their own benefit and that's the problem okay it's not lying for to protect you and me like that's the excuse they use so like the Patriot Act like let's take the do you know the Patriot Act please me teach okay so when 9-11 happened that they came out with the Patriot Act which allowed us to spy on foreign enemies and all of us were like fuck yeah let's fucking get them because back then dude none of us really understood that there was an agenda at play that was not in our interest we all believed America loves us our government loves us they protect us they gave us an enemy we went after the end that's right so so naturally you know we're all on the same team yeah this guy's throw a rock and it hits you in the fucking face and we're like fucking kill him right yeah but what if that motherfucker threw the rock was paid by him to start the shit because he had interest that we're gonna make him money happens a lot that's so so so now we're dealing with the situation where we've all figured out that these people are not operating with our interests in mind so it's in it's very apparent and trackable so the Patriot Act basically started this the Patriot Act was this act that said we can spy on people that are over in the Middle East basically enemies of America but then they created domestic terrorism so now now if you speak out or say something and they can spy on you so they and this is what Snowden did Snowden came out and we're Snowden came out and told this and then they labeled him as a traitor when all he said you're so right we're gonna do it to you yes 100% I always say listen the government is recording everything that you say every picture every every phone call every text message to like I don't think any of that's new right like that's not new well that's new from that's from the Patriot right it's new of like 2002 2000 do we think so you don't think the government was looking at our ship before you didn't have the technology you know yeah it was it didn't really exist I mean wiretapping was a thing sure yeah I mean even that like require court process the differences with the with the Patriot it doesn't require any of that like to me it sounds like again just just hearing like it feels like you know now we have the NIL deals with college but it's like they've been getting paid you know what I mean like they've been getting paid college players being getting paid to go somewhere and so but I get what you guys are saying as far as you know weaponizing this to their benefit it's some well here's the the but we could sum it up by saying this we pay them to look out for us and when they stop looking out for us you start sending the money overseas to get a funnel back to their own fucking pockets which is how they go in making 175K a year and walk out worth a hundred million dollars I agree okay that's a fucking problem and then when they I do like how well they escalate that bro so now what they do is now for example the the like okay you saw what happened that gangster where they left all the equipment over here all right why do they do that well they all own stock and fucking Rayhion and and Lockheed and all these things and then by getting involved in Ukraine we don't have the equipment so now they got to make more and their stock goes up so it's all a big fucking fuck job for all of us while they tax you you're in fucking California bro you're getting raped okay that's what I have the you're here you're you're you're paying you you are paying over 50% of your income to the government I I cry now if you pay over 50% of the of the year you're in coming to the government what does that make you a hoe no once it make you bro what it makes you a fucking slave you work more for the government than you do for you I get it that's not okay and that's not free I definitely agree we're all the same right we're we are slave class bro we are fucking slave class we are just told we were free and we are not free and once you see it you can't unsee it so I I believe and again I'm I'm hearing this right this is new but I believe what you guys saying it makes sense and like okay I just say to you two do you have the same energy on the other side because to me I think I think I think I can yell that by both yeah I think it's a political thing I like right now with it's happening on one it's happening right now I'm getting yelled at there is no right and like that that is that's the government okay yeah and the reap the right there's not only democrats doing it bro like no they're all in the same fault so we listen there's three there's three categories of officials right now there is democrats there is republicans and these what we would call established democrats establish republicans and then there is non-affiliated members of each party very few there's a few democrats that are not establishment democrats meaning they are in office to actually make change on the republicans side there's a few more all right the reason they hate Trump so much and the reason bullsites fucking hate him is because he is the least like that out of all the politicians he's independently wealthy I like Trump for that yes so he is a third he represents a third unaffiliated class of political figure that isn't on the the take the way these other two are okay and now what's happened is we've had these fucking establishment guys on the right and establishment people on the right left try to weasel their way into this fucking our game up we've had this thing run for hundreds of years he's coming he's fucking our game up but now they try now they've in they've infiltrated his shit so now like these people were fucking scavengers dude and basically what we have is a totally corrupt system that needs to be the real the real fucking talk is it needs to be fucking wiped clean and started over I agree I couldn't but I do think that a lot of this happens less from well I don't want to say less than agenda but I do think it's just humans doing what they've done throughout history which is put themselves first that's right so like you know when Biden is doing this thing well what's the fucking saying he's doing the same uncorrupted or uncheck absolute power corrupts absolutely yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think that's yeah yeah and Billy it's happened it's happened for so long that it's just so infested with shit that like I don't think it can be fucking fixed I think it has to be burnt the fuck down and like and yeah I think it's just the way it is yeah you know I'm saying like kids born into technology world now like they don't know what the fuck you know a letter is there I have to write like no it's Instagram DMs right like that's just how it is you know I think the political landscape left or right again like I don't look at it as a difference there it's changed over the course of this country's history right like it used to be you know we were farmers bro and like you know there was a problem going on and we saw something that was gonna affect our farms and our local communities I'm gonna go in office I'm gonna serve for this you know quick term I'm gonna vote on the shit that I said I was gonna vote on fix the shit I said I was gonna fix I'm going back to my fucking farm these people are in office for 40 fucking years bro and I don't think that's healthy yeah accomplish what and then they come out they they they overtax us they spend 40 years in fucking office come out worth hundreds of millions of dollars yeah I mean that's good fix what and fix what all they do is cause more to they they they it's it's and create no you said it earlier it's a fucking it's a dance it's a fake it's fake we're gonna think they have no intention of fixing all bro and then they come out on camera act like they argue with each other and then go play golf and have dinner together yeah you know I'm saying like it's what you think about that picture then with viral with Obama and Trump like laughing together yeah yeah trust me dude I I I get yelled at now because now I'm like now I'm criticizing Trump and people are mad because I'm not just like mindlessly like like it's okay to criticize your friends and people it's okay it's okay it's supposed to yeah it's all right bro you have to look at should objectively man it's like is it is there working or is it not yeah what do you I think you you mentioned purpose earlier I do think people find purpose in being on a team right that's why you kind of joining up in air coach yeah right and so it makes them happy that you know it's part of the identity yeah that's right guys arms around fuck the lib tarts oh you know fuck those far right fascists like you know it gives them you can't fix anything like that they can fix it but it makes them feel better yeah I really would chase feelings instead of results well it's the same thing it's it's it's it's group think it's it's no different it's it's a it's an it's a very unhealthy way of being a fan that's what it is the other thing that's a good way to put it yeah it's like like like like I'm a Cardinals fan I fucking all like the Cubs fans right I'm a steady guy yeah I'm a right right yeah that's true it's the same shit and we're all we're all conditioned to doing that in different areas of our life but when it comes to politics it's very unhealthy because we can't solve anything and the other thing is too I say this like I don't believe that like all politicians go into office with that nefarious like no they get stuck in they they they get in they see how the game is played and then there's left no options like or they get blackmailed to go on yeah people really know what like how politics these fucking committee seats work bro like you know imagine like we talked about business in the beginning it's just say you lie in relationships and like fuck everybody's playing the game you have no choice right like I give people really knew how the like for example let's look at the city can the Senate committee real quick right let's say you're a new senator you just got to elect it you raised two three million dollars from your constituents they voted in you won your election you're in now right yeah and you want to go sit on the the Senate appropriations committee right well those seats each one of those seats they cost they cost you like you have to pay to be on that panel so your pack pace right and so okay well depending on the committee those seats can go anywhere from five hundred grand to a million bucks well fuck you just raised two million and you spent it on your campaign you don't have money here's this lobby that comes in oh okay Billy you want to get on that seat we'll pay for your seat there no problem just make sure when this vote comes up your vote for this yeah classic right until like there's a like I like dude there's a bunch of problems in government that needs to be addressed term limits lobby guys this is this is literally why though like just with anything is I'm so big on just investing in my personal brand for the last decade and like well of course I did I need you know if I want to be free on money you want to have your own voice you want to have your own direct line with people like it's dude it's what I say it's what we say here all the time dude personal axel and saltiment rebellion if you if you if you create your individual self into an uncontrollable human you're going to win and you'll be free the free as you can be right you know right if you they want your fat you got to be fit they want your broke you got to make money they want you to hate the the thing that you aren't you got to get along with those people yeah right they you got to do everything opposite of what they tell you because everything they tell you it's for that's what you said that's good because we all need to be better at that yeah that's good dude it's real shit and that's why they don't come out and say the shit that we're like why aren't they saying this yeah why don't they come out and say hey black people and white people you're all bunch of fucking idiots get along like what a what that's not hard like that's it's really isn't the thing is though like but again going back to reality bro like I remember even in the high like you have George Floyd shit like even the high-decker bro me and Andy were going across the country doing these talks speaking to people meeting people real world bro the shit didn't exist like that like I didn't walk we didn't walk down the street like it was like in the real world well it's all getting out exists why would say it doesn't exist I would say that's that's a little too but I get what you're saying I get your point out like you watch CNN you watch fucking Fox you think it's fucking now that doesn't exist what's seen in and Fox do is a small window that they blow up you think it would be that is bullshit that is everywhere well I think there's racism on both sides yeah yeah there's fucking sure I mean there's no doubt bro it's openly acceptable to hate white people openly I will I will agree with you on that and that's you know like that's why I get pissed off on the race the race conversation because it's like bro you're gonna call me a racist for breathing the fucking air because I exist when it's okay to legitimately fucking hate white people out in the open yeah yeah I will agree on that it's all it's wrong no matter what yeah you know and I'm just I'm tired of that shit like broke fuck off like I got stabbed in the face for that fucking cause like I'm not gonna hear it you know yeah I would say yeah I'm with you a thousand percent is and there's fucking weird time where yeah you know like I I I fuck with the jokes of like you know like it's hard out here's a white man right now with you know how much this but also too I do think there is this weird conversation right now on the white side that racism like it doesn't exist that that one pisses me off and so I think what they're saying bro I think I can tell you what I think that means like people have an tendency to speak in absolutes right what what when when people say that I don't believe like because I've said that before doesn't exist but what I'm not saying it doesn't exist I'm saying it doesn't exist the way that we're saying it exists yeah yeah right like I don't fucking get invited to the clan fucking barbecues you know yeah yeah like where I'm in a white guy the whole I've been a white guy my whole life bro and I'm a very outspoken I've never fucking met one of these motherfuckers like I've never seen a dude walking around a pointy fucking hat like yeah I've never think the easiest way of where it's at now how I try and explain to people is I don't think it's the old school clan shit for the most part right you have idiots out there very rare I think it's mostly just we have our biases so for example take race out of it for a second you know me and you vibe we both play sports we run businesses we believe in hard work we share a lot of common out values since of humor laugh the same stupid shit if somebody comes along and they're different than us we're probably gonna have a slight favoritism towards us and I think that is what but that modern day racism is actually we have bias but that's what we're comfortable yeah but brother that's not actually racism that's just biases towards a yeah now where it becomes where it becomes racism or could feel like that to people as if me and you look the same and there was a hundred more people that look the same like that and now we still shared that it's going to feel like racist we mean you know what I mean so what I'm saying is essentially so going back to we share those those common values if where a hundred white guys all sharing those common values and then everybody else who's not like us is all black you're not gonna be like I don't like you because you're not black but it doesn't change the fact that still a hundred white people saying it against a hundred black people does that make sense yeah I mean you know what I mean like yeah it's tribalism I mean it's yeah exactly like that's brother that's that's that's not that that exists amongst every culture and a hundred and that's what I think the racism is so here's that's okay so I don't disagree with that but where I get fucking pissed off is because for 20 motherfuck for my whole life okay I've been told and it's progressively gotten worse yeah that now it's the point where and it's getting better now now people are like dude this is fucking stupid so but there was a point a few years ago where if you were fucking white you were racist by default you just don't know inherently yeah yeah and it's like a probe shut the fuck up I'm not even in this shit yeah I'm you know and and like dude you know this thing of like I'm responsible for what happened 400 fucking years ago motherfucker my family wasn't even here and by the way I'm Sicilian which means our people were conquered by black people and raped my my blood is part fucking African because of it so like when we really break this down it's just a stupid fucking argument and the reality of it is is that we can't control what happened we could control what happens now and what shit with that yeah because I because I I'm with you on the same page so what is your guys' feelings on the conversation around privilege I don't think I don't think I think there's American privilege bro and I think we're all we're all agree I I have a hard time like buying into that that there's like there's this privilege like Andy's not where he's at because he's privileged and he's where he's at because for the last 26 years he's worked his ass off if I do the exact same thing that dude did for the next 26 years there's a good chance of him to be exactly where he's at or successful or even very least right like like I mean there's there's so you DJ this is interesting so you don't think privilege exists I don't know absolutely I think there's I think we have American privilege I think we're okay so what's American privilege I think we're the most privileged people because shit's too good we don't like we we we make up probably we try to leave I mean so if you believe in American privilege then you kind of by default believe in white privilege because if you realize hold on there's different there's different yeah I was like yeah like that's a little because there's also there's black privilege yeah you know why I agree yeah so let me let me go so like you know if there's American privilege then when people talk about white privilege you have to understand that's real because you're saying in America we have it too good we all agree with that right we've seen some other countries and how we're living like clean water we get that also too if you were white and you were allowed your grandparents were allowed to own land and own property and pass it down that's fucking privilege yeah but but like I mean it's not a bad thing which I want to get to a second but it exists like my wife's my wife I have a black wife yeah okay you ain't got to feel sorry for me never her her family her family has like 500 fucking acres down in Arkansas that like was been past you're not gonna talk about a unicorn talk about the mass right like that's most there's a lot of black owners that own property down south like you know I'm saying so like I know hold on hold on like yeah just the fact of that because we like facts and real it's like the person you're talking about like a good what like black people are not allowed to own property for so long like this is just hold on hold on hold on hold on there's number where we weren't even a lily like really guys that's not untrue but there's also been a lot more white people here than black people the entire time it's existed yeah yeah but like also but so okay let's just start like clad just so we're all on the same page because we we're all pretty much agreeing except for this topic I'm acknowledging let me let me rephrase it take my daughter we can all agree my baby is privilege is a motherfucker she got rola dex she'll grow up and have property she'll have down payment she'll have why is all of that because of her dad's hard work right because except why didn't white privilege and so and so what I didn't see now you're putting words in my mouth care like I just I didn't say white privilege stop me I didn't say anything else besides the fact we're going to acknowledge that it exists if you could because I think privilege exists but I don't think it's exclusively to white people correct correct but just white privilege just happens to have a lot more advantages than some of the other ones that's all but I agree with you there's privilege in all different types but for example is if we weren't a lot of our grandparents or you know great whatever yeah were allowed to own land own property go to good schools had other grandparents who were attorneys doctors etc would they not have a massive advantage no because is okay that just that would like what are you talking about literally that's just like man what do you mean let me say hold on hold on hold on let me just restolize so my daughter is has all the things that we just talked about we dollar she has privilege so how can you not acknowledge that there's white privilege I don't let me let me say this book because the thing is the thing is after get black you can give somebody you can give somebody all the shit in the world they should have to do it I guarantee yes I agree so so even though like I have two daughters right yeah I'm setting them up for fucking success I agree there's not a guarantee they're gonna make it I agree right there is still a lot of white people who have those same advantages there's still white I agree there's still there's more white people who just doesn't change the fact that it exists I agree with you still have to do more it doesn't take away that's what I'm saying it's still gonna have to work her ass I guess we get it most people white or black that are successful came from shit like hard work is hard work you can't outbeat that my question is everything you just said my question is I have to acknowledge that there is white privilege there's black privilege two bro what's black privilege what does it change black privilege is what does it change acknowledge you know why the privilege exists what does it change empathy so what let me explain to you let me explain to you if a kid was here I'm just gonna I hate to random country uh-huh and they're here and they grew up without running water without electricity without education etc all three of us and they came here in this room today and they're around us all three of us would be a little bit more empathetic we would be more open we would see how we could help we would pour into them if somebody just down the street came through and was like yo guys Billie Jean Andy for sale I mean it's we're a little less empathetic like it's just it's built in us it's empathy empathy is the difference and that's why acknowledging things is important what is it what about the same time it's not a hall pass now don't no one get this much as confused that this is a fucking green light to be a victim well it's been presented that way I okay and it's been I agree with you it's been hung out in front of my fucking face I agree with you life like mother fuckers discounting the price I've paid to get where I'm at do you know when people tell me that I'm where I'm at because I'm fucking got some sort of privilege I want to fucking choke them for sure because I can promise you every single one of those mother fuckers that said that could not walk a fucking day in my shoes none of them I agree okay so I but do you agree that because I also on top of that I have been having to deal with that my entire life yeah being told that I have it easier when mother fucker I've almost blown my brains out a thousand fucking times to get where I'm at on top of that I can't point simple things out otherwise I'm racist such as that six percent of the fucking men in this country create 50 plus percent of the violent crime that is a fucking statistical fact that does not make you a racist for pointing it out okay because if we do not acknowledge that how can we solve the problem the actual racism exists in ignoring that and pretending that it doesn't exist because the reality is is if you actually gave a fuck about black people in this country you would be able to say this is a problem we need to fix this problem we wouldn't say oh that's not actually true you're racist okay so I actually have the needs to be there needs to be true yes and also too you like I mean since we met like you grew up like I let me just say I think it's wrong for people to do that to you well no try it well no I mean I mean there's more there's more to this there's more to this too yeah okay we can open in this country it is acceptable and it has been acceptable yeah my entire life to fucking hate white people in the open there has always existed black entertainment television there has always existed the black Grammys there has always existed all these things that segregate society but we didn't get invited to those which is why they were there maybe I don't know it didn't happen in my fucking lifetime I'm not concerned with what happened before I was here well that's why people are mad all I can control all like control is how I behave and how I behave I have I have I have Syed who is Indian I have Madat who is Bosnian I have DJ who is black I've got Billy who is black to me you mother fuckers are just my friends yeah and I don't give a fuck how black you are Indian you in fact I'm gonna make funny about it because you're gonna make fun of me about it okay that's what friends do so it like there is multiple sides to this equation and at the end of the day I don't think that you're making an an accurate point but what I do think is that it's been hung out in front of society yeah and I think it's enabled and created a culture amongst certain groups of people both white and black and Asian a victim class and we're we're telling them that the reason that you can't succeed is because of something that happened 200 years ago yes and you and you are examples of that not being true that is not fucking true okay you drive a fucking rose voice just like I fucking drive one okay but you have more cars than me okay well that's because that's because of privilege so but my point is my point is is that we can argue these things yeah but at the end of the fucking day bro we as grown men have an obligation to put it end to the division and the device of shit so I agree with you and what you just I don't think I don't think I don't think that you're wrong and what you're saying but we can't generalize all white people in that because like for example my family came to the United States in the 20s and they were extremely poor they were brick layers okay and they my dad grew up in a family of fucking 12 mother fuckers and when they start when they were kids they were fucking starving yep they collected fucking rainwater to fucking drink it okay our generation and my family went from very poor to not ask poor to a little bit better to where now I've been presented with an opportunity and while I wasn't given any money I was blessed with a father that cared about me that taught me a lot of valuable lessons and so that's could be considered privilege which is why I give so much back that's why I teach what I know because I know that not everybody out there had a dad like I had or a mom like I had that was willing to teach me things so there's going to be privileges in different areas no matter who you are and I just don't feel like I think I feel like we were at a point in time in culture where we really need to understand that no matter what's happened there is good people and there's bad people and no matter what's happened all we can control is what we do now and do the best that we fucking can and and and that's that's how I've always felt like dude when I think of like American heroes bro and I know a lot of people say that Martin Luther King was a communist on the show I don't give a fuck his message was fucking right content of character on about it okay and discrimination or special standards we live in a meritocracy and until that changes it is what it is everybody should be treated respect everybody should be having and here's what I will say yeah there is a problem with the black communities but the but the problem is not white people doing it the here's the problem the problem is the fucking democrats that they voted for for 60 fucking years come in every fucking four years and say Billy we're gonna fix your people we're gonna fix your neighborhood we're gonna get you money for fucking schools and infrastructure and this and that and this and then they don't do any of it they go and they take the money and these are not just white people this isn't people on the right this is the people they're voting for and this is black people doing it to their own fucking people so they vote for black people the black people go to Washington they figure out how to steal the money and fuck up with their own people so how is that my fucking fault right how how is it my fault so how is it my fault that I can fucking say hey here's the I'm a business guy you're a data guy right like we look at data all here we do okay here here's what I got to solve we have six percent of the population committing 52 percent of the crime and most of that crime is done amongst their own people in their own neighborhood how do we fix that yeah but we also look at history in the why the first the first way that we fix that if we actually care about those people which we should because they're all Americans and that's the principal of America now it's one America's been founded on but right like on slavery well it's founded on a set of principles and for certain people well like you know I mean they that's the and so because we're on the same page because I want to just first I can't control what they did I control what we do and you do a good job of that but what I'm saying is is we have to acknowledge what the problems are and allow them to be addressed and solved and not called racist because we acknowledge them I agree with you know what I'm saying like that's that's my piece on the two bro it's like you know my upbringing bro right like where I grew up the worst area you could possibly grow up okay the I'm talking about the worst area in St. Louis I saw my first dead body at nine years old taking out the trash bro okay bad my dad was out of my life you see boys in the hood yeah you know doleboy it was based on him good good at moving up right guys bro that's one that's ever single parent household right my mom's white okay you don't if white print by my my thing is on this like the white privilege part bro if it did exist if it does exist like we say it does where the fuck was I would have loved to have what you missed out on white privilege I will hold on bro let me ask you it so if we're gonna say if we're gonna say that then couldn't I say because I'm Sicilian and American Indian couldn't I say fuck my people were fucking treated terrible my people were conquered by the moors so listen I mean so where's the stat I saw this is now tell me yeah I encourage you I don't know there's now we go let's go to the Irish people Irish people were literally hell this slavery those those those things were we're bad too right they're all bad yeah yeah that's what point for sure they're all bad but we're talking about America specifically right yeah so let's just a couple of things number one you're correct I agree that is bullshit that people discredit not just you but any race and their hard work and dedication and almost like villainizing people for how they were born you know because that's fucking ridiculous and I think that you do have a right to be mad about that like that well after a second 40 years I mean yeah well especially and then you probably have even more because you're like what are you talking about like I've had black friends my whole life like I played sport like I don't like you like for you like it's like like this is fucking stupid what are you doing that so that is valid is fuck to be angry yeah like you are like hey well I'm not really angry yeah like that stupid it's like man like 100% like what else can I do you're like you're like I get money like that like literally what else could I do right you're like I have free podcasts I help everybody like I do it I can like the world is better because of your impact you can't deny that the facts but it is it is like that's real talk I'm not you too I know that yeah and you're saying like yo there's this whole story about white privilege but I had to live in the shittiest fucking place ever not a lot my mom's white like ironically there's this big thing where the fuck was it from me like also raised me his white yeah where like we're we're not even had it also well who are we talking about here yeah like are we talking about like hold on are we talking about like Anderson Cooper who grew up as a Vanderbilt and the Vanderbilt mansion and his property was passed down he's worth fucking hundreds of millions of dollars that's why privilege that's a hundred percent like yeah that's such a small person I think it's I think it's just a it's a big deal but I think it's a because that's that's that's that's that fits in the framework of the example that you're providing yes which is 200 years ago their family passed down and he's had privilege because of it and clearly he's had it because he's fucking I think what's like the if is did you have it did you have it did you have it but the absolute was we didn't have it but most people have but no like no no no like but we weren't even allowed to have it it's just like I'm not all the my only point at first of all even if you don't what I'm saying I believe to be true it doesn't change the fact that anybody has an excuse to not fucking be successful in present day right now I'm also going to acknowledge that it is harder for some people but guess what still not to fucking excuse it's your deck of cards play a fucking accordingly and it is what that's reality that's reality and I think that's what we talk about you and I talked about that for decade we thought here's a reality for some motherfuckers it's gonna be fucking harder yeah that's that's it so all on the same page there and you're right no yeah that's it that's a fair that's a thing lost it's what you said is a fair point okay and I would like to acknowledge that because you didn't have it that's fair yeah okay some white people had it but most white people also didn't have yeah all right so that's my thing it's like we're talking about but also it's but I don't know that let me just like one other point too is like the the biggest advantage that someone can have generationally as we know here is here it's not the possessions etc and honestly knowledge takes generations to pass sometimes so when our generation starts here and we weren't allowed to read then we weren't allowed to get property and now we're not and now you have this group of people who at times it feels like you're saying hey why don't you guys just get your shit together and it's like we're trying to catch up motherfucker because because it takes it takes a generation to pass down so all if you look at the stats probably it is getting better it's getting better for everybody but while that gap and that's why you have movements like affirmative action etc it's to help accelerate from the decelerated let me ask you this right like okay that's how these things came about I'm not saying it should or not but that's how it came about right let me let me let me say this real quick because I think this is important right yeah I look at it like this I have to see I look at it like this how many fucking white people who were qualified for jobs were fired or not given jobs to an unqualified person of color is that not racism watch this now they may have one is that not racism I think maybe yeah I think one can also especially one let's just say they're both qualified and that still would be racist if you're doing it however it was a it was an effort to try and accelerate right now like good or bad it's like there's pros and cons all of this right and and so I think it's a hard issue period because look if I'm born a day and I'm white I'm saying suck my dick I'm not giving you money for what happened a long time ago because I don't give a fuck I got bills to pay in life as hard that's that's that's I understand that also too and the same breath you can't be mad or let me let me rephrase like this if that is the attitude or energy that's going to be put out about it how can you also expect people to be empathetic to your cause well it like and whatever that may be well generally speaking right okay so there's the opposite of that too so if you're told that you're racist because of the color of your skin and if you're told that you don't get opportunities because other people who may be equally qualified or less qualified get them instead how does that solve the racial problem because we know what that does that makes fucking the people who are getting fucked hate the other people yeah for sure I mean you can you can you can understand everybody is like anger in the situation but I mean you can't go back to winners you can't solve racism with more racism yeah but I don't know if necessarily like like put it this way are we racist if if there's a I don't I don't know like or let's let's call it bias let's say that there's we're in a race and there's somebody with one leg and we gave them a wheel are we but now they can beat us in the race no we call it but now we don't race together yeah I was called segregation that's my point listen it has this place sometimes you know I'm saying okay so so where's that where's the expiration on that so going now that's a fair question I want to get to that because that's that's a good out point but yeah like if someone had a wheel we gave them we're not gonna all be like oh we're racist now dotted out because I have a chance but they can't beat us because they got a fucking wheel now and so now thing is competitive we got to step up our games to get us but we also know there's enough for everybody to eat so there's that now the expiration that's a hard part right because it's like how far back in time do we get now mind you this is not long let me ask you something like let me ask you something let me ask you something let me ask you something I'm just doing the same so right so to my so to my so to my so to my family so to my family so so we're Italian so we're Irish okay there's other race like it benefits every every every pen road has money every every every culture that exists at some point time was held in slavery bondage every one of them correct but because we're dealing with American history so so if America was founded founded on the ideals that all men were created equal and they weren't back then but hold on let me make a point all right we got to the point where civil war okay in the civil war do you know who died who who died the most to free the slaves probably white people fucking right bro my my house I didn't even cook you for that hold on my no it was fighting to keep them though it was a lot of black people too not only that hold on wait I'll make a point I live when you come you haven't been to my house yeah we're gonna go after where I live you know you let's just ask Grant used to have a house there okay you let's ask Grant was white he was 18 president United States the reason that he became president United States was because during the civil war he was literally one of the generals who went to the fucking plantations and killed the slave owners himself and freed the slaves all right and he started the party called the radical Republicans okay the Republican party has been anti slavery anti anti fucking segregation forever okay all right that was the whole premise of the fucking party when when this happened in the civil war and hundreds of thousands of fucking how many people died in this of war no it's shit time look it up you got computer millions and they were mostly white okay where does that fly where do we forget about that that that happened no it just doesn't change the fact that it's still once the civil war ended it wasn't like racism and it's or that like racism will never in well it wasn't like things were equal okay 620 thousand fucking mostly white people that is never talked about it's never acknowledged it's never it's I think it's acknowledged like I mean it's not a great knowledge like yeah I think that you might acknowledge it but it's yeah I mean that's a good point but my point so this leads into the question I ask of what the expiration date is and where where the okay so I asked you this question of well how long do you think since that civil war ended things became equal when did it become equal I don't think things are equal okay all right then I think that's pretty let's see bro no no no no no no no no no no you're you need to let me finish what I'm saying okay you didn't finish what I'm saying but like super unequal no no no no things aren't equal they're never going to be equal so foul it's fucking ever for anybody ever there I have a lot of white friends who were fucking who came in way better situations I have a lot of white friends that I was born into a better situation yeah same for you yeah do you have black friends that were born and better yeah absolutely do you have black friends that were more worse absolutely okay so the idea the whole idea that there will ever be equal outcome is fucking not real yeah yeah okay I agree but we're gonna try to make things fair okay we do as a leader okay like I agree with that yeah that's what we should we should we should we should be fair yeah and fair is it for the whole one is it fair to say in that 2025 okay that we do not have a much better system than we had in 1776 I completely disagree you don't think I was a slow you would own me right now I wouldn't even be a lot of time I'm saying the opposite oh yeah wait wait wait I'm saying in 2025 are we not better more equal now no fuck do no shit um you think I'm fucking retarded bro no I'm saying in 2020 okay my the bottom line of what I'm trying to get at is this at the end of the day personal responsibility drives outcome I agree with okay and if we continue to tear open this wound of how unfair it has been yeah we are victimizing the people today to believe that they cannot be successful this is a big problem that happens in our schools right now yeah little white kids are told your racist because you're fucking white and little black kids are told you can't do shit because you're fucking black what does that do to them over the course of their life I think that probably happens more at home than maybe maybe but no I get what you're saying that's what either I think I think I think I'm going to go on the same page I disagree with that message I want to say that's my whole piece right like I look at the sick like the equation for success right to me like do you take it's right okay I mean let me see because I've been around Andy for five going on six years I I understand the equation for success right and for me and what my family is trying to do I'm trying to break generational curfews as you call all of all of that for me white privilege black privilege in any of that stuff it does not go into the equation period at this point time at this point in time successful at this six because here's the thing success does not give a fuck what color you are you where it came from how hard it was it doesn't that's not in that equation it's yeah look I so for my daughter right like I want my daughter to be successful I want her to be successful let's say I'm going to go to my daughter and say her hey babe listen like you know she's in private school yeah she goes to private school mom stay at home wife right like like like she's she's good but but guess what babe that that white privilege that's out there it's going to hold you back no matter how hard you try it like yeah so yeah so it comes in this like because I think we all agree there like I tell my daughter let me go one general come back in that no one believes in more than that than than me like I hate a fucking victim story like I hate the bitch like like like I don't believe in any that shit like success is there like no excuses that's what I believe in I think it comes down to now that I'm giving right in a position to give thank god um I acknowledge that I work my ass out for I also acknowledge that there were some things I was born into with my privilege that I got into now I had a choice well that's what I said I said I said it's not just right but I have a choice I can go I can donate my million bucks for my boys and girls club to wherever I want so I could have done it and like scripts ranch and carls bad right like where it's them really nice predominantly white happens to be predominantly white areas or I could do in southeast San Diego where it is minority primarily etc I chose to go there not because I'm racist because that group needs to be that's the need yeah that's the need that's the need correct and that and so I just that's okay now now now why doesn't make you racist I don't fucking know this isn't 100% yes is where I want more conversation or I think you know sometimes that this is a great is this is great conversation but I just like I like what you said is because that's the need and I think sometimes groups feel like people don't think there's a need and there is a need oh you're saying like they pretend like it's not real yeah exactly well you gotta do the only thing that's a scenario is like yeah but see here's the thing so there is a fucking double standard there right because yes you go down the fucking downtown St. Louis bro I mean there's a fucking need I'll show you but I will but I will also take you 20 minutes out this way and we will go to the fucking trailer parks and you will tell me it does not look any different it's just it's just the color of the people and listen and that's and that's why it's like look we need we need help on all sides yeah right but it's just I just don't think we can't at some point in the time for us okay well that's going away because everybody's fucking each other there's not going to be white kids anyway that's a whole different conversation we're going to look the same anyway that's a whole different conversation because that is engineered intentionally to eliminate fuck here's the reality dude there's other he's going to be mixed that's real that's real but here's another thing white people okay can you say you're proud to be black yeah you can say you're proud to be white no I can't no I can you can't say that power well first of all it's not it's for first of all let me tell you something there's a difference because I've never been able to socially accept it be socially accepted saying that sure okay Latino people can say Latino pride black people could say black pride white people say white pride oh my it's a big fucking problem catch up okay okay no no no no hold on let me make a point you winning in life Andy you and I are waiting my can't say a lot of things because winning people with a lot I say we're the fuck I want but my point here my point on this is that because I've never been able to fucking think like that and I've been told that my identity is not in my race okay I don't have racial I don't look at it fucking white people and be like oh yeah they're like me and I'm fucking proud to be at all like I don't even think that way yeah and so then culture tells white people they're fucking racist on top of it it's like the fuck you talking about dude like yeah I don't know I can't believe a thing I have yeah I have like so there's multiple sizes this equation and here's the bottom line bro if we're going to be what America says that it should be at some point okay if you fall down when we're walking out and you fucking skin your elbow yeah and it's bleeding what happens after a day or two I'm peak no no yeah well what happens okay a fucking scab forms yeah okay and if we continue every time that scab starts to get better we peel it the fuck off it never heals this is good here's my point my point is this there has to be and I don't think that what you said I really honestly don't I don't think that anything you said is actually wrong I don't think anything he says and vice versa and I don't think I said I don't he's just perfect to acknowledge privilege but everybody else no look but at some point the men of this country have to stop tearing the wound open so that it can fucking heal and that's the truth so question hold on let me ask you both this because this is a question for both of you now with that inside and thinking about what you said earlier which I agree with the government it's like yo we need to get rid of all that shit and Trump comes in and he's like let's fucking delete it all because it's bullshit would you be opposed because of it is time to move forward if Trump comes out and he goes you know what it is time to move forward there was some fucked up shit in the country it was this ideal to make America great but it was just for white men but we all know that it needs to be for every man every woman doesn't matter your fucking color any rips up the constitution and he burns the fucking flag and starts a brand new one I don't think that's yes I would be opposed to that I'd be a big I'm curious though I know here's why here's why could you understand why I wouldn't be super excited about the flag though no not at this point but here's what I will say here's what I will say and bro you know I love you dude like and I've I actually really appreciate that you have your opinions and actually back them up with a fucking argument and not just say stupid as shit I believe that the idea of like when I say hey man I'm a fucking patriot I am not saying that I am a fucking fan of the way shit is now what I'm saying is I'm a fan of the way that it was designed to be and America has never lived up I this is this is what I think needs to be said okay America has never lived up to what it was designed to be from the start and if we actually took what it was designed to be from the start and actually applied that right now yeah we find we'd have the best fucking thing ever I agree with the astic of just saying how is designed to be for all people because it wasn't designed to be for all people if it was designed to be for all people that I'm with that no no no you know back then it said all men are created equal they did not but your votes three fists I understand this yeah I understand this what I'm saying is if you took the same document and you apply it today and you actually fucking lived by that we'd have the perfect fucking country the problem is just like many businesses that there was a business plan that nobody fucking followed the right way okay so I would not I think that the answer is not okay if we have a problem business right let's say you and our business partners yeah and we make this plan and we say fuck the business isn't working well what's the first thing we should do we should look and see if we're following the fucking plan we haven't followed the plan we don't just tear up the plan yeah we audit ourselves are we following the system okay and the audit of America over the course of the last 200 years is in my opinion that while it has gotten better we have never actually lived to the system that was designed to be okay and so I think that if we actually started applying what it was supposed to be in reality the way all men are created equal and all of these other things I think we end up with the perfect product we just have a bunch of people as you said who have gotten into power and utilized it for their own benefit yeah and and I do think that it would be I think it's very important to acknowledge that there has been massive amounts of progress that have happened over the course of this time and we are much closer what it should be at this point culturally yeah but I believe that we are much further away from a leadership standpoint where these guys have started to create a system that pretends to be free that actually isn't free and I really think that we would all do ourselves a service at you as a black man me is not white man but a white man okay to lead people to unity so that we could understand that it's not us that's fucking it up for each other it's those motherfuckers up there that are constantly telling us you're this you're that and then while the same time we're fighting they're still on a fucking money bro they're stealing it all so so I don't think the answer is to tear it up but I would tell you from a symbol I think the answer is to take the fucking tyrants and put their fucking heads on some fucking stakes and make sure that no one ever does that shit again that's what I think yeah I think that's well put and I I just think as a you have sensitivities about it yeah well no my my you got to understand I do too yeah because there's flip sides to it yeah I think I mean yeah for sure right like I mean I think but none of that shit I didn't I it's not my identity no it's not my look it's not yours either stop me yeah what I want to do I just think like for America to be unified right and if we are because you're bringing up a good point of like when does it in when does it stop to me I think we end those docs in those processes and create a new one like I think that's how it would end is like hey this is kind of a symbol of well could you make a better system than that one was on I mean maybe we and maybe we rewrite it in different words just a sign of symbolism of like yo we're acknowledging that this was shit is kind of fucked and moving forward well I bring this up because I I come back full circle with you know like I had a friend of mine and she was really taken back at like now mind you I pledge allegiance and I stand up for the flag but also and the same stand I can respect somebody who doesn't if you look at the history and see what everything that would have like it wouldn't make sense for them to stand and so I just think it would be ideas or maybe those stand and there's just a new additional doc like a new declaration I think it the whole thing is fucked and we do need new but I see a lot of backlash when people don't just bend the knee to the old documents the old constitution all these things that were written at it why do you think that is because they're protecting their own well do you think it could be something else like for example like I don't know like my grandfather being killed in World War II after fighting on fucking Gidey and never meeting my dad yeah I mean do you think that that's do you think that you know me growing up without a grandfather and my dad growing up without a dad would in the name of of fucking what this country supposed to be would make me feel a certain way when people don't stand for the flag 100 percent but you just like that that same passion you can also see how somebody else's dad and grandpa was killed because of it and I think that's the hard part is it's both you're not wrong neither is John Doe who's you know or my my ancestors who were killed because we're not wrong I just think we're here and I'm just a fan of everybody kind of understanding everybody's perspective like I would hope that the comment here is I think this is a healthy conversation both sides have really good perspectives let's grow together but you're not you're gonna have comments and someone's gonna be like they're super fucking far right and they're racist no and he's a little hard are people are very central I think that I hope people can see that we're all on the same stage now that's my biggest point but I think I think what it comes down to we talk about exploration of it the problems that we have in this country they're not black problems they're not white problems they're American problems and I think the moment that Americans start realizing hey we're all on the same fucking team here yeah and start looking at all of our separate needs and stop looking at them as separate needs okay no like like the poverty that's in fucking downtown St. Louis that's all of problems the probably agree with that the poverty that's like in fucking you know South County the most unified you've sounded well I mean but like this it's like that but I feel that that is my belief you know what I think the problem is like when we constantly try to oh well this is a black issue oh well they got their white privilege is a white issue no bro like the the moment we can all address it together and like hey these are all of our problems we have to solve all of these problems that's when we move past the expiration dude I agree with that but you can't call people racist for pointing out the fucking problem that's what I'm saying but again if we all oh well then with Andy with that just they need to state the whole problem right like I think state the problem because you're right the data is the data at this point but to anyone's gonna be sensitive why don't think people like hearing the truth about the whole problem but anyone's gonna be sensitive about the problem if you don't say the how and why so for example if you walked into me and let's just say I punched my boy Paul and you're like well you guys just punch etc and I didn't tell you yo he just literally killed three people in the other room you'd be like I'd be so fucking mad because I'd be like you didn't understand why I said like and he's the news big knowledge meant of what I don't buy I don't buy listen here I don't buy in to the black community being statistically ultra violent compared to the white community for sure for what happened fucking 300 years ago I don't buy into that yeah it's economics it's economics well I know I know I don't think it is I think it's fucking I think it's I think it's I think it's it's low pot low income places is it no it's not because the murder rate is not the same and white poverty places it's not the same yeah and the thing is I think that's the other thing and then we'll say well where it's it's the culture is an rap music well no it's not because lots of white people listen to fucking right so what do you think it is I fucking don't know but I think we need to figure it to fuck out and that's the thing it's like I think you know specifically like black community but like we have an accountability issue I think so too I think that's the biggest thing it's like you know when little tyrone kills little JJ it's okay we'll put up make make the team sure but also who says that what do you mean like who's who says it's okay and like I think they don't say it's okay but we don't call it out we don't know Billy here's an example bro I was a police officer right like I've seen death I've seen murders right you know like when when little JJ gets killed in the block right and you go knocking on doors anybody see anything no he's aren't you see shit yeah right like that's a problem I agree that's a problem and I think we have a massive accountability issue within the black culture bro and it's like it's a tough thing because nobody wants to talk well here I can tell you there's a big difference I think that's fair that's a real one to say it's because do the my and white culture is some fucking like in my family I didn't Johnny does some dumb like that's a fucking idiot Johnny this is a guy he's right down he deserves me in prison everything you guys just said there is okay it's just when you do that and then also not acknowledge white privilege it just it's harder to hear but what does white privilege it doesn't my point is what's the hardest thing here not putting those two things together what's the hardest thing here but but I'm saying is though just from listeners being leaders yeah with voices etc when one side is just saying one thing that that's where the labels come that's where people go oh DJ's racist or he's being an uncle Tom is because you just got to say both sides is because then if you can say both sides then you go he's right there isn't accountability just like if you sit in two people down and if you only say the one thing oh boy does this person is going to fill the type of way so I think it's just continue the conversation like we're having here I think everybody I think everybody has to be held the same standard that's it no air like we can't have special stand if we start making special standards for some people and other people then we create resentment which creates more bias so if we're gonna fix it everybody has to be held the same standard everybody has to be held to the standard of their own personal actions and we have to say what happened fucking back then it that's not what caused you like right now okay let's take it away from race okay let's take it to another there's another thing it's happening now that's very similar this person killed four people because he had depression or he had meant I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck if you were depressed I don't care that you were having gender dysmorphia you kill four mother fuckers you go jail like that's it and so like dude now we just cover this on the show last week some dude what what was the example with the mental health the uh oh shit um this guy killed somebody or did something and he was like oh he was suffering yeah they released this guy so the yeah the the fucking um oh he bombed the fucking Tesla place yeah so there's a guy like dude right yeah white kid you said bombing I knew yeah that's right that's fair that's fair so this is the way it should be handled bro that's fucking fair sorry anyway this fucking white dude fucking bombs a Tesla and then he gets let out because he claims that he's having mental health problems that's bullshit yeah that's bullshit I don't think you should be able to use any kind of excuse anything like I'm I'm I'm on the other side I think there should be harsh punishments for stupid bro I think we should go to fucking I think we should be cutting people's hands off putting them in the fucking wood shits right now is I actually believe yeah because it would stop it it would stop it it literally like stop it immediately it would stop it it's like it's like Singapore you hear like oh if you if you put how many times do I talk about Singapore how do you I'm like let me tell you when I think about going to Singapore the only thing I know I'm not touching fucking gum yeah I'm not gonna do it yeah because they're fucking putting me gum they'll pull your pants down and public and beat your ass 100% like in front of the other guy yeah I'm actually yeah so so let's start doing that and we'll fix all the problems facts yeah I cut heads off my hands off I don't disagree came embarrassed shame fixes a lot of things so the bottom line the bottom line is here's the reality I don't think you're wrong I don't think I'm wrong either I think we fucking but I don't think that these things are within our control other than what the example is that we set now for I think his leaders is a good conversation to have yeah I think it's like if someone took away just one additional perspective on all sides cool I think that helps right I'm still going to make fun of you yeah I'll get my tap dancing shoes yeah I mean he gets it the worst bro because like you know the Uncle Tom shit yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah honestly how does that make you feel because that's pretty I mean do let me talk I mean I've been on I've been on that wagon for like five years now because again like you know most people they try to they don't know my past bro they don't they don't know that I talk uh in inner city schools they don't know that I've coached youth I've said I'm a border to red this hell but done a lot of shit DJ I've done a lot but like they don't see that they don't see that I think like the truth of the it's all good shit like there's a good I don't think you could find somebody that cares more about the black I know I care fucking shit to yeah right and I think when it comes down to again it's like that that's the end goal and we may get there differently but like the end goal is like there's some things we got to fucking fix yeah yeah for sure you know I'm saying and not addressing the mega fix them yeah or just blaming the other side I'm gonna feel confident yeah I agree with that like we got like there's problems that we have to fucking address and I want the best for everybody you know I'm saying and I don't look at shit uniquely I don't think it's uniquely these problems or these people probably know bro we all got to fix it man yeah like I think the best thing that anybody can do if you are experiencing any kind of racism prejudice whatever is just move on and get rich get really successful no shit bro and make the change that you want to see yeah because like you know what I don't like is there's this all saying that you guys see every single election year and it's this it's vote everybody says get out and vote the truth is fucking run you really want to change run well that the only the only the only you know it's like like they or conversations vote and then they get the new or or juicer apple juice or like that's not a choice or do what the constitution says that we should do over there and have a duty to do is to overthrow tyrannical government that too that's a fact no listen we have failed our American people have failed their responsibility to keep the government in check period it's it yeah and whether that is however that needs to be solved and needs to be solved and you know that's why I'm on the fucking list because I will openly say that yeah it says in our fucking preamble it says that we as American citizens have a responsibility to keep our government in fucking check we also have responsibility to overthrow them if they get to when we have our fathers and the people before them have allowed these people to rape and pillage us financially and slave us financially and make it hard for all of us and now what they're doing is they're telling the public school policy they have started to start the division at fucking two years old when I was in preschool and grade school at least they told us like hey uh you guys are all the same they don't tell them that anymore you know what I'm saying and like dude I'm just so sick like dude how hard do you work it work hard you work hard as fuck how is it okay for them to take more than half of your money and then fuck and then fuck and then fuck that's not okay no it's not that's not okay man and the money that the the the the takin you know that's supposed to be going to me how much more the fucking money give more how much that's from saying well how much more money would you like it's so and then they use it against the they make everybody hate people like me and you because they say well all they're gonna do is keep the money that's actually that's actually makes no sense because if you were to say that the reason that that I'm successful is because I'm greedy and you were to say we tax him because if he's greedy he's just gonna make more money because well to make more fucking money I had to create more jobs dumb fuck okay so I actually have to do more good the greed and capitalism if you actually fucking believe that actually is what creates the fucking economy so like it's either one or the other what what's sad about what you're saying is you're correct but because people won't be in our shoes they don't get it yeah I know it's almost okay that's why we'll live our lives in here well but my point is is that they intentionally stoke that fire so they don't fucking figure it out the bottom line is this bro we are at a place in time where I don't know I mean I I feel like I don't know I personally feel responsible to at least try to fix what the fuck's going on now the only way I know how to do that is by changing the culture and I'm a pretty good culture guy would you ever run for office no I don't think so because the truth of the matter is is that I believe that my strength is in developing culture and I think that if we can get people to understand that if they become excellent and they become wealthy and they become healthy and they become good people and intelligent people that by default creates a cultural revolution and if the cultural revolution demands that the government will fucking fall in line so politics is downstream from culture so my answer to that is I feel like I can do more good here than I can there I mean if you look at Trump Trump is getting blocked and this or that you know and like same thing when whoever's in office they deal with there's no way to get anything done and the only way we as American citizens can fix anything is by taking responsibility for our own lives our own wealth our own thoughts you know and do everything the opposite of what they want us to do because everything that they want us to do is for the benefit of them and not for the benefit of us I have a tag one that I like to always say and this is to the world I don't care what color you are and that is get off your fucking knees and what I mean by that is one thing I'll never do it's big for anybody's approval big for anything and what I see like just think a big example like you know the fucking Oscars or shit like this you see people up in arms they didn't give us a Grammy they didn't give us an Oscar go make your own mother fucking Oscar I don't like that right like how about this fucking you fucking better like yeah like get better but like also you don't need the approval for fucking anyone anything go make it if you want something go make it like literally go fucking make it you live by that I live by that too bro like I like you know many times I've been told no you know when times I've been told I'm fucking stupid you know when times I told I was never gonna be able to do any of the shit that I've done yeah I don't fuck like that's normal for me like I don't watch me huh watch me yeah like what the fuck like that's because then if they see you do it and they know you and they grew up with you and if they know that Andy could do it that they can do it too they have to deal with a harsh truth yeah well I mean look man it's real man at the end of the day you know we're always gonna have problems and and I think that the men of our generation have an obligation is my view to stop tearing open the fucking wounds that they want us to talk about and fight about and start getting everything fucking aligned so that we can't be taken advantage of as a whole and I think the more that we argue about race while in and discussing and discussing and arguing are two different things yeah when there can be reasonable conversation we even know different than talking about the fucking the sports game this could have happened or that could have all we can deal with is what the fuck is and what is is that for us to ever have our country back people that look like you and people that look like me are gonna have to figure out how to get along because the number one way that we are taking advantage of is along that line I agree that line everything else is accomplished yeah that's right but the minute the white culture and black culture start to get I know you all say we don't have a culture but we do all right but the minute that's just fucking live row so so the minute though that we all get along and figure out that it's them causing this shit they are fucking done and and dude that's why I care so much about the conversation I hate race baders I hate antagonistic people along those lines that consistently tear that wound open yeah so that it can never we they do that so that we never fucking figure out how bad they are taking advantage of us give them a greater enemy right so anyway this has been great combo yeah we're gonna have to wrap it up here yeah we're we're we've been going we've been going 310 yeah no shit yeah that's the longest show we've had yeah it's good though I feel like yeah the top it's fucking right bro's awesome yeah bro listen we are gonna what stop complaining work learning AI yeah get ready to change the world yeah don't be racist yeah that's how be racist yeah but make racist jokes that's correct racist jokes he'll best the best yes for sure that's it man but yeah so let's wrap it up with a final segment of the show guys always thumbs up the dumbest fuck we bring a headline in we talk about it it'll get one of those two options so with that being said a thumbs up
