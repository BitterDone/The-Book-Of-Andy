I'm ready to kick some ass yeah makes the people better yes go it never felt so good never feels good so good you know that it does today to make people better I don't know what you're trying I don't know let's just do the show man I just got give me give me what you got yeah I give it to you man okay I know you will yeah guys hey I got three go as for you man are you sick over there are you you cold you're cold it's freezing in here is it I really believe Klein comes in here and fucks with the thermostat it's possible you know I'm saying you told me like it's all cold here really it's freezing it's maybe you all shit hiding here all day cold it's my only safe space man it's my safe space yeah man well guys let's get better today guys we got three goblins for you Andy um guys Andy question number one Andy I'm the kind of person who spends hours agonizing over every little detail whether it's a word project or decorating my home it's exhausting and even when I finish something I rarely feel satisfied my friends tell me I'm too hard on myself but I feel like if I let go of my standards I'll be mediocre how can I learn to embrace imperfection without feeling like I'm settling for less let's get this kicked off Andy well first of all uh perfection will keep you ignorant and unskilled okay if you were perfect all the time how could you learn how to be any better and this is something that people have a really hard time with they set out they want to do everything perfect which by the way you should want to do everything perfect but what happens is that they have a you know a hiccup or they have an obstacle or something doesn't go the way that they want and they refuse to acknowledge the value in that situation and the truth of the matter is over the course of your life over the course of your career the mistakes you make are much more valuable than the perfection that you execute upon because the mistakes that you make are the things that teach you the skills the resilience the grit the fortitude and everything that you need to know to be successful long term so instead of being upset that you're not perfect in the beginning you should be thankful that you're making these mistakes in the beginning when nobody's really paying attention to you because if you were to make those same mistakes 20 years from now when you're running a hundred million dollar operation everybody's going to see them okay so and let's break this down further you can't get to a hundred million dollar operation being perfect because you're not going to be able to learn the skills that are required to operate at that level and then all the levels that come along the way so you're saying you will fail before you even get that yeah but but dude listen the reason that people struggle is because they don't put enough value on the failures that they have they're embarrassed they get upset they feel stupid they start having doubts but they don't realize that every single business and every single entrepreneur and every single person that they look up to the reason that you look up to them is very simple they are willing to go out they are willing to fall on their face over and over and over again they don't give a shit what anybody thinks about it they don't care what their friends say they don't care what the media says they don't care what anybody says they're willing to fall down on their face understanding that whatever happens past that they won't make that same mistake again and they keep moving being successful in anything is so simple it's just that people aren't willing to go through the process of being embarrassed and for the people who quite honestly aren't going to matter over the course of your life so instead of wanting to be perfect do your best to be perfect and then when you mess up instead of getting down on yourself instead of you know feeling bad instead of beating yourself up say hey all right that's good I learned that right here from this and I'll never make that mistake again and then when you're doing 10 20 50 100 200 500 million in that same situation presents itself you're going to remember the last time I did that this is what happened and if I do that same thing now it's going to cost me this much more so look dude if you want to have a excruciating time being an entrepreneur try to be perfect and get mad at yourself every time you mess up if you want to enjoy the process and you want to enjoy as much as you can because it is a brutal journey and it's very difficult and it's hard for everybody including you including me including anybody else learn to value the things that you're learning from the mistakes that you make just as much as you value the perfection that you happen to hit by accident along the way you know what I'm saying is by accident yeah of course if you don't have the skills and you don't you know like you know there's a thing there you can you can hit a fucking home run without being a good hitter it's pretty enough bad yeah right like something look man you're gonna do things right sometimes that doesn't mean you're skilled so don't let your ego get out in front of you and think just because you've done a couple things in the beginning that you actually have the skills because the skills can only come from making mistakes over and over and over again or watching other people make mistakes and learning from their mistakes which is a great way to learn as well yeah you know and you talk about you know even just like actualize in your own individual success like it's a it's a it's a strive thing right like you're never actually going to reach that so you look at perfection pretty much the same way like you're not gonna really ever reach that fucking pivotal but you're always striving to get as close to it as possible right yeah I mean look dude we're on a time scale okay you're gonna run out of time eventually like the best entrepreneurs that I've ever met they act like they're gonna live forever you talk to these people that are in their 70s and they're talking for the next 30 years it's like bro you're gonna be in a box right you know saying but like they don't think you don't think that way and like for example like if you took a guy like Jeff Bezos I think Jeff Bezos is around 60 or so right um you take a guy like Bezos to take everything he knows right and you give him 30 more years he's gonna accomplish a whole bunch more but what's he gonna learn in those 30 years and then if he were able to live to 200 what would he be able to accomplish because of what he's learned the last 30 years of his life so when you think about like what potential is for an individual you have to understand that it's capped only by the amount of time that we have and so if you actually subscribe to the idea of always improving always getting better actualizing your own potential like you said you're never gonna be able to reach your potential because you're gaining skills along the way through the process that you don't have time to fucking execute on at the end of your life does that make sense? So the day that you die if you've given it everything that you have you actually have more skill and more potential than you've ever had before which is why it's important to like transfer that knowledge as you go right um but you know it's a weird to think about but I think you know when you think about what you're gonna be the most proud of as a driven individual and look dude we're not talking to regular Joe's here okay we're talking to driven people we have to we have to clarify that when you you guys who are driven individuals who are hungry who are the go-getters who want to win when you guys get out to uh you know the end of your life you're going to have regrets and the reality is is you get to choose through your actions what regrets you're going to have and for entrepreneurs and people who are driven to achieve build create um and who drive society in the proper direction those people are always gonna ask themselves they're gonna say well did I give it everything I had could I have done more what could I have done right and they're gonna pay the price probably in some other areas of life all right that's the reality but that's the trade off yeah you're gonna have a trade dude you're not gonna have it all everybody who says you're gonna have it all you're not gonna have it all it's a trade so but certain people are wired for this kind of life and if you're the kind of person that's wired for that life a lot of reflection is gonna come down to did I do everything I could to to maximize what I'm wired to do and um if you subscribe to the idea of your potential always expanding and your skill set always expanding uh you know you're you're gonna be proud of what you did because you're gonna say yeah I continue to improve I continue to innovate I continue to reinvent myself I continue to push I continue to create I continue to build and I did that my whole life and I did everything I fucking could with the amount of time that I was given and dude that's that's a noble thing because most people don't live that way yeah and then if you take that same idea and you apply it to let's say your relationship or you apply it to your friendships or you apply it to your family you can really have a really good well-rounded life without feeling like you have too many regrets like you're always gonna have some regrets man I you know I missed a couple of those soccer games or we know whatever you are fucking this right but um but there's a trade-off for the quality of life that you're gonna have for the things that you know you're gonna ultimately regret and that's just reality there's no way to get out of your life without looking back and being like fuck I should handle that different yeah I think and I think too for most for majority of people that conversation that that's talk happens at the end of it right for sure if you're lucky though you have the awareness well you have some near-death experiences you know bro also push that I tell you this I mean look man every enlightened person that is like totally gets it they've always had some sort of near-death experience yeah like because you're having that conversation right there okay so when I got stabbed when I was 23 it was that people people get like so weird when I say dude it was the best thing that ever happened to me well the reason one of the reasons there was a lot of reasons it humbled me it taught me a lot taught me how to treat people better there's a whole lot of things but one of the main things that taught me is that your time is finite and when that happened I went from like kind of being like I'm just be real kind of like a tub of shit you know really not given too much effort into my life kind of like you know it'll work itself out to being an aggressively driven individual because of that because I'm like fuck dude that could be taken away from me in a second I don't know when that's gonna happen so I'm gonna fucking go hard right and everybody I know that has gone super super hard they all you can always trace it back to something where their mortality was in jeopardy yeah you know because it says you came real like you're shit now if I'm going right now what did I do yeah that's right dude yeah man that's right I love it man I love it so so don't be satisfied always works you do better and learn from the mistakes I love it man guys Andy question number two hey Andy I'm currently on day 27 of 75 heart I am learning so much about myself and myself discipline I have worked in healthcare for over 25 years in different genres long-term care day treatment nursing homes and patient side and most recently in hospitals I'm not a clinician but a manager of over 250 volunteers in a prestigious academic medical center I'm really good at what I do and I have picked up so much knowledge along the way I have a bachelor's degree and a master's degree and I know I can do more the other day I listen to my boss voice and reached out to the CEO and chief human resources officer for the entire system to ask them their thoughts of going back to school to attain a higher level within the system so I now have a meeting with the chief HR officer to discuss my qualifications and what I can do I know I can do more and I'm wondering if you have any advice for me that I can use them out coming meeting thanks in advance well first of all you can do even more than that like you guys have to understand all right all these people that you look up to all these people that you think have these special skills or they're in these super high achievement areas of life these people very few of them have any special skills that you don't have most of these people are just regular people they are people just like you bro they put their pants on like you they have problems just like you they get frustrated they get angry they get disappointed they get excited they do stupid shit just like you okay there's no difference and we make a mistake as humans when we look at other people and we say they have something that I don't or they must be more qualified than me or they must be smarter than me or they come from a better family or they were born with more advantages and we're experts at telling ourselves all these reasons as to why other people are and we aren't okay and we have to get out of that habit because every single great thing that's ever been created in the history of the world was created by a human being and guess what you are you are a human being just like them you have access to more information to more skill to faster learning than anybody who has ever existed before you in the history of earth so what is it about you that makes you incapable compared to everybody else and I'm going to give you the answer the answer is nothing the answer is the belief in your ability to achieve and become things that nobody you have ever seen in your own universe has done and that is our limiting beliefs we look at everybody we know personally and we look at him and we say okay well that's the most successful guy I know he's a doctor he makes four hundred thousand dollars a year makes seven hundred thousand dollars a year he's got a nice house he drives a Mercedes that is the limit of what I could maybe do and I'm probably way below that because he's a doctor okay so we are and what are we told growing up we're told these things think about his school dude when you're little bit of kid your parents if you had decent parents that tell you you can be anything you want you could be the president one day right but then you go to school and in first grade second grade third grade you know they'll entertain that shit but by the time you're in fifth sixth seventh grade they've started the process of indoctrinating you into your own limitations they've started telling you hey DJ I know you said you wanted to be a president but you need to be more realistic okay we need it we need to we need to get you to you know maybe you could work at seven eleven you know that'd be a you could be the president of seven eleven and they start telling you all this shit and instilling doubt in you and bro these are the this is what's wrong with education system we we deal and by the way it's not just the education system it's our culture okay your parents will start telling you that they'll start telling you well you better you better figured out because you got to you only got a few more years left till you're out on your own and they start putting all this extra pressure and and doubt inside of us and and then we get to high school right and we're like you know little DJ's like why wouldn't it be president and you tell your friends that and they fucking make fun of you and they throw you in the locker right so so over the course of time our dreams our goals our aspirations our belief in our self is watered down by the environment that we all grow up in and I believe like we talk about on CTI that that environment is intentionally created for the prep or the proposition of controlling the population all right they listen to Tuesdays and Friday shows for that back tomorrow for that one yeah but the point is guys is that you don't really have limits you have what you have been told your limits are and you have chosen to believe that those are your limits and that's why you have this problem going for the things you really want and instead going for the things that are more realistic right like man I'd really like to have that you know that 40-ounce ribeye but I'll take that three-ounce fucking strip-sake instead it's almost the same thing no it's not there's a big fucking difference okay and there's a big difference and you settling for this mediocre position and you actually going for what you want to be so so I say all that to say this I think it's great that you're you're taking initiative I think it's great that you are starting to move in the right direction I salute you I think it's amazing I think you need to continue on the live hard program for a number of years because the more years you do it the more believe you will instill in yourself with the idea that you're going to get to a place where you're going to go to the max distance of what you really want and that's what my suggestion would be for you take the baby step right now you're already in the process of it but don't make that the step that's a stepping stone to where you really want to be and I would start thinking about where you really want to be and start taking action for what you really want to do because big dreams create big action which create big results and little dreams create little action which creates a little bit of life that we end up regretting so you're much better than you think you are and you need to remember that most of the doubt and most of the things that you struggle with were installed in you by people around you who have already given up on what their life could have been and they want you to do so as well because it makes them feel more comfortable about their mediocre existence right it's all people who who who limited themselves correct passing this yes it's crazy yeah bro it's crazy it's everybody yeah do you know how many people told me over the course of my life okay I'm 45 years old you know I don't even want to say what I'm worth because people get pissed but it ain't fucking nine figures there right okay it's more than that you know right yeah I've built a bunch of different companies been very successful done a lot of fucking big things and I was I was the dumbest motherfucker ever if you go back in grade school everybody made fun of me I got picked on in high school I was a CD student you know not there's not a single teacher that I ever fucking had ever that would fucking would have said Andy for sale is going to turn out like I have turned out not a single one and that's no disrespect to them okay because I didn't figure it out to after that and if I had looked at me in high school I would say the same but I got to a point where I'm like you know what dude I don't want any of these motherfuckers lives right I just don't and that's that's and that is not me looking my nose down to whatever someone chooses for themselves that's just not what I wanted okay I wanted to make a lot of money I wanted to be successful I wanted to travel I wanted to have nice shit I wanted to build companies that is what I chose for myself and I didn't let anybody talk me out of it like when people would say you know little remarks and things like dude you're a little vitamin shop or this or that like bro I never for one time did I think like fuck all we're gonna be is a little vitamin shop I would get like pissed and I would look at the motherfucker in my head and I'd be like dude fuck you like I'm gonna show you bro watch this yeah and and and we've done it you know and sales wired the same way my business partners are all anybody I'm a business with has that chip on their shoulder yeah don't believe in us bro fucking doubt us fucking make fun of us laugh giggle make remarks please do because I take all of that shit and I turn it into productive energy and I end up stepping on your fucking throat with that so we have to learn as individuals to take all the negativity and disbelief and doubt and limits that people put on us and turn it into real action and shove it down their fucking throats that's what you have to do if you can't do that you won't succeed because you get so much negativity and so much limiting belief and so much doubt so much bullshit that happens over the course of the journey that you're on that if you can't take it and turn it into productive action it's gonna wear you down bro and you it'll crush you so you have to have it it's not an option and we have these people who say all this idealistic shit on the internet don't do it to prove them well on do it to prove them right what the fuck have you done you see what I'm saying bro like bro we have this scenario where people want to make there's nobody that's that that's that tough that can take all of that criticism all of that pain all of that doubt all of that shit and fucking just wear it and not use it you have to use it we only have so much energy available to us we have positive energy I believe in you hey you're qualified you broke listen you can do this okay there's that and then there's the fuck are you thinking bro that's not for people like you what you better be realistic dude you're gonna be broke now let me ask you there's fucking six people in this room do you get more positive or do you get more negative you're gonna get way more negative bro what do you what do you guys get every single motherfucker in here it's gotten more negative than positive well if you can only use the small amount of positive and you can't use a negative you're missing out of most of the energy required to get where you want to go so you have to learn to have that chip on your shoulder and you have to learn how to process negativity in order to produce the positive outcome that you're looking to create yeah I want to hit on this man because I think it's important you you said you know you like and we don't want to look down on anybody if that's what they chose to do problem is most people are settling in their life no mo you're you know what I'm saying you're correct here's what you're saying and then I agree with you I have no problem with anybody in fact I admire people who are living the way they want to live if it's actually the truth if it's genuine and authentically what they want yeah bro but they're so but that's not most people most people settle and then pretend that that's what they actually want it so that they can be noble you know I'm you know I could have done all that but you know I chose I chose bro I watched you you didn't do shit you laid on your couch and fucked off you didn't try to do anything right and you got what you got and now you're pretending like that's what you wanted yeah bro listen they're it's all bullshit no most people never become anything because they're lazy they don't believe in themselves they weren't willing to take a risk and put in work that doesn't have a guaranteed outcome and then at the end of their life they get the fucking look at themselves in the mirror and be like fuck I didn't do shit and that's their that's their tradeoff so they get a comfortable life and a hard pill to swallow at the end of it yeah man and by comfortable I don't mean comfortable I just mean like lazy comfortable yeah right right like they still gonna have high amounts of discomfort you know that's the other thing people don't understand it's gonna be fucking hard no matter what dude like it's going to be hard whether you put in all the work to become successful or whether you don't put any of the work and you fucking struggle your whole life it's you know I actually from the first fucking person that said choose your hard back and I got the meme to prove it now everybody says it right but it is what it is it's fine lots of shit that I said original but yeah dude you choose your hard you can either fucking choose the path of hard work and you know bear fruit or you could choose the path of being lazy and it's gonna be a hard life and that's it yeah I love it man guys Andy let's start third and final question Andy we've got question number three hey Andy I'm 25 and near bank rep see I started a business a few years ago in video production and quickly worked my way up to 250 thousand a year being the only one in the business over the past few months I let my ego get the best of me and I have no money left I'm behind on taxes 60 thousand dollars in credit card debt spent it all on going out and expensive purchases and I got lazy and overweight lost quite a few clients and businesses slow over the winter but I am working my way back what advice do you have for me or other entrepreneurs who have self sabotaged after getting their first success thank you guys I hope this one makes it on the pot I think others can relate self sabotage how do you what do you do after that moment you realize self sabotage bro you just didn't know how to handle any kind of fucking good shit happening okay it's a it's a normal lesson that's a normal lesson a bunch of entrepreneurship the difference is most people let that barium and then they say fuck I tried being an entrepreneur it didn't work with me okay that's you're at least saying all right I recognize what I did I got fat I got lazy I let my ego fucking think I was the man and I spent all my money and now I'm gonna fucking shit storm right I could respect that I respect the honesty and the fact that you're willing to own it says that you know I don't think you'll do that again right and that's a valuable lesson so let's go back to the question that I we ask question number one how valuable is that lesson for you to be $60,000 in debt instead of 60 million in debt 10 years from now right okay so you're learning a very valuable lesson that is going to be relatively cheap and I know it doesn't feel that way right now but it's going to be relatively cheap for you to learn versus what it would cost you in five 10 15 years so first off I'd be thankful that you're an idiot and they're an idiot now and not later okay secondly I would take out a piece of paper and I would write the lesson right there on the piece of paper in a big ass fucking Sharpie marker and I take that motherfucker on your bathroom mirror and everywhere you need to see it because if you have the tendency to do this you're you're gonna have the tendency to do it again okay because you are playing the entrepreneur game for the wrong reasons and you need to adjust those reasons and what I mean by that is this you are playing to to fund a lifestyle and you need to be playing to create impact and value in your customer base and if you create impact and value in your customer base you will make so much money that your lifestyle won't be a problem so let's take the mode let's be honest about your motivation because you didn't make much money bro I mean I know that you think you made a lot of money but you think you made it right right okay and then you figure out a way to fucking spend it you need to understand that if you really want to have a great lifestyle you got to take the focus off of yourself and you got to put it on your people you got to put it on your company and the rest of that shit will take care of itself okay so let's make that adjustment right now let's make a conscious uh you know point to not make this mistake again and let's start digging it out and you say okay well what do I do to dig out well you fuck bro you got to start chipping away you know there's no there's no magic success fairies can fly down and give you a check for a hundred grand it gets you out of your hole that's it you're gonna have to go you're gonna have to do the work I would recommend getting on the live hard program starting 75 hard getting your fat ass back in shape getting your mental sharp and everything else will follow that let me actually this in because I've heard this before I don't think you've ever really talked about this but what is the right way to win meaning like how do you celebrate the win like the right way like winners know how to win right like like you've been here before my coach used to tell me that all the time act like you've been here before right what what's the appropriate way to do it in in six months let's be real dude do you see fucking Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk or fucking any do you see me or fucking anybody in the club popping bottles and acting like they're fucking it's first time they ever got a fucking dollar right did you see that I'm not at all right because it ain't and I don't know anybody successful that acts like a like some of these fuckers online like you know like the shit they do we're fucking it's embarrassing and it makes them look like amateurs so yeah um you know be classy be cool reward yourself you know but realize that you know people are they're the people that don't like you aren't gonna like you no matter what you do so you gotta do what you like you know I'm saying like there's a lot of people that fucking don't like me because I drive fucking cool ass shit and I fucking post on the internet but you know why I do that because there's a lot of people that are young andies out there they're gonna think that shit's awesome and be aspiring to fucking kick ass because they're like fuck okay if I go kick ass I could drive a cool car I could drive a bunch of I could drive a different one every day of the month you know I'm saying like I can live on a fucking history you know like it's inspiring bro and you know there's a difference between inspiring and just being a fucking jagas you know like these dudes on the internet throwing money in the air and shit you know it's not like it's a fine line like it's pretty good yeah it's just fucking don't be a douchebag yeah that's what it comes down to I love it man yeah I look dude this guy here you got a long way before you should be buying any cars the money and the vacations or club like dude I see man now let's bro they need the internet the the internet's a really fucking hard place because it causes people who are doing pretty good to do really dumb shit that keeps them from doing better like you know like you know like buying buying exotic car too early I gotta watch oh yeah the watch yes or traveling private when it's fucking a hundred times more expensive too early just so you could take a picture for the Instagram like dude that shit will bury your fucking ass you know what I mean and the truth of the matter is is like you know if I you know I don't know I just I just I just think you should live below your means for as long as you fucking possibly can and that's it I love it yeah I love it guys forever yeah like bro like these people that you see living in a uh 20 million dollar house and having fucking you know 30 million dollars the car you don't realize how much money those motherfuckers have made they're living within their means yeah you just don't get it well below it yeah you you have never kind of conceptualized the amount of money that you can make if you went out and built something real and because of that you think that other people that are wealthy are spending all their money on lifestyle and shit when they're not they're spending a small percentage on it and then they're using their money to create more money which pays for their life you see what I'm saying and it's unfortunate you know I'm pretty thankful that you know I built most of my the base and the foundation of my success personally before social media really took off and then I was able to leverage those skill sets into digital but one thing that I had that that these other guys don't have is I didn't have you know 200 fucking knuckleheads in my in my face every day with Lamborghini's and fucking flashy watches and shit like distracting me like I didn't have that like I I was I had Tony Robbins books yeah I think that's a perfect words you distraction yeah like I never felt like I never felt like fuck I need to buy this watch because he has this watch or I need to go out and you know sacrifice the growth of my company because I need this car like that was never that was never a thing for me because the internet wasn't what it is today and now we have a lot of people who you know they compare themselves to these motherfuckers online and as you guys are seeing more and more and more of these guys are getting caught up in lawsuits and federal cases and indictments and it's just showing you like this isn't real they're not real like if they haven't built a real company if they they don't have employees and they haven't built multiple companies and you can't order their products and you know you can't see what they built you can't experience their company like motherfucker you shouldn't be fucking paying them for business advice you shouldn't like why the fuck would you do that you see what I'm saying and we have a lot of people who don't know anybody and it's sad and this is this is part of the reason why I'm starting MFCO project again because for the last four years and by the way we're keeping this show going it's going to be on an app but for the last four years we focused on dude cultural awareness like hey we're fucking lose here they're not going to be an opportunity for any fertile soil well now we're going to get our fertile soil back and people young people are going to have to learn how to really win so I want to turn my focus back because I have built a number of very real things to to training these younger people how to actually build things and actually win not just this focus focus fucking bullshit you know because dude for us to keep this country it's you know we talk about this all the time dude you've got to have the soil and then you got to plant the seeds and harvest out of it and we were about to have soil that would never allow us to plant seeds and harvest out of it and now we are going to have that and you guys need to learn how to plant and fucking harvest and so that's that's what I'm going to do and and I was called to do it uh I felt called to do it again because I see so much fucking garbage out there of people being misled and taken advantage of and top things that aren't real by people who've never done anything because they they you know it's because what they see on the internet like bro it's not it it's it no what you have it would you rather would you rather look like you have money would you rather have money I'd rather have a money no shit bro yeah obviously man that's that's the problem with Instagram right now so for guys maybe it's a hell of a way to start a Monday yeah all right guys we'll see them all on CTI don't forget don't be a hoe show the show more
