What is up guys, I'm San DeFrySullin and this is the show for the realist's say goodbye to the lies. The thickness and delusions of our society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys today. We have Andy and DJ, Bruce the motherfucking internet. That's what we're going to do. We're going to get right into it. I don't even feel like doing the intro. We all know what it is. We got shows within the show. We got a fee. You got to pay it. Otherwise you're a hell. So don't be a hell. Show the show. Hashtag no hoes. Yeah. Alright. Let's get right into it. Yeah. I wanted to bring something up. You know, fitness we talk about personal excellence being the only. This is a record intro by the fuck. Yeah. Now I'm going to make it not a record. Anyway, go ahead. No, but we should be talking about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion is super important. I'm in one of those things. Incomposing is that is fitness, right? We talk about it quite a bit. Have you seen I'm sure everybody's fucking seen it. I know you've seen it, but there's been an update here. Have you seen this article that came out from MS NBC? The one they did about me without naming my name or my 75 hard program. And then try to act like it wasn't about me. Right. I've seen it. Yeah. And they figured out finally that every time they they name me or 75 hard that it blows at the fuck up. So now they just left me out. Well, so for those of you guys who don't know MS NBC put out this article. And this was one of their tweets that they they tweeted out posted this article says the far right obsession with fitness is going digital. Okay. But it backfire in their face because this Fox News did an interview. All right. I have this headline here of this article man down 113 pounds tells MS NBC not to politicize getting healthy after column ties fitness to far right. It's a fucking awesome article read awesome article read. I thought we could dive in dive into it a little bit. This is fucking great. So I can great. So the article goes to say a man who lost 113 pounds over the past year called out MS NBC for a column tying white supremacists and Adolf Hitler to physical fitness. You were in the article a little bit. I was. Oh. He says quote, please leave fitness. I was about to get excited. So it says it says quote, please leave fitness and getting healthy out of the polarization. We see in every aspect of American life Dave Dana 31 toe Fox news. Well, I can't stress enough how not interested. I am in someone's personal politics at gym. Makes sense to me. He says quote, my hope is that we can set aside the clickbait articles like this and focus on mental health and physical health and move forward. He continued MS NBC columnist Cynthia Miller, Idris wrote in her piece quote. Pandemic fitness trends have gone extreme literally that researchers discovered quote fascist fitness groups posts groups online. That are radicalizing young men with neo Nazi and white supremacist extremist ideologies. She said young men are first Lord in quote with help health tips and strategies for positive physical changes. Then are later invited to closed group chats and exposed to far right content. The column now this column was written back in 2022 stop here. They have no problem promoting far left content everywhere we fucking look. Let's just state that. You don't think there's nothing wrong with that. I'm just saying. What is far right? I was about to say the death. What's the definition? Everything that isn't far left. Exactly. That's the definition they're working off the big. Now they're trying to make it seem like they're talking about white supremacy and fucking neo-nazism and you know, clan and all this shit. Link out jogging together. Yeah, link it. Where is it at? So the article was written way back in 2022. But Fox News writes it says got renewed attention this week after MSNBC tweeted a link to it. And that's the one that we just showed here earlier. Quote the far right subcession with fitness is going digital. So Dana Dave Dana said it was disheartening to see MSNBC dragging exercise, which is provided positivity in his life. It's as something as incredibly counterproductive as American politics. But I wouldn't want to turn off any segment of the population from joining a gym from working on their health because they might not want to be associated with the alt right. I don't want to be associated with the alt right either. Dana said, but that's not what I get from working out. Dana started his fitness journey in June of 2022 after he stepped on the scale. And saw an error message because he exceeded the maximum 400 pound limit. And then a year later, he's down 113 pounds and has gained a following on Twitter from his daily motivational post about its progress. Quote I specifically don't talk about politics. I don't talk about the culture war on my journey. Dana said quote, I don't do that specifically because my hope in what I see in the real world. 99% of the time is that exercise, fitness, weight loss and health is for everybody except those on the far left. Just be honest it. Although Miller Idris acknowledged that fitness is mostly a hobby that is enjoyable and rewarding for brain health and overall well being. She said its intersection with extremism. Quote leads into a shared obsession with the male body training masculinity testosterone strength and competition. Yeah. Yes, it does indeed science. So it wraps up here, man. I thought this was a great story. I got his progress pictures here. But Dana said he believes these are popular buzzwords. The media uses to get clicks. Correct. Quote they understand what will get people on both sides riled up and they use that he said Miller Idris also wrote that fitness and violent hyper masculinity have always been central to the far right and linked physical fitness to Hitler. She said quote in mind comp Hitler fixated on boxing and jujitsu believing they can help him create an army of millions of their throwing Dana white in here now to. Dana white is getting thrown up in there. Yeah and here's a weird thing though as a Jewish man Dave Dana said he doesn't appreciate likening anything to Nazi mentality. Quote I don't think it's relevant or useful to make that comparison he told Fox News. And even if you're going to make it I think it falls flat of what they were trying to do. Very very interesting so here's Dave Dana. Here's this progress picture. This is just a year in. You know it. Yeah I thought I just thought it was fucking great. So anyway, what do you got on this? What's wrong? Who's that? Huh? That's Hitler working out. Bro. Is that a real guy? Yes, real guy. Holy shit. He walks around like that. Because that's like a real that's like a brand new picture. That's real. Holy shit. Yeah. All right. What do I got? Yeah, but what do you think this is like it gives us a glimpse into like what a normal person living in America how they feel. Yeah. And I think what we are tired of the shit dude dude. And we we had this pandemic that killed a lot of overweight people like let's be honest. Right. And so I mean here's a guy who probably was scared shitless when they happen. Well let's state some let's state some clarifying observations. Number one. We've talked about on this show many of times why they want you to believe that big is beautiful and that 400 pounds is healthy. And the reason that is because they know that if you are of that mindset that you are going to consume their food which is full of chemicals it's fake food. And you're going to consume it as a mega consumer. You're also willing to consume their data which they feed you on their phone which means you're consuming their propaganda. And they also know that if you get to be that size you're going to be sick and you're going to require their medication. And if you're that big and you're that propagated and you're that sick and you require their medication you're probably not much of a threat to them. Alright so that's what we're talking about here and that's why when we say personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion it makes sense why they villainize. This kind of stuff and people like me and my program live hard which you can get for free by the way now a plug. And episode 208 alright I've changed your fucking life. Secondly typically far left people don't believe in fits. Okay at all because to believe in fitness you have to believe in a core fundamental belief that when you put work in you get a result which is contrary to their entire perspective on reality. They believe that everything should be equal and they believe that when someone else has something that they deserve part of that in order to make the whole right. So the fundamental like misunderstanding of reality by these people who are on the far left makes them not gym goers or fitness people anyway. It's just something they don't believe in and this is why when you see these people with. You know that have the typical look I'm not trying to be a dick but let's be real no bones no most they all look the same bro they got fucking starving listen. It's one of two looks it's either super vegan and I look very unhealthy I'm very thin and I've got you know I got blue hair pink hair yellow hair got some foot something weird the screen's attention. Yeah or I'm a huge disgusting blob of a person who's on the internet screaming my ideologies and who's never accomplished fucking shit in their entire life because they don't believe in accomplished and they believe in entitlement. All right so here's the here's the bottom line on all this shit. These people represent at very tiny minority of this country and they have been propped up through technology for over a decade to believe that they are setting the standard and they're not set the fucking standard and do you know why Hitler stress physical fitness so much. You know why because you actually believe that his citizens should be excellent examples of Germany and he believed that if we were stronger citizens then we would actually be more capable of being more productive be a better society and you know what that's actually fucking true whether anybody wants to call it fucking inaccurate or whatever they want to say it's this or it's that that's actually true okay so you know this shit is absurd keep writing articles about me though because guys I love it because like when you write those articles my shit goes up so don't be so shy next time just call me by my fucking name I'm totally cool with it yeah yeah fuck yeah and I do like master props that's a Dave Dana man fucking amazing one thing real quick what I love about the cap are elix I was just about. Yeah bro like like you see the picture before and like he has a smile you know he probably told people he was happy probably told everything is fine but his after of a year you see genuine happiness yeah and and do when he when he loses his next hundred which he's going to do because he's already killing it and he gets to be you know jacked and buff and all this she's going to feel you better and then they're going to call him a fucking and you're not. No but see this is what happens yeah he will get attacked by these people who probably used to be cool to him and it will push him further to that side yeah because that's how it works you have a lot of common sense people who are who four years ago you would say they would have said you know I don't really identify with who are saying now dude I actually identify with the right because they represent what I stand for and you guys are fucking assholes and so these people are such bullies and and they've been. You've been used to bullying right because they've been no repercussions for 10 years on social media they've ran the fucking show if you don't say one thing that they if you say one thing they don't agree with you're ruined you're you know and they've empowered is very small percentage with favorable algorithms bought usage you know favorable preference on their on their traffic all these things to make them believe that they hold the power and it's very easy to believe that you hold the power when they suppress everybody else. And cancel everybody else and fuck everybody else's lives up and so what we're dealing with is the hangover of the far left believing they still control the narrative which they fucking do not and if you don't believe me look at what's happening to buy life. Okay and I'm not I don't I got a lot to say about that too but the reality is is people aren't buying this shit anymore they're not buying the shit they're not going if you own a company and you're forced your fucking political ideologies down on people they're going to reject it and I believe that's going to be any. And I believe that's going to be a political ideology other than the core fundamental ideologies that America is supposed to stand for which is that we're all here this is all our place we're all cool treat people nice do good things work hard stand up speak up be proud and treat each other good and that those things. And I believe that's going to be a pro America job those are the that's the culture that's going to win in business for the next fucking 20 years. Okay so any of you big companies any of you CEOs I know a lot of you guys listen to show if you fucking go with this shit just understand you're going to fucking destroy your own brand. True shit. That's real shit well guys this cti let's get into our headlines remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos you can go to enter for sell the dot com you can find them there or you can go down in the YouTube description below and find the link there as well so that being said let's get into our first headline of the day headline number one. This is a good one rules for the not for me. Hello, hello, one reads carry erupts after his private jet use is mocked in house hearing denies ever owning one this is great. Oh this is great. This is great special presidential envoy for climate john carry last out at house lawmakers during the committee hearing on Thursday over the criticisms of his use of a private jet that is emitted hundreds of metric tons of carbon even as he battles. Climate change so carry who did not deny traveling on a private jet was responding to republican representative Cory Mills who told carry that he hoped quote it wasn't too problematic for your operational team and your private jet to get here so this is. This is a video of john carries response and again I mean let's just watch the video. I just don't agree with your facts which began with the presentation of one of the most outrageously persistent lies that I hear which is this private jet we don't own a private jet I don't own a private jet I personally have never owned a private jet and obviously it's pretty stupid to talk about coming in a private jet from the state department up here. It just honestly if that's where you want to go go there that's where we want to go yeah we want to go we're going there. Well I mean like real quick like hold on I got a question because I'm a little confused yeah I'm not the smartest guy in the room right but. If you don't own the private jet does it automatically not emit the gases. Do you have to own a private jet to ride one I think you have to but no I think what he's saying is that if you don't own the jet it's okay because it's actually emissions free it's not you admitting it because you didn't know I think there's some sort of magical thing that we peasants don't understand which is basically if you fly on a private jet but you. Don't own the jet it doesn't actually put out any picture it's a mission list that makes sense yeah but it's it's crazy because. Is that one reads John Kerry family private jet sold shortly after accusations of climate hypocrisy you motherfucker did. I don't want to come on man so this is a first on Fox news article this was actually this came back out this came out actually in February of 2023 I had to dig it up for reference but. Like listen to what these motherfuckers did this shit is it's crazy they think we're stupid they I mean listen like. I don't blame them sometimes because I mean you know well you have to consider the people that believe their shit right. Okay like they're laughing at the people to vote for them yeah these motherfuckers right and we're dealing with those same people we're like guys what the fuck can you not see what's going on and they know that they don't see what's going on because they've been in Washington for 75 fucking years so they understand that those people they don't think they're stupid they know that they're stupid man. You don't mean Democrat D means like. Yeah. Well hold on. What does the army man you don't want to be. No but really like listen to this shit man okay so. I can't ask a yell at me in the comments. It's funny I don't give a fuck. Well listen to this shit so so John Kerry's family quietly sold their private jet to a New York based hedge fund following intense criticism of the planes carbon footprint in light of carries work fighting global. So the carries family private jet which was a golf stream G4 SP yeah that's all one those are shitty they're not even that which is even worse because it's not efficient those are like those are like 20 30 years old that brand that that SP thing yeah G4. Well the crazy thing is so they sold it right they are worse on emissions I might say they probably worse on emissions not very efficient Mr. Kerry all right but they sold it so so so this golf stream. It's golf stream trying to fly squirrel LLC is that what they fucking call it so that you know what a flying squirrel is no it's when you take your ball sack and you stretch it to fuck out shut up the flying squirrel you guys ever did that shut up oh yeah no it's not. It's work you guys made that up yeah I love it actually you like stretch it out you're like fly squirrel. What are you doing you just hold it like I look like squirrel like you know yeah see. That's a real big no it's not dude is this like urban dictionary is telling you that's what that fucking means hold on man hold on is this urban dictionary like that's what it means to me. Oh man we're gonna get sure say flying squirrel. What's it say stretching your scrotum and balls over a person's face. Oh shit. It is my fucking name to come and fucking told you that's when it meant bro where are you gonna stop doubt me so if you listen so this motherfucker's I do not fucking miss this motherfucker's nasty well that means these guys are all pedophiles anyway bro we're fucking surprised allegedly yeah allegedly allegedly done properly this will cover the person's mouth and nose completely. Oh it's great. So these fucking names to create a good section make sure your balls are warm before proceeding. See there's art to this not only did not only did I know that it was a thing it's like a real thing that's like that's why flying squirrel clubs. Injury can it yeah this motherfucker's in it. Bro hey you're right you're right how many times do I miss you you're right you're right I can feel so good here yeah. I mean bro that's that's so nasty I'm just telling you so they had a fucking they put it they put it into a company that's a real nice that's a real nice like nobody's even talking about that come on Fox you guys should know what flying squirrels are that's crazy bro so so they sold it right but it gets better and he admitted it in his fucking financial disclosure that him and his wife they own a stake in that company worth more than a million dollars okay so they sold it now it's listed as a V aviation LLC and to this company small firm based out of waterberry Oxford airport and Connecticut but it gets it gets a little bit crazier than that guess what they did after that after they sold the plane they blacked it out they blacked it out so they they they filed what's called an F. D. D. L. Which is a limiting aircraft data displayed so you can't look it up on the apps can't fucking look it up yeah so they sold their problems with my still flying on it. It's allegedly allegedly yeah so I mean like it's so crazy. It's crazy so I got one more video for you because it gets checked and this representative Andy big see he tweeted out when this came out. I mean to the dark says he doesn't own one but he sure does use one because reports came out. The reports came out that last year that the carry family jet the Gulf Stream G4 SP it made a total of 48 trips lasting more than 60 hours and emitted an estimated 715 thousand pounds or 325 metric tons of carbon just since president Biden was born in office. And they told it once all this shit came out now I want to show you the exchange real quick this was the final exchange between. John Kerry and the other red. Mister secretary in exchange with Mister Mills you just testified under oath that you never owned a private jet Mister chairman like to enter into the record article here from February 15th of 2023 that the John Kerry family private jet was sold shortly after accusations of climate hypocrisy Mister secretary you stand by that testimony that you've been in the end or I personally I personally yes my wife owned a plane and so the way that's been. Not in the number of years that I have flown on it and this article is not then in that I did not have sexual relations. He said yeah my wife on it. I didn't I didn't know why I'm here's the here's the why vote it. This isn't some kind of partisan gotcha when we are asking Americans to make serious sacrifices as we transition. For the common good and your family and or yourself are flying around on private jets that smacks of hypocrisy it actually hurts your cause Mister secretary but I'll I'll move on I want to know from a record sample. I'm bored me the right at least to set the record straight here I do not fly on a private jet. I do not fly I fly commercially. I have flown five times in the last two and a half years on Miller which you also fly on and or some of you travel fly on five times. Otherwise all of my trips are commercial. I've flown on a private jet in a personal or official capacity since you've taken this position. Possibly once. I don't I think I just don't I'm trying to think I think you need to take the broader point of how this appears the American people know as we're asking Americans we're not asking Americans not to fly you know you're trying to create an unequal thing we're not. I don't want you to be by example. They don't write you which is what you can't do it is that it yeah okay they don't care about being hypocrites they don't care if they fly on private jets and you get told to not have a gas stove and you get. You know an app on your phone that registers your carbon emissions that doesn't allow you to drive or you get you know find because of your carbon output which is the shit they do over in China right. Which is what they're trying to do here they don't care. Because in their minds they're above you your peasant and they are not a peasant they don't care about hypocrisy they don't care if they do things that are in direct conflict with the message they preach. And that's the biggest fundamental misunderstanding that's happening on the ground level in the United States right now. You guys think that these people care they do not care and they do not see you as part of their country they see the United States as their country and we are a nuisance that infests their country. And you guys think that's a hard radical viewpoint to take I'm telling you that is how they see you and then they come every four years and every two years and they beg for you to vote for these people. We should never vote for an establishment politician ever again in the history of this country whether they are a Republican or Democrat or anything else someone who has made a career being a politician should never ever ever be voted for by any American ever. We can start with this motherfucker and everybody else okay this guy is a thousand fucking years old. Okay this guy I guarantee you this guy pisses his fucking pants in a physical conflict with an able body male that is hyper masculine this expert right right this guy would get himself fucking kill. Okay we have the weakest oldest most corrupt people leading this country instead of the most able the most intelligent the ones that actually have some sort of fraction of care about the belief of what America should be and the people that inhabit it like these people do not care bro no representative they do not care and so to think anything else is a mistake. You do it's like going into the coliseum right back in the old days and you think you know what I really don't want to hurt this guy. So he probably don't want to hurt me either so I'm going to walk up to him and I'm going to stick my hand my fucking chop your arm off bro like you we are getting killed because of our own idealistic expectations which are not true these people have no empathy for us do not care about us do not care about you all but know him to they don't care. They are better than us they rule over us and that's that no different than what's happened human history for the last fucking 12 thousand years you get people in power what is it absolute power corrupts absolutely you get people in power they get there they get comfortable they start seeing themselves as different and that's what we're dealing with we're dealing with a media class and entrepreneur class at the highest level we're not talking about me we're talking about people who are hundred billionaires we're talking about people who control the biggest countries. The biggest companies in the world we have politicians corporate and media interest class that look at us like we would look at cockroaches infesting our home and that's what we have and for you to give them any benefit of the doubt whatsoever as there's some sort of quality human being or that they have some sort of empathy for you or me or any of us would be a bad assessment it's bad strategy dude you're sticking your arm out in the gladiator ring and they're going to cut it off and that's what's been happening they've been using our own good hearts against us for a long time we all have to come together and realize who the actual enemy is it is not your neighbor it is not someone who has a different pigment than you in their skin it's fucking them the people who think that they can preach to you about climate disrupt your whole life about climate bankrupt you over climate limit your freedoms over climate but they can still live the old way they can still do whatever the fuck they want I can tell you this I fly in a private jet air where I fucking go I love it but you don't know what I'm preaching against it I think you should all I think everybody should get on one it's fucking amazing bro how cool is it I was pretty flying the other way no right no it's pretty fucking is what it is it's pretty nice so it is what it is guys join on the conversation let us know in the comments hashtag flying squirrels would you guys like to fly on fly on my private jet what's the name of the company like squirrel when I get a private jet I'm gonna fucking paint a flying squirrel on this fucking side of it one day I'm going to be running for president and I'm going to have a big ass plane like Trump only instead of Trump it's gonna have a I swear this is what I will do it will have a fucking squirrel with a cape and he will be flying through the air flying squirrel yep and only like you guys listen to this episode right now we'll get it yeah we'll laugh for us off this president why do you have a man it's rocky the flying squirrel guys let us know what you think headline number two headline number two reads no cocaine in here secret service closes white house cocaine investigation by demonstration is accused of cover up over five minutes failure to catch suspect who left drugs in West Wing locker despite security cameras recording 24 seven you know by it I don't buy it I don't I think they're blaming it on secret service I don't I think they're being forced to do that without saying too much I know that's what's going on I know you know I do know I know so let's give into this so so the secret service is closing the investigation into the White House cocaine discovery because of a quote lack of evidence in a stunning move just 11 days after the drugs were abandoned in a West Wing locker furious Republicans have caught the shuttering of the probe ridiculous and accused the Biden administration of a cover up with agents unable to find a suspect despite pouring over surveillance footage for more than a week GOP representative 10 burshets said agents quote just decided it's just some weekend visitor and chalked up the entire investigation as quote another cover up by the Biden White House it's bogus the Tennessee congressman at it that is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life this comments came after the secret service briefed members of Congress 11 days after the cocaine discovery when the Haylessborer Student action episode the of course who did the amount Another cover up, you know, it's the most secure building in the entire world. You can't go in there They have facial identification. They had you got to give your so security number nobody even the press nobody goes in there without them knowing This is a bad look on the secret service and a horrible look on this white house So more cover-ups continue I mean he's pretty pissed So apparently the list of suspects was narrowed down to 500 people Democrats said drug testing all the potential culprits would violate their several liberties and insisted the cocaine was found in the area Used by guests not members of the Biden family to make sure it's specific on that Um, or those with security clearance. Why don't you say that? Yeah, what was what there's no drugs in here? It's not my pants. This is not even our white house You know I'm saying I don't private jet I I don't want to private How about wife on here? There's not my cocaine my my son's but since July 2nd the secret service has been pouring over surveillance footage from camera stationed all over the white house But still hasn't managed to find a culprit Meanwhile President Joe Biden has avoided the latest white house scandal by escaping to Europe for meetings with foreign leaders Trump a recipe Director and longtime FBI agent mark morgan told dailymail.com last week that the case is straight forward and could be solved in a matter of 30 minutes now let's Put this together quick. So first When the news first broke they said that it can't it was found in the library, which is you know open to public tours, right? But then after a few days 40 hours later they change it. Oh actually it was found in the West Wing lobby Another place that is open to public tours The West Wing lobby is the reception room for visitors of the president vice president and the white house staff But it comes to find out that from this you know Classified brief they had it was actually found in this third location Which is the West Wing executive interest entrance Which is used by vice president senior staff officials and visitors to the West Wing A very secure location Extremely secure not just one that you know any normal day American patriot can walk Um, so a full statement was uh issued from the USS Which is United States secret service it was released today on the days recording Following the briefing that gave a detailed rundown of what the agency did to investigate the matter But it concluded by saying it could close The investigation without finding who brought the cocaine into the white house um Says at this time the secret services investigation is closed due to a lack of physical evidence I see an end jumped on it of course Um, this is also at the same time that FBI director raise getting Uh, blasts it for covering up Biden administration Um, he's been going back and forth with representative gates uh Jim Jordan There's a lot of stuff going on here Andy. What do you got on this? Well It's my personal belief that This Was never meant to be solved and that this is actually part of the demoralization of the image that we have For our country the White House is a sacred place the White House an important place to our culture in our country And it's representative of America at the purist form and What I think is that this was actually put in there discovered And then created a massive buzz in order to moralize people's image of this country That's personally what I think is going I think they know exactly who did it. I think they know exactly why it was done And I think they're blaming the secret service um To make the secret service look incompetent which is another way to demoralize what we think of our country Okay, so a lot of this has to do with demoralization in my opinion And the ruining of the prestigious View and opinion that Americans may have of the government um That's my take and I don't you know, okay, so they got Uh 24 hour surveillance footage. This is no different than January 6th. Where's that shit? Oh, they released a little bit of it from the news But not all of it. Where's the rest of it? They released what they wanted you to see yeah and and dude this is this is this is absurd um People should be fucking pissed about it and That's what I think I you know, I I'm I'm so tired of seeing this country Embarrassed and made to look like buffoons and Intentionally destroyed in the eyes and the hearts of their own American citizens I'm sick of this shit. I'm fucking sick of it and You know when I look at these people's faces I I start to get like legitimately physically angry That's the point where I'm at so you know, I'm tired of these people walking around You know making the rules for us and then not abiding by any of them I'm tired of them doing totally insane shit and not being held accountable like taking money from foreign governments And then making policy decisions around them I'm tired of the weak politicians in Washington DC that pretend like they're doing something when they aren't Okay, half of these people that yell at these people on on these Congressional hearings are in on it too. It's all an act Okay, these people are up there. He's screaming at you know John Kerry and screaming at you know whoever they have there Embarrassing them and then they do nothing about it. It's all theater dude It's all fake and these people go behind closed doors and they fucking go to dinner and they smoke cigars and they play golf Fuck I didn't go too hard on you. Yeah, and then yes exactly like that And people have a hard time understanding that that's exactly what's goes on Okay, these people fucking are friends behind the scenes they all get along And they're all on the take they're all getting paid and that's the game. That's the game attorneys play That's the game politicians play and it's all theater. It's all fake. It's all bullshit And what's happening here is the intentional demoralization and the reduction of the prestige that we all hold The White House and the United States of America to be It's the ruining of the image in our hearts and minds of something that we once loved And once believed in that's real shit man guys. Let's chime in on this conversation Hashtag not my pants in the comments. Let's get it these people who have done this stuff Hmm they deserve the harshest punishment possible Let me if you let's say I'm not talking about the cocaine. Yeah, I'm talking about the ruining of this fucking country Yeah, for sure. I mean because dude, I mean here's the thing dude. It's gonna take some fucking It's gonna take many years to regain the image of this country and what it's supposed to be like that's not gonna happen overnight We can get back control get everybody here to count. We happen a lot quicker if these people held accountable publicly. Yeah Yeah, that's real shit But I'm gonna even talk about the proud of the nation at this point at this point DJ This is on the shoulders of these people that are that are up there in Washington Who are who were elected By us republican or democrat to represent us and represent this country There's a lot of fucking cowardice happening in Washington DC right now Okay, like we're gonna have to fucking sacrifice some stuff to get our country back And allowing you know these people to get away with their shit Over and over and over and over again not saying anything you're complicit at this point Yeah, because they're gonna destroy our country completely if people don't get some fucking balls and speak the fuck up and tell the truth and Unfortunately, we're not there yet We're not there. We got a few people that are doing it. Yeah, but we don't have enough doing it We're I'm talking about the people up there I'm talking about the real American Patriots and happened to Luckily inhabit the Washington DC ecosystem and there's not very many But my advice would be to figure out who the fuck they are and to take some action on getting the word out about what's actually going on and You know stop just doing what the fuck you told because compliance is what's created this whole mess Yeah, right the whole reason we're here in this point in time is because of the masks It can be all traced back to the mass had people said no to the mask And none of the other shit would have been able to happen because they were they got a temperature check As right that's correct and they stopped it and then You know, I remember a couple guys saying that when it happened, you know Whatever happened to them. Yeah, they were they were they were gonna die Not their dead. Yeah, well, they are They don't even exist. Oh, let me actually this so for for the person listening to this show right now What's What is their Roll in this call for accountability? I wonder things that that people listen to the show right now can be doing I think they need to be calling and emailing and harassing their local elected representatives For accountability. I need you need to be you know calling their phones leave messages sending emails Everybody needs to be pushing because what's happening is these people can't Accurately see the temperature of us from there, all right, so they're not They're not they live in an echo chamber up there bro everybody's friends. It's a whole culture They all play golf together like I said they all go to dinner together. They all they all exist together And there's an echo chamber up there that is come that is Miles hundreds of miles out of touch of what people actually want and what people want is they want accountability They want to know that they can trust the justice system to actually hold people accountable Dude when there's a two-tier justice system. That's part of the demoralization as well When people start to understand like these people can get away with things, but you can't they accept it And what they're actually accepting is their role as peasant class By doing that. Yeah, does that make sense? Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so when you when you accept that Biden and Hillary Clinton and this class of people Barack Obama and all these people can do whatever to fuck they want And get away with it when you accept that what you're actually accepting is your role as a peasant And that they are your superior and so accountability must be had If we're actually going to keep this nation pure and we're going to keep it to the point Uh and and to the premise of what it was supposed to be where all men are created equal treated equally Um and people are going to have to see that that's reality It's going to have to be accountability. It's going to have to be public It's going to have to be had or people will never trust this country ever again or never believe it in again And the reason these people continue to get more and more and more aggressive is because they understand that that's what waits for them if they don't win They understand this is this is life or death for them So that's why they continue to push So they're going to push harder. Yeah, and we said this years ago We said one of two things is going to happen. They're going to pull back or they're going to push harder and they've chosen to push harder and You know now you have the media um attacking a film about trafficking children Why would the media attack a film about trafficking children? Why would that why would they do that? Well, it gets worse than that. Why why would they why would they celebrate grown men dressing up as women and shaking their private parts in small kids faces? why why why why why are they creating names for pedophilia and like trying to like create pet there There's nobody in this country that can deny that pedophilia Is now being pushed to be accepted not only here in the United States, but around the world All right, we have the elected officials in Spain that we covered a number of months back screaming in debate that young people meaning children Are allowed to have the right to choose who they want to have sex with This woman was screaming at the top of her lungs in Spanish. We played the clip on the show talking about how If it can consent Okay, why why I just want you to think about why would this be Why would they try to normalize this why would they attack anybody who's talking about human trafficking? And let's also mention the fact that human trafficking in reality actually looks a lot different than what that movie shows You guys want to think that it's like you know a bunch of guys doing a raid on some you know jungle place where there's keep kids a slaves But what you don't understand is that America the United States is the biggest hub of human trafficking on the planet And so you're you walk down the street every day and you go to the mall and you go around to places and you see victims of this everywhere You go you just don't realize it because it's hidden in plain sight And so if it's hidden in plain sight And we have this situation with Jeffrey Epstein no accountability Glein Maxwell no accountability everybody knows what was happening on that island And then we have you know all of these little breadcrums sort of trailing towards You know them making pedophilia seem like it's no big deal Why would they be doing that? My opinion is the reason they're doing that is because they understand that it's going to come out in the wash And when they by the time it comes out in the wash they hope to have normalized it so that they are not held accountable by it Because we're not calling for accountability now. That's right so What can people do? People can start fucking using their voice they could stand up They can do what we talk about every single show which is become a personally excellent human being raise your standards That's the cultural answer Raising your standards living at a higher standard becoming fit becoming intelligent becoming financially able Unplugging from their matrix. That's part of the solution. That's a cultural solution But there actually is a real solution on top of that that must be had and that includes accountability Because without accountability how can we ever trust the institutions of this country again? How? I'll never trust them without accountability to the media for the lies that they told and the the millions of people that they grew in their lives whether it be people dying on a ventilator or Being denied I've remected in which is now proven recommended COVID therapy which they literally de-platformed people for Without accountability for this and what they did How could we ever trust any of these people again? can't so people need to be calling for accountability and they need to be pushing it on these On the their elected officials from their state as hard as they possibly can all the time And then they need to be using their voices all the time. You cannot be afraid of this We're afraid of look at what's happening with the sound of freedom All right, I got the next hold on are people afraid of it? No, because now they see that everybody else is with it too You know everybody else has been with it the entire time guys all these years happen. Yeah, all these years That you've been you think the tide is changed the tide has not changed The the curtain has been lifted Okay, the bot traffic the censorship the favorable algorithms the Hollywood Fortune 100 Politico matrix has been discovered everybody sees what's going on So it was always that way it wasn't the tide change They were always promoting these things to make them seem like they were the popular things They had everybody in Hollywood promoting this crazy shit How do they get everybody in Hollywood to promote this crazy shift? Do you think everybody in Hollywood just happens to be one of these people? Oh, they own these people These people are chosen for their compliance They go along they get the rewards they become rich and famous, but they just got to do this little things right That's we're dealing with We're do this country belongs to the fucking people this country is not belong to these people Does not belong to a small group of ultra rich elite people that are willing to do anything say anything To fucking take from us dude They take one how much more they got to take from us how much more you got I'm gonna say how much more are we gonna let them take yeah They take your peace They take your health They take your finances They take your time What else what else we're gonna let them take And if you don't fix the problem your children are gonna have to deal with this problem So you should really fucking do a gut check about what you stand for and what you believe to be right Oh, I can't I can't talk about it because you know the people at my job meant fuck the people at your job You have a chance to make a difference your words and actions right now at this point in history have a chance to change Fucking American history for real And all you got to do is be a little bit courageous That's right It's real shit man Guys let us know where you are Um we want to our third and final headline headlined up a three you brought it up a little bit touched on a little bit Um, we covered the last cti about the sound of freedom movie It's over 50 million dollars right now at the box office Um, and that's all great You also mentioned the Politician in Spain right what we got some shit happening in our own borders right But there is a little twist on this. I thought it was important to bring up for the show. So uh headline reads California Democrats Block bill to make child trafficking a serious felony Why why would they do that why would they do that really Because I don't want to be because they don't want to be convicted of a serious felony Obviously I agree Okay What let's move let's move this that reason off the table Let's say you and I are tinfoil hat conspiracy Wachers, okay, there's there obviously they're not trafficking children, right? Okay, all right Let's take that let's take that shade off the table. Obviously. They're not pedophiles. Yeah, okay We're conspiracy to Forget everything I've ever said you've ever said or thought Let's remove those let's remove those things from the table. Why would they do this? You want their answer? Yeah, they said because it's to Prevent overcrowding in the prisons You mean after they just you mean the prisons that they just emptied during COVID right right Oh, that's that's interesting and so so we've now adopted a mindset in this country where We'd rather let people who harm children and violent criminals be on the street than violate their human rights By keeping them in prison. That's what we move to Okay Here's what's really going on They're guilty of this shit a lot of them are in this culture They want violence in the streets. They want crime in the streets. They want disorder in the streets They want chaos in the streets because just like they say Out of chaos comes order You know, and they're burning everything to the ground They are Demoralizing every viewpoint About this country that we've ever loved and ever thought favorably about and they're creating a scenario where they're going to have so much chaos on the streets And so much chaos in the world up to and including pedophilia To where people will fucking gladly accept any sort of order at all As long as it just cleans up the crazy shit Even if it's communism See what I'm saying? I mean could got guys thinking about this way right like You know Crime is so bad outside you don't want to go nowhere If you don't want to go nowhere, you don't feel safe going anywhere You got you know pedophiles or murderers running into the streets rampant You're gonna just stay at home and when you're at home you're gonna consume more of their fucking propaganda You have no real way of interacting with the fucking real world. No real temperature check. You're not going nowhere They want you they want you scared because the moment they get you in that that that state of fear You're theirs they own you. Yeah, and to me this whole thing is crazy But like I said, there is a little twist on the story But I would also like to get your take on Andy So the public safety committee which has a democratic majority The client to advance Senator Groves bill known as SB 14 on Tuesday and some members express concerns Andy about the effectiveness of the three strikes rule and longer sentences Come on Andy. I have longer sentences, right? So the committee which has eight members Voted down the proposal with two Republican members voting in favor and six Democrats abstaining Uh, no votes To me, that's the same as voting. We're chipper. We're chipper All right, now here's the twist for you. Okay, no votes against Like dude when these people play this part since shit. Yeah, those those people belong right in there with the pedophiles Yeah, okay, this is our fucking kids bro That's the thing and like you know, yeah, the senator I have a picture of her here. She brought her grandkids up there during the vote right she vote Which way she goes? She's the Republican that introduced it She's actually the most conservative Republican in the state of California But here's the twist, okay She has to go to battle every single fucking minute of her wife dude So we're in California, dude, it's rough So here's the twist. Let me make sure I got the uh The source correct. This is from the San Francisco Chronicle. Okay, they wrote this article Um, my headline reads a child sex trafficking bill is royaling in the California capital Um, so they go into it and they starts off In an unusual move Governor Gavin Newsom and leaders in the state assembly worked with a conservative lawmaker to revive a bill to increase criminal Consequences for child sex trafficking after progressive Democrats shot the measured down in committee Newsom rarely publicly announces he wants to intervene in the legislature's work and legislative leaders rarely publicly question the committee's votes of their fellow Democrats It's especially unusual in this instance given that the bill in question was authored by one of the legislature's most conservative members The move comes as newsroom and other state leaders are under increasing pressure to not be seen as soft on crime While the state's violent and property crime rates are at a relative lows compared to recent decades Concerns about crime arising according to polling by the public policy institute California They're relative lows because they're not getting reported exactly Exactly Yeah, I'm glad you caught that um, so currently child sex trafficking is already a felony in California that carries a prison Prison sentence of five to twelve years for 15 to life of the crime involves force to seek Corrigion for violence So I thought that was that was an interesting twist So Gavin Newsom Shana I know why do you think you did that? I'm I said that I want to ask you that I'm gonna ask you I mean dude it could I I think That this is an example that he he saw They were showing too much of the fucking fellow And he's like hold on that's gonna bring way too much fucking heat they're not ready for Can be we can be knocking down bills like that. I think I think what this was was a move To kind of ease the public temperature because again, God kids That's the line for the majority of people look at this guy Look at him Do you think he's a total dumbass? No, I don't think so he know I wouldn't give him that have you seen him talk No, for sure you seem to bait you're extremely witty. Okay. He's very witty I hate his debate style because all he does is shout people down like most liberals do because they can't make actual points This guy's not a dumb fuck he realizes that the child thing is a fucking no go for his run to be pressed That's what I think yeah, and he's correct. Yes, however Mm-hmm Look at your state Look what's happening Look at these people who are voting to keep harsh punishment for crimes against your children That you elected to represent you Who use your tax dollars to do whatever the fuck they want Okay These people are complete violation of their oath to serve and do what's in our interest as the American citizens And any politician any politician that votes either Or votes in the favor of a law that somehow protects pedophiles or people who do crimes to children deserves to be held accountable with those people That's real shit And that's a hard line that every single American no matter what you think no matter what you think of politics no matter what side you identify with no matter what You should agree with that has to be the line. Yeah I'm fucking tired of Tired of these keyboard warriors on the internet and he's fucking crazy motherfuckers all over the internet You don't even know who the fuck they are or the suicide rate for transgender people Is like fucking near 50% Okay, we have detransitures. It's not because they can't cut off their dick. Yeah, it's not because they're not happy That's correct. Yeah, like you you Cutting off their penis and giving them a vagina that they have to fucking like stretch open Bonus hole whatever bonus hole You have you is that what the fuck they call it? Okay, bonus hole. Okay, you cutting this off or or or or or So in shut a female's vagina and Making them a penis. Okay Whatever the fuck you call it Not being serious. That's not that's not keeping them from killing themselves It's probably actually when the data comes out later It probably increases the chances dramatically now they will never let us see this data But I bet if you did the studies right now because this has been going on long enough you would see That the actual suicide rate of trans people is higher post surgery and pre surgery That's my bet. It's not because of trans hate. That's my bet Now I don't know the data and even if I saw the data right now I would have to very partially scrutinize where the data came from because of how politicized everything is But my that's my gut I think it's we see all these detransiturers coming out now who are saying holy fuck and we have these people voting For this shit to happen Okay, we have a major problem in this country and it's not minor It's major With with people who want to sexualize children with people who want to Uh, you know normalize pedophilia With people who want to sympathize with violent crime Okay, we have a big problem here and it needs to be addressed and the only way it's ever going to get addresses for all of us Stand to fuck up and say no mother fucking more. It's not happening So That's where I'm at y'all free to join me But I'm gonna tell you this I ain't with none of this stuff You think I like I said on last show I have to answer for this at one point in time where I stood what I said What I believed in was I a coward or did I actually have courage and you know what I live by that And you can think whatever you wanted me you could call me whatever the fuck name you want to call me You could fucking say whatever you want you can yell at me on the you know, I don't give a shit I don't care because at the end of my life I'm gonna have to fucking say you know what I either stood for what I thought was right or I was a coward and I'm not willing to be a fucking coward This shit is wrong and y'all know it's wrong and your silence is starting to become true complicity You're enabling it now that means you're part of the problem that means no matter how big you apologize How much you say you're sorry? How much you wish you would have spoke up There's actually kids right now. They're getting their lives ruined because of your fucking silence as an individual So think about that and think long and hard about Because this is fucking fucked up I never thought we live in a and a I never thought we see a day and age Where pedophilia could even be talked about as potentially fucking normal I never thought that we would get to that point. I never thought that we would get to a point where young kids would be encouraged With one therapy session To mutilate their genitals or bro you see what's happened in other countries right now too while we're advancing the Lightning of sentences and you know normalization here what what's happening in other countries. They're doing opposite Castration yeah, I mean like like and it's not just one country like these are multiple country because this is a global movement Makes sense to me. This is going on in every country people don't understand that's not just America bro And other countries are standing up to this shit You know we here as Americans we don't want to be called names We don't want to be seen as intolerant the time for tolerance is fucking over. I don't know if you noticed It's over Okay We've peaked over that point of tolerance now we've moved into a point where you either comply with their agenda or you're a big Or you're a racist or you belong on the domestic terrorism list You're a bad person You're all right because you don't want to mutilate kids generals Or you don't want them reading about blow jobs when they're in kindergarten or you don't want grown men dresses women shaking their balls in front of their face Are you are you want to you want to say a politically correct term like minor attractive people instead of pedophiles Like bro, they're using Americans They've first of all they've conditioned to be tolerant and now they're using that conditioning to push their agenda through And so the time for tolerance It's fucking over Real talk So shit man guys join in the conversation in the comments. Let us know where you got stand on this But what that being said that was our third and final headline it is time for the final segment of the show is always Thumbs up with dumbest fuck guys. This is what we bring a headline up bring our article up Go through a talk about it. It'll get one of those two options So without being said our thumbs up for dumbest fuck headline reads Video shows mother and Cambodia saving child just seconds before home ceiling collapse Do this is wild now I know Find me huh or you always find these ones Uh, I want to get your secrets. I mean, I can't give the magic away, bro I get I find respect. I find them though.

They ask me yeah, like they'll ask me fucking here I don't come from that world, bro. I kind of like Like is this something new in the world?

Yeah, like like that shit like like When I grew up we didn't ask that shit about each other like we didn't talk about it was better too because it was like this Mysterious because you just wondered it yourself. No bro, but like nowadays.

I want my life. I don't want it to be your life. If I wanted to be your life I'd invite you to be part of my life I'm not showing you all my shit because that's my shit right you know I'm saying I get these people to come at me on social and they're like what about this? What about that? What about this? Why don't you show this why don't you show that because I don't fucking want to It's real simple Like I come from a different era. I know I'm young and handsome and fucking young looking real young looking I probably look like I'm 25, but I don't come from year-als era I like my life bro. Yeah, and I don't understand what happened to America with that like You know now now we're classifying people based on all these little things these data points and these questions and these uh, you know this information about people's personal lives You know like you said a minute ago back in the day it wasn't like that It was like dude is this guy cool or is this guy not cool? Right now? It's like what table do you get to sit at? You know and like bro look I said it the biggest mother fucking table And I don't like it you know I'm saying like I don't think it's cool. I like people for people I think we should go back to that I'm gonna say some fucking rules and some manners and some class dude It was better too because I was always like this like mysterious like around Other people because you didn't have that information it made it better. I wasn't able to judge you or have any that shit I could be like oh man, you know I bet Andy's into some weird shit. Yeah, I ain't gonna ask him. Oh, you know what I'm saying but like it created like Times is just better man dude. I did You know, I mean I wonder what Keith does when he gets home with his cats I'm not gonna ask him but I do one. That's not what I wonder. I wonder what Keith's cast with Tasteland Meow meow That's it. I quit Dude dude it it's just so weird. Yeah, it is anyway. Yeah, that's real shit man. Yeah, so Gotta thumbs up So this is this is crazy. So the Fox News article reading a dramatic video captured a mother in Cambodia saving her child just seconds before her home ceiling collapsed The incident happened in the capital city of Phnom Penh On July 3rd after a shopkeeper Pip Shrey who operates a business out of that same building I finished up the work for the day according to viral press video begins with Shrey holding a baby and standing alongside three young Children in the room a sound is heard and Shrey and two of the children start running away while screaming Shrey still clutching the baby then runs back and pulls a child who was left behind in the baby Walker to safety here is the video Oh Holy shit is right damn. I'd say this they would definitely survive in like a horror movie bro Did you see that fucking faster guy in there? They booked it bro, that's crazy. Is that what is that is that their house? You know, it's a is it their shop? It's like a home shop combo. Yeah Because it's like the drop ceiling just came detached and fell down. They probably wouldn't killed any of them But they had it there. Hold on Oh Man, I mean real talk. I don't think anybody would have got killed in that situation because that's just like super light drop ceiling bullshit But it probably wouldn't have felt great It's not like she had time to analyze the situation But I mean that that that's somebody's getting sued. Oh well for sure. Yeah for sure So the ceiling that was above her and the children then came crash into the ground we saw that so quote He would have died if the roof fell on him It was just my instinct to run away when I saw the refalling Shrey was quoted by viral press the saying Quote something made me look back and I saw him there. So I just ran over and grabbed him Now the news agency said builders who later repaired the building blamed the ceiling collapse on poor construction and recent heavy rains that we can Destructure quote there was no water proofing in the original plans for the house all of the rain has made the ceiling weaker It is because of poor construction when the builders told viral press quote people should be aware of this when they buy homes As one day it could fall down just like what happened here Yeah, I don't know about that, but I mean it is Makes sense like if they had a leak there's no water proofing on the roof. They got leaked drop ceiling got like a sponge Heavy shit fell down. I don't think this would have killed anybody This is my part. I think it's a great story. She acted. No, you should act I think the Mo'Ped probably saved them Yeah, I'm just saying never got low enough to hit the kid in the thing. All right. Like look dude. We got to tell the truth here It's a dusty off a little bit like this is a great story, but no, no, come here. You get What's her name? Gip Yeah, her name was pipped. No, oh, your name is pipped. Yeah, Pipschray. Yeah Oh, you gotta take all these cells against me forever, dude. It's gonna use to it We're giving this thumbs up. Yeah, for sure, man, but I mean You know Thanks for guys That's all I got all right. Don't be a hoe show the show Fuck a stone count it millions in the cold bad bitch. Oh, this whoa got a own bank row can't fold. That's a no-hit shot case
