What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realist's second body of the lies, the fitness and delusions of modern society and welcome to mother fucking reality guys today we have Andy and DJ cruise the mother fucking internet. Oh and by the way we have some special guests. Yeah we do. When I say special. I need to either I do bus. Yeah he returning to the show. We've got my good friend very special. Mr. JT for black rifle coffee you guys might recognize this man he's been on the show before to my ride over here we've got Mr. Dan Holloway. What's up bro. Living the dream. Yeah. He's a great Francis which was a great surprise. Yeah see he has more than expecting. Yeah this is great. Yeah so yeah we just found him walking around outside. That's pretty much how we get our guests. That's Missouri for you. He was asking people if he could lift their cars. Yeah please. For a tip. For a tip. So actually I helped some old lady we flew in this morning I helped some old lady get her bag down and she tried to tip me 20 bucks and I was getting. I like no shit she just held out 20 bucks I'm like I'm good. You're doing that crazy like that's that's where we are in the world. But you just do some meeting on your own. But it was something great. He goes you don't have to pay for us being nice around here. Yeah. So there shouldn't be a charge for that. Yeah there shouldn't. That's where we are though. We want Chicago should we rob you for 20 bucks. Yeah the old ladies are that's most of the crime is old ladies. Yeah did you guys see that clip this week of the two the girl acting like she was drunk and like like falling over and the guy came over to help him and they both stabbed him and told shit. No way. Oh yeah. That's why anytime I see somebody in trouble I hurt them worse. Just to be safe. Yeah. You know what I mean? Because I didn't see it. I can't see the video. So fucked up. Oh yeah it was crazy. Because the guy just looks like a he looks like a dad you know like he probably mowed the lawn earlier today and he like came over like oh hey. Oh wait was this a Chicago. I don't know where it was. I think I did see this. It wasn't black and white right. That was like a little bit like a camera. He just came over and was like hey yeah let's carry her to the car and then they both stood up and they stabbed him like right here. He died. I don't know. It didn't give the he's quite. They just rolled him to take a stop though. Yeah. They took his watch and take his shit. It took his shoes. They took his shoes too. Yeah. Money you're getting for your shoes. Is that like going up on Craig's foot? No that's a foot fetish thing. They just smell them. Yeah. That was it. That was it. I don't know. So what's good man? How's the show going? It's going well. I mean most of what we're doing these days is just promoting the booze company hard enough and cruising around for that. But yeah it's good. It's fun. How's booze business? It's good. It's growing faster than we can handle which is always you know you should be asking for your royalties for the AF. Oh yeah. Well we collabed on the stock car. Somebody some fan made that. Really? So fan made that and it's or no you made it. Did you make the stock car for Hard A1? It was 75% hard AF. Yeah. Did you make that or was that a some fan made it? I didn't make it. Yeah. Somebody DM'd it to us. I'm like oh this is cool. I didn't even notice that it said 75 hard. I said dad of tech. I'm like bro you're the smartest brand or I've ever seen. No. I was a complete luck. It wasn't even we didn't even make it. Somebody sent it to us. But it is good idea. We should do that. We should. I don't know if you can booze company sponsor stock cars anymore. I think so. I mean I wouldn't right now. I would sponsor now. Oh like Nitro Cross. Like you know a place a place that's broadcast on rumble. We're real freedom is right now. In the NASCAR world you know if you if you like a a tweet wrong you don't you don't get to drive anymore. Yeah. That's a crazy shit. It's stupid. He's black rifle's driver too. No way. He drove the black rifle car the last two or three years. What was it? Two or three years. It was something. It was a George Floyd one. What did it say? It was it was the it was the crab from Little Mermaid and then it had George Floyd's face under it. It's under the knee. Bro. Sorry. It's funny. I'm not the one to kill the guy. I just. Yeah. I asked for spending for shit that he was like definite on the he's still suspect. I just like him. Yeah. He's no. No fucking way. Oh yeah. Yeah man that's the state of the union right now. Bro no one he should be watching NASCAR. First of all, if we're being real, we're going to fucking open this fucking can of worms. NASCAR is the most boring shit in the world of watching. I'm a huge auto racing fan. I am too. But I don't understand. I don't understand it. I've been to the day 200 500 and I don't know. I don't understand the strategy because you could be leading for so long and then you're not leading anymore because you like like the pittings things like that. They need to do it. It's a stage or something. It doesn't make any sense. I have a 500 mile race where it's just like if you get unlucky at the end, you're fucked. I mean, it doesn't make any sense. Nobody watches that shit. I like the crowd of NASCAR. The crowd's good. Yeah. So we went to I was at the we were at the day 200 500 and this is this is will tell you about the state of NASCAR as a whole. The entire thing was about Travis, but Toronto. He's not he doesn't he's the second NASCAR race ever. It's his first time in a car. Yeah, it was just a bucket. He got 11 is 11. Well, I'm not surprised. No, he's a. He could do anything. Yeah. But it's like so the entire all the festivities, all the promotional stuff was him and then Jimmy Johnson and Jeff Gordon, neither of whom even fucking race anymore. That's the state of NASCAR right now. When they're struggling for stars, everybody went to pit. Travis stayed out. So he could he could say he led a lap of the day, two out of 500 in his life. And it was just his car for a whole lap. Did he do a didn't he do monster trucks? He's driven a monster truck. Did you guys ever sponsor a monster truck? Not yet. We want to do a monster. We do to monster. I think that's a great idea. But also, yeah, we need to introduce you to Nitro cross because Dana White's involved in Nitro cross now and rumble. And that's Travis's invention. Okay. And it's imagine taking the remote control car that you had when you were a kid. Yeah. Now you can put a human in it and they're jumping it, you know, 200 feet at a time over each other. Like it's it is the way you run this thing with a remote control outside. No, no, they're driving it. Okay. But it's like 14. Now I thought we were talking about some truly innovative shit here for a second. It's 1,200 horsepower. Well, what we'll make it even cooler is if we put a person in it and then we got to run it with that. Who are you going to get with that much trust? Hey, that's the sport. Right? You're going to get it. I was thinking, dude, look, here's my thing for for monster trucks. So Bigfoot is right down the street. I researched this. They're from St. Louis. They're right down here in Pacific. Literally 10 minutes away from us. Bigfoot hasn't driven inside Monster Jam since 1998. I guess they got in a big feud. So this is what we should do. We should somehow convince Bigfoot to partner with first form and black rifle coffee to come back out of retirement and just dominate Monster Jam. And we have the Sasquatch costume. Yeah. That is our mess. Yes. So this is a really good marriage. So like you guys at Monster Jam and Bigfoot, you need to bury your little fucking feud and let's make some history. I mean, in 1998, the people that are probably part of this feud aren't even narrowing. No, we can just get the car. Apparently it runs pretty deep. We can just read that. We can get the truck into show up. What are they going to do, stop us? Yeah. You know, I got to drive Bigfoot. I drove Bigfoot. Drive through the front. It's pretty legendary. Yeah. I got the video. Yeah. I mean, I definitely pussyed around with it, but like it won my truck. Yeah. I'm sure you did. I would have done some other shit. We're also public street. Yeah. Well, that's, you know, you own that. You own it. You're a public. You're the public. Yeah. It's true. All right. You guys know how the show works. Oh, yeah. All right. So what we do is we put up topics on the screen. We discuss the topics. We say what we think is true, what we think is bullshit. And then we talk about how we can solve some of these problems that some of these morons create for us in the world. So that's what CTI is about. We also have other forms of entertainment within the show. Sometimes we tune in. We have Q and A F. That usually airs on Monday. So you can ask questions and we answer them on the show. You can ask your questions a couple different ways. First way is guys, you can email those questions in to ask Andy at Andy for selling.com. Other times, if you want to submit a question, go on YouTube underneath the Q and A F episodes and drop your question right in the comments after you click subscribe. Sometimes you're going to have real talk. Real talk is five to 20 minutes. And we just deliver in some real talk. Some things I think that everybody needs to hear. And then other times you tune, we have 75 hard verses and 75 hard verses. Where people who have completed the 75 hard program come on the show and talk about how it changed your lives. All right. 75 hard if you don't know is available for free. I don't make money on the program. It's episode 208 on the audio feeds. Go to episode 208. You will get the entire live hard program of which 75 hard is the initial phase of for free. So go do it and stop being a piece of shit. How about that? That's a good marketing right there. Maybe 75 hard. All right. Well, we got dude. Yeah, dude, I got some good ones man. Yeah. Don't forget guys, pay the fee. Yeah, don't be a hub. Yeah, share the show. All right. Yeah, I got some good ones man. We were talking about some interesting stuff right before we got into it. But I wanted to bring about some interesting stuff we were talking about. Well we were talking about some of the crime set. They do getting stabbed, right? Maybe some new collaborations here. So that mean that, you know, that's great. But I wanted to bring this up because there's just an interesting little story. That's kind of trending out there right now. Not sure if you guys have seen this headline, but the hell on reads Connecticut doctor 32 abducted after night out at Brooklyn, Mirage is named as Michael Batista as it's revealed arm captor made him spend $6,000 on shopping spree. Now first, who ever wrote this headline? Well, this one, this one, the camera I've ever seen in my life. Yeah. What is wrong with these pieces? He's not just me reading it. Brooklyn in Brooklyn. Very clunky. Journalism is a verage is a locate. Journalism has gone way down. It's way down. It's like, I mean, it's just like TSA, right? This is also like UK journalism. Is it? Yeah, but as it's revealed arm captor made him, who like, what the hell does any of that mean? Basically this doctor got kidnapped. Well, I got that. And his kidnappers made him like they weren't so like, this actually sounds fun. Dude, it's kind of fucked up. It's kind of fucked up. I mean, if you know that the, if you know that the company, like the credit card company is going to pay for everything that happened because that's how it worked. It was a crime was committed, right? So there was, yes. My question is, is why was it only six? Yeah. Well, maybe they, maybe that's his max. Well, it's just that they, they bought it on dude. Like they, they went like on a legit shopping spree. So let's get into this. So optometrist Michael Batista is 32. Oh, you said doctor. You got a gear, man. Kidney? That was a real doctor. Dan is going to get the most optometry on the Instagram. I'll be the first to go blind. There could be the comments. We see you, Dan. Yeah, we did. Well, I'll be the first person to receive optometry related hate mail. But as a Michael Batista 32, he told cops he was threatened by Anthony Benjamin, 42. After he helped to diffuse an argument with the taxi driver on July 22nd, Benjamin is accused of forcing the cat or ex-serjun to drive around the Bronx with him overnight in a bizarre cross state kidnapping splashing out on pizza, sneakers, caps and a strip club. According to the New York Post, this is what happened. Okay. Listen, this is what happened. Michael Batista met this dude. I'm going to translate this. Yeah, sure. Michael Batista 32 optometrist. Oh, all right. Never had a good night out in this whole life. But he has a really shitty wife and a correct go back to the thing. Okay. I got to know the names. It's right. Meets. Anthony Benjamin, 42. This guy. That's right. And realizes that they are going to have a great time. They go out all night. He runs up his credit card to eat some pizza. They go to some titty clubs. And then he wanted to avoid getting a trouble. So this is the story. You're not being told his wife this story. She goes, well, you got to call it cops. He's like, five. Did you file a piece of work? Oh, yeah. Or this is like the wish dot conversion of that movie collateral. We're Tom Cruise is making Jamie Foxx driver out. Except for this time, they behave like teenagers, I guess. No, it sounds like a pretty stop. Did they not stop and play video games anywhere? What the hell? They bought sneakers. He got some hats. Yeah. He went and got a fucking haircut. He took him to his barber and made him there. The doctor says is Captain Threaten to shoot him. If you tried anything funny before taking him to his barber who then styled his hair. Who's here? Who's here? Who's here? His. This guy. No, no, no, you don't know. You don't know this. Based on the way this is written, you don't know that because there's no, there's no connection to it. Here's what it sounds like to me. It sounds like to me. These two dudes had a couple fucking drinks or smoked some drugs or something. And so we're going to go out and fucking party. And they went out and had a time with their fucking lives. And the young guy lied about it. I'm pretty poor. That's what it looks like. I just want to see these two just tearing it up in the Bronx now. Do you know how much funnier it would be if the fucking doctor had cornrows now? Oh, yeah. He, he, he, he, holy shit dude. You know that we're scenes where they were like trowing on hats. He like comes out. He's got like new sneakers and new hat on and then he goes like, no. And he goes back in and he's just trying to. 80s, and the low tops. Yeah. This motherfucker where I had time was life. Yeah. And they party. He definitely got HP. Yeah, man. I don't know. You can't listen. You don't know what to trust these days, man. I just thought this was interesting, man. I thought it was kind of fun. You don't have a good time but to shoot you in a fucking face. Yeah. Well, apparently they both were arrested. So there was actually a third guy that came into the picture. This guy. Okay. Oh, this guy, his name is, uh, where's it at? Steve daily. He's 50 years old. So he became the chauffeur for the night drove around. Are we, is this even possible? Can you just go kidnap somebody and then, and list a third party with whom you've had no interaction prior to join you and your felony? Dude. Is that possible? Listen, I don't know. But they apparently they both were arrested. So Mr. Benjamin and daily they both were. They were arrested. Um, but both were released. So they got caught coming up in September. So I can't wait for this trial. Yeah. We'll see what happens. I thought those are pretty. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's Greg Mathis, bro. That's judge, that's judge Mathis all day long. But um, yeah. So let's get into this cruise, guys. Remember, if you want to see any of these pictures, articles, links, videos, go to Andy for seller. Com you can find them there. If you're on YouTube, you can also drop down in the description below and find the articles link there as well. But with that being said, let's get into our first headline, the most pressing thing we got on the news cycle today. There's a lot of interesting updates. Um, but let's get back over to Hawaii, talk about the fires. Uh, head on to more and reads identifying Maui wildfire victims could take years with many feared to be kids. Uh, now we did, we did say that exactly what I said. Yeah, we did. We did say that two days ago. Yeah. So, uh, this is a New York Post article reading the heroing process of identifying victims of the Maui wildfire could take years according to a forensic expert who helped at ground zero with fears that children could be a large portion of the dead. Despite 111 people being confirmed dead by early Thursday, a total expected to still rise considerably. Officials have so far only publicly identified five because most were burned beyond recognition. The identification process quote, could be days if you're lucky, it could be weeks, it could be months or it could even be a few years. Dr. Robert Mann, Mr. Gentlemen here, uh, a leading forensic anthropologist, uh, heading to Maui to help. Man liken the painstaking process to his work helping to identify victims of the September 11th terrorist attack on the world trade center. Um, we've all seen the updates. Uh, Joe Biden has decided to send $700, um, to all the Maui victims. Yeah, but also, uh, gift card to Wendy's that the Wendy, uh, uh, uh, uh, fries for a year. So they're good. Chilly. Oh, and there was chili. Oh, keep on. And that's not we made that up. Okay. I mean, the fuck is that? You could believe that to be real. It's actually the product. Yeah. What are you going to believe in? $700. Yeah. Uh, and then dude, he's getting a lot of push back. We did the math the other day. It, and for the amount of money that's been sent to Ukraine, uh, it was like, what it was, I don't know, I think it was like almost $3,000 per person, per citizen in Ukraine, um, that we've sent them. Geez. Yeah. You know, that's important. I know, bro. Look, we could legitimately, we could legitimately, and I did the math. There was 13,000 families in Hawaii that were affected at a $5 million of peace monetary value. You could restore. Ever. This is for every single one of those 13,000 families. Restore every single house they lost. Restore every single belonging they had. Let's financially set them moving forward for the future because I doubt most of these people have $5 million worth of net worth, right? And we would still have spent a third of what we sent to Ukraine. You know what the weirdest part of this story is about this whole event? Well, there's, there's multiple weird things. One, the government, the power company there didn't turn the power off during this storm. That's what caused all this. That we know that now, right? You're tracking on everybody's tracking on this. Well, like the government incompetence caused this. Yeah. Some bullshit there, though, too, because the, a lot of people are like yelling at them for not turning the sirens on. And I watched the whole press conference, not just the clip that everybody who's pissed off. And by the way, everybody should be pissed off. But they explained, and I thought this, this may sense to me, that the population was, the sirens are designed for Suna Mish. Yeah, yeah. That during this phenomenon, you're, you're talked to go to higher ground. And the fires were in the higher ground. So you want people to shut into the, I'm not talking about the sirens. Yeah, I don't know what I'm saying. There's a lot of shit going around. Yeah, sure. And everybody's trying to like pile on and pile on and pile on. And you know, they're, they're sides to it. I don't want to get too conspiratorial here. Well, that's okay. But they, I was ready for it. Yeah. But I just, just track a few of things. So the government's definitely, the government, government, and confidence is responsible to the fire. That's point one. Point two is immediately the day after the governor of Hawaii is talking about how they want the government to buy that private land from people and make it public land. What? Yeah. You're going to use this tragedy to try to steal people's property from them and probably like try to leverage the him and the domain heavily resisted by those for a year, for a four decades. Yeah, forever. And then the other part of it is, I don't know if you saw this interview with this Dick, but they were talking about people requesting water to come over there for drinking and to try to put the fire out. Yeah. And the guy was like, well, you know, Hawaiians have a, you know, kind of a history of water. It's part of our culture, you know, that we don't. It should be a review. It's, it's sacred in a review. Right. Like, I'm on fire, but you mind some water, please? If you don't mind what the talking you talking about. Yeah. So this is like, you know, don't go to Hawaii, I guess. Did you guys see the video? So apparently this video came out. And this is supposed to be this Daily Mail article headline says, is this the moment Maui's killer fire started? There's a video. And apparently it's showing the moment and the fires were ignited. Let's watch this. That's why listeners on audio. There is no audio on this video. But let's take a look at this clip. You can definitely see the wind pick. Oh, there it is. Oh, yeah. And then all the cameras start glitching out. So what happened here? Like a transformer blue? They're saying that a tree knocked down a power line in the jungle, okay? We're in the brush and the forest. And that's what caused the fire. Oh, yeah, there it is. So there's massive blow of light that you guys see and happen. The camera is spinning around, painting around, resets. And then it's back on the fire and now the fire is on. Very interesting. Yeah. And then the reports, and this is from MPD and FEMA down on the ground. These are their reports. They're saying that Monday, August 7th at 10.47 pm, sensors detected a fault in the power line or in the power grid. And then the next day or technically, you know, five or six hours later, sensors on the complete opposite side of the island detected two major faults in the power grid. And then all of the fires got going. So until your point two day, and I mean, there was a lot of weird stuff that were coming out, like, you know, there was talks of this. And this is MSNBC reporting this headlines. And Maui residents say utility trucks blocked roads as they tried to flee. They're like, quote, that is our lifeline, our escape route. And you cut it off from us. Amanda Cassie said, there was no other way out. There's all the shut shit with the celebrities you guys see going on. There's apparently a lot of celebrities at own real estate on that island. How many of their properties got burned up? None. Yeah, the Obama's. None. What about the operas? Opus was fine. Jeff Bezos, his was fine. Like very, very good. So basically, the only part that was burned was the part that was actually owned by Native Hawaiians, really the refuse to sell this property to these people. No, it's interesting. Like, I mean, that's quite a coincidence, isn't it? It's fucking weird, man. But there's one final thing, right? There's a lot of coincidence is going on. Last three, last three years or so, it seems like there's just a whole bunch of them. Yeah, it's weird. But dude, have you guys seen this last little weird bit? This fucking book comes out. Okay, now you're the day out. Like, well, it came out three or four days ago, right on Amazon. It came out. So the fire started on August 9th is what they're speculating. But here's the thing. And this book comes out on August 10th, but people don't understand this part of it. It takes three to five days for your book to get posted once you try to post it on the Amazon. Weird. So for this to be published the day after the fire, that means it had to have been submitted days before. I mean, why is this a book? Wouldn't this be like a Wikipedia entry? Who the fuck is buying this book? What? I mean, who the fuck is Dr. Mille Stone? There's two. I can't find anything on the guy. Well, Dr. Miles Stone. I mean, it should be Mille Stone. Yeah, there should be. And they shall be tied to it. Yeah, that's weird. Somebody sent me that yesterday. That's what I mean. There could be an internet troll that used chat GPT to write the book as fast as he could. The second he saw the inkling of the fires to. Yeah, but it's still even bypassed the Amazon up. Yeah. Like, how do you do that? You know, click on his name. That's the thing. I mean, there's probably about 40 other books that are on there. All about weird titles, weird events, things like that. He wrote a couple of stuff I'm hunter, pro hunter biting. Yeah. I think that's probably Jared actually did that. Jared. No, man, it's just, it's interesting. Like, not to get to, you know, Q and R on all of that shit, right? But then, you know, this stuff surfaces. This is from a Q drop in January 7th of 2018. Bro, fire and fury, real talk. What do you guys think of this Q shit? Oh, it's nonsense. I think it's like, uh, uh, explain this to me that it's a catch all for anybody that's in the government to put stuff out on fortune. So I'm sure a lot of the information is probably accurate, but there's not one person doing that. Okay. But, but like, dude, there's this Q drop that says trust grassly. Okay. And then, grassly comes out what two months ago and starts doing the exact shit that's been posted on the internet for fucking three years. What do you think he's an Android or something? No, I don't know. I don't, I don't know. I only wanted to tell him. Yeah. You're gonna get inside. You're gonna have to get inside. Open up that panel. No, I'm just saying like, dude, I'm just saying that's like, have you ever heard a grassly before that Chuck Grassley? Yeah. Well, you have, but like, but more than, yeah, you shouldn't have because he's right. Well, and he's also like a non major player. Like he's a, he's a, you know, he's kind of a mix in guy with all these guys. And all of a sudden, this dude comes out in a pro Trump stance. You know what I'm saying? After Q's been saying that for fucking four years, like it's just, look, bro, that's a coincidence that like kind of made my eyes kind of like, what's going on here? You know, well, maybe we're living in a simulation. Dude, I believe that. More and more. I'm more and more. Like, I think I, I started to think that we might have you ever had Rizwan Burke on the show. He wrote the simulation hypothesis. He's an MIT guy that does, I think some of the stuff he does now is video game AI programming as well. But he wrote the book, the simulation hypothesis. It's really interesting. Dude, I've had so much shit in my life happen to me that I projected in my mind before, before it actually happened. Like my entire life pretty much, I saw my brain before it's actually materialized. And I've always wrote it off to quantum physics and metaphysics and both things. We talked about this in my house last time. Like, fuck a five hours. But like, it's just weird. It is. Yeah. Well, your brain to begin, your brain is a lot better to be in a brain than you are thinking. So it'll do things that surprise you sometimes. But that, you know, some stuff we still have no idea what's going on. I think most of the stuff, well, if you think about, so time we see it as linear, right? Yeah. It starts here and goes this way. But think about the second dimension. There's no height, right? So it's just length and width. But if you, if you were to lift somebody from the second dimension up into the third, they would then experience time in a different way. So this is all the time that's ever happened in the second dimension is one unit in the third dimension. That's how it works. So the same thing would be true from the third dimension to the fourth spatial dimension, which means everything in our dimension that's ever happened or ever will happen already exists in the fourth spatial dimension. Yeah. So technically, and that's what wormholes are kind of, you can, you would be able to access that stuff if you had the energy or the capability of doing it. So maybe your brain can just do that. Yeah. Or maybe we are really in the matrix. Yeah. You see that black cat and it glitches out and you're like, oh, shit. And like that. Yeah. Well, that was the first time you realized something. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think I'm high enough for this conversation. Why? Well, you should have pre-came, buddy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, man. So guys, jumping on this conversation, let us know what you guys think in the comment hashtag Joe knows. Well, at the very least, at the very least, I'm going to say this, these people fucking hate American citizens. And they want as much pain and as much hardship and as much struggle imposed on our citizens as possible. Yeah. If you're not a part of their class, they want to fucking crush you. I've been trying to tell people this for 10 years, the aristocracy will protect itself before it'll protect any given political party or position or person. Yeah, because we're a threat to that. We're a threat to their insulated community. All right. Good. Guys, let's get on with the show. Before we get to our next headline, we got a cruise mother fucking comments. All right. Let's do that. So this is where we cruise the comments. We go through the comments. We find one that we like or maybe disagree. Maybe troll. I don't know. We thought up here. And we get Andy's take on it. So this episode for cruise the comment. Our comment is coming from Tracy Royer, 993, posted day ago. She says, AF, you actually believe voting matters. Nope. Well, are you asking me? Are you telling me? So she seems, she seems to not think voting matters. What's it? What? I mean, let's open this up for discussion. Well, that's a very unintelligent take. And here's why. Because if you want to, I don't disagree with you that it might not matter. But if you want to prove that it doesn't matter, you have to vote. And that's the issue at hand. And all these people out here who keep claiming that voting doesn't matter and they want to sit at home and not vote, you're actually perpetuating the situation that you don't want. OK, because they want you to think this is part of the demoralization of society when it comes to communism. They want you to think that none of your actions matter and that nothing you do matters because it creates a hopeless situation where no action is ever taken and you just accept the oppression and the tyranny that comes your way. And so do I believe that it matters? I'm not sure. Here's where I think what I think. And I'd be interested to hear what you guys think, too. I believe they seem, meaning the progressive left, the Biden administration, they seem fearful of the elections. Look at what they're trying to do to Trump. Look at what they're trying to do to keep him and disrupt his campaign. That tells me that they are afraid of the election at some level. Do I think they have the ability to fudge the election by maybe 10 or 15 percent? Yeah, absolutely. I think that's what happened last time. I do not think they have the ability to completely steal the election, meaning your vote doesn't matter. And so if we vote and there's enough people that decide to vote that you overcome that 10 percent or 15 percent that they may have the ability to cheat on, that's a good thing, right? Because then we end up winning. But even if they do have the ability to steal the entire election, how do we prove it if we don't vote? And that's where I'm coming from. So I understand you guys might feel demoralized and I understand you might be frustrated and I understand you feel like your vote doesn't matter, but you also have to understand that's the plan. That's what happens in communism. That's what they do to elections. They make people think that they don't matter. And if you don't vote and they end up winning and they stole it, there will be no proof to show that. Right. So that's where my we need the numbers to show the way. Yeah, absolutely. Play the play. Play the way said that if you refuse to take part in your own governance, then you're doomed to be ruled by fools. Yeah. So this idea that you can just black pill and tune out of the process, that's fucking stupid. I think it's super responsible message to put out because I see a lot of I see a lot of patriotic people, especially in the libertarian community saying this kind of shit the same way they say, you know, we need fucking no police and no taxes and all the shins. Listen, bro, there's a there's a hypothetical and then there's reality. Okay. Yeah. I mean, maybe just take a look at the way this system of government was set up in the first place. It's something called federalism, right? The ninth and 10 amendments that the Constitution returned any power not explicitly given to the federal government back to the states. So they've been amassing power all this time. We've let it happen. And it isn't because we've not been voting either. It's because we fall asleep at the wheel. Yeah. And the solution to it is to both decentralized power and then gain power at the local level. And this is there have been a couple of examples of this concept called nullification that have happened over the last 20 or 25 years with weed and with gay marriage, right? Massachusetts in California specifically told the federal government to go fuck itself. We're going to do whatever we want because we think this is the right thing to do. And what did the federal government do? Nothing. Then do a goddamn thing, right? Because they can't. That's it. And it's because the reason we set the government up this way is because that is true. Federal power, any kind of external institutional power only exists if you believe it does. It's like tinkerbell. And once you stop believing in their power, they stop having it. Yeah. That's just so this is dumb, right? I think it is. But it's, you know, but I think there is a there is a bracket to this though of like let's look at Arizona. Fucking Katie Hobbes has just disappeared. She hasn't shown her face since supposedly winning this election. She came out to be late has been slaying her in court. They have they have proof after proof after proof after proof that not only did they fuck this up so bad, but they actually were doing very, very illegal things and what has happened. Nothing. Look, so, so yeah, I see how some people are feeling this way. No, I get that. It's like we are not. Why isn't that? Why isn't that the secretary of states number one priority right now is unfucking the election integrity. Yeah. Look, instead they're trying to go, oh, no, no, it doesn't exist. Yeah. Push. Yeah. Look, what do you guys think of my take of that? Like you, am I seeing this right way? Yeah. You'd certainly have to participate. No. I think I'm right there with you with on that. I think that the voting does matter, but I've always kind of felt like it might just be like too much conspiracy stuff, but I've always felt like it's going to happen the way they wanted to happen for whatever they're trying to push, whatever they've got going on. Because, you know, I kind of delve into the conspiracy side of that stuff. Like I think they always have some particular thing that they're trying to do each year that, all right, this is who's winning because this is what we want to do with them. That's just how I've always felt. Yeah, I can get what they like how people feel this way. Yeah. At the macro and micro level sometimes. So think about 2001 Afghanistan, right? We have a some have been locked in cornered in Toribura. He has no way out. We have fucking sorties running constantly. We have operators on the ground with so flamboyant lasers ready to light his ass up, but he manages to escape, right? Why? He dies right then and there there's not a 20 year fucking war. That's right. You know what I mean? Yeah. So it's like you can find practical examples of the shit that happened just a little nudge from time to time, just a little bit of perceived incompetence. And now all of a sudden there's 10 to 15 trillion dollars extracted out of the American population. Right. I think they showed their hand on this last election, exactly what Caleb saying. They fuck whole reason why I read that. I think they fuck up. The whole reason why I bind in is President was because they had some plan. Yeah. So no way that those people just all the sudden fall in line and go, oh yeah, Biden won the DNC. Let's go. Let's look. First of all, I agree. I agree with that. Yeah. But that can not be argued. Like people have people have already forgotten the fuckery that happened during that time. Like bro, you have a stupid shitty said like if you don't vote for me, you're not black. Here's my dude. Listen. What was the phone they were talking about? James. They줄 helped him out. He just got out of the house. This dude, this dude campaigned legitimately from a stage in like school high school gymnasium. Okay, we could say we could sit here and say, all right, he can't pay him from his basement. No, he did a campaign. He went to high school with Gix where there was like literally like 15 or 20 minutes or 20 people in circles, eight feet apart. Hands selected. Dude, hands selected or car. Syden and Jeeps. We're like they had the people come in in their cars, seen their cars because of COVID. Like is a drive-in movie. And then even afterwards, they built that fake white house set. Dude, do you remember that? Yes. He was doing all of his, what did they, he's the back door of the Oval Office. That's what that is. They built a fake one inside of a studio. And then when they shot it, they shot the peripherals. You can tell that it's fake. What the fuck are you doing? You got, listen, remember this. Like Trump, do you not remember the last 30 days leading up to the election, what Trump did? He fucking campaigned every single day out in front of a hundred thousand people. Everywhere he went, no matter where he went. Multiple states. Dude, my opinion of that move was he understood what was going on then. And he did that to show people the optics. And when you think of what you just said about the office of the president-elect, that was not, that's not an official office. That's something that made up. That's something that these people made up to appear to be credible to sell the American public on the idea that he was actually elected. Yeah. It was marketing, you know? And dude, people have forgotten about this. Like they're like, oh, I don't know. Bro, this, what he, what they did, I don't care what anybody says. You guys could say election, denier, you're fucking right. No, no, no, you look at that. You look at the final DNC debate stage. All the people that were up there where he spoke like absolute shit, by the way. Yeah. And then you tell me that after that night that there wasn't some backdoor meeting where Obama pulled everybody in under the DNC and bro, and went, all right, here's the plan, ladies and gentlemen. We're gonna elect the retot. Yeah. And we're gonna run the country. Yeah. With that, they're like, okay, I get this position. I get this position. I get this position. Yeah. Sounds good to me. All right. Go. That is what happened. And that's who's calling the plays right now. That's who's calling the plays. I don't know. It is Obama. Yeah. Yeah. When he's not writing love letters to his fucking. Yeah. Is it his make-believe gay love? Is that the weirdest way that any dude's ever tried to get laid by telling the girl you're trying to bang that you're gay? How is that? Why is that even effective? Bro, I read that. I read that and I was like, this dude's trying to appear to be so smart and so swob and so open and so. Like, bro, so. Oh yeah, I guess I would suck a dick if I had to. That's not what women want to hear. I know you've never met one. But yeah, but this, the incredulity that came with all this. Like, oh, what do you think the fucking lecture was actually rigged? Like, I'm sorry, this is four years after Hillary Clinton took money from the DNC and paid a foreign intelligence agent steal. To make, to make some shit up and then pass it off and then a list 50 plus intelligence community people to say it's real and all this other bullshit. And you know what I'm getting me? Bro, this is not a trial. Listen, what it, that's treason. Yeah, that is treason. It's getting pretty goddamn close. Yes, that is treason. Dude, those people should be rounded up, put into some like. Look, we all know what shipper. 100%. 100%. And it should be on TV and it should be monetized. And all the money, huh? Yeah, pay per view. Pay per view. And all the money should go to the child victims that these people have prayed upon for the last 50 fucking years, which they try to act like they're not doing. Throw shit, man. Well, they are definitely the plus. That was one of the things we were talking about. The plus, what is the plus? What is the plus? What is the plus? The plus means petafile. That's what the fucking means. That's what the fucking means. Yeah, that's right. Plus. Plus. They prefer map. Right, right. I can't say this shit dude. Like straight to the woodshipper dude straight up straight to it. You would think that would be the one thing that would already be happening. Like, you know, I don't, are we just like giving these like, okay, they're, they're going to normalize this. Now, is that what we're going to do? That's the, that's the old numbers. I mean, we're looking for you. Just loosen the laws up. Yeah. What do you mean? Oh, yeah, I saw that. They loosen the laws up a lot. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of it is this guy, Scott Weiner from San Francisco. He's a congressman or he's not a congressman. He's a state rep up there, a state center or one of the two. Yeah, he's a piece of shit. What's he doing? Well, he wrote that bill. He also wrote the bill that made me think that he was going to be a state center. He's a state center. He's a state center. He's a state center. Yeah, he's a state center. What's he doing? He wrote that bill. He also wrote the bill that made it, that made it, that made it, that made it. He pushed the agent consent down to 14 or something. Push the agent consent down. He also wrote a separate bill that made it not illegal to transmit HIV to somebody on purpose anymore. So you just do that now, I guess. Why is this guy in office? Well, because San Francisco is a lawless shit hole. That's why I, yeah. But they just take the gold medal in a well-rounded. Isn't it interesting? Bro, isn't it interesting too? And like if you're in California, you know what? Like when I'm about to say, I don't really give a shit. Is it interesting? The attitude that people have that are from California, like they're like they're so blessed to live in California and we're all stupid because we don't like. I had two stakes last night. Yeah. Yeah, he had a stake and then a side stake. Yeah, because I asked him why he didn't have any sides and then he pointed the stake and he goes, what the, what the, is this, yeah, that's side stake. I don't need to live in California. Like there's nothing about California that appeals to me at all. But I avoid going there. Like people try to pay me to go there, I don't go there. Yeah. It's also like ridiculous and insane. Like everything that's going on, like just a normal person will hear it and be like, what? But that can't be real. And it just constantly makes me think, okay, what is this covering up? Like what is this goofy shit that's always happening? Like what are we being distracted from my ambitions, Patrick? That's yet like it's always, but I'm like, okay, well something else is going on. I'm not going to be able to do that. Yeah, okay. Look how crazy this is over here. So silly and wild. We're doing something else way over here. I think that's definitely part of it. I also think just tearing down the collective epistemology or country is a problem, right? Like the set of facts that we all agree on. Is there one anymore? Right? Yeah. Because it used to be like tip o' neal and Ronald Reagan could sit down and look at stuff. They were on opposite sides of the political spectrum. And they were like, yeah, well, we agree that kids shouldn't get fucked probably, right? I think that's pretty simple. We can all agree on that. We can agree that men or men and women or women. We both want to make a lot of money. Yeah, well that too. Yeah, sure. But there was a list of facts that still agree on. It is. Yeah, that's all that really mattered ever. They were just pretending with the rest of it. Yeah, it's like the set of facts that we all agree on aren't there anymore. And it makes it easier for this 1984 shit to happen, right? And the last paragraph of the book it says in the end, the party would say that four or two plus two equals five and you would have to believe because of the logic of their position demanded it, right? And the logic of their position is that there is no objective true. It's all relative, right? And when truth is relative, that means the people and power, somebody with the biggest gondor, the most resources, they get to say what the truth is. And you can understand how damaging that could be to a society, right? It's no longer merit to credit it all. Well, that's just there. Oh, yeah, we're way beyond it, buddy. I think people are like, oh, dude, this is going to become like 1984. Like, what do you mean become? Yeah, we're out of the world. Do you think this thing's not listening to us talk right now? No, of course it is. Are they not giving us so much? You not get prescribed? Do you? Leotamas is a guy. That's a dude. Yeah. That's a dude. That's a dude in the pool. That is a dude. That's a dick. Yeah. Guys, let's keep this show on the road, man. Let's get another headline to get to. That's a, let's dive into headline number two. I have the number two reads. US preparing for new pandemic by searching for virus mutations. What could go wrong? It's not like, is this like the second headline in a row that I've predicted? Listen, I've only been saying this one for like two years. Nobody's going to fall for this shit, though. Well, they will some, some, no, no, they will. Because here's how they're going to do it. They're not going to do it. They're not going to do it like they just did it. They're going to release something that actually kills people. And all the people who resisted the first time are going to resist the second time and a bunch more people. And then they're going to blame the people who got those people to resist as the enemy like they tried to last time. They're going to round those people up. They're going to put them in fucking some sort of camp. Just like Trudeau saying, remember Trudeau saying, what are we going to do with these people? They're causing people to die. Like that's the beginning of that. Well, they're more than welcome to come try to put me in a camp. I understand. I would love that. As a matter of fact, you've got an APC. I love camping. Yeah, listen. I understand that that's reality for us. Yeah. But I don't think they understand that. Well, I think it should. I think it a reality for everybody. Well, think about this, bro. What better way to remove leadership from the resistance than to do the same thing again in an actual home full way? Because in the second pandemic, the exercise they ran six, seven months ago, seers, seers, the pandemic actually targeted only children. And it killed like 20 billion children. This is like children and men. Correct. So do that moving was where everybody sterile or whatever the fuck and all the kids are going to think about this. So they fucking release this and it kills all these children. Those parents aren't going to give a fuck about, you know, whether we were right the first time or whatever. They're going to be fucking enraged because their kids are dying. So what better way? You enraged the population with a virus that actually kills people's kids. Then you get those people to blame the people who stood up against the tyranny the first time. Those people get removed from society. So they remove their resistance. Then they also accomplished their depopulation goal by removing the children. It would be in line with all the other things. So think about the institutions that protect society, policing, military, masculinity, generally speaking. They've all been under attack for a couple of decades now. And there's only one reason to do something like that. Like if you're in a war with somebody, you attack their supply lines and you attack their fucking people. That's just how it works, right? So we call it battlefield preparation to do stuff like that. That means there's an invasion coming at some point. Well, there's an invasion going right now. What he's explaining now is following directly in line with the steps you take to have internal genocide happen with the community. Because the first one is division, right? You create the, then you make them, yeah, you make them, you make them divide. You classify classification. Yeah, you vilify one. Listen, dude, these people plan in my opinion and when I, well, if I were to say how certain I am about this, I would say I'm 99% certain by my standard. And you guys listen to the show, you can judge for yourself how much I missed the last three years. There's an even much. Their plan is to genocide the patriotic American me. And the way they're going to do it is they're going to release this fucking pandemic. And they're going to do what I just said. You know what they shouldn't have done first though was send tens of thousands of to war. That's how right before. Well, that's another discussion. Okay, that's another discussion that should be had. Why is it that every generation of American men. It has to participate in a war. And why do they send our most masculine most able to provide strongest most fertile healthy men to wars. It's very simple because those people if they existed in society at scale are hard to control. And you can't exercise tyranny over that population. So what do they do? They manufacture these wars to send all these people over there to die. Yeah, it's happened every single generation. That America has fucking existed. I think they made a mistake this time. And that is we fought. For the first time we fought a guerrilla war with guerrilla tactics to some degree. Yeah. So now it is very not easy, but it's it's kind of routine for people like Jared or myself to be able to teach other people how to do things as well. So it's it's forced multipliers what we call it. It's not the same as it was. It isn't like a World War II guy who just laid on the ground in Bastone and got fucking bombs blown up around him and then getting a couple gun fights. Yeah. They I think the average in World War II was they got into a shooting match every 45 days or something like that. And we and on mine we were in theater for I think total 405 days and 389 we were in contact in some way. Yeah, mortars or direct direct fire. So yeah, I think they may have fucked up on this one. Yeah. And with COVID too, they tip their hand. They should have done what you're talking about originally and that would have worked. But now that they've tipped their hand a little bit, they're going to get a lot more resistance than they thought. But to your point, maybe that was the point. Yeah. Because if it's actually deadly, I mean, right. Yeah. I mean, the point is to get people to be to rise up against it so you can, you know, wipe them out. But they're maybe there's something to do that. Oh, let's dive into this, man. So so this is actually a report that's coming out of Russia. Okay. So this is saying the United States has begun preparing for a new pandemic by searching for virus mutations in general. Igor Krillivov. Kierlov. Exactly. Close enough. He's the head of the radiation, chemical and biological defense troops of the Russian armed forces. He said on Wednesday. And he said, The priority areas of this department include work on the creation of vaccines and drugs for stopping viruses and their genetically modified variants as well as the introduction of advanced technologies and bio production. Thus, the United States, as it was in 2019, began preparing for a new pandemic by implementing search for virus mutations. Krilliv to reporters. The article continues this report from Russia saying the US can also use its so-called defensive biological technologies for offensive purposes, as well as for the purposes of global management by creating crises situations of a biological nature, the official added the US Army Research Institute of infectious diseases is going to play a leading role in the Pentagon's biological warfare program. The Institute was established for detrick on the basis of a bio weapons development facility and is an important part of the global biological control system documents uncovered during the special operation in Ukraine have confirmed that this institution is involved in collecting dangerous pathogens in various regions of the world. And it's very, very interesting. So again, that was Wednesday, August 16th, when this comes out. And then this headline comes out, Newkovid variant, BA.6 is probably already in the US experts warned, and it calls for masks to return. There's not going to be a COVID variant that is a problem for us. No, this is a test. This is a probe. This is a probe of a test. See how many people will go back to mask based off of what the psychological operation was last. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. By the way, the Ford detrick thing is true. It's also where the Ames and Thracs that made its way to the capital from 2001 came from. Yeah. Right. So that's interesting. Yeah. I guess people don't remember that story. The big anthrax girth of 2020. I mean, I'm 2001. Yeah. We did a story about it. Actually, it'll be out today. Well, we'll never record in this. Yeah. So R.F.K. was talking about it on Tucker Carlson show the other day. Now, he made some claims about Tom Dashel and Patrick Leahy and all this stuff about how they were specifically targeted to get the Patriot Act through. That's nonsense. What he said is absolutely and demonstrably untrue there because Tom Dashel wrote the fucking original Patriot Act first. And then Patrick Leahy voted for it all three times, including the three worst parts of it. So that's nonsense. But the Ames and Thracs coming from for detract 100% true. And then the guy who they tried to charge with it, the biologist that was working at that place who killed himself. Maybe, right? Who knows if he killed himself. They were about to charge him pro public and he in PR in a couple of their organizations did an investigation into it and found that there's no fucking like everything the government said about it was untrue. So the agency, the CIA and the US military are some combination of the two 100% were responsible for setting that act and Thracs to Congress. And the idea that they may have done it to push through the Patriot Act, I can believe that. It's just the part about those two policies. It was like when you said many ago, it's that extra push. Yeah. Just a little nudge from time to time to get people afraid. Yeah, this stuff here though, the COVID is not the threat. Here's how I see this is that this is a probe to see a test balloon. People will jump in panic and go put mask on again. And they're not going to you. So they're good. That means you have either answer. Okay, cool. They're not going to do it to escalate. Yeah, that would be the. It's weird, man. Do you guys follow Klan Best down on Twitter? On X. This dude, you can follow him guys at war Klan Best down. Has a pretty decent following on Twitter. And he posts them really, really, really good stuff. But he posted this earlier today. He says, quote, I feel like I'm in the twilight zone. Russia just publicly accused deep state actors and big former of manufacturing the COVID pandemic to take over the world. They even listed Obama, Clinton, Biden and Soros of being the main audiologist behind the plot. This is the biggest story in human history. And yet it is somehow remaining largely unnoticed. And then this is the diagram that Russia released. And it's like basically a flow chart that's showing. You mean you're showing everything we talked about for the last three years? Pretty much. Okay. Yeah, this is basically the. I'm lapses of real. Yeah. So if you want to review the last three years of this show, just look at this chart. If you're if you feel some level of. And you can see that the government, the US government would test bio weapons or use bio weapons on its own people. Just go Google the Tuskegee experience. Exactly. See how they gave dudes fucking aides or whatever the fuck. Yeah. I think it happened in our parents lifetime. Bro, you talk. Listen, dude, it's not just that. What's allowing this to happen over and over and over again. American citizens have the they hold, which is it, which is something they should hold. But they continue to hold on to the belief that these people are actually acting in their best interest. It's like a it's like a psychologically like battered manipulated woman, right? Like she. Oh, he hit me, but I deserved it. Yeah, right. Read. He really loves me. Right. We have a psychologically abused citizenship that has been completely fucked with for years now. It's Stockholm syndrome. Bro, yeah, a mask. Yes. Yeah, 100%. Well, you know, dude, put like think about what they've done to us in terms of, you know, we're old enough to have like lived before a lot of this. But the fact that she's been going on, the amount of division and the amount of hate and the amount of pain in the amount of anxiety and stress that the media and these politicians put on our society is that's not what America ever has been or what is supposed to be. Now we have people who legitimately still believe probably because of mass Stockholm syndrome that these people actually care about us and it's just a coincidence that they're doing all of these bad things that are hurting us right now. And what time do people wake up and say, dude, these people fucking hate us. Here's the best part about what you just said, though Andy, is like, you know, you talk about domestic violence victims, right? And if you guys ever see that show snapped, right? Yeah, well, eventually, yeah. That I mean, that's the best part about it, right? And until your point, that's exactly why the battered way the fence, yeah, the batter, a batter woman's defense, like that's an actual legal defense. Yeah. You know, because those victims at one point after all the years of abuse and psychological abuse, they fucking snap and they end up killing their fucking abusers. And it's a legal defense now. So I mean, can we get to that part? Yeah, I mean, it'd be nice. We know. If you if you haven't before, you should read iceberg slims first book. It's called Pimp. And then there's some subtitle, but it's about how he, it's he was a Pimp, right? And it's about how he fucking convinced women to be part of his stable. Dave Sheppell's told the story on stage before, but basically he would whip him with an extension cord and then leave him in the bathroom for a couple of hours bleeding and then come back in with some water and pills and be like, hey, I'm going to take Harry on. Right? And that's the relationship we're in with our government at this point. Yeah. But people need to understand, United States is not the fucking government. It is the people. That's right. You know what I mean? And this is this is why it's always a call to action anytime you see some fucked up shit. See something say something. No, see something fucking do something. Yeah. Get off your ass and do something. Be a citizen of this country. GK's Chester's in used to say that men didn't love Rome because she was great. Rome was great because it meant love der. Right? So if you love this country enough to say that shit and where that flag and do all this stuff and enjoy the institutions that we have and stuff like that, you better God damn get off your ass and do something. Yeah. And I just wait around for someone else to do. Yeah. You have a you have a good take on what it means to be a citizen that you talk about a lot. You and I have talked a lot about it. We talked about it on your show. We talked about it, you know, when we're just hanging out. Talk about that for just a second. Because I think people need to hear it. Yeah. People will say something like somebody's got to do something. Well, you're somebody who you waiting for. You know what I mean? So the premise of the and it's the premise of my show of citizen, you can either sit around a bitch of moan about your rights and your plight, your circumstances and wait for somebody to secure your rights for you and that person, that group or whatever it is, they will be your ruler, right? You will be a subject under their rule or you can perform the responsibilities required of you to earn your citizenship. And then you will come to the citizen, right? And that is the ultimate inoculation to tyrannical bullshit. And it's the only thing that works. Earning your citizenship. That's right. Now, how does the average person earn their citizenship? Well, you know, sometimes just saying no, collectively saying no, remember the government are the disinformation governance board. Remember that name? The janko witts? Yep. Yeah. They're very poppins from throughout. Yeah. For about a week and a half, the Biden administration tried to install an agency inside of DHS that would be the thought police, especially. And everybody in America was like, nope. Yeah. And that's all it took. Yeah. That's all it took. Yeah. Mass non-compliance. Yeah. Mass non-compliance is the most important thing you could do. Yeah. I think also personal excellence is in there as well. Sure. Yeah. Because what we talked about, it's also a rebellion. That's right. It is because if you're trying to create a society of client-compliant people, the best way to rebel against that is to be non-compliant through the way you live. You know, if they want you to be unhealthy, you become healthy. If they want you stupid, you become smart. If they want you poor, you become rich. If they want you to consume their fake food, consume real food. If they want you to stream all day and watch all their shit, how about you read some books? Like these are things that actually take their power away because they built this huge power matrix that basically keeps people dependent through convenience. And you're on the tip. That's right. That's easy to be. It's easy to do that. It's easy to order. It is. If you look at things like like in your average citizen's influence, that's like that what's kind of Walmart has done. Having haven't Walmart where it's one stop shop. Like your average person goes to work, goes to one place to get all their shopping done and maybe goes to their favorite bar. So their sphere of influence is very small. I think that was by design. Yeah. Like I think that that was that was well, now they're even actually trying to accelerate that by creating this situation with electric vehicles and limiting travel and all these things. They're going to be able to flip to switch. Correct. Oh my god. But this is where they got caught with their their pants down was with social media because it's all the sets. That sphere. Correct. That sphere that they were creating. That's how I see it to got fucking disrupts that disrupted. And now they're like, Oh god, what do we do? What do we do? What do we do? That's how I see it to they would have been able to pull this off had the internet existed. But what do you do with that now as a citizen or an aspiring citizen? What do you do with that information? Right? Like if you want to take action, if you're if you're three years into this shit now, if you still trust the government that I'm not talking to you because you're you're fucking lost. Yeah. Hopelessly just go the fuck away. You're not coming back. You're not coming back. Your mind is hopelessly broke. Right. But if you can if you don't trust the government now and you shouldn't because why the fuck would you? There's only one way to really defeat a government like what wars and all that stuff. Sure, but we're not looking for that shit. The best way to defeat an intrusive government is to solve problems locally before they can get there and fuck it up. Yeah. Right? Box those assholes out when they show up and there are no hands out, the government has no fucking power. No, it's a true cultural revolution. It's a it's a fucking protection racket. Yeah. That's all it is. Dude, if you live at a higher standard where none of this shit flies with you or your friends or your family or your neighbors, how do they how can they can't do any? I don't need your fucking welfare. I don't need your hills, bitch. Get the fuck out. Well, remember remember when Obama first got elected and he was running on that free cell phone sheet. Yeah. Okay. And remember how remember the attitude of most of society like people a lot of people listening are younger. So they don't remember. But most of society was like fuck you. We're not taking your free fucking cell phone. Yeah. Well, I mean, the smart people are like, what is this government listening to my? Yeah. Right. Well, yeah. But you know, there was a there was a natural resistance to that. Like fuck you. I'm not taking your free shit. And it feels like since then we a lot of people have started to adopt this. Well, I'll just take what I can get because they're giving it. And like, well, you don't understand is whatever they give you comes with. There's a trade off. Yeah, it comes with something and you should ask yourself what that is. What are you giving up? There's a price to pay. Yeah. Because another thing they could do, dude, that I think about, you know, I think there's three options that they could pull on us. And they are going to like when you think about what they face. And when I say they, I mean, the people that Russia just named, what those people face in terms of accountability for what they've done is ultimate accountability, which is death. Death. Yeah. So, so like they're not facing a five year prison sentence, these people are facing death. And if you're facing death and you're in power, what would you be willing to do to make sure that you stay in power? And the answer for every single human being on the planet is anything. Yeah. All right. So we're dealing with that. That's what we're dealing with. And that allows them, in my opinion, from a strategic viewpoint, there's three options that they are going to do. Okay. Maybe four. One, they're going to disrupt Trump's campaign, which shows me that they're afraid of the election. All right. They wouldn't do that if the election was completely rigged. All right. Like people like to say, there's has to be some truth to which is why your vote matters. Two, they could start a nuclear war. All right. Three, they could release this pandemic that Russia's talking about, which that's an option. Four, if they stretch this out long enough, they could convert every single person over to digital currency and say your paper currency doesn't matter anymore. And then they could fucking blame this infrastructure attack that would cut out all the power and on AI. So there's no country to blame. There's no person to blame. AI got out of control and they shut down the power grid. Oh, yeah. Right after we turn all your money onto the power grid. Now imagine what that would do to society. Imagine if all of your money went into this, you know, one and zero system, which most of our money is anyway right now. 93% of and they just turn the fucking power off and blamed it on a faceless, nameless enemy called AI. And then they come back in after amount of time and they say, Oh, we got to fix, but guess what? We're going to have a new system now. And the new system is going to work like this. And it's going to be everything that Cloud Schwab talks about and these psychopaths over in the world economic forum talk about it. Either way, all of those scenarios lead to that. That's right. And that and and I in my opinion, it's going to be one of those four things or a combination. Well, there's only one way to really at the personal level make yourself insulated from that kind of bullshit. And that is to be resource resilient, right? So money doesn't matter. It's what money buys that matters. Yeah. Food, shelter, water, whatever, right? That's the only thing that matters. So you need to find a way like you're not going to be able to fight some of this stuff by yourself. At some point, there will be some kind of social or or vinyl conflict that I imagine. I mean, it looks like a tent in that way, but you personally, you need to figure out what if the power goes out today, how does your family eat for the next month? So do you have an answer to that question? Because if you don't, you're fucked. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. And they also you shall also understand there's people that say, well, all those other people got food. Yeah. Well, there's also a bunch of people on our side of the fence that are like, I'll just go to fucking Walmart. Like you, oh, you're the only one that had that idea, but no, I'm saying, you know, the people who propagated this and who allowed it to happen and who rooted for it, I'm going to their house. Oh, yeah. That's where I'm going. I mean, it's going to be like taking their shit. It's going to be a list. Don't we? It'll be a list. It'll be. You know the fuck with me. You're on the list of shit. Like James, I'm James out of the Bob strike. I'm coming to take a shit. Yeah. But it's like silly and murphy and in the dark night rises where he's holding court, throwing people out into the ice. Yeah. I mean, and look, to be honest, I look, I look at that the same way I would look at surgery to get a tumor removed. Like it's not the best thing, but it's better than the alternative, right? And it's not always a bad thing to cut some cancer out. Yeah. Well, stay tuned. We'll see. Guys, let's get this show on. How'd you shit? Say, how'd you shit? Yeah, you better. How'd you shit? You know, it's also delusional thinking. Like I was talking to honey. My buddy, honey, Rambo, we were talking about this stuff on the phone one day. He's like, yeah, man, he's like, my name, he just moved from San Francisco to Dallas. Because of obvious reasons, right? And it's impossible to run a business there. Like impossible. Like these people don't want to work. And when they do want to work, they want to make so much money that the business cannot operate. He said he was a California. He had like had a guy up the street was like, hey, man, like check this out. I'm getting prepped, right? And so his neighbor pulls him into his house. And he's got like, you know, big water supplies and prep food and all this shit. Well, first of all, honey, he's like, why the fuck are you showing me this shit? Why are you showing people? It's second of all, where are your guns? He's like, oh, I don't believe in you. You don't believe in supplies. Like these people don't understand what happens. Like you, people put a bullet in you that costs nothing and they take your shit. Like I don't believe in guns. Yeah. Living in a country that exists because of guns. Yeah. And the reason all the reasons every country exists because of guns, the only reason it still exists is because of guns. Yeah, that's it's never been occupied is because the citizens. It's fucking occupied right now. That's right. There's never been a mass gun confiscation in the history of human beings or weapon and general, not just guns, but edged weapons and shit that didn't come before some kind of authoritarian takeover. Yeah. I mean, it's obvious. Why the fuck would you ever allow that? You wouldn't. Who is this? Who do you guys need? You need fully automatic web? Is this the shoot? Where do you think the deer is out there in Kivlar Vess? The fuck out of here, dude. Uh, yeah, I just wanted to shoot 40 of them. No, not only that. Uh, like I just want to stop those people every time they say that and be like, the two A is not for hunting. Yeah. It's never been for hunting. It's been for hunting people. That's what the fuck it's for. And like, it's funny to see these two A people on the internet make these arguments as if it's about anything other than just making sure that people don't fuck with you. The Bill of Rights was specifically written to limit the power of the government. So why would we add something and about guns if it wasn't directed to why are these two A people so so like hesitant to say what it's really for? Like what the fuck, dude? Manufacturer consent. That's what it is. It's a it's a, uh, uh, and principle from the 80s. And basically it's what's been happening in the last couple of years, right? You use different types of pressure, um, uh, chaos and then social pressure. And the what where you're ultimately looking for a self-censorship, that way you don't have to even do anything. Well, that's why that's why political correctness exists in the first place. They started that 25 years ago where you couldn't say anything because it was offensive. And now people won't say anything. Yeah. And now it's it's pervasive in the corporate culture now with us. Yeah. That's how they're pushing it down. Yeah. It's like it's it's it's become pervasive in the non publicly traded stuff, but publicly traded companies, especially with the ESG scores. It affects the interest rates you can get all sorts of stuff. So this is why this is why it's so important that small business owners who actually employ far more of the population than these big businesses stop adopting their culture from these big businesses. Like a lot of these small businesses will like do the things the big businesses do because they think that's what you do when you're a big business. Yeah. And they push this shit down on their employees and they're contributing to the stuff that they hate that they have to deal with in their own company by even doing it. You know, you're free to say, Hey, guess what? This is fucking America. I'm going to run my country. I'm going to run my company like that. Like cultures control by the entrepreneurs and they're not understanding that, you know, you got all these business owners who are forcing their employees to do all this woke shit that they don't even believe it. Yeah. That's what's causing it. It's what they're doing is really smart. Like when I say they the the world economic forum matrix. But even if the CDC like they were the internal memos from the CDC were telling people like, I don't know if you should actually be taking this vaccine yet. Right. Like that that was a conversation that was happening inside this CDC. But they were trying to force everybody else to do that. Yeah. And threatening them with fines and I was a style. Well, they threatened us with a $700,000 per employee fine. For what? There's 450 employees, 500 employees in this building. We're not getting them to vaccine. I'm like, fuck it, dude. I'm gonna shit. Yeah. Whatever you're gonna do. Let me keep this your veil. Yeah. I put that shit in a trust. Fuck you. Guys, let's let's bring this show to a close. We got a third and final headline headline number three. And that number three reads exclusive Georgia State Senator takes first steps to impeach Trump's Fulton County prosecutor. Got some movement here. Now that was a lot of weird stuff that's happening with this. So let's dive into this a little bit. This is a bright bar article reading. Georgia State Senator Colton Moore, and probably can took the first step on Thursday towards impeaching Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis for her actions against former president Donald Trump, a memo exclusively obtained by bright bar news shows. In a letter to Governor Brian Kemp, more announced an initiative to begin an emergency session to conduct a thorough investigation into the actions undertaken by Willis. On Tuesday, a Georgia grand jury and died at Trump on 13 counts. The lawmakers investigation could lead to the funding Willis's investigation of Trump and or ultimately impeaching the district attorney. Quote, we must strip all funding and if appropriate, impeach Fannie Willis. Willis, more said in the statement, quote, as a Georgia State Senator, I am officially calling for an emergency session to review the actions of Fannie Willis. He said, quote, America is under attack. I'm not going to sit back and watch as radical left prosecutors weaponize their elected offices to politically target their opponents. And as we all know, Trump's now facing 91 felony counts. But the most recent batch is different. This was a political article. And there's a lot of weird stuff that's going on. There was stuff about the indictments being leaked before they actually came out. And of course, the left's quick to hop on that and try to fix that like this AP news article reads, no, Georgia officials didn't air in releasing Trump indictment with grand jurors names. So the claim that officials in Fulton County, Georgia forgot to redact the names of the grand jurors who indicted former president Donald Trump this week in relation to his actions following the 2020 election. AP's assessment was false. It is standard that indictments in Georgia include the names of the grand jurors. And part because it provides defendants the opportunity to challenge the composition of the grand jury legal experts told the Associated Press. Now, problem with this is, is that one, there's no law that says they have to actually include the name. So I'm still led to believe that that was either intentional or these people are just idiots. But here's what the AP left out is that they did leak the indictments well before it was actually an official indictment. All right. And MSNBC, they actually covered it. Georgia clerk says, Ms. Hap calls erroneous release of list of Trump charges. And they go into it. It says, the clerk of the Fulton County Georgia court system acknowledged Tuesday accidentally releasing what appeared to be a list of criminal charges against Donald Trump before he was actually indicted and sought to deflect blame amid mounting criticism from Republicans who have seized on the blunder to characterize the cases rigged. After refusing to explain what happened for more than a day after orders posted the document, the media outlet said was published on the court's website. Clerk Shay Alexander's office said she was doing a quote unquote trial run of the court's filing system on Monday, quote an anticipation of issues that arise when entering a potentially large indictment. Wink, wink bullshit. Yeah, right. And all of this is all of this is going on with Trump stuff. I don't know if you guys saw the stuff come out about Joe Biden's pseudonym that he's been using for these email communications. This is how he reads then VP Joe Biden, you pseudonym and emails with Hunter regarding Ukraine dealings Republicans accelerate Biden family corruption probe and demand national archives records. There's a lot going on here. God's what we've got. What was the pseudonym? The pseudonym was like Peter Roberts. Yes, I'm sure we're gonna pull it up once I'm creative. So just made some shit up. I mean, I saw a poll this morning that was on one of the left or the progressive MSM channels that show that 83% of people, Republican and Democrat think that what's going on with Donald Trump is wrong. Yeah, they don't think he did anything. That's why I mean, that's that's something that we should bring up first. Number one, if I live in the state of Georgia, I would be furious that any money was spent on this. Like, who is giving a shit about Fulton County, Georgia, and what they think of Donald Trump three years after this thing happened? Yeah, if this was so unfortunate, the date that they did you see the date for the actual start of the trial, the trial of preliminary hearing is the day before the primary primary. So they're doing this all on purpose. Like so it's like, so that's the thing. If I live in Georgia and I pay Georgia taxes, this DA needs to be ousted. She needs to be footed the bill for every dime that she's spent on. These people are criminals, bro. Like these people are conspiring against our country in a real way. Like this is like, look at her up there smiling. She's smiling. She thinks she's getting an adaboy from all the headwings. She ain't going to be getting an adaboy when someone sticks her fucking head and a guillotine. Like, because that's what's going to happen. That's what happens, man. And I mean, here's another interesting thing too. Listen to that is what's going to happen. Like I'm this is you guys may think that sounds extreme. Remember, we are on the way down still, and it's going to get way worse and way harder and way harder on you and your family. And when people finally realize the level and depth of what's been going on, there's going to be accountability and who participated in this crimes are going to be handed the ultimate accountability. That's why they continue to go. Yeah. Well, then do like the weird thing is too, man. There's been a lot of headlines like when I was putting this together. They're already trying to talk about like, well, yeah, Trump can still get elected, but he can't pardon himself. Like they're already trying to build up the defense on the back end. And what is interesting is that their defense is that if Trump becomes president again, that he can pardon himself from all of these indictments going on. The problem is that in the state of Georgia, they did not escalate these to the federal level. They're still on the state level, which means Trump cannot pardon himself from state crimes. You know what Trump could do. But the governor is the governor could. Yeah, he can tell the suckers dick. Yeah, you know what Trump could do. Trump could actually do the exact same thing that they're doing to him, which he's already come out publicly and said he would do. He said he would do. Yeah. And he said this federal charge. Correct. And arresting people and put these people in jail or worse. Let's kick Georgia out. I mean, you did that. You're a fucking man. Well, in reality, in reality, guys, they chat rides down there and George, yeah, I like chat. I'm a braze fan too. They're good. They're good. They're the best. But he can shut off federal funding for a little bit until they clean up their house. Well, this is a the other. I think the main part about this particular case that's going to make it not be what they think it is is that they're trying it as a Rico case, right? Yeah. Rico is was created for the mob, right? But it's it's you have to be able to prove that the organization was specifically set up to commit crimes as a group. And she's just tied a bunch of random people that run this team. It's not what Rico is. It's like Alvin Alvin Bragg and fucking New York. Oh, what they're doing is Rico actually. Technically, yeah, but like what Alvin Bragg is doing up there, he's trying to amplify or elevate or get an escalator on the case because if you forged though, if you quote, quote, forged those documents, which is not really what happened anyways, but let's say it did if you forged those documents, that's a fine. That's it. The only the it doesn't become a crime until it's in the to cover up a secondary crime, right? And that's it, which the crime that he's alleging that it's covering up is outside of his jurisdiction, which means he won't be able to charge this like he wants to. And then this when they go to trial for this Rico case, you have to establish past present and future crimes. You have to establish past crimes that have happened, present crimes that are in the process of happening and in future crimes that are planned conspiracy. You have to do all three of those Rico predicates to get a conviction on Rico. None of that exists here. They just put 19 people and fucking a thousand charges in there. Yeah, but that's not what it is. It's like, no, this is this is these are the George Soros D.A.'s. So he spent $2 billion on something like 270 judge and D.A. races across the country over the last five years. And this is these are Alvin Bragg is one of them. He got he got $2 million from that. This is one she's won. They're all over the fun. We had Kim Kim Gardner here in St. Louis. Yeah, we saw all the shit that went with just dumb as fuck, dude. Yeah. You guys have some of the dumbest politicians that exist. Cory Bush. No, if she graduated fucking high school. No. Why don't know she did it. She did it. I mean, she may have been a lunch lady at the high school. I'm right. She was she started. You know how she became who? No. So she was active in the 2014 my brown riots as a community organizer and then also during the George Floyd shit. Right. And she like still pushes like still to this day pushes for defouting the police when her own people and her own communities are getting burnt to the ground. And she's because of their lack of police security. She's using their money to paper private. Yes. Like bro, this while is that she listen. She does not care to fucks about the people that she represents. You know, that's very clear because what's happened since she's come into power? What has she done? Nothing. Nothing. She continues to champion the same exact policies that have created the issue that the inner cities of St. Louis are dealing with. I invited her to be on the show. Yeah. I'm sure that was to decline. Yeah. Yeah. politely declined. Well, that's what you can't you can't have a conversation when you have an IQ 60. No, I do. I thought I did a pretty I'm like, it'll be a safe space. You know, and psych. I think I got to mention. Go back go back to that AP thing, by the way, because I want to I want to explain which one the one the AP fact check thing I want to explain exactly what's happening here. So go to the next one. There you go. You see how it says that nobody the claim isn't that they forgot to redact the names of the grand jury. The claim is that they leak the fucking indictment. That's what they left that's what they left that. This is the fact check to make it a peep. That's why I'm doing this all over social media. This is called the Texas sharpshooter logical fallacy. It's a literary fallacy, right? Like an argumentative fallacy. And it is a Texas sharpshooter. You shoot the barn and then you move the target to where the fucking shot went through and say, oh, I hit it. That's not what this is. They just made they created a false dilemma here. It's nonsense. Yeah. Most of these people are falling for this stuff though. This is what's happening on social media fact checks as well. We see people will post a meme. I posted this meme by Georgia Orwell got fact check. This is back in July. And the quote was like, I don't know, it was one of his many quotes, right? And their fact check was that they put the quote in there except there was two words out of order. So they fact check and dig my stuff. This does not say this. Correct. Yeah. They're answering a question that nobody fucking they're doing. They're doing what fucking progressive liberals do, which is deflect and then turn around and try to talk technical language. And then, you know, they're censoring people's entire platforms for these. Well, and then dude, that speaks to the intelligence of society because here's the problem is that the majority of people just like these headlines, that's why we do this shows because majority of people don't repast the headlines. Just like the majority of people won't repast the fact check. They see the more notification it takes. Talk is seven seconds. Yeah. Yeah. Like they won't read. They're not like most people not going to click on the fact check to see what's actually been checked as fact. Right? Like they just see that little note. Oh, okay. Well, and then they do that because when you get fact check, it reduces the amount of traffic. Yeah. It takes you out the algorithm. Yeah. So absolutely, man. I want to actually got the question real quick on this Trump stuff. Right? So I'm to the belief that we obviously see this as a two tier justice system. Right? It's setting a very, very dangerous political precedence. Right? I'm to the belief that I feel like Trump should just say, fuck all of these DAs, fuck all of like forget all of this stuff and not comply with any of it. I told him that he just come to my house and hang out and when somebody shows up and try to grab him, we'll deal with it. I mean, like, like, I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah. Real shit. Like, like, I mean, because what message like, okay, yes, we know the stuff that like why like to me, I feel like you're still well, I think playing into the game, I think there's there's actually multiple points to that argument because a lot of that of what you're talking about, you know, there's there's multiple ways you can look at that. Okay, Trump, Trump understands that the more they do this, the bigger his approval rating is going. Who else they look? Yeah. Like dude, he's Thanos at this point. He's getting the more, the more they throw at him, he's absorbing it and it's going to come back out in a real serious way. You have to look at the body suit. Like, is that is that is that how it works? I never saw that movie. Only you would know. I think you. He was nervous the last time. But I think the the aspect that you're kind of missing there is this could be attacked too. Is they hit him with a bunch of erroneous shit. If he blows it off, then he actually does break a law. Then they have something that can stay. There's also a third possibility. Okay, the third possibility is and this is a legitimate complaint. And I believe there's legitimacy to this. And you know, people in the Trump, I'm friends with a lot of people in the Trump campaign and community and they get mad at me when I say this. But why didn't he arrest Hillary Clinton when he was in office the first that he would? He said he would. Why didn't he clean up this corruption? And so there's part of me that legitimately wonders is this dude a part of this? And is he walking us into this? Playing the role of the hero when in reality, nothing's changing and nothing's being done. And I can understand and have empathy and respect for the fact that the media, how they attack them, how they treat it them, plus there's something that we may not have been able to know. Look, I also can lend respect to the fact that way more people understand what's going on now than did that. So like had he done that shit then, it might not have been received the way that it would be received now. They would have seemed authoritarian and correct. Now it's going to be seen as cleaning, literally cleaning up the government. So, but like dude, real talk, like he doesn't do himself favors by the way that he has complied. And so I see your point with that. And I actually, you know, wonder, like I have a hard time seeing how this is going to play out. Like what? Like okay, because like dude, they're not going to stop. No, it's 91. Listen, motherfucker, these people are going to put his ass in jail if they can. Do you see the thing that like it's going to come down to the people stopping? That's what I'm saying. And like they put out this this other headline, like it's like it tallied up all like he's like there's like seven. He's faced like 700 something fucking years. Yeah, no, no, no, there's death for some of the charges. Yeah, so it's like it's like okay, so what you know, how many more are you going to allow to keep happening, right? Because the message is like and we've stepped state firm on this on the show multiple times, but it's like the what the only thing that's like holding up the law for law-abiding citizens is us thinking that is still being held up. When we have our cities that are burning to the ground, businesses being looted robbed on a daily basis, the only people who still believe in law and accountability are the law-abiding citizens at this point, right? So like, bro, like that that facade of law being you know being being held accountable like once that erodes it's over, right? Like that's going to be the green light and it's like he has, I mean you're going to see more and more vigilanteism. One thousand. It's already showing. Yeah, it's already showing. Dude, and so, and but look at how the vigilante is being treated right now like this marine Perry or whatever his name is in New York. Penny. Penny. Penny. That's yeah. And then the Sikh, they tried to charge these Sikh dudes for me. Yeah, but as far as the trials go, there's some of them that I think he should just like the one in New York, he should just tell they got to go fuck himself and not show up. Frank, that's what I would do. But the ones this Rico one, the the and the one for the J6 charges, especially he needs to stay in because now he has the ability to fucking subpoena everything. Yes, and and the discovery discovery is going to be wild as hell. And I think it's going to you know, bro, but they talk about that in the fucking Q shit. Yeah. So it's like that's what I'm talking about. Like what the fuck? Well, it's a full circle about it on on TV too. Yeah. I mean, it's it's like the the Capitol police chief last week is talking about how look we asked for a fucking peep. We asked for the National Guard and they said no, we wanted them to come down here and they said no, why would you say no to that? Yeah, do you know that the do you know who the guest was on Tucker Carlson the day the schedule to be on a show the day before or the day after he got fired? That dude. Yeah, there you go. Well, he was just on Tucker now. Yeah, a lot more people saw it. I think 40 million people have seen that on Twitter now. Yeah, a lot. But yeah, that's that's the kind of stuff like for those specific trials, I can't wait. No, because I've seen some of it. Yeah, I mean, no, it looks like it's good. If that works out, the look, man, I just my take on it is, you know, they they probably know a lot of shit. We don't know. All right, like I'm sure Donald Trump and his team and the people not now I'm not talking about his country club team that think they're on the team. I'm talking about his two or three trusted people on the inside. They fucking know what's going on. Okay, and there's a reason he Donald Trump is a strategist. He understands exactly what the fuck he's doing. I guarantee it. But you don't become Donald Trump in America and it's successful as he has been and everything that he's done without being good at strategy, the guy smart. And the fact that he's continuing to go along with it tells me he knows some shit that we don't know. I feel like he's because otherwise if this was really just happening at surface level, like and it was you or me and that was I'd be telling the people what to do. I'd be directing them from those little videos. I'd be saying this is what we got to do. We got to do this. We got to do that. We got to do this. And that lack of direction tells me that he knows something that we don't know. And what is that? There's a reason. Yeah, otherwise and that's where I have my doubts about the whole situation because I'm like, dude, if you're a real leader of the people, you know, people are hurting right now. No, people are paying, you know, ridiculous amounts more to live right now. People like, there's things happening in the world that are irreversible once they're done. Like this migration crisis or the implementation of AI. A lot of people say, oh, AI, I'll never do. Do you serious? Are you serious right now? Like they could easily combine AI with robotics and replace all of us peasants and probably we'll probably less than five years away from that. What are burgers doing that right now? They have a completely automated what a burger that's opening up and that's better because one of us has two stores in Texas already. There are no employees. Yeah, but like dude, and then we well, because I hear this from the blue collar guys, well, they can't take blue collar jobs. Not sure. Not yet. But two, three more years. And then we got all the, and how did I tell you, they would implement AI through greed? Yeah. Because you got all these entrepreneur guys out here talking about how they can hack everything with AI now. And dude, you don't understand what you're contributing to. You know, if AI should be completely boycotted by fucking anybody. There's a bigger problem in AI. Quantum computing is a much bigger problem just AI. Because the way that a quantum computer works, like our, the largest super computers we can build right now. You talk about like, sir, that's a large hazard. I'm talking about quantum computing. So instead of, instead of reading bits, it reads qubits, right, which is a bit can be one of a certain number of things. And it's not that many, you know what I mean? It's like, let's say 512 megabytes. It depends on how big it is, right? But a qubit could be an infinite amount of stuff. At least for our mathematical capabilities, human beings, it could be an infinite amount of possibilities per qubit. You know what I mean? So you think about encryption. The encryption on your phone, I think is 512 SK right now. Is that right? I think it's still 512. That means you could take this strongest super computers on earth with a brute force attack. It would take it something like 25 years to get into this thing. Okay. A quantum computer is so powerful. It's like this, that old god experiment about god it cannot create an encryption itself that it can't break easily. That's how powerful a machine it is. So privacy encryption passwords, that's over. Yeah. And it's over now. It's able to essentially try an infinite amount of combinations to get your password in one second. Yeah. Well, that's also, I mean, that's why everything you do here, everything you say around any of these devices is already monitored. Oh yeah. Like people don't understand it. That's what Snowden was trying to show you guys. You guys called him a traitor. You said he was a criminal and all this shit. All he was trying to show you was that these people watch and listen and record every single thing. And you wonder how they get people to do what they want to do. It's real simple. If you do enough shit, they don't like. They go into their database of data that they have called the stream, which is everything that you've ever said, video, look that internet history, pick, point of the phone at, set within earshot or your television. They have all of that shit recorded and they go find the shit you don't want anybody to know. And then they send someone to you and they say, guess what, Dan, you need to shut the fuck up. Good luck. Yeah. I'll tell you this. The stuff I do on public is way worse than the stuff. But that's, but that's how they control these. They show them the little thing and they say, you want that everywhere? And people say, no. And that's how they get these people to go along. I mean, that's that's how information operations, like every single, developing assets, every single human being in the world with a cell phone is compromised. Sure. Every single one of them. But only if we all care, right? Yeah. Like if you don't get like Charles Barkley, they tried to cancel for seeing that women in San Antonio were fat and he was like, women in San Antonio are fat. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, all right. I guess. Yeah. Well, I'm the next guy there. Yeah. I mean, it's like, I say is yes. You don't have to be faster than the bear. But they've trained faster than the other guy. But you see how they've, you know this, how they've trained society to automatically get defensive in those situations. Like we've had cancel culture now for 12 years. And it's been implemented on the population now, which is resisting the tyranny, right? And so these people have been manipulated psychologically over the course of time through things like political correctness, removing and making removing the pledge, making the flag controversial, participation trophies. You know, we could go on and on and on. But what they've done is they've like you said earlier in the show, they've gotten people to start self censoring. And so they whipped and beaten their most resistant population and got them to a point where now they're hesitating when it really matters to speak up and say what they believe to be happening. And that's what that's a problem we're dealing with. It's paralyzing for a lot of people. But the good news is it's very easy to overcome. All you have to say no. You don't have to be a dick. You don't have to be crazy. You don't have to start a fucking podcast. We do it because we like it. But you all you have to do is just say no. Yeah. Just like Nancy Reagan said, but say yes to drugs. Yes. Say no to authoritarian governments. I want that shirt. Say yes to drugs. Say no to authoritarian governments. Next shirt. Well, I love it. I love it. Guys, jump down in the conversation. Let us know what you guys think on the topic and the words of this could be our big foot uniform shirts. From team. I was saying guys, jump down the comments. If you want to jump in on this conversation and the words of 21 Savage, how many charges you got? Hashtag a lot. Let us know in the comments, guys, what you think? Guys, it is time for our final segment of the show. As always, we have thumbs up or dumbest fuck. That's where we bring a headline up. We talk about it to get one of those two options. And so with that being said, our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads, my wife has a terminal illness. She wants sex with her ex one last time. I saw this thumbs up. Well, I'm only giving thumbs up because because if it was me and I wanted I wanted the X one last time, I'd better say yes. So treat people the way you want to be treated. Yeah. Yeah. Just a golden roll, bitch. No, I don't know, man. Let's dive into this. So a heartbroken husband says his wife's dying wish was to sleep with her ex one more time. Come on. Posted on Reddit two years ago, the anonymous band alleged his wife of a decade had just nine months to live. The original post was deleted, but it has been reposted and has since resurfaced. Quote, my wife has a terminal illness. She is projected to live at most nine months. I am of course destroyed. We've been together for a decade. I don't remember life without her. And I don't know what I'm going to do when she's gone. I've been doing my best to make the last days of her life good and grant her or and grant whatever wish I can has post began. He explained that his wife would need to be we need a wheelchair for four or five months. And then she would be bedridden if she didn't decline faster to add to the man's sadness over losing his wife. She reportedly asked him if she could be with the most quote physically kept compatible lover. She's ever had her former flame quote recently she sent me down and told me that one of the last things she wanted to do was have sex with the previous partner of hers. I of course was shocked and when I asked why the fuck she wants that, he lamented quote. So basically she thinks that her most physically compatible satisfying lover was him. She gave a whole monologue about how sex sometimes is just physical and how emotionally fulfilling sex is with me. But it was bullshit to get to that point. He continued. The man said he was left with a grave decision to make quote. So now I'm left with this denying my dying wife a wish for my own ego or let her go. Fucking other man who she feels was better. Honestly, I'm so pissed off and betray that she asked me this of me. I feel like I'm put in a position where I have to say yes because she's dying. He expressed I don't know what to say. But I don't know if that's right. I'm so hurt that sex with an ex was apparently so good that she needs to do it once before she dies. I just hate everything about this. I love it. New 10 years of bad dick man. This is the fucking this is the made up bullshit that people do on fucking Reddit. Like 90% of the shit on Reddit is totable. She's because it's built for this. Yes. Okay, but like we're doing it tonight. What we do? Like okay, yeah, she's a she's a this is America she can do whatever she wants. I'm not sticking around with some fucking gimpie wheelchair bitch. It's gonna fuck some other dude. Can me do it? Yeah, fuck out of here. That's probably this stipulation. Yeah, you're like okay, sure, you know, you're dying. You can go have some this big dick that you've been dreaming of. But I'm not gonna stick around and wipe your ass. Yeah, the remainder of that. I'm not gonna clean up the cops. That's the we handshake and we're done. High five. Okay, joy. Yes. Yeah. All right. They see what? I mean, I'd give her one weekend. Oh, man. And then you take care of it. She's the one dying. You know, she's dying. What if she's just making up that she's dying just so she can get some extra day. That's pretty funny. There's no different than that guy from the fucking earlier story. She's gonna be lying about the weekend. She's gonna be dead for three days before he's on another day. This is still by the way, not as bad as what George Lopez did to his ex-wife. What do you do? So he needed a kidney. She gave it to him, right? And then she got cancer and he left. Oh, fuck. Damn. True story. Wow. Really? Tony guy. No, no. No. Yeah, definitely. I just imagine him jumping on that trampoline at the beginning. Other people. Other people. Other people. I hear other people are funny. He just regurgitated. Listen, let's be real for a second. Like the only reason those people who have ever been funny is because we were told they were funny. Exactly. That motherfucker ain't funny. No. Listen, look at some of these shows on TV. They're like legitimately not funny. Go watch the big bang theory. It's on YouTube. You can find this and it's on Twitter as well. Big bang theory without the laugh track. Bro, those people. Because you don't know what the fuck those funny produce that level that they produce our heroes because they think that's what we will accept. And we're starting to understand this on social media because we're electing new heroes. We're listening to the podcast. We're watching other regular people do crazy shit. Like you could say whatever you want about Jake Paul and Logan Paul. Jake Paul and Logan Paul. Two regular dudes who use this tool called the internet to choose themselves to become the heroes of generation. And that's real shit. And now look, they're becoming got listen. The Hollywood's over, bro. We're done having these people chosen for us. And what's funny is is these no talent dumbasses like that guy, you know, walk around the egos like they're hilarious. And then tell you to take the vaccine. Bro, there's a show on TV. I'm not going to say it because I don't want to be rude because I know some of these people actually watch the show because I've been on some of their shows. It's so fucking bad. It's on MSM. It's a fucking nighttime show. It's so not there's not the literally nothing funny about at all at all. Like every single dude I follow on the internet that does their own comedy is 100 times funnier than any of these people they put on TV. Like who the fuck are these jokes for? They're made they're they're they're they're castrated. They're they're made and manufactured for the level of intelligence that they believe that our society has. That's why I only have one hero. His name is Paul Tibbets. Yeah. He's the guy that dropped the bomb on her up. And he's slayed. We have a new design as a teacher. This is Paul Tibbets. Slayed. Is that the movie? Oppenheimer? No, no, he's not to that point. No, that's just something we've joked about. Well, he's the guy that actually did it in the plane. Well, because there is an interview of him on YouTube. He's in his 90s. It was probably about eight nine years ago. Great 10s. In a B 17 or the the the bomber that he's in a replica one or whatever talking about it. And he's like he's like amped. Like he's there was no remorse. There's no he's not like somber anything. He's like, oh yeah, we got a lot that day. That's one. That's that's that. That's one. That one that interview right there. Yeah, dude. It's pretty wild. It's long, dude. It's like his whole life, like bragging about the body count. He fucking should have. Yeah, I would have. I mean, that's I mean, that's I know, that's kind of an inside military thing. What was it? Here's Hiroshima's 25k. What do we see? I think that was 80 or 40. One of them was yeah, one of them was 40. One of them was like a 80. Yeah, but he said like 80. How many of you there? How many people died in Pearl Harbor? Uh, three thousand. So that's how America used to be. Like if you poke the bear, the bear cut your fucking head off. Oh, yeah. You like we're like we're getting tenfold. That's it. Where's that mentality been in our society? We know it began in Rome. They had this concept called citizen remanus, right? And what it meant was I'm a Roman citizen. And the implications of saying that to somebody that wasn't a Roman citizen if they tried to fuck with you was that the full weight of the Roman empire will crash down on you. If you even look at me, fuck it wrong, right? Well, no, you want to know what our attitude is right now. And this comes down to like some some footage and stuff that was posted on official military channels and things like that about two weeks ago was Russia's Migs mess in with our drones in Syria. Do like look at how unprofessional these Russians are. I'm like when did you guys become such little bitches? They're laughing. If if Russia was flying some drone near us, you bet your ass I'd fly an F-15 right in front of that thing. Yeah, unprofessional shut up, stop being a bitch. What is this? What is this shit in society where people think there are rules? Yeah, there are no Russian. We are playing by rules. Yes. People, people's not understanding that those people are completely hostile to us is not registering with the public. Like there's this politeness that people think the rest of the world operates by. Unprofessional Russian fighter pilot. What a what a Martin Sheen saying. Professional unprofessional. So what do they call him when he so when he shoots you down? Yeah, when he's a professional. Yeah, that's what he's supposed to be. Well, he was wearing a bow tie. Yeah, he didn't have tattoos. He didn't have tattoos below the lot of this. A lot of this is couched in this guilt, this Western guilt too. And here's what I'll say about that. I'll tell you what's quite a bit more effective than feeling guilty about your position in life. If other people have it worse, what's quite a bit more effective than feeling guilty is helping them come up instead of trying to tear society down. Even if that's at your own expense. Yeah, like every every meaningful thing you do in your life will be in the service of other people. We forgot that shit, right? We think now because we think we're still in some kind of resource war right now. We have everything we fucking need, man. It's only these assholes that are on the fucking media all day. Tell me this bullshit that's true. It's not true. It's just simply not true. Every there's enough for everybody. That is a reality. The situation. The only reason everybody isn't getting enough is because there's somebody standing in the way between the resource and them. And it ain't us. You're not blockading resources. I mean, let's be real, dude. Like this, this is a true culture war. Like this is not there is no. Those migrants coming across the border are that's not a mistake. That's not that's not designed. Yes. And that's what it's designed to do is to remove American culture from America. And they understand that those people come here and they bring their culture here. They understand those they know this because you know why because they've already done this before. Look at what's going on in Europe. All right. And then people deny it. And they say you're some sort of racist for pointing out. No, I'm not a racist. I'm pointing out the fact that this thing that we all call America. We all say that we love and all these things that we have that have made our fucking lives awesome. Even you guys with shitty lives life's still pretty awesome. All of these things these culture, the values, the the meritocracy is the everything that makes America America is being destroyed by inserting millions of people that do not believe any of that shit. And like you guys think that's racist to say. That's not racist to say. America is only as strong as its culture. And if our culture is ruined, then America ceases to exist. And people have a really hard time understanding this. They think that that's some sort of like bigoted statement. Like we don't want migrants here. No, we don't mind people who immigrate here, but we expect them to adopt to our culture here. And that's the way that America has been since the beginning of America. That's the point of it. Bring us your sick. Bring us your tired. Like yes, come here and you'll have a different life than what you had there. Not come here and bring your shit here. This is this is what people are failing to understand. Think about it in practical terms. You run a very successful business, right? Let's say another supplement company went out of business because of incompetence, but there are some talented people there and you hired them. Like, hey, you know what? And you guys I've been watching what you're doing. You're doing really good job. The company was fucked up. But you're great. Come over here. If they bring their culture from their fucked up company into yours, get out. Why do you failed? Why do you think we build our people from the inside here? Yeah. That's the only thing that's because people tend to bring their bad habits from other places here. Right? This is this is real shit that people are understanding. They think the United States of America is like some like I don't know how people think that they also think of their freedom in a weird way. It's like your freedom is an autonomous decision. Yeah, the government doesn't grant your rights. That's not how the fuck it works, bud. That's not the government. The government doesn't have they don't grant your rights. The government is as a matter of fact, the documentation we have about government from our founders, the only thing it does is limit the rights of government, not ours, right? It enumerates our rights. It doesn't fucking grant them. That's nonsense. So yeah, I mean, it's that idea of what America is to people. There was a young woman that's attending a college right now that was sitting between Jared and I on the plane this morning. We were kind of just saying weird shit talking and being funny and stuff. But she was like, yeah, America, I don't even know. Like when people say, what is America anymore? I don't even know what this is. It's a 21 year old woman, right? That's the point. She's thinking about it. She's thinking about it, but she doesn't have an answer for it. I'll tell you what, if you don't, particularly when there's so much external influence, when you don't have a solid answer to that question, you are very prone to being manipulated. Yeah. You know what I mean? And it's you to see it now. Yeah. We'll fall for anything. That's how people get into cults. Right? Like this, why do you think it is that people have a hard time understanding that freedom is something that only exists if you individually exercise it? Like freedom is not a law. It is not a president saying you are free. That's actually you being a slave of it by even acknowledging that sort of relationship. So many people say they want freedom, but how many people actually exercise right? How many people listening to this show right now say they want freedom, but they won't talk about the things that they believe because they're afraid of their, you know, bully who's been bullying them the left for the last 10 years. If you are doing that, you understand that you're granting them your freedom and you're accepting your position as a subservient class to them. That's right. Yeah. Remember that scene from saving private Ryan where they come across the enemy machine gun position and like, hey, the guys are like, hey, we can just go around this. This is not our mission. Yeah. Tom Hanks is like, no, because the next group is going to come along and get chewed up by that. Yeah. Every time you capitulate to authoritarian bullshit, all you're doing, maybe you get out of the way on Skate, but the people that come behind you are going to get fucked up and that's on you. It's your kids. Yeah. It's your kids. And like, dude, that's what I have this, it's really hard for me to continue to talk about freedom. And you talk about it on your show all the time. But like you guys just don't exercise it. You wonder why this tyranny is winning. Your tyranny is winning because you are afraid to exercise your own freedom. And the sad irony is all it takes is exercising the freedom to to stave off tyranny, right? Right. Which is very simple, which is why they fucking attack it that way, right? It's very well. This is also why they have articles attacking 75-harm or telling you that if you drink too much water, you're going to fucking die or telling you that exercise is fucking racist. I mean, technically, it's true. If you only drink water, never eat anything or get electrolytes, you'll probably die at some point, but not from drinking a gallon. Not one gallon, no. I mean, that would be... That's been proven scientifically. Yeah, that's dumb. That's real dumb. Your body could process more liquid than that. Yeah, it is nice, though. I've noticed since working out became racist, he's gotten in much better shape. Like just bigger. He wasn't laughing at DJ Joe. He wasn't laughing anymore. That's a racer, right? I mean, he's by the speaking of a racer. I don't mean to jump on your dick here, but have you seen that the Cleveland Indians and the Washington Redskins are now getting criticized pretty heavily by Native American groups who feel like they've been erased from culture now? Yeah. Did we not talk about that? Are they going to be fucking years ago? Yeah, exactly, because it's third party offense. The people that wanted to remove those things were not from those culture. Who's been saying that? I've been saying that on the show for a long year. It's so stupid, man. Dude, okay. We live in the dumbest period in human history. Let me tell you how dumb it is. The Washington Redskins are racist. Okay, so what do you want us to do? Get rid of it. All right, so Redskins is actually a label for the fear system, American Native Americans that have ever existed. It's an honor to be called a redskins in that culture. It's racist. The logo was drawn by a chief in the 19. Dude, so let's take, let's take an NFL iconic team, which is one of the most badass fucking team names and teams ever. Okay, the historic and let's change the name from this name that honors Native American culture that they believe honors Native American culture. Let's change that name to a name of the people who killed us. What the fuck are we doing? Yeah, I think Mrs. Butterworth is going to change it to Mr. Slave, I think. I'm sorry, Mr. Slave Master. It's just like no, it would be the equivalent. It would be like putting a do with a whip on the front. What are we like Mr. Massive? This is a surgesy Massive. And the fact that it's got, they should change it back. I think there's a petition going around here. There's a group aren't I just found them on Instagram. Oh man, that is actually like running a massive campaign for this. Let's see if I can find it real quick. Here it is. Native Guardians on Instagram. That's the I saw that too. So Native Guardians is running signature campaigns to change back the name of the Redskins and the Cleveland Indians to the original iconic names, which they should be. I just think it's cool that they're doing it. They're over 100,000 signatures now. You guys can go check them out there on Instagram. It's Native Guardians. That's their page. Small page right now. But that's a correction that has to happen in society. We have to go back and correct all the shit. It comes from that attitude that the aristocracy knows better than you're right. Because even though you're the one, you're the native person that might be offended by this, like, well, I'm not. Well, you should be. So we're going to get rid of it. Because you can't handle it. Well, I'm fine. Actually, thanks for asking. By the way, laugh at our comedians. No shit. Anyway, good. All right, guys. Andy guys, that's all I got. All right, guys. Well, thanks for coming up me on the show. Appreciate you guys. You guys listening. Don't forget. It's not cool to be a hell. So sure. Case closed.
