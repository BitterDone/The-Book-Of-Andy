What is up guys? It's Andy Fercella and this is the show for the realest, saying goodbye to the lies, the fakeness and delusions of modern society and welcome to Motherfucking Reality. Guys today we have Q&AF, that's where you submit the questions and we give you the answers. You can submit your questions a couple different ways. The first way is... Guys email your questions in to askandyatandyfercella.com And what's the second way? Uh you can also drop your questions in the Q&A episodes on YouTube. And what's the big way? Big way guys is you can click that link in the description and submit your questions for live call-ins. I think we're going to start doing the live chat on the Q&A and just pick you right out of the chat. That'd be sick. Yeah let's do that. That'd be sick. We're doing that from now on executive decision. Executive decision? Yeah. So look out for that. Let's see. Throughout the week we're going to have shows within the show. It's not always going to be Q&AF. Sometimes we're going to have real talk. Real talk is just 5-20 minutes of me giving you some real talk. Tomorrow we're going to have CTI. That stands for Cruise the Internet. That's where we talk about what's going on in the world. We speculate on what's true, what's not true. And then we talk about how we, the people, have to solve these problems going on in the world. And there are a lot of them. Then we have 75 Hard Verses. We just had an awesome 75 Hard Verses. If you didn't get to check that out. It was 75 Hard Verses Lexi Johnson. That's where someone who has completed the 75 Hard Program comes on the show. They talk about how they were before, how they are now, and how they use the 75 Hard Program to fix their shit. If you're unfamiliar with 75 Hard is the initial phase of the Live Hard Program, which is the world's most popular mental toughness program ever created. And it is available for free at episode 208. Get the whole program for free episode 208 on the audio feed only. There's also a book on my website, andyforsella.com, called the Book on Mental Toughness. Go fucking buy it. It has the entire program in there, plus a whole bunch of other chapters on mental toughness, how to use it, how to build your life the way you want, and why it's important. So for you nerds out there that like to dig deep, get the book. What else? We got a fee? We do have a fee. Fee is very simple. Please share the show. We're always dealing with throttling and bans and all that bullshit. We need your help sharing the show. So if the show makes you think, if it makes you laugh, gives you new perspective, if you think it's information that needs to be heard, do us a favor and don't be a ho. Share the show. All right. What's up? What's going on man? Evan. Yeah? Yeah? Beautiful day. It is? Yeah, it's a beautiful day. Dude, it's been fucking hot. It's been hot. Yeah, how long is it supposed to stay hot like this? I don't know, but I don't like it. So you know- It was nice for like a week. Yeah, it was beautiful. 70 degrees. Now it's hot again. Yeah, it's back hot. You know, it is crazy. Oh god, man. So you know, one of my passions for those that don't know is I like, I love football. You love food, food ball? Do you say food ball? I said football. Oh, football. Oh, got it. I thought you said food ball. What's up? It's supposed to be better like Thursday. Oh, is it? Yeah. Yeah, that's nice. Anyway, so- Yeah, no, I love football. It's a big passion of mine. I played it for years, coached it for years. And so recently I'm like, I want to, I want to ref, right? I want to be a referee. And so I went through the whole process. I'm doing like low league junior high games and shit now. And yesterday I caught two cramps in my quads on the first play. I was trying to scoot across field. Bro, listen, first of all- Did they have to call the fucking, the traitors out? Bro, I started running like fucking, like I had something up my ass, bro. It was so bad. Crazy thing is though, like one of the coaches recognized me and- Once he saw you running. Yeah. He's like, wait, you said your name was DJ. You're DJ, right? I'm like, yep, that's me. Flag, get off. You know what I'm saying? It was great though, man. It's been cool. Where's the games at? They're all over. I've been doing, like I said, I'm doing junior high right now because they want me to do some JV games, but those are on Mondays at like five o'clock. I can't do those. Yeah. Now I can do like some of the varsity stuff. I just haven't got a sign in the first year. So yeah. But I'll do the junior high game. So sixth, seventh, and eighth grade. I was at Marquette and they got swept. Who do they play? Rittner. Oh really? They got fucking swept, bro. Those kids are good. You're going to ref MICDS? Probably. Yeah. They're probably- We played them in junior high. They beat the shit out of us. They've always- We played them in high school too. Fuck, they're good. They've always had a program. Yeah. It's been cool, man. Yep. It's been fun, but yeah, I caught two fucking cramps on the first play, man. I was fucking dying the whole game, man. I'm like, y'all niggas got some diabetes water here for me or something? Dude, I just wanted something, man. The diabetes? Diabetes? Diabetes water. The diabetes water? Pickle juice. Fuck. Dude, I would have drank anything. Yeah. Speaking of drinking anything. That's right. How about that fucking plug? Now, we may not run ads on the show, but if I were, it would be for this amazing Form Energy- Fuck, man. That was good. Energy drink. That's right. ...the history of Earth. And just so you know, there's more because we also have- Look at you. The first form snack stack. That's right. I just picked this up on my way over here at Wally's. Not really. Okay. But if I did, I actually got this out of my office, but I could have bought it at Wally's or 7-Eleven or pretty much anywhere else. And you should too. I needed those yesterday. Yeah. See? So, this is definitely not an ad because I'm not getting paid, but this is a personal recommendation. Mm-hmm. I like it. Damn, that is fucking good, bro. The orange is good. Bro, they're all good. I can't wait for the new flavors. Bro. Because there's some special- I know which one you're waiting for. You know which one I'm waiting for. Yeah. Can you guys guess? Can you guys guess which flavor is coming that DJ is really going to like? I'll send you guys a case if you guess it right. Yeah. All right. Case will be stolen too. I was waiting for that. Yeah, let's do this. Hey, listen. It's our Monday morning, so let's make some people better today. I got some good ones for you. We've got some callers ready too. So, let's get this first one going. We got, let's give Cody a call. Cody. Cody with a C. Cool. Is there other ways? Yeah. The K. Cody? Yeah. You guys do that shit all the time. No, we do not. Yeah, for sure. We do not. Yeah, now- That's Carl. You know, 28-year-old, 25, 28-year-old new moms, and they're trying to be unique. Yep, that's right. Yeah, they'll do that shit. We, normal people, do not. People don't realize how bad that fucks up their kid's life. Every class you're in, you've got to spell your name out. You know what I'm saying? People that have a regular name don't know that, but I know that. You know that. I know that. Yeah, I just spell my last name, and everybody always says it so many fucking different ways. Frisilla. Frisilla. Yeah. Frisella. How hard is it to fucking pronounce, bro? It's Frisella. Frisella. Like fry-seller. Fry-seller. See? And that's my calling is sell fries. Is that what it is? Yeah. I got this whole plan, bro. Oh, yeah? Yeah, I'm going to transition into a fry- No, barbecue, bro. Tycoon. No, we got to do smoked meats. Both. Okay, we'll do both there. Yeah. We'll put smoked meat on the fries. Fuck. Talk about fucking diabetes. And then we'll sell the weight loss stuff. Yeah, that's right. It's perfect. It's called vertical integration. That's right. We'll put a gym right next door. Yeah. All right, let's give a, let's get a calling going. We got Jake. Let's give Jake a call. Hello? Jake, what's up, dude? What's up, big dog? Let's go. How'd you know I was a big dog? I don't know. I'm a little dog. I'm a little dog, bro. You know, you're the big dog. I'm a big dog. Jake, what's up, dude? What's up, Andy? How are you? I'm doing great, brother. How are you? I can't complain. Another day, another quarter. Yeah. Where are you calling in from? Long Island, New York. Nice. What do you do? So what do you do? What do you do up there, bro? So I run a gourmet seafood market. Okay. So you sell to all the, you sell to individuals or also restaurants? Individuals, mostly individuals. Okay. A lot of hedge fund guys and housewives. All right. So they want in between, you know, everything from hedge fund guys to, you know, people who clean houses. So it's a really, really good job. That's awesome, dude. So what, how'd you get into that? I was a pretty troubled team, always fighting and getting in the problems, you know, getting in the problems, you know, getting in the problems, getting in the problems, getting in the problems. And I was always, you know, I was always, you know, I was always, you know, I was always a pretty troubled team, always fighting and getting in the problems, you know, running the streets and doing stuff like that. And I turned 18 and I said, well, it was either I'm going to go to work or I'm going to go to war. And there really wasn't much of a war at the time. So I walked into this little seafood market in my town and I actually had a black eye at the time. I didn't think I was going to get hired. I got stung by a bee a couple of days before. And the woman at the time, she really needed help. So I just walked in and asked for a job. And that was 10 years ago. And I've been here five, six days a week, blood, sweat, tears. My first year here, I boosted sales 30 percent, really just knuckled down and did my best. And it's taken me taking me pretty far. That's awesome, bro. So so do you own this place now? No, I don't. And that's part of my question. So I like I said, I've been here 10 years and it was always a plan to either buy into this one or me and the owner now. We're going to open a new market together in the past couple of years. She's taken like a 180. She got divorced, bought a house and then got remarried. And she's in nursing school right now. She kind of she wants out of the business. But me, I have my foot on the gas. I want to grow the business. I have a lot of things I want to do with the business, do things with community. I have a whole lot of ideas. So I'm looking to buy the business within the next six to nine months. OK. And my question is, is I'm going to be getting a loan from my father in law for the business. And like I said, I've done everything by myself my entire life. Phone bill, car bill, everything. I've never gotten a hand out and getting the money from my father in law. To me, it feels like almost like a hand out, not a hand up. So I'm kind of just like struggling with that a little bit, how I can feel like I'm getting a hand up and not a hand out. OK, this is very easy. The one way, dude, the real the real way that you make what you're trying to do happen is to make it successful and make it worth his while. Beautiful. Yeah. I mean, that's it, dude. You know, like, yeah, take the loan. Understand that, you know, this is something that you're not really comfortable with. But have the intention, which I could tell you already do, of not just paying the loan back, but also making it a strong financial investment for him. You know, it sounds to me like you're trying to scale this bitch out. And, you know, who knows, this could be one of the greatest investments since he's ever made. And I would make it my personal goal to make it that way. And it sounds like you understand the business. You've been doing it a long time. You sound confident. You sound like, dude, I, I, I think you're thinking about it exactly how you should. You know, any time you take money, you should feel a little hesitant about it. I think that awareness is like, yeah, it's a healthy thing, dude. And yeah. And then figuring out how to make it worth his while. What are the terms that you guys figured out? Or did you do that yet? So right now I have we're getting contracts and everything written out. I know I do everything here. So taking over really wouldn't be that much of a problem. I write the checks. I do the ordering. You know, it's not really like a job to me. I love it so much. I talked to all different people and stuff like that. The terms would be basically we haven't really talked about like a payback situation. Yeah, because he's one of those guys that I just got the contract from the lawyer and everything. He's one of those guys that nothing happens until that contract is written and signed. And then we move forward. But it would probably be kind of like the traditional SBA loan where I have a 10 year period to pay it back. It would be my mission to pay that back in four years. And I believe that I can do that with the revenue of the business. Because for the first couple of years, I really I'm going to take the salary I take now, which isn't great. And then I'm going to take whatever else from the business, reinvest back into the business and pay back my loan. Like I tell all my customers all the time, like I'm prepared to open a cooler, put a blanket in there and a pillow and sleep in that thing if I have to. Yeah. So I really, you know, I really think I could pay back the loan. The loan isn't in terms of like, you know, it's a couple hundred thousand dollars. But I really think that just grinding it out for a couple of years, I can pay back that loan in full. And it would probably be my mission to do it with under four years. Yeah. Do you do you do you ship your product or is it walking? We don't ship. We don't ship. So that's that's one of the next steps that I want to look into once I get everything situated and start going to business and doing things my way is we make a couple of niche products here that I look at the seafood, the frozen seafood selection in, you know, supermarkets and things like that. Pretty trash. It's fish sticks. It's no, I'm aware of fish mix. Yeah, it's trash. So I really want to look into we make swordfish meatballs. I make swordfish meatballs. I make these really nice standard burgers that I think in the long run, you know, I would try to get into a frozen space in supermarkets, Walmart, BJs, Costco, things like that. You know, I know a Walmart customer is not to be the same as a target customer. So you have branch out and have different things that I can put in these shelves and stuff like that, that I can do different products. And that would be the ultimate goal. I have another idea that I want to do is I want to take like a 10 to 13 foot brisk craft, a wood grain brisk craft boat. Yep. And I want to hollow it out with a metal fabricator. And I'm going to set the engine, gut it out and have a metal fabricator come and we're going to install a metal bin inside the boat that I can bring to beaches, parties, people's mansions over here. People have funny money. The average house over here is like a million dollars that I could bring to these people's houses. And it could be a shucking boat, put clams on it, oysters, king crab, lobster and things like that. And they're really there's they have canoes and things like that. But a real wood grain actual boat has not been done. And I look at that as like a business inside of the business that I can grow. And I can even get one boat, two boats, three boats, have a separate Instagram for it, post things, you know, run it as a business inside of the business, not taking my attention away. From my bread and butter, which is retail seafood for sure. But something like that could easily bring me an extra 20 to 30 grand of summertime season just renting it out on the daily. Yeah, brother. Look, can I can I tell you what I do? Yeah. All right. Because it sounds like you got it all figured out. And I'm going to play big brother here. How old are you? I'm twenty seven. All right. I'm big brother. All right. I'm not dad yet. Who's the deal, bro? You got a fucking great thing going. OK, and it's and it's niche, too. It's gourmet seafood. Here's what I would do if I was your partner. All right. I would take the loan. I would. Well, first of all, before I take the loan, I would sit down today and I would make a concrete plan of how we're going to scale this motherfucker out. And how I would do it if I were you is I like the Chris Kraft idea a lot, by the way. I would. Are you on social media yet with your fish market? So there is a social media for it. I I tried to take it over about a year and a half ago. The owner, the woman, she was like, no, I'm doing it. The social media is trash. So that's number one thing when I take over is I'm going to delete everything and revamp the entire social media. That's my number one. My number one goal. OK, I take over. OK. Here's what I would do, dude. I would make a plan and it would look something like this. We're going to go out and get the loan. We're going to pay this thing back within five years. Here's how we're going to do it. We're going to take over the ownership of the retail location. We're going to continue to run that. We're going to continue to make it better. The product is going to continue to get better, not worse. We are never going to compromise the product. We are only going to move it in the direction of better because you're playing in a premium market space. So the price of what you sell is less relevant than any of the other spaces. It's about quality. Then what I'm going to do and what we're going to do is we're going to get that fucking Chris Kraft boat. But we're not going to get five of them. We're going to get one. And what we're going to do is we're going to shoot content around the brand story. All right. This is how Jake makes the meatballs. This is where we get the fish. This is what I do. It follows you around. It shows. It shows that you're a blue collar, small fishing expert who loves his product. And by the way, you do fucking love it. I can hear it. Who loves what he does and loves this this whole thing. And the content that we make is going to be very Cape Coddish feeling. All right. Premium. You know, the Northeastern feel. And then what we're going to do is we're going to create an amazing social social strategy that's going to tell this amazing story. What's your what's the name of the business? Marty's Gourmet Seafood. What is it? Marty's Marty's Gourmet Seafood. All right. That's fucking great, dude. That's highly merchandise. That sounds like a place that sounds like a place I want to get my fucking fish from. Real talk. Yeah. So so then we're going to create this. We're going to create a direct to consumer model. OK, that's the first thing we're going to do. So we're going to have the walk in. We're going to create the content. Then we're going to create a direct consumer model fueled by advertising on digital spaces. And we can we'll start to create an operation where you can sell to individuals wealthy, high class, high demand, high standard individuals at a high price point throughout the country. All right. And that's going to create that's going to create a high margin that you're going to be able to scale the business off of. You know, most of the problem that most of the reason that most people can't scale their business because they don't make enough margin and they race to the bottom. And the reason I like the premium category is because when you're dealing with a customer that just wants the best, it allows room for margins to be fair. And yeah. And so this this is basically what I would do with, you know, with what Marty's gourmet seafood. Is that it? Yeah. OK. Yeah. And then I would create some cool old school feeling shirts. I would have those available and I would go branding war on on the product, dude. And great product, great branding, digital ads, direct consumer model. Keep the retail to where it is. And then what happens is, dude, is the retail will eventually become this like this landmark where people who come to Long Island, they got to go to Marty's because because this is where I get all my fish from my program or for my parties and my events. And I and I got to meet Jake, dude. You see what I'm saying? Like this. This is like, yeah, so this is how I would scale that business out in a very general way. But here's the thing, bro. And I'm like, I'm getting excited about it. You have you have a highly scalable situation here. And a lot of people don't. A lot of people have things that can't be scaled properly. This could be a massive brand, dude. And yeah, that's the goal. Yeah. And dude, you originally ask, how do I make how do I not feel guilty? Make the brand so fucking big that you can afford to give your father in law an equity position of five, 10 percent that pays out for the rest of his fucking life. And then when he says, undeniable, yeah, right. Then when he says, well, you already paid the loan, you say, yeah, but now I'm doing the right thing because you believe you believed me. That's right. And that's how we fucking do things here, bro. That's that's that's how I've always done shit. And while it's cost me money and it's not really it's an investment in the right thing. And when you do good things, good things come back. And exactly, you know, I believe that I've seen it 100 percent, 100 percent. You know, I always tell people I'm like, oh, give the homeless guy five dollars. Get the guy at the gas station pumping your gas. A couple bucks. Buy somebody coffee and don't get donuts. Those things compound. Yes. You might not see them like originally a day, a day or two later. It's just it's karmic. It's good karmic relief. There's karmic debt and there's karmic relief. And you put you put good out there. You will get good back, dude. A thousand percent. And people with bad karma will look at that guy on the fucking corner and they'll say, you just gave that guy a hundred bucks. And he's just going to go drink with it. Look, motherfucker, this ain't about what he does. It's about what I did. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. If he wants to go party, let him. He's happy. You know, that's right, bro. I'm with you, bro. In fact, man, like this is an exciting. If we were a few years down the road, bro, I'd be like, say I'd be calling you back on and be like, hey, let's fucking do this together. Like this. This is awesome. Yeah, I'm with it, man. I'm with it. You know, it's crazy. I found you in like 2020 and you were talking about like chopping heads off and putting them on the White House lawn. I was like, yo, this is my guy. Yeah. You started talking about business and everything. And I was like, holy shit, this is really my guy. Hey, we can make a business out of that, too. By the way, we can make some we can make some thrones with the skulls on the corner. You know, hey, look, dude, you're in a good spot. And I like the whole idea. I love. Thank you. I do. I really do, bro. And I'm excited for you. And you're young enough to do it. And I fucking hope one day. Oh, and by the way, after you've built the direct consumer business, then you then you have an opportunity to fill in that retail play that you're talking about. All right. Yep. So then you can go to the you know, the you could start with the high end groceries and then you can go to the you know, you can go to the big chains. And then and then the box and you can you can scale this out. But here's the thing I want you to remember, because a few years from now when this is a real conversation, this is what the fuck they're going to tell you. They're going to say, Jake, your product's too expensive. Jake, you need to make the product cheaper. Never fucking do that. Because the whole the whole magic of your brand is the quality of your product. That's right. And if you're going to if you're going to play in a premium space, you cannot ever, ever, ever cut corners on quality, no matter what it does to the price. Definitely. Beautiful. So hopefully that's helpful, bro. Oh, it's 100 percent helpful, Annie. And, you know, if you're ever in Long Island, hit me up. I'd love to take care of you. Give you some, you know, whatever. Whatever you need, you know, if you're ever if you're ever over here, you know, I'll take care of you, man. I really appreciate everything you guys do. And, you know, you just get free game. You get free game, free game, free game. And that's really appreciated to, you know, a younger generation of entrepreneurs like myself. I really appreciate it. I listen to your podcast every morning. It just gets me fired up to just go out and conquer. Brother, there's nothing that I have that you don't fucking have. All you got to do is just all you got to do is show the fuck up and keep doing it, dude. That's it. I appreciate it. Thank you. All right, Jake. Appreciate you, bro. Appreciate you guys. Thank you for everything. All right. See you, dude. See you, brother. I see that's a fucking entrepreneur. Yeah, that's a young dude. That's why the fuck I do this. That right there. You got a young dude who sees an opportunity. You can hear the hunger in the bro. Bro, it reminds me of how I feel, dude. I feel that way every day. Yeah, I still feel that way. You know what I'm saying? Like a lot of people like, why do you still do this and this and that? Because I fucking love the game, dude. You're still Jake. Yes. Yeah. Still because my goals are so big. You know what I mean? Like, you know, it's not greed. It's just the game. It's a game. I love the game. And he loves the game. You could fucking hear it. We got it. We got it. I feel like we got to stay in touch with bro. I want to I want to see Marty's gourmet seafood fucking everywhere. I want to see Marty's gourmet seafood restaurants. Fuck. Well, I'm about to call him back and give him that money myself. I love it, man. I absolutely love it. I love it. Well, let's keep going. Let's get it. All right, guys. All right, guys, Andy, here's another question for you. Hey, Andy and DJ. Hey, this is right. That's right. Andy, how do I move forward when I caught a co-worker stealing time clocking in at 4 a.m. when she wasn't there, which also manipulates our tip pool, gave my boss proof. My boss staked out the place to gather her proof for herself. And my boss confronted her. But instead of firing her, my boss let her apologize and is keeping her on because she's deemed irreplaceable. Mind you, this has been going on for months and months. And I had suspicion and have known it's not just one time thing. And my boss knew that. And I can and can see the proof in the POS system. It feels like this sets a bad precedent for the rest of us and honestly just shows we don't align on the same rules. That this stuff, what should I do? Oh, man. Doing the right thing. Listen, here's the lesson here for anybody who is a manager, a leader, an operator who's in charge of hiring, firing and running a team. When you have someone who is doing something that is outside the realm of what is supposed to be allowed to do and you allow them to continue doing that, you demoralize the rest of the team. The rest of the team loses belief. They don't believe in you. They don't believe in the mission. They don't believe in the company. And eventually all your good people leave because they recognize that all the standards and all the things that you say you stand for don't mean shit. And they also recognize that there is no accountability for doing good or bad. So you as a leader and a manager need to understand that when your team understands that someone's fucking off and you don't handle it, it ruins the team. It tells the team you don't need to try that hard. It tells the team that even if you break the rules, there's no repercussion. It literally makes it impossible for you to grow and build the company. So I'm going to say that first. That's terrible leadership. I don't know why he would do that. Maybe he has a friendship or a history or he's known this girl's family. I don't fucking know. But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. I agree with you. That is a character flaw that will end up biting him again and again and again until he he does it because that same person is just going to find another way to cheat. And by the way, what are you training that person to believe about their job there and also their job anywhere? You see, this isn't just about holding someone accountable for the behavior on the job. It's about teaching them a lesson that they will carry with them for life. And what this leader just did was teach this person that it's OK to do these things and there won't be any repercussions. And because they now have witnessed this, they are much more likely to continue that pattern through their life everywhere they go. And this guy thinks he's cutting her a break when in reality he's probably handicapping her for life. And so, you know, that's something that no one talks about or believes. That's a real thing. Fuck. Yeah, it'll ruin that guy. Just ruin that girl's life. She's going to go to the next thing, the next thing, the next thing. And eventually the thing will get her arrested and it'll fuck her whole life up. So what should you do? You know, I'd probably have one more conversation with the fucking boss and I'd probably say something like I'm saying. And I'd say, hey, man, I know you think you're doing the right thing. But here's the problem. The rest of the team fucking hate you for it. And the rest of the team doesn't want to work here because that you're allowing her to fucking get away with special shit. What's that tell us? That tells us that it doesn't matter what we do or not do. And by the way, if I do the same thing and you fire me, I could just sue you for discrimination. So he's creating all sorts of holes and liabilities for himself that I'm sure he's not aware of. And I would have a conversation with him about it and and I would be OK walking out of the room. Not working there, you know, like I would I would have already decide personally when I walk in the room that I might walk out of the room and not work here anymore. But I'm going to say what I think I'm going to say the truth and hopefully they respect it. And if they don't, then I'm going to move on to something different that, you know, is more representative of a place that I believe in and want to work at. Yeah, it's hard to have the courage. It's easy to have morals and values. It's hard to be able to stand on. That's a tough thing for a lot of people. Yeah, you know. Yeah. But I mean, that's also called being an adult. You know, like. Yeah, I understand that that's tough for people, but if they never learn the skill of confrontation or standing up for themselves, then you're going to get walked on your whole life. So, you know, if this is making you nervous to handle instead of letting it make you nervous, maybe you should look at it as an opportunity to grow and say, all right, this is something that's holding me back. My inability to have a direct conversation about things that are wrong is something that's holding me back. And I need to conquer that. And I'm going to I'm going to invest in that right now by handling this situation the best way. And regardless of what happens, whether you he gets rid of her or whether he says, well, hey, maybe this isn't the place for you. You're going to be proud of yourself. And that's going to build integrity and confidence in yourself to where actually what will happen is you'll become less afraid to have those conversations. And then you'll get into a place where that direct feedback is very valuable because I'm going to be real with you, dude, direct feedback that is not bias to either way is some of the most valuable shit that you can have inside of a company. There are people who will tell you you're wrong because they think like, well, nobody stands up to him and eight. You know, I got it's my role to tell them the truth. Those motherfuckers are annoying as fuck. Everybody sees through them. They're not valuable because they take contrarian viewpoints no matter what. And then you have the other extreme, which is, oh, that's a great idea. It's great. We should fucking do that. That's not valuable either. So when we think about like, who's the most valuable, it's the people who can objectively tell you the facts of the matter without exaggerating them one way or the other so that you can make the proper decision. And the most valuable people in my organizations are those people, the people who come to me and they say, hey, here's what's going on. And it's the truth and the facts. And then if they want to be even more valuable, you know what, you know what happens? They come to me and they say, here's what's going on. Here's how I handled it. And I don't even have to fucking touch it. Yeah, those are the most valuable things that you can do. And you're in a position now to invest into that skill set by having that sort of conversation, not a conversation that is extra contrarian or abrasive and not a conversation that sucks balls. Right. Right. Like the truth. Here's what it is. Here's what's going on. I want you to know because this is real and this guy doesn't sound like he might value that. So but dude, I'm going to tell you most competent operators. That's like some of the most valuable shit that you can look for. And I would go, I would further this discussion to say that the reason that most people don't succeed and get capped out in their careers is not effort or hard work or even skill set. But it's their inability to communicate honestly and directly. They're afraid. And if you're in the right place, what would you be afraid of in regards to telling the leader something that's going to benefit the overall mission? Yeah, they might get upset. They might fucking bark and make some noise. But that's not at you. Yeah, that's at the situation. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, I was just he may not value it because he's never had it. Maybe never had anybody come tell him. Yeah, because it is rare. It is rare. You know what I'm saying? Does it say where he works? No. No. So yeah, I mean, it's rare, dude. In my career of 26 years, I have probably 10 people that I would say have developed that skill set. Yeah, all 10 of those people are either making a lot of money or they've gone somewhere else and made a lot of money. So it's a hell of a skill to have. It's one of the best skills. And I truly think that from my experience, when I look back, there's not much difference between skill set. There's people that have high performing skill sets that put up numbers. And then there's people that have high performing skill sets to put up numbers that tell you how to make shit better. Who's more valuable? Yeah, the second guy's way more valuable. So yeah, that's real. Yeah. And it can't. It's got to be real, though. It can't be bitching. It can't be complaining. It can't be, you know, some false information. It can't be bullshit. It's got to be real shit. All right. The bullshit is your job to handle. The real shit has to be communicated honestly, directly, without bias in a factual manner so that your leadership can make correct decisions. And when you develop that skill set and you don't put emphasis on one way or the other way and you're just telling the way it is, that's fucking valuable, bro. I love it. I love it. We got another call. It's going to call in. This is Bailey. Who? Bailey. Bailey. I don't know which way. I don't know which way. So let's check it out. Let's give Bailey a call. Hello. Bailey. What's up, dude? What's up, DJ? How are you, brother? I'm good, man. I'm doing much better. Now I'm talking to you. How you doing? I'm just living the dream, man. You know, Bailey, what's up, bro? What's going on, Andy? How are you, man? I'm doing real good. Real good. Where are you calling from? Charlotte, North Carolina. All right. All right. Good spot. What are you doing out there, man? What do you do? I do sales for a flooring company and we sell exclusively to the apartment business. Okay. All right. So how'd you get into this? I kind of fell into it, man. After the Air Force, I left active duty to do the Air National Guard. And one of my one of the guys in my squadron was working here and referred me. And here we are coming up on four years, man. And it's been an absolute blessing for sure. That's awesome, dude. That's awesome. So what are you struggling with, bro? How can I help you today? Yeah, man. So it seems like I'm about to take my first jump into leadership here. I've got an interview Thursday. And that's kind of the last step. And it looks like it's, you know, kind of a formality. But, you know, I don't want to count my chickens before my eggs hatch. But in preparation for that, you know, just doing some thinking. And my question is, you know, I got like I'm struggling with like not everybody's going to be committed to excellence the way I am. And like, how do I reconcile that? You know? Well, if I knew that answer to get 100% compliance, I'd be worth a trillion dollars. Look, you know, here's the reality of being successful in life. If you are going to be successful, leadership is a required skill. There are there are basically two avenues and you're in both of them of getting paid real money. One is the ability to sell. Two is the ability to lead and manage a team. And if you have those two skills, you're extremely valuable anywhere in any industry. And the fact that you are aware that this is a different skill and it's one that you need to pay attention to is a huge deal because a lot of people think that leadership is just like a promotion or you get a title and you just show up and continue to do the same thing. When in reality, it's a completely different thing. So obviously, the biggest thing that you need to do as a leader is to operate at the standard that you expect from your team. And you are going to have some fall off. OK, if you operate at 100%, your team's going to operate at 85%. They're they're not going to ever truly hit the standard that the leadership is operating at. They might now you will have some people that do and you'll have some people that exceed that standard even. But you shouldn't allow them to exceed it because your shit should be so high. So the first thing is, you know, you got to live the standard, which the fact that you asked, I'm worried that they don't have the same level of commitment to personalize your team. I'm worried that they don't have the same level of commitment to personal excellence that I do. You know, that shows me that you're probably already live in a pretty high standard. The second thing that you have to do is you have to realize that leadership is not just about the job at hand. It's about the character development of the people underneath. And I think the difference between a leader who struggles and a leader who thrives is the amount of interest that they take in developing the individual. A lot of people who do claim to lead people will basically set a standard inside the workplace and then let that standard be and then never really teach them or coach them or make them understand. And Bailey, the truth is, man, a lot of people do not understand. They just don't. You know, they've never read a personal development book. They've never listened to a podcast on success. They've never tried because they've never had anybody that has been successful within their realm of observation. And if people have never seen or touched success, it's very hard for them to understand that they can also have those things. And so your job as a leader is to make sure that one, you're holding the standard to, you know, you're setting the standard for the job. Three, you are becoming their personal mentor in terms of how you're going to help them improve in all of their areas. And the fourth one is, is that you have to get them to care about improving. And that's the tricky part. So what you should be doing on a consistent basis when you get your team is to sit down and paint out the big mission. OK, this is what we're trying to achieve. This is what we're going to do. And this is what it means to you. All right. All right. And then always tie the mission back to what it means to them, their development, their career and their family. And then you have to make good on those on those situations when they earn them. So doing those things, bro, you'd be surprised at who will step up and. Want to be led and want to be coached, a lot of people have never had anybody take an interest in them at all, not at home, not in school, not at their job, never. And so when we have people who sort of, you know, I have this saying that you got to be brave enough to go after what you really want and you got to be strong enough to pull people with you. And pulling people with you is draining, dude. It's a hard thing because you're basically trying to unfuck their brains from a lifetime of bad information and discouragement and bad experiences and bad belief systems. But the truth of the matter is, man, is that we're all human, we're all capable and what one man can do, another can do. And so to be an effective leader, you have to embody these things that we just laid out. And at the end of the day, man, you know, you're going to have people that are going to step up. You're going to have people that are that are not and the people that are not you're going to have to move on from and replace with people who are going to fit the culture that you're developing. And here's the cool thing. When you start to develop this culture of winning, when you get rid of the people who won't buy in and you bring new people in, the culture will vet those people. But your team, your winners, your ass kickers, they get this new guy in and within, you know, two weeks, they're going to know if this guy is going to fit or not. So it weeds them out real quick. And yeah, man, I mean, that's I mean, that's pretty much it, dude. Like leadership is is its own skill set. And I think the reason that most people fail at it is they don't think that it is. They think that it's just something they earn by putting up numbers on the board. You know, I scored a bunch of touchdowns, so I'm a leader. That's not that's not it. It has nothing to do with it. Actually, it's more about like, how did you train? How did you eat? What's your work ethic like? What's your what's your influence on your other teammates? Is it good? Is it bad? Do you bitch? Do you moan? Are you positive and empowering? You know, these are the things that make up leadership. Do you make the people around you better? And it's far less to do with the title and far more to do with with your behavior. So I think you're going to be fine, though, bro. The fact that you're aware of it already. You know, most people aren't like that. Most people will get a promotion into a leadership position and they'll just say, well, I'm the leader now and like continue to do the same shit they were doing. And then you'll say, well, why isn't this person or that person getting any better? Well, fuck, I don't know. They just they're not any good. Well, your job is to make them fucking good. You know, and and it's a skill, bro. And I'm going to tell you this, too. The other thing is, is it's a skill you never master. You'll go your whole life. Continuing to learn, continuing to develop, continuing to be better. And it's a full time commitment, man. It's, you know, there I've been doing this for a long time in business, and there's still things that I mess up and there's still things I need to improve on. And it never ends. So and I like that. I like skill sets that we can continue to get better at over and over and over again. Through the course of our life. So I think you're going to be fine, bro. That gotcha. Yeah. And I'm fortunate enough to it's like I'm stepping into a good situation. There you go. You're here. It's great and everything is just we want to expand cap for more market share and all the good stuff. And I guess I'm very wary of trying to like not hire myself, I guess, because success comes in different forms. You know, like some some people, a lot of people out there in the world, you know, don't have to wake up at 4 a.m., hit the gym and do all this stuff to be successful. But I do. And I just I don't know. I can very conscious of that, you know. Yeah. Well, I mean, look, man, you're holding you're holding a high standard. And that's a great thing to be a leader. You know, I have to do those things, too, bro. Like I have to do all the extra shit. Like I'm not gifted. I'm not fucking nothing was given to me. Like I have to fucking do these things like. Yeah. And you know, I it's it's funny, bro, because. I know I'm a lot better than most people, like I'm a lot more skilled and a lot better and a lot harder worker and and fucking way more intense and care way more than most people. And I still have to do those things to fucking win, bro. And then some of these people are like, I have to do those things. I'm like, fuck you talking about. You're special. Yeah, right. That's right. Yeah, I forgot. You're super special. I will take a mile. Yeah, dude, me too, bro. And you got to know yourself for that. You know what I'm saying? Like, I have to stay focused because the minute I start sliding, I fucking slide fast. Yeah. So that's you know, I make this joke, bro. I've never done cocaine in my whole life because I know what will happen. I'll spend all my money and end up in a ditch in about 40, 40 hours. It's zero or 100 with me. Yeah, I watch these motherfuckers like how they behave when they start doing drugs. I'm like, that's why you never start. Fuck, man. Don't do it. So, yeah, brother, I get it, dude. And I think if people are being honest with themselves, you know, real talk, they all have to operate that standard. If they want to win. But, you know, some people haven't figured themselves out yet. So, yeah, I think you're in a good spot, though, bro. What are you most concerned about? Just the added pressure, right? So I fully understand all these awesome sales numbers I've put up and all this cool shit I've done over the past four years. All that goes to zero. Right. This next chapter, it's another mountain. It's another climb. And I'm ready for that. I'm excited for it. But at the same time, you know, it's a bigger deal, you know, and I'm still relatively young. I just turned 33 like a week ago at this point. So, yeah, it's just the next big jump. You know, I mean, it's what you want to see. Right. That's what we're after. I'm just trying to be, you know, prepared for it. Yeah. I'm excited about making my team because they deserve that. Remember this, bro. The people that founded this country were fucking 20 years old. Fair enough. You know, you can you can lead these motherfuckers. I promise you that. Yes, sir. I appreciate that. Yeah, I could tell from talking to you, bro. I mean, you're going to be fine. You're going to fucking do great. Appreciate it, man. I'm excited. I'm excited for you, brother. Do work, man. I appreciate you calling in, brother. I appreciate you all, man. Keep up the good work. Yeah, man. You guys are killing it. Keep going. Yeah, you too, bro. I appreciate all the support and go out there and do it, bro. You're going to be fine. Lots and lots and lots of people that don't have your mental acuity have become great leaders. I can tell you that. So you'll be good. Copy. All right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that's the other thing, too. It's like when it comes to leadership, specifically, when people get those positions, like, well, I was a great salesman. Absolutely. I mean, I know I'll be a great leader. He understands it. You heard what he said. I'm starting at zero. Yeah, it's a different scoreboard. Totally different. Yeah. Your score is not the numbers you put up. Your score is the numbers they put up. And a lot of leaders don't understand that. Right. It doesn't matter how good you were at selling. It doesn't matter how good you are at selling. What matters is, is are you good at transferring that skill into your people and helping them develop? And a lot of people can't connect those dots. It's, it's very hard to adjust from being someone who's only responsible for themselves and their performance to then putting your life and your performance in other motherfuckers' hands. Yeah. Like, dude, that's a hard thing. And, you know, as an entrepreneur, you got to do it every day. You know, not everything depends on how well everybody else performs. And you have to care about those people. You got to care about their lives. You got to care about their families. You got to care about, you know, their development. You got to care about them. And the best leaders care the most. That's the truth. And the best leaders have the ability to understand the difference between nuance, you know, cutting someone slack versus teaching them a lesson that they need to fucking learn or it's going to cost them later. You know, I used to be someone who protected my people, meaning like I would, they would make a mistake and I would say I would kind of stand in the way of them. And what I realized is, dude, I was costing them time later down the road. You know what I'm saying? Like I was doing them a disservice. And if I really cared about those people, I would let the results of their actions affect them so that they felt that pain and didn't allow it to happen again. They got to touch the stove. Absolutely, bro. And you got to allow that to happen. It's probably, it's kind of, it's probably kind of like being a parent. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? You got to let them learn. Otherwise, you're sure hurts. Yeah. Otherwise you're creating a situation. They get really hurt later. And when you really care about people, bro, you know, it's hard because, you know, 90% of the time people value very heavily that you care about them. But then there's 10% of the people who see that as an opportunity to take advantage of you. And so you're always when you really truly lead the right way, you are always going to have people that take advantage. And you've just got to deal with that. It's heartbreaking. It fucking really hurts. But, you know, you got to you cut those people out and you take the good with the bad and the good far outweighs the bad. So that's my take on it, man. I think leading people is the hardest fucking job. Managing people is the hardest fucking job you will ever fucking have. And if you can master it, it's worth big money, big, big money. If you can run a fucking team effectively, dude, you become invaluable, not just to your organization, but any because it's so fucking rare. So to all the guys out there and girls out there, you know, moving into a leadership position, I would take the responsibility seriously. I would take the opportunity seriously. I would understand that it's no longer about you. It's about them. And if you help them win, you win. And it's not just about them, dude. It's about their kids, about their family, about their fucking bills. Like, there's a responsibility that we have as leaders in the workplace to help people win if you actually care, man. Full circle. Yeah, that's it, dude. Just in the office. Yeah. And a lot of people, a lot of people will say things like, well, how do you build a great culture? Well, you can't build a great culture when you don't give a fuck about the people that work for you, bro. And like, that's most places. You know, they're like, how do you get all these people to care and do? Well, I mean, bro, listen, let's be real. You don't give a fuck about them. You don't teach them. You don't sit with them. You don't help coach them. You don't give a fuck. And they're not going to give a fuck. You give what you get, you know, and that's reality. It's in life and business. And I think it's a universal biblical truth. Yeah. So that's real, bro. That's real. Well, guys, Andy, that was three, man. All right, guys. Well, let's try to Monday. Yeah. Let's get out there. Let's make some shit happen and see you tomorrow.
