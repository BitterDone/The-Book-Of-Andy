Yes. Look at like what are the seven stages of like coping or what it what is it? There's like yeah, I'm I'm in the acceptance You know, I'm just like watching like Joe Biden. It's just like I'm early even I'm like, okay, it was just another day in clown world like the other day. I was I came across a clip on YouTube from I think it was the ambassador to the US if you're creating ambassador to the US Is a transgender person? Oh my so is it is it? I saw that It's not like the like the best thing that could happen in clown world like and this person is in charge of Debunking propaganda coming from Russia. Yeah, a person who doesn't even accept his own gender. Yeah, who's delusional Who's who's filtering through what's true? And what's not true and I was like I send it to my friend I'm like is this not the most perfect ambassador that we could possibly have a transgender woman the bunking Russian propaganda and saying the Russians are lying Meanwhile, you're pretending to be my gender. So that's where I'm at. It's just like it. It's just dude It's so weird. I'm a clown world enjoyer. That's what I am. It is it is weird. It like I go through my days like some days I'm angry and you know for a long many years for many many years My leather bound books. I was very angry. Yeah Now to the point where it's just like all right, whatever's gonna happen happen I'm not going along with any of this. Yeah, if you guys want me to you're gonna have to kill me That's it many days. I wake up and I just feel like they just keep fucking with this. They are That's what that is. You know, I'm saying like and every day I feel like okay. Well, that's got to be it No, then tomorrow comes you know, I'm saying like fuck man Listen man, you got to understand like people have a hard time understanding like how deep The demoralization destabilization process goes like they're their goal is to make people not know In their own minds and hearts. What is okay? What's not okay? What they can say what they can't say What's true? What's not true and they've successfully demoralized and confused A Pretty good size of the population. I don't think it's a majority. I think most of the people realize it's bullshit But I mean like it yeah, oh no for sure, but like we're at a point now where I mean From what I could tell more and more and more people are starting to realize like this is absurd Like yeah, I'm also I'm also to the belief too. I used to believe that this with the demoralization aspect of it that like You know think of like a fucking account right like they would let us get down to maybe 20 percent You know i'm saying and like now i'm to the belief that like no, they want us at fucking zero. Oh yeah like complete drain Yeah of everything. Yeah, you know, and i'm like man like and it's becoming more real every every single day man It's crazy stuff. I mean, we're I know where this is I don't know if this is one of the surfing internet topics, but Uh, well, we cruise the internet. We surf the internet. That might be that's for California version. That's not political I don't know how we don't do that and get all deserve. Yeah, we surf out here in Mississippi Yeah, I think that the you know the next phase Yeah, if we had an appropriate title, we're in St. Louis. If you drive by the internet Seriously Anyway, sorry. No, just that I just you know on the way here actually I screen grabbed Um, how there's 14 u.s. Cities that currently have committed our committed to the climate change Something I forgot the correct title. I saw that banning cars Uh told my 2030. Yeah, three articles of clothes No meat. Yeah, Austin was one of those cities. Miami is one of them. San Diego is one of them. Miami is one of them Yeah, what's what's happened to Miami? It's I'm I remember we were talking before this started It's like one of the they have chosen Miami as like the new like Dubai They're doing a lot of like insane like Extravagan luxury like construction and bringing all these stuff here into Miami But with that, it's gonna come like The the people that are driving this agenda that people want electric vehicles and green, you know, whatever Um, I think my partner Bella She was just telling me how there's a company knocking on doors around her neighborhood because they want to put their solo panels on people's houses For free, but why is that for free because it's a government incentive a program and um, it's just they want to turn it into like a green Economy that's really what it is and with that has its consequences, you know in France and even in Colombia There's days that you can't drive your car. You can't drive. Yeah, or you can only and only calves can drive like a certain range, you know And it's just you're you're gonna have like water limits People are like how could they how could they limit the water? I'm like they'll put a little thing that will stop you from getting water out of the fossil Like people have no idea how bad it's gonna become because of climate change. Well That's how bad they wanted to become. I don't think they'll actually achieve that Yeah, I don't think I don't see it happen. I think I think more and more people like look dude five years ago Nobody would stand up in public and say climate change was a hoax. Now you have a presidential candidate on the stage last night Love him. Pay them no opinion right now for me but uh Ramaswami is that how you say his name? Yeah, I'm a swami What you asked me for bro. I don't fucking know. You guys know what I'm talking about bro He's asking because the young guy with the guy here. Yeah, that's why Yeah, I figured you I figured you as a brown man would know the name like bro I don't know the name not brown enough Look man The brown dude with the big smile that everybody likes right now. Okay like bro He fucking stood up on stage last night. Yeah, and by the way, I think he did a great job uh, he said Straight up the climate change is the hoax He's like and he started saying exactly what it is and talking about how it was you know It's communist in nature. It is no 100% that's all it is it is people who buy into the climate change dude they are some look man They've pushed this so hard. It's really really hard for people to realize that they've been completely lied to about So there's a lot of people who are like emotionally attached to it. I'm not saying that we don't care about the environment I'm not saying you know, let's Not care about cleaning up the oceans or let's Nobody thinks that nope when we say climate change is a hoax That's now what we're saying. We're saying. Okay. Yes. We should be environmentally conscious Yes, we should do things that make sense but What they're trying to do is take that and turn it into this moral and ethical attachment Where economy yeah, no, that's what it ends up being about. It's not it's about taking the economy from oil and gas Which a whole bunch of people own and have owned for a long time. There's some of the wealthiest people on the planet And they're trying to move the economy from oil and gas to green energy of which all these politicians Entirements and world economic foreign people all own these companies So they're using their legislative power to to to villainize oil and gas which people that don't understand oil and gas oil is a renewable Resource. Yep. Okay, like it's being made right now in the earth like this Yeah, like It's the most renewable resource like this shit that they're pulling out the lithium and the cobalt and all the materials to make these batteries Guess what that's not being made anymore. Okay, so like when we talk about the renewables They're actually selling it's the same thing they do with everything they completely backwards lie about it But anyway, it's exactly what you're saying Linda. They're taking the economy that's existed off oil and gas for you know 120 years 125 years or so and they're moving it over to electric of which they are Financially incentivized to do because they own the stock and all these companies and that's the entire play of what's going on And they're also using That play to not just enrich themselves, but then encroach on our rights and then limit our rights and our freedoms And impose control on the world not just the United States of America That's the biggest thing because they'll have the ability to flip a switch at any time Whether that be your car whether they be your house. Oh, you're saying something that's out of line politically cool No more car for you, right? Like people think that's people think that's conspiracy. That's already happening in other places Yeah, already happened and once they put the nest of dangerous thing because once they put the foundation in Like it's not like, you know, okay, everybody all electric cars no more gas cars Immediate control. That's not how that's not how they work it. They put the infrastructure in first Right, and then once they start seeing the trends of of the centers That's when they snap the fingers and turn a little switch. Yeah, you know, so I mean it's real shit, man It's dangerous, but I want to talk about something real quick before we get into our headlines you guys You guys kept saying talking about these this hoax right climate hoax.

So How is he top down on truck when down truck wasn't in it. Yeah, I don't I don't know all right. Yeah, I don't know But I mean that's the UK man. Yeah biotech entrepreneur. That's what he is. Yeah, dude dude. I mean he's got money. Yeah, he's a wealthy guy loaded. Yeah, loaded um biotech this is a daily mail article reading biotech entrepreneur Vavec Rama Swami won the first Republican 2024 debate on Wednesday evening according to an exclusive poll For dailymail.com beating out Florida governor Ron DeSantis by the narrowest of margins He put up a combat of performing trading blows with opponents such as former vice president Mike Pence Who seemed intent on cutting him down the size and made him the focal point for much of the debates. So here the polls Okay, I guess daily mail since this pull out who had the best debate performance And it has Vavec at 28% Ron DeSantis at 27 Mike Pence at 13 Tim Scott of eight Nikki Haley at seven Christ Christy at four Doug Burnham at 3% that's an orthocoder. Yeah, right. Yeah. He's also loaded. Yeah loaded Also Hutchinson at two percent And then 9% of the people said that they didn't know well Hutchinson isn't that the guy who on a presidential debate stage? Where's the flag of two countries? And so just the American flag correct. That's the one. Yeah, so so that makes sense Why you got two percent dumbass? You're trying to be the president of the United States and you're up there wearing a flag of no Israel Israeli flag and a and a fucking American flag Like sorry bro. This is America We're just so you know that You're crannies and you Israel, but we can talk about that later. Yeah, that's a fact. Yeah, it's actually actually Ukraine is the original is If you want to get tired Why? Well, because uh, that's the homeland of of Kazarian Jews used to be called Kazaria. Okay, let's see where you're going. Yeah, so Anyhow, yeah, so I mean since you got two percent dumb fuck Don't wear another country's flag. Christy doing the Senate the Senate the Senate anti-Israel statement If you're you're wearing the flag of another country. Yeah, the stage should be president of a certain country People are not going to like that. No, I would we were actually at a party last night You and me where the debate was on and the fucking without me are you saying a fucking word to anyone Every single person's like why is this dude wearing two flags on them like Maybe rethink that strategy bro. Yeah Yeah, it just didn't make sense man like Believe it or not you be surprised how many people actually consider Israel to be an extension of America to that point Yeah, if there's from israel, there was people that were upset at me when I was talking about the Each week two six nine, which is the anti-Semitic anti-Semitism law that they pass in Florida the sas Legislation and I was like Round the census went to a foreign land to sign Florida legislation, you know how terrible it is and people were offended by that Jews were offended by that And I just just even jellicle Christians were offended by that well And it's just like I'm like I don't care what you believe in. I don't care what your religion is I don't care where you were born or if you think that Israel's our greatest ally you don't sign Florida legislation and any other country I would be just upset is if it was in Saudi Arabia in Colombia and Peru in Bahamas That's the point. That's the point. That's the point That's the point. If you point out That there's a large number of the government That actually has dual citizenship between United States and Israel And you point that simple fact out you get called an anti-Semite. Oh, yeah Okay, well that that's not anti-Semitic to point out a fact That's a fact okay, and in my opinion Nobody should be serving in the government of the United States America that is a dual citizen of any country And that doesn't that's not an anti-Semitic statement Look man, the anti-Semitic thing is the same thing as the racist thing. It is okay. It's been it's been overused It's been overplayed. It's been it's a it's a societal weapon to to protect From being able to point out actual facts. Right. So you know, and every most people know that and they Decelectively choose win and win to attack win and where to attack people for it And the reality is is dude like it's not it's not a racist or Sexist or misogynistic or anti-Semitic or any of these labels to point out actual facts. That's just facts. Yeah, and The social weapon of language is is out of control But I think most people are starting to understand, you know, anyway Yeah, Aisa Hutchinson somebody told you some bad ideas By the way, did you not notice like how every single Dude up here were the exact same outfit? I don't even know what he looks like Mm-hmm. I don't even know who he was That's a stylus decision right like every time these like people run for president They always get like a campaign stylist And like you know, they do all they have all this research and psychology research like all these colors will Every dude was wearing a blue suit with a red tie with the red tie Well, they know why you know why they did that because Trump wears a blue suit with a red tie And they got they got they have they spent literally half the debate talking about Trump too. They did oh, yeah Oh, yeah, they got on the they got on the discussion of Who would support Trump even if um He was in jail Or being in diad if he became the presidential nominus Was raised his hand immediately which I thought was cool And then everybody else kind of followed his lead after skin and then DeSantis was like the last one like one of the last ones in his head like he was like Yeah, really can you see my hand up right? All right, dude. I said this when DeSantis started up and I we got we got this on receipts like bro You got bad advice. You should have listened to someone that has knowledge on strategy You should have shut up you should have supported Trump and you should have sat in the back until 2028 and you probably would have been like the automatic guy in 2028 And now you've created room for this other dude Vivek to come in who's 38 years old He's self-made successful multi-billionaire Um To come in and start gaining people's hearts and minds and he's doing a great job. The dude's got a big smile. He's highly likeable um You know, I I don't know anything about him. He came out of nowhere But I'm just saying like why give your competition the room to do that that just doesn't make sense You know anyway, what do you think dude? Yeah, I mean There was a couple of interesting things that that I saw as we read that party um He's starting to get like Compared to Obama. Yeah, Vivek is and it's a little interesting and like to the point that like he even opened his debate With a Barack Obama Quote So this hell I'm ready to Vivek. Ramaswami ripped one of his debate one line is straight from Barack Obama um Ramaswami introduced himself as a quote skinny guy with the funny last name after receiving his first question from moderator Brett bear Um in Milwaukee on Wednesday the phrase echoed Obama's own choice of words when he introduced himself to the country without delivering the keynote address at the DNC convention in 20 2004 here's a video of the vex into introductory A monologue I guess you can call it here it is uh mr Ramaswami Listen to all of this. Why should voters choose you over more experienced politicians on this stage You're basically, you know a blank slate for people you're 38 years old You've said that you only voted in two presidential elections before this moment this political race So first let me just address a question that is on everybody's mind at home tonight Who the heck is this skinny guy with a funny last name and what the heck is he doing in the middle of this debate stage I'll tell you i'm not a politician Brett you're right about that I'm an entrepreneur my parents came to this country with no money 40 years ago I have gone on to found multi-billion dollar companies. I did it while marrying my wife a porva raising our two sons Following our faith in God that is the American dream And I am genuinely worried that that American dream will not exist for our two sons and their generation Unless we do something about it And I do think Brett is gonna take an outsider because for a long time We have professional politicians in the Republican party who have been running from something Now is our moment to start running to something To our vision of what it means to be an American today If you have a broken car you don't turn over the keys to the people who broke it again You hand it over to a new generation to actually fix the problem. That's why I'm in this race and we're just getting warmed up Very good I'm just gonna have to say it No one's gonna vote for the guy with that last name The red necks in the middle of America are not gonna want a president rama swami I don't agree with that Like we're from we're from the heartland of red necks And I don't think they give a fuck bro I think people just want to be free they want to be left alone Like but I'm talking about in comparison to Trump Oh, dude look this is this isn't no these guys are these guys are auditioning for next time Like Trump's the guy maybe even VP dude just all the numbers. Yeah, that's right and also If something that we don't take into consideration because I'm You know, I'm not an evangelical or anything, but I mean I just read what I see on Twitter Which I think it's the biggest right now political Town Square whatever public sphere um He's Indian and he doesn't share or hintu he doesn't share our religion and believe it or not There's a lot of talk about that of having a guy that believes in many gods or whatever. I don't think that way I this is not my opinion I'm telling you what I've seen from others on the internet when we when we think about America You know America this is where I differ with conservatives a lot you know a lot of conservatives will say America is a Christian nation Has to be Christian and Christian and Christian and Christian How many of the people out here actually live in Christian values? No, no them okay, it's not very much and and the reality is is that America was founded with secular diversity And it was meant to have freedom of religion. I don't The beginning that's why the first amendment says freedom of religion Right people don't get that no the conservatives on the the far extreme conservatives These people will not even hear of someone who's not Christian That's a problem because the reality is this country was founded on separation of church and state freedom of religion and we should Be able to identify and be intelligent enough to understand That someone with a strategic mind who's been very successful in business who's very young who has new ideas And I'm not advocating for this man, but I am taking a side on this um If he has different religious beliefs, but he's got the solutions to the problems that affect us every single day I'm okay with that you know, that's not that's not uh That's not a no vote for me um My issue with with Ramaswami is First of all, I'll say this None of those other candidates really belonged up there They really didn't and they embarrassed themselves by being up there like my Chris Christy is seriously Yeah, he made a fool of himself He made a fool of himself and so did Mike Pence it was unwatchable both of them. They're so old. They're so out of touch They're so like They're everything that they are Dude they're everything everything Gen Z hates about politics those guys on and they're not relatable And the one thing that like I would actually like to have Ramaswami on the show and debate him myself brother to be dope Yeah, I think so because here's the thing. I'm young and I'm also rich and I got some ideas too And I like the sky a lot I think he says the right things, but there's certain things that don't make sense You know he does remind me a lot of Obama It's a performer. I hope you own yeah, that's what I'm saying he's a performer and also But also remember this when you're the CEO of a company and you have thousands of employees You get pretty good at performing because you have to talk to him every day In big groups so like he has the experience to do I understand why he's so charismatic because this is what he has to dream You got to pitch the visor skills that you need as an entrepreneur to run a company that this man is running um So I could appreciate all that But he does remind me of Barack Obama and if you guys who have been around enough to remember Barack Obama that were old enough to remember it Like in 2008 bro Every but like I didn't vote for him But I still rooted for him. I was still like dude. I hope this guy does good I hope he does what he says he's gonna do no And he went into office and did nothing of what he said he was going to do and that's where I look at Ramaswamy And I have concerns because he does He did come out of nowhere We really don't know anything about him and that's not his fault because I agree that we need an outsider. No however It he does give off that Obama vibe. Yeah, and it's also hard to That's what it is. He's fake. Yeah, I mean, I don't know if it's fake. It is fake. You feel like it's fake Yeah, I'm a woman. I could see through these things. It's fake It's it's it's just like 10% to polish. I talked to Emily about it this morning on the car here And I was saying you know if let's say in the event that we actually can put Trump back in the White House I wouldn't mind seeing him Spearheading a an agency. Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing him in the business administration or whatever whatever it may be over the FBA Ramaswamy. Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing him being part of Trump's cabinet. Yeah, or are the head of one of one of our Retail agencies. Yeah, but as far as him Appealing because here's the thing and you don't understand something the people that he's appealing to are terminally Terminally online people if you get out of the online world of the people that are posting hand these influencers People like you and I and whatnot He's not appealing to the majority of the voters in America and real life is what listen Linda Linda I don't think they're listening when I when I talk about the debate here First of all, let's look at the data. I'm a data person. All right. I live and die by the data in business There's no none of these guys are going to be the guy. It's going to be Trump the data says is Trump the polls say is Trump It's Trump, okay? Everybody understands the injustices that are happening towards him everybody the more than attack him The bigger he's gonna get the more powerful he's gonna get and He until his path is exhausted the the fanfare and the support That he has is not going to go anywhere. Yeah, like Trump's the dude. So when I talk about this I'm talking about who did the best of this not that they're better than Trump right With that being said, I think Ramaswami crushed everybody Yeah And in regards to him appearing fake To me, it doesn't feel fake. It feel if I guess it is saying the same thing He just feels like he's 10% too polished. That's what it is like 10% if you watch his Commencement commencement speeches. I was saying remember English is my saying is a great speaker right You you got to watch him from college like I've seen clips that people have pulled up from when he did his vali Ritorian speech or whatever and he's been this way like he has that's what I call star power You know, so he was like the cool Indian guy. That's how that's how my best friend has always been like the cool Indian guy That just like here you go again the best grades in school. I'm sorry I just don't want to see that I'm a kicky-kicks Spirit the KKK Miami But no dude, I listen. I get what you're saying. I I want we DJ and I go watch both we watched that we recorded the Trump thing or we I was going to yeah, I was going to watch when the base was on commercial. I pulled up the Trump in it Yeah, I thought I thought you did a great job. He says all the right things, but like real talk There's things about that he says that I definitely don't agree with Like like for for example like he said in a interview Which was disheartening because it was the first thing I've heard him say that I was like no like that's completely wrong And this is also what made me think that there's a potential for him to like have been like created right So that did yeah, yes because he said in the interview that he did not think that Like somebody asked him about accountability and he said I'm not worried about the past Like I can't prepare for a single he said I'm think I think We should put down the arms and stop fighting we should move forward together and all this stuff And what he was I get that I do get that like I agree with that with like regular people right like the the people on the left or Democrats like we all need to chill the fuck out. Okay, I get that But he basically insinuated That he didn't believe that there should be accountability for some of these crimes that these high level people have created like Hillary and Soros and Obama and like this conspiracy that they've been pushing through So this yeah, yeah, it's it's treason there's treason yeah and and by when you pay to put Uh, you know The country in a terrible spot with immigration or the media or The the the the justices in the you know the judges in these inner cities And you put people in there and you tell them not to prosecute crime so that the crime can go out of control And we do all these destructive things COVID Uh, you know fucking you can rush or you like all this shit Making up a Russia collusion document out of thin air to persecute a president for seven years and destroy everybody's mental health by creating Division amongst society Russian delusion. Yeah, but but the thing is is like there has to be accountability for this Crimes that you can we cannot just let politicians who have served in the past Create documents out of thin air all right and then say they're true and then persecute people And then put them in jail like what's happening literally today. Yeah, all right even lawyers are going to jail right With no accountability. We cannot fucking do that. You know what happened Yeah, we are because and I and I'm starting to ruptue But the reality is that while Democrats are putting their political opponents in jail The only thing there are Republicans do it's like I'm just gonna send a very strong letter again. No, I get that I was gonna send a strong Tweet again. I'm so disappointed. You're not disagreeing with me. I know I'm like we're gonna have a hearing again in Congress No, no, no, no, these motherfuckers need to go in the fucking woodshipper Okay, like dude, there needs to be accountability for treasonous crimes. Yeah, it happened. It is treason by the way I know it is. It's treason. I know we have a we know we have a president of the United States Empower right now who has taken millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars from China And then he's making policy decisions in exchange for that money That is now put our country in the weakest possible position. It's ever been in ever all right We have open borders. We have high crime. We have low fuel reserves. We have low military equipment. We have I mean a million other things right we have a terrorist media. We have Chinese bases being built in Cuba. No, we have we have we have hundreds of thousands of military aged Chinese males coming across the border So you guys know of the Chinese bombers. I'm gonna be the first one gone because I'm in Miami. So yeah, well Look dude that guy that's in office right now is compromised and these people who are acting on the behalf of that man The Hillary Clinton's the George Sorosis the Barack Obama's basically a whole part of the part and by the way There's people on the Republican side too. Okay, we just talked about it We came in but all those people that are going along with all of this treasonous shit They have long ago abandoned their responsibility as servants of the people and exchange it for Servants of themselves and they have utilized their positions of power to create wealth for themselves to create power for themselves And then to commit crime they've gone so far as now to commit crimes against humanity by forcing people to take a medication that is legitimately hurting All kinds of people causing myocarditis causing 18-year-old healthy kids to fall down in basketball courts You know, ask LaBround James about that shit. Okay, let's be real. This is happening It's not fake. It's not conspiracy and these people did this shit And to sit there and say that we need to not have accountability. I'm sorry. I can't that's a that's a deal breaker for me I cannot vote for that I think accountability is the number one issue like I think it's accountability then economy That's what I think look man. We're already all hurting Let's let's clean this problem out for good these people look if we don't have accountability These people will go away for a while and then they'll come back I think that you And I and like us people like Ian Smith like there's like a sect of us who are the very small percentage of Americans I wouldn't even say republicans are conservatives just Americans who C.I. Do I with what you're saying that? We want retaliation and we want accountability. Yeah, it's just accountability right, but it's also retaliation I know because I'm a woman and I'm emotional. Yeah, but that's the rule of law Stuff being done to people all I'm asking for is for us to hold people accountable to the letter of the law But but here's the thing um there's a lot of establishment republicans people that have just always voted republic and no matter who it is because they're just just like the democrats Well blue no matter who right um who want to go back to the time before they were calling them races before they were The Nazis before maga before all this bullshit was going on before the daily drama. They want to go back to that So they're kind of saying okay, we leave the democrats alone and we don't hold them accountable for whatever Like the Clintons the Obama's of the world then you're gonna leave us alone. That's not gonna happen I know that's not gonna happen. See that's that's the one. No, it's not they're misunderstood listen You know how you lose a battle. You know how you lose in business You know how you lose a war you lose by underestimating your enemy and not understanding what the true intent is And just because you're a good person just because you think that like Live and let live and take the high road. You're not understanding not you but yeah in general they're not understanding that This is Bolshevik communism in the United States, okay And if you go read about Bolshevik communism They kill the opposition the minute that they have the ability to do it This is part of the play if you go read Karl Marx he talks about this in his book You have to demoralize society after you get control You remove all the intelligence you remove all the doctors all the educated people you remove all the artists And then you create a society of servitude all right, and that's this that's where they're trying to get to these people Will never stop until it ends with a legitimate genocide of their imponent That is where we're going and that's going that will happen if people do not recognize that that's their intent And because most of the conservative side of the aisle And honestly 80% of America are good people and because they are Live and let live people and because they believe in other people having the same intent They would have right because they wouldn't want to kill a whole bunch of people They they're misjudging the enemy and the that enemy that we're dealing with right now is Liefily dangerous to anybody that stands against them and so for for us to like say oh, we're gonna take the high road That is not an option at this point in time because if we take the high road These people will regather they will come back. They've been at this for a hundred years This is not something they just started in 2020 2020 was like they're super bowl and they fucked it up Okay, so now we get another chance to like stop this shit But the only way it's ever going to be stopped is if people are real about what the consequences are if we don't stop it And the consequences if we don't stop it are death or lifetime imprisonment labor camp That's not me that's historically For anybody that opposes their positions. We already have political prisoners Yeah, look at the conditions of the January 6th political prisoners. They will do that to every single person that resist them They the the munch shots that came out of Folten County yesterday all the The 46 it was like six people I think are at nine including Rulie Giuliani and John Adams. They're all lawyers. Yeah, do you understand the severity of the situation when they're putting lawyers in jail with the bail as high as 180,000 dollars to 100,000 dollars that's actually what's happening right now and You know whether you know Democrats are obviously cheering it on the Republicans are what the fuck but You you're intimidating lawyers into not doing the right thing because first they were disbarring these lawyers and their respective states And then they said that's not enough. We're gonna actually entitan you and try to put you behind bars And it I mean if you're if you're putting lawyers in jail Who are the ones that kind of interpret the law imagine what they're willing to do to us? We're gonna they can't be the concentration camps for back. That's the intent that was the intent of COVID Okay, they Bill Gates is on TV saying COVID didn't go the way we thought it was gonna go But next time but next time no, but he said just recently he said you know COVID there was a lot of resistance that we didn't account for because they No, shit they account for kidding me. They were planning on a much smaller pocket of resistance And they plan on social support to remove that resistance at that time. That's why there's camps built in Washington That's why there's themic camps all over the country. All right, they're already built all right These people were counting on a very small group of resistance the first time around and if if we hadn't have stood up There would be a group of people in these camps right now and it would all be us and They would be doing shit bad shit to us and like bro You have to understand the brutality of how they execute people too. They don't just like Star view or like kill you or shoot you. That's how these people work They work on intimidation. Okay, so some of the Bolshevik revolutions that have happened in the past Dude the way to kill people is the most brutal Disgusting painful ways that you could possibly imagine and I'm talking things like cutting a person open stapling their intestines to a pole and then making them run around the pole until their dead and holding their family Gunpoint to make them do it That's the kind of shit Bolsheviks have done and that's the mentality of the people that we have that are On this far progressive movement. Yeah, what I think it's funny is when when they go on their Delusional state and then they start condemning other countries for alleged allegedly committing Human crimes against humanity. Yeah crimes against their citizens and they're like you know we we condemn Russia for x y and z Where can I mean? I'm like are you fucking kidding me right now? Yeah, like we have did you guys see the pictures of the Generaries six prisoners that were just released like Like she's on the cotton show when they're in a little we're in there in a freaking shoebox They have to take a poop in a a mop bucket. Yeah, that's that's the condition of our citizens. Yeah, you know, and oh no We're the third world country and what's important? I think Andy for especially for the publicans to understand is that The blacks haven't been wrong with they've been saying that our justice system is fucked up their execution has been messed up The elems not of something that we're proud of but when it comes to their justice system is bad We need to fix it. We're seeing that right now with our own president. We're seeing that with the generator six Allege is right now we can admit that there's a problem. Yeah, it is a mess of judicial system It is extremely fucked up Because we have people right now because of the patron act who haven't even seen a day in court There's no fourth amendment the the Constitution has been ripped apart This people haven't even gotten a dean court and they're waiting for a date. It's been three years three years Yeah, real quick. I want to point something up before we go to our next highlight. I know because You gotta get moving but I wanted to point this up last last point on this topic. Did you guys see the numbers of these debates? So I don't even bother honestly. Yeah, so I mean it's pretty it's pretty incredible So we all know that that Trump did not attend these debates, right? I mean, he decided to do a one-on-one interview with Tucker Carlson on Twitter on x But the numbers are in And it's ridiculous It's it's ridiculous So we go to the debates Well, just so this is on average, okay, so so Fox News and this is average up until the day before the election So as of Tuesday Fox News typically gets about 1.5 million views And their prime time airtime Now they're claiming allegedly Okay, that for the debates they received an impressive 50 million plus views Okay during their debates Yeah, I don't really know how I feel about that but maybe maybe okay, but let's go over to to Twitter and see where those current views are Um on on on the truck crossing the Trump interview Currently sitting at 200 and 29.6 million Well Well, that's just more data as to what I was saying like Trump's the guy everybody fucking knows it Yeah, that's almost all the country Yeah, actually it is that's almost all the country it's all the voters People definitely all the voters. Yeah, but I mean do they gain like fucking it was it was almost like 60 million views and just the first like 23 hours. It was insane Yeah, I just thought I don't believe that the other debates got 50 million. I don't believe so either No, I don't realize and you know My own friends will argue with me about this and we'll debate it that the president Trump is actually the most loved president That has ever existed number one and around the world and you know where you see this TikTok This is why I talk about TikTok someone Well, I haven't done it in a while, but I do because on TikTok, it's a decentralized up And you get to see how other Countries that make content about Trump react to Trump and when you go to the comments these are in bots these are real people you have uh Even Muslims have accounts that are pro Trump Videos go viral you go to the comments 90% of those comments are all positive people bring back Trump. This is my president. I miss Trump listen people people recognize that what's going on and Even people from the other countries like look dude. Here's the reality If Trump Doesn't get in the free world ends Which is already ending. I know bro But every listen That's the truth Okay, if Biden wins or Gavin Newsom wins this crazy shit that they're doing will continue and accelerate Tenfold over the next four years just like any other presidential Campaign the last four years is when they do all the work. All right, so you will see shit Here that will legitimately ruin America and we'll probably be conquered in that time. Yeah, so like this this like huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, this election here People people not just Americans. I actually believe that people in other countries recognize it more For what it actually is than what Americans do because of the amount of propaganda that we have here against him People in other countries recognize certain things they recognize that America's the country that has the most arms They recognize that America is the country with the strongest military and we are still that country But they make us think that we are not that country all the time on the news. Why do they do that? Well, that's called demoralization That's why people don't want to enroll in Darmin. You see the numbers. They're doing that on purpose It's really bad. Yeah, the reason they post these trans Generals and this trans shit is because they're intentionally trying to keep people from the marketing They're they're marketing. Yeah, but look here's a mistake people are making Linda that people are looking at it saying When they're bad marketers actually they're perfect marketers because they're getting exactly what they want You're assuming they're not the majority that you know, no people are people have a huh people cannot understand What their actual goal is like if you look at what they're doing and you say That makes no sense that these people just don't yeah, why would it why are they doing this like this is absurd blah blah blah It's absurd to you because you don't understand what they're trying to do When you switch your perspective over to they're trying to destroy the country and weaken the country in every single way possible In the shortest amount of time then all their stuff. They do makes perfect sense perfect That's real stuff man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you think Hashtag debates Drop down there. Let us know what you guys think but uh before we get to our second headline It's time. Oh, is it got cruising mother fucking comments all right. It's cruising comments.

Yeah, so the house committee already knew that but just for the for the record Yeah, for the record Uh, the house committee on the judiciary uh, the house committee on the judiciary is probing Fulton County district attorney Fanny willis regarding her motivations for prosecuting former president Donald Trump Jim Jordan uh, the chairman of that committee uh, Rodel letter Sent that down to Fulton County um, and it's long but he listed out three main points that he attacked Fanny on the first one being um, the then White House chief of staff asking for a minute. This is so he's basically explaining why This whole thing is bullshit. You said it listed out three points. So first The then White House chief of staff asking a member of Congress for the phone number of the speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to Then president tweeting that hearings in the Georgia legislature were being aired on a news channel and commenting on those hearings and three numerous acts taking place in other states not involving the conduct of the 2020 election in Georgia Or the counting of the votes cast in Georgia Uh, you're a diabetic prosecution implicates substantial federal interest Uh, and the circumstances surrounding your actions were a serious concern about whether they are politically motivated um, he listed out Three actions. He told her that he uh, he had to submit all documents and communication referring or relating to the Fulton County District Attorney's Office Um, since January 1st of 2021 Um, all documents and communications between the Fulton County District Attorney's Office and the DOJ because there's possible little corroboration there between the DOJ and Fulton County District Attorney's Office All their emails communications all of that stuff has to be revealed Um, and then any communication between the DA's office and the federal executive branch Regarding this investigation and they have to turn all of that stuff then by September 7th Um, well, we'll see how that goes They're really scary committee. Yeah, for sure. I mean, but here's my thing that I've always worried about right there When they put these subpoenas down to get these documentation and stuff right like What's to say that they're actually going to be getting like like roles? I'm if they could have destroyed a bunch of stuff That's what I'm saying and like how do you actually like how would you actually be able to tell if what they're sending is all of it Or it's also something happened with the people that pushed the Russian collusion homes. No There's never any strong words and Madgates comes out and all these people I like I'm not saying in general that they come out Nothing ever happens to them, you know, I think and we broke this on in our podcast and the and the first slide that you showed Which really scary about this indictment and the one in what was the other not the Florida one Not in New York. No, the Washington DC. Remember when he was in DC? Um, they're trying to criminalize free speech Like when they when they when you look at the 96 pages of this indictment Um, and they go through the acts of the crime committed allegedly Um, they talk about you know, the president tweeted that people should go watch the reporting live on one American news network Which by the way was banned from the directivee I think Um, the president tweeted that people should go watch newsmax like how how is that Uh, a crime. How is that even listed as an act that's part of this case? Yeah, they're trying to criminalize free speech Well, you know, and the same and the same thing with the indictment in Washington. Do you see as a bogus and banana? Yeah, we'll see how I look at this Linda is that I look at this is that they are trying they don't care about the optics Don't care about what we currently think about any of this. They don't their goal is to they are writing the history books For the next generation. They're writing they're writing the history books for the next 55 here Right, so that way when our kids and our grandkids look back. This is what they're going to have to see They're going to see, you know, they're going to see a president that trying to over throw the judge Right, and that goes yeah DJ there's more to that too like that goes into the You know the January 6th visual that they did where they had all those people and it was broadcast on all the news networks And they had a candlelight vigil on the anniversary of January 6th And you have yeah, and you have Kamala Harris saying December 7th 1941 the 9 o'clock 9 September 11th 2001 January 6th 2021 like listen bitch Let me tell you something Nobody out here fucking thinks that those are the same things. No anybody that you're that's just that's That's That's them painting the Future history books So that when we go back and Google it your kids and they go back and Google this or like look at the visual look at this look at that and they okay So If that's the case All right, and that's the history that they're this is going to make my point that I made earlier If that's what they're planning on doing what are they planning on doing with the people that know the truth You Camps okay, they're planning on removing them from society somehow they have a plan for that I don't know exactly what it is, but I think I know what it is and When you remember Trump tweeting that black and white photo where he's like pointing and he says Actually, they're not coming for me. It's they're coming for you. That's never been more clear than in the last three years That's right, and it's never been more clear than in the last three years And now and I'll and I'll tell you this um After they go for the lawyers They're gonna go after news personalities and other people. Oh, they're gonna come after Tucker Carlson They're already harassing those people. They're gonna come after the Charlie Kirk's of the world As we know after the Prager use of the world. That's what they're gonna start doing I don't know if they're gonna go after Prager you, but they're gonna go definitely go after Tucker They're gonna go after they're gonna go after they're gonna go after Charlie Kirk and I'm gonna tell you why because Charlie Kirk had buses of people being bus to Generating shapes Do listen, they're gonna go after everybody. They come they fuck with me Like I could tell you story. Listen, we've had to arrest seven people Between January 1st and today for like harassment and showing up here and like these are all people every single one of them That is like legitimately Mentally disturbed like manic episode Mm-hmm It reminds me of these people who are doing the school shootings. Mm-hmm So what we've also recovered on this show or whether you're the first is that you unformed it's me Software transforms me. It's you. Yeah, but regardless the point is these people are so deceitful and so criminal and so calculated And most human beings do not understand like when you say things like oh well the three letter agencies have a program called mk Altra and they actually use mind control to get people to do shit. That sounds crazy Most people said most people are like fuck that sounds crazy. There's no way. That's not true. Yeah until you see them That's right literally You see them And they are crazy and you're like yeah mk ultra these people these people that these guys They are I don't know how they're doing it. I don't know how it's done But they are taking people who are a certain They're in a certain place or a certain age with a certain background a certain fucking life And they're programming these people to do very bad things I'm a hundred percent convinced because how many are all these people that have come here for them? They're all the exact same Almost catatonic and there's there's too many common denominations that like When add up statistically dude dude when I tell you these people Come off as like hypnotized like catatonic like they You're looking at them talking to them and their eyes are dead I've seen it. He's seen. No, there's no soul in these people because there's shit's been Yeah, and and dude It's a Kanye told us they send them to zombie land one more to the people on they never he said exactly They literally said they want to send me back to zombie land. Yeah, post text messages Not just of his handler which by the way It's the same Hollywood hotline for other people we can get into this conversation a whole bunch of people But also of his lawyer that threatened him with not only sending him to Zambi land, but like you're never gonna see your kids again. Yeah And he told us that yeah, and he showed us that yeah, and he ended up in the hospital In the mental hospital, so let's see that's But when you talk to like if you talk about this in public You know people are like dude like I see it all the time like I see the comments people saying about the stuff that I talk about Like they're like bro. This dude's a real conspiracy theory is holy shit. No, I'm not I'm pointing out things that you just get there so evil and so bad that a regular person can't wrap their mind around Yeah, you haven't seen it a touch. Yeah, that's all that is that's it. Yeah, sure stuff I think one more thing too on this same point the same headline Talking about the optics right so like all of the other died and nightmares majority of them They've all been closed courtroom preceded right? Yep, not not in Georgia Judges allow the local cameras to come in oh my god So crap and so while that's going on the inside. I thought this was interesting to bring up. What's going on on the outside Large crowd gathers outside of folks in county jail waiting chunks arrival. I was able to find this video I'm not dude. I just thought this was perfect I feel like we need to this man that I'm about to show you guys needs to be protected at all costs All right, so here's the video. I'll just play this real quick I'm here to support president Trump You want to know why I'm here to support president Trump because it indeed black me and like this for decades Make up charge and put them so I know Trump is innocent I support Trump. I guess it's corrupt two tiered justices That's why I'm here to show my support as a black man for Trump and I wear my shirt Control 2024 and I mean What do you think about the indictment? Oh, it's a bunch of bullshit. This guy's around the country. You know Fanon's fan and willis. She's a she went to school with my sister. She's foolish So she's a puppet for the white libra That it's controlling everything she's in front but the white libra back that pulling those strings telling her what to do That's what I think about them making a fool of herself. This man you can help his election Our course it is gonna elevate them on our way. I think we should make Trump keen No, I feel No, there's no way that's not we're just gonna make him king, but we still got out with freedom and rights everything You thought that yeah, Trump for king You're on that you're on Oh, my name is for Trump 2020 I'm a former candidate for New York state government the air and gifts of look me out. You know, I got I can scrap too, but I can get down I can't I got a proven track road with rugged are you on try me out? He took it he took it. This is it. This is what I wish to say like this is going this is Going to show Republicans Joe's got a couple plot mother platinum albums that he's produced no, never let him say it. That's right That shirt bad First of all, that's a great point. He makes by the way take away the comedy He's making a great point here. What happened here is waking up the black community Yeah, I know what I'm saying like this is this is and also it's going to show Republicans that these people haven't been wrong Yeah, the justice system is fucked. I don't think I don't think Republicans have ever thought that the black communities were wrong I absolutely they have no Absolutely they have Andy. I disagree with you. I disagree with you for sure. You could disagree But I mean, you're still wrong. No Republicans Republicans don't first of all because here's the thing B. L. M. really destroyed The face of criminal justice system and police brutality because they did a horrible job I basically blame him the white man for everything so then what's the counter reaction to that Fuck these people Fuck your movement who cares? Yeah, but is that is that it is a Republicans? No, I mean, but is that but who then This is the other different viewpoint here. Here's my viewpoint. I'm from St. Louis, okay? What we have a very large black population here And in fact, I would say that our country's been destroyed by leftist policies and our blacks and St. Louis have been destroyed by leftist policies Long before most of the other country and this whole entire time these people coming here And they say the reason your shit is fucked up is because of the Republicans and I don't that's never been true I've talked to and by the way, I don't even identify as a Republican, but I have never heard a Republican say some shit like not Understanding what's actually going on like when I talk to Republicans the ones I know They completely understand that the Democrats go into the black communities at least around here Because it's been going on for a long time The Democrats go into the black communities make a bunch of bullshit promises say they're gonna fix all these problems And they're gonna say you know what the Republicans caused all this shit We're gonna fix it and then they get voted in they go in they don't try to fix it And actually try to make it worse and they steal all the money that they're supposed to use fixing What I'm referring to yeah, but like But I'm saying I think what you're getting to the window like it's so that's my question is like Criminal justice reform that's what I'm talking about I don't think I don't think I've never met a Republican that doesn't agree that needs that happen yeah, I think I mean if you were to say that like they've ignored the black community that I mean that's a valid argument But again, it's only been ignored because they get Beat down for being a Republican because they're blamed for all the problems in those so for example Trump signed the they passed actually they passed the criminal justice reform while we were first right And that he got backlash from the from establishment Republicans Tommy Lauren was one of the biggest ones You can look it up right now who is completely against it in fact the census his the census his campaign is attacking him for being soft on crime We know that's not true, but what they're trying to use is the criminal justice reform Right, that was supposed to help people as as this gentleman Joe said They're attacking Trump for saying some of these guys are getting out most of them are black by the way or Latinos And they're going back to the streets to commit crime, right? Has it happened? Yeah a very small percentage of them has because the human nature and you know should happen But not all of them so there is like the the Santa's campaign and those Republicans I don't want Trump to come back in the very establishment the bushes of the world they attack Trump Over his criminal justice reform policy. I think there's two different thing. I mean I think there's these are two different conversations There's there's what happens There's the the conversation on crime about the crime that happens before those Uh People get to jail and then there's what happens when those people get to jail, right? Like once they're in jail How do we deal with them? Right. I think that's a whole different conversation about how do we deal with them before they get Like how how do we you know that that goes down to the front of the police and all that's right. Well, how do you think it should be? Well, I'm just saying my my point was basically that the Establishment Republicans because you and I Despite the fact that we meet identify with Party we're not like I'm not a Republican. I'm just not a more of an independent. I'm just a human and things right yeah But what I'm trying to say is that the party before Trump That still remains right those various options we call rhinos exactly those people Have been have criticized Trump over trying to change Doing the criminal justice reform that this guy talks about why because the black community has been the most impacted by certain Like the 1994 Criminal act that Joe Biden was part of right. Yeah, so that that's what I'm talking about Maybe I like we know I get it. Yeah, but I agree with Trump's criminal justice reform because Barack Obama promised to do that in eight years and he he couldn't get it done So so when I ask him so when I'm asking is how do you how should it be? Like how what is the optimal in your opinion? Way to deal with the crime that's happening Well, the the crime is going to be localized for the most part that's going to be a state and local issue So when you have this to get turnings or or or or DAs and attorney generals who don't care like for example California, what's the what's the this guy's name does Letting everyone out right if you steal under 950 bucks. That's why we're seeing all these Flashmobs coming in right, so first of all this is a per-state issue. It's not a federal thing to take care of So the people are electing Well, you can talk about voting discrepancies or not, but the people are electing These soft on crime Criminal justice people San Francisco actually got rid of one chose Chesa Boudin or whatever they recall that guy because he got so bad in San Francisco and affect them mostly The Asian community they they gather they got rid of that guy They haven't done it in LA. So a lady's progressively getting worse. I'm sure you guys have a terrible person here as well Yeah, we did we did and they replaced it with another one You know, we we have bad people in In Florida too because it all comes down to local politics, right? So this is a very localized problem when it comes to crime Um, a lot of the like you agree that criminals should be afraid to commit crime. Yeah, I do too Yeah I'm of the camp of cutting hands off for stealing. I'm of the camp of Violin offenders go to prison forever. I'm of the camp of Pedophiles go in the woodchipper publicly. I'm of the camp of treasonous politicians are publicly executed. I'm of the I'm of the camp that that only works If we have real ethical people running play well, that's what the problem is is we don't have that That's why the president of a Salvador is so popular because as Salvador had dealt with 30 years of Gang you talk about a young guy. Yeah, he's turned it around so but what do he have to do? He had to guy. He literally had to break through the two-party system his party which is called new ideas And I must see the ass is who runs The entire government they have 80% of the chamber of of Congress So they can do whatever they want Um, he got really he got rid of all of the Supreme Court justices because he has the power to do that through the legislation The Kamala Harris and United States which I know this is like a dictator No, it's not it's in their constitution. They can do it if it's in their bylaws and they can do it. It's not dictatorship. It's not a dictatorship You may think that way because you want to continue to keep your preferred puppets in each country That does your little favors and allows for criminal gangs to do whatever they want in the country But that only works when you're literally clean house, which is what they've done They take complete control of the government and then he says Guess what I'm going to use the military to crack down on crime. You know, that's what they're doing So if so what's happening in the Salvador right now My friend just ran for mayor in in in in a sense of the war he lost is his first time not a big deal very young guy I'm sure he'll make it um and what's happening right now is that let's say that there's a crime again Very small very very small country. So let's say there's a crime right now in whatever uh in in in in a in a city or in a uh Sector of the city the military is sent in And they will block down that perimeter or that area until they get the guy Out or the guys or the gang members or whoever it is and then people can resume back to their I like that. And so they have a problem with that the US has a problem with that along with international bodies of law right the UN You know the our friends The global is because they say that it's That he's running a dictatorship and that he is um Uh fucking with people's Uh Civil rights because a lot of times they have to go on lockdown to be able to get this criminals out Now you got to believe that I don't believe that violent criminals are entitled civil rights. Okay, they're talking about the Civil right exactly. They're talking about right now. I'm sure if you ask them exact. I was about to go there So when they love it Right of course. So during lockdown we were we were told what what is it that they had to do during lockdown they had to do uh um It's a goal based style. Yeah, I forgot how the translation like when they when they When they go into an emergency and they lock everything down. What is that called? State emergency. Yeah, so they have the state of emergency. So when they say oh it's state of emergency You know a woman was raped and murdered or whatever We're locking down martial law. Yes. Yeah, so they're they're constantly under martial law except the civilians are not really affected like they still have mobility. They can still go to work But you're gonna see the military walking around certain areas until they find the people and when you ask the citizens because my my My uh podcast podcast partner just went with her husband down to a Salvador She's like everyone is fucking happy like street vendors selling stuff on the street can take Bitcoin Okay, these people selling arepas and and and you know Juices and whatever it is that they said they can take Bitcoin. They're finally able to work You know these gang members. We're stealing from them raising their women It's stealing children so they could be part of their gangs and then the government the government officials is so yes So so that's what happened here if you ask the citizens do you have a problem With going in a state of emergency to find the three gang members that rape the woman or whatever killed somebody in your in your little town Or they're like no, we don't care. We're fine with this because we dealt with 30 years of bullshit Having you know losing everything which by the way. How did the 30-year start? Oh, it started with fixed elections I started exactly what's happening now. Yeah so You have to have a very tough hand and when we have been brainwashed particularly the white race to feel bad because Certain criminals are black or Latinos or whatever it is so You know, that's how they got some Francisco to turn completely into a shuttle. Yeah We have to feel bad, you know, this is criminal justice reform and it's social social justice reform You know 900 dollars on anything under 950 dollars was in count people are going through and and stealing everything Know what I noticed yesterday because I wanted to go to Walgreens in in downtown where I'm staying Everything was closed by 830 and I'm convinced Convince that all these Walgreens and CBS is are closed in downtown because of that because oh no, it's not 30 oh no Yeah, in Miami listen listen People have no idea St. Louis because it's not a big city does not get the press for how bad shit is here Like it no in shock. What did you tell us before the show that this place is like I feel like it's like a Baghdad or something like bombs over Baghdad. That's what I can think of Because it is Like I spent a years in Iraq and I can tell you that yes this place is Fucking horrible it reminds me of so you drive through certain areas and it looks like a bomb had been dropped in a neighborhood The infrastructure is falling apart. You move outside the city limits is great Yeah, like so do like once you want you go Ten minutes away from there. She is perfect But it's almost like New York you go to upset New York and you go outside of New York and it's beautiful Get out of the lake. It's freaking beautiful It's the same for almost every single one of this shit hole liberal cities So shit man guys join this conversation on YouTube if you want to join in Hashtag free move or Trump I would that being said let's go on to our third and final headline headline number three I don't know the three reads Wagner boss your vany Progzean Jet appeared fine 30 seconds before crash amid rumors bomb was hidden in a wine crate Ah Interesting Hmm now listen, I think this shit's just about as fake as India landing on the moon What part I was the whole thing. I mean listen. I mean, I did a plane crash. I'm sure You know, but did he go down? I don't know and listen There's some conspiracy theories that are already popping up Counter evidence things like that. So let's just dive into this headline number three This is a New York post article reading Wagner mercenary chief your vany Progzean dooms plane Private plane showed no signs of distress until they sudden dropped 30 seconds before the deadly crash in Russia amid speculation that the rogue warlords plane may have been downed by a bomb hidden in a crate wine The imbra How you spend that? How you say that? Embraer Embraer Embraer The imbraer like fucking you say that guy's name, but you can't say that. I don't think I said his name right I think it sounded like an assade right? Progzean Yeah, sounds like a pharmaceutical drug If you were a lover That legacy 600 is a nice jet. That's a pretty decent jet. We flew on once real nice. Yeah, we even on one. I'm bad Yeah, so it was him and other senior Wagner group members listed them on the 10 passengers Show no indication that there was anything wrong early in the flight Wednesday According to Ian the checknick of the flight tracking site flight radar 24 It then made a quote sudden downward vertical at 5.19 p.m. local time and within about 30 seconds plummeted more than 8,000 feet from its cruising altitude to 28,000 Quote whatever happened happened quickly the checknick said quote They may have been wrestling with the aircraft after whatever happened now. Here's a video I'm sure everybody's already seen it Um for those of you guys on youtube and check this video out for those of you guys in the audio I'll go to any for sell at our economy find them there. Here's the video You think the other one is a little bit of a difference Video just I mean it's a plane crash Yeah That's a plane crash and I mean there's other videos of it like you know spiraling out of the sky So was was the bad guy the world or in it Yeah, apparently allegedly now that was the guy from the thing a few months ago Correct that he wanted to do the cool, which was all planned. Yeah, right Which we we reported here on really if it came out It was a genius plan right, but here's the thing so conspiracies are already popping up online everywhere that this May not be what it is made out to be right and we've learned here on on really off that you know when things like this happen You can't just jump to conclusions right give that time give it time to breathe because there's always more information that comes out And just like in this case There's a second plane Second jet spotted after Prickazins crash sparks rumor Wagner boss faked his death Right, so speculation has grown that prognosin May have evaded the fiery fate after news spread that a second private jet Linked to the Wagner group landed safely in St. Petersburg around the same time as the crash Put it showed the second jet another embrayer ERJ 135 VJ legacy 650 aircraft Landing safely at osteveo airport It's not the first time 62 was mistakenly thought to be dead last month the former US military leader speculated that progoyze was either dead or jailed following a much publicized meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin after his botched rebellion a meeting that was likely fate Now here is the in the most I think the most interesting part about this whole development before we get into discussion This is how that reads expect us Wagner mercenaries threatened revenge march on Moscow after warlords death So purported members of the Russian Wagner mercenary group released chilling videos threatening revenge and a new quote march of justice on Moscow after their leader Yeah, yeah, give me Progoyze and Reportedly died in a fiery jet crash now. They have not identified any of the bodies. They've not confirmed They just have the fight list right And there's been plenty of times like just so people understand how this stuff works. You send a flight list and well before you go on that plane We've had plenty of times where people who we thought were gonna be on the plane getting come but guess what? They're still in the fight long. Yeah, and then it delays the whole thing right? They're like where are these people? Oh, they're not here. Oh, we got to do a new thing right Right, right It's there's a there's a pretty it's a it's it's definitely Not that bad, but I mean it's it's definitely checked for sure So a telegram channel associated with purgoyze's private army released a short clip showing a trio of masked men dressed in camouflage and body armor making vague threats of retaliation Quote there are many discussions about what Wagner would do now one of the supposed mercenary says in the eight second video Quote we'll say one thing. We're already starting off Expect us Some critics have raised questions about the authenticity of the footage claiming it was the handy work of Ukrainian security services Aimed at sewing panic in Russia, but there was no concrete evidence to support that there But you continue to the video Quote today we saw how the little Kremlin filled wiped out you get you've get any Vitrovich the masked fighter says in an altered voice apparently referring to Russia's leader I think goes on to issue a sinister quote unquote order to all Wagner units to retrieve their buried assault rifles machine guns and grenades presumably In preparation for an unspecified retaliatory act quote all of us who have fought all these years are seeing that This devil has played long enough the mercenary adds gain again seemingly referencing Putin Quote await future orders and victory will be ours glory to washia What do we got on this guy? Dude, I don't know No, seriously yeah, I mean shit man. They don't allow us to see any of the things that Putin says on TV Well, so he did make a comment so he came out of we know what do you say? Yeah, his comment was basically like listen like you know You're gevin and he's a good friend of mine. I've known him for a long time. He's done a lot of good stuff He's had um, he said something about having like you know some ill fate um You know, but you know he shared his condolences for all of the passengers on the board if it is true Said Russia's gonna be launching their own investigation Um to determine the the cause The US are Intel services came out and said something about that was a Possibility of a rocket taking down jet Um, that would have came from somewhere inside of Russia, but then there's talks about this wine crate Uh, that was on board um, but the interesting thing with the wine crate is that um His plane was searched by bomb dogs and everything right before they took off So I mean like you know this guy he knows he has enemies. I mean I'm sure he's gonna put in the proper Yeah, right like I mean, I don't I don't know There's just a lot like I think it's just important for all of us when news like this stuff like it breaks Like you can't just jump in one way or the other let's get some more information I just thought it was definitely a weird development Because we do know what we do know is that there's a lot of hands involved in this little pot of honey Yeah, you know look man I have a bigger picture thought on on this particular story because it's so hard to understand what's going on and People need to come to the understanding that we don't know what's actually happening Like we are only told what they want to tell us and there is no transparency. There is no truth We are fed a narrative that is geared to produce behavior that they want and Anything that we watch on TV anything that we watch from our government can no longer be Assume to be true or credible You know when you go back. Yeah, nothing nothing and it's intentionally designed to confuse and Create a narrative that We are supposed to believe and then go along with without any proof of validation from any source and we wouldn't our own government In our own media and our own big tech social media platforms Do not allow us to see full statements of other people's speeches or other people's You know information that they're giving out it prevents us from understanding what truly is going on And they make these censorship You know these decisions the censored things with the idea that You know, we know what's best because we know what's true But the problem is it's creating the society of people that have no idea what's actually going on And then you combine that with this this ideology of you know Up is down left is right Two plus two equals five men or women women or men and we have a society of people that have Creates mental illness because you never actually yeah, you never actually know what is actually true what we believe to be true in 1999 was believable because there wasn't access to so much information so People say well, we need to go back to 1999 or 2000 the way it was then well. How do you know How do you know that what they were saying then was actually true because there was no recourse for the information How do you know that you haven't been being lied to even worse then then you are now Right, we don't know and that's a big problem. There has to be transparency. There has to be truth And the only way to get to truth is through transparency where we're allowed to see what Vladimir Putin saying or what zishi ping is actually saying or what You know these stories actually are and unfortunately, you know the world media has been infiltrated by members of the world economic forum That are intent on confusing the entire world for their own for their own benefit. Yeah, you know They're statement. They're slogan is out of chaos comes order You know like that's that's their slogan and they're trying to make as much kind of world economic forum It's a thing that Klaus Schwab talks about all the time Yeah, I wouldn't I honestly like it's kind of hard to see what's true or not coming from the other side of the world especially with you know, especially in from Russia um if They're gonna bleed if if the guy did die and the event that he is dead him and his uh Other the other people they're gonna 100% blame Putin because this is what they've done time and time again Putin kills off his enemies put him in jail does this does that so It's pretty much what what they're gonna do. They're just what they want you to think of him right. Yeah, right So line with that, you know, I know this is it kind of goes with a conversation just real quick But like you guys have heard of like the eager uh camps in China that they talk about So I've always been very skeptical of that narrative for a few reasons But there was this one time that I was like just kind of bored and wanted to See what people in the other side of the world were saying about that just because I just don't believe it and It turns out that there's a lot of people online mostly on x you can find someone facebook as well That their story is not that they're in concentration camps their story is that this muslim population of that side of China um, who doesn't know the England who doesn't know the language or anything what they are actually doing is Making sure that they learn the language in a skill before they're like Introduced into the general public Which is why they call them like concentration camps. So when all these illegals come to the US We just literally like dump them in the street of New York as we're seeing right now with no housing no shelter no food no Nothing no skills nothing a lot of them do turn to crime because what are they gonna do Sometimes they do get help from the government phone stuff like that So the whole thing is that um, they're they're saying like How could we be killing off? How how could China be killing off the U.R. population if in fact here are the numbers and their population is growing You know here are pictures of them in a mosque like like all these different things I'm not saying it's completely true But I just know that you're saying there's two different stories right and that's the thing that people are refusing to understand right And that goes on all things everything yeah, there's perspectives of the story depending on what part of it you're in so they're Perspective and I actually heard an interview of two women and they're like No, what we we are being Uh Thought the language and we are being taught skills Including like I don't know like sewing was one of them for example cooking bubble blah It's like because they want us When they when we do go out in public we need to find jobs You know, so not to say that China is a good guy's or not. I don't want to you know what's interesting that You know You say that and We think about those things and then we think about who's funding a lot of what's going on here It's clearly China right and then we think about the messages that we're fed here What are we fed here about China through the media? We're fed that China is much stronger than us We're fed that we are weak and our people are weak weak weak weak And their people are strong strong strong strong strong strong strong but when you actually go and talk to someone from China They'll tell you like a lot of this stuff is bullshit You know, so is it possible that our entire media and our entire narrative is being made to believe that we are far Less than what we actually are and they are far more than what they actually are I think that makes a lot of sense, but I think that the the China has really changed in the last 20 to 30 years And the only reason why I kind of believe a little bit of it is because I have friends that actually lived in China Just just move back about a couple that just moved back And what they are is a communist country They're very they're but they have like an open mark and I get take out I don't even know what type of model that is because they do have people can work There is luxury rounds people are my friends were living at the W Hotel in Shanghai, you know like they weren't like Put in like shitty That's a misunderstanding about communism people people don't When people talk about the communism that you see in Cuba. I went to Cuba. Yeah, I should sucks Well, you know, well, well, it would be if there were more people in Cuba So what communism creates is a very small minority a very wealthy people and a vast majority of very poor destitute people And China has some of the richest cities in the world But because their population is so vast they're able to populate cities with their rich people because there's more of them Right, which Cuba wouldn't because they don't have enough people So like what China has going on Is a very small amount of very very very very wealthy people And a large amount of very poor people and that's what they're trying to create here and most of the people here um That you think are wealthy they're not even to the level of wealth that they intend To that look like a lot of the wealthy people here say oh well communism well I'll stay wealthy and everybody will say poor But you're not wealthy enough to make it over the hump they're gonna take your shit too Yeah, and that's why we have a lot of successful people who are kind of turning the other way and they're like Well, fuck it. What do I care if like the poor people get poor? Well, you should care because you're gonna be part of the poor well, though So what happened in Cuba If you go and you see the old houses the houses made in the 1950s 1960s that are run down um when they came in if people have They've you were rich and you had like that say like four different properties like two in Havana and the one about Adela Which is the beach town they give you a choice of like okay you could stay with one house But like we're taking your other four houses. Yeah, well, well look Yeah, but look everybody migrated to Miami how that start though how that start I revolution it's no it started just like What they're talking about here where they're now up in the northeast they're saying hey If you have an extra room consider homing a family right all right, and then that translates that moves into Because they give these people more rights than the actual citizens of this country That leads into a situation where you know You adopt a family and they come in and live in your house and you go on vacation And then when you come back their whole entire families there There's fucking 50 of them and then it's their house and it's not your house in yeah Well, that's what's happening in California with the Airbnb. Yeah, that's how can kick out people out of their Airbnb you can't keep people we have squadra laws here in Missouri where it's like six months to get a squadra out of your real estate Like dude these are all leftist communist rules And they do this because they intend to give and repopulate our shit to those people That's the hundred percent the goal and people will hear that. Oh, that's racist the fuck you talking about dude It's racist to point out that they're actually telling people up in the northeast in New York And these other places Washington DC to take these migrants into their own home who have No idea or understanding like you just pointed out about the Wiggers Of the culture of the language of the skills of anything and you bring these people in and you go away And you come back and all the cousins are there and you go back and it's their house. Yeah You know like yeah, no, it's it happened in Columbia with a million Venezuelans That's whether they're a lot of they did no Salvador They're they're accusing Columbians. I actually had a really big fight on Twitter a few months ago with a Venezuelan Because she was saying like all of the Colombians are xenophobic like we're supposed to be like brother and sister like countries and I was like yeah, that's all cool But the reality is that these what what happened in Venezuela was all the rich and middle class Venezuelans came here They're in Miami. They're in derral. They have businesses. They're well off. They're good They're paying citizens. They don't commit crimes What stayed behind which is the poor people they only had a choice of migrating by what food right where do they go Peru Argentina Columbia, Brazil their neighborhood their neighboring countries and then their poor they come in It's already a developing country like Columbia and what do they have to do trying to crime so where I'm from which is galley They hate them. They hate Venezuelans like nobody wants to house them nobody wants to employ them very different than the perception of Venezuelans in Miami which people really really like because they're Good citizens well, right so That's the case everywhere every every other come listen most Americans have never been out of America No, so like they don't understand like when you go to Europe and you go to like you know Let's say a France France they don't like all the migrants and they are openly racist against it and like it's actually not even really racist It's just this is our shit. Yeah, and these motherfuckers don't belong here and that's that that's the way the world works Like it's not racist to say hey these people who come from this other country who are not contributing to our country We don't want them here. That's not racist Okay, I this is Ramay. No, we're we're wrapping up, but I thought you guys maybe we're gonna talk about In Brazil, but just so you're listening or snow in Brazil nine nine Supreme Court nine to one decision that you can go to jail for Hummel Flavix Lerge I saw that and what was funny. Oh, homophobic slurs. Yeah. Yeah Well, that's that's what they get with Luna It's the Supreme Court, which is super lefty They banned telegram telegram sound a lot in Brazil. They're obviously the ones that also banned Bolsonaro from ever running for president And you know, it's funny that I see people celebrating and there the people people don't think right they're shortsighted All of us not everybody's as smart as we are. Hey, that's fast. That's fast. That's a mistake, but that's just a fact Um, and you know people are like celebrating like yes, you know like you shouldn't be homophobic All these things and like you have freedom of speech, but you shouldn't say the the the the f word. Here's the thing Right now we're under a liberal new world order, but the the pendulum always turns back. Yeah, so when the pendulum swings back Not only are you going to get your right to be a homo and it restricted Not only are we gonna not mean necessarily not only a society going to say okay, we're gonna go to Uganda round Which is that not only we're not gonna allow you to get married, but we're also not gonna allow you to be a free person to express your Your this is how that happens and then hold on and then we're not gonna stop there. We're gonna make it so that's legal For you to say anything about our religion or or Jesus or Jesus Christ So they never think of how the this actually sets the president for the other side. I know. It's really funny It's really cool when you when you think you're gonna A punish the homophobes, but you never think how this is gonna recoil and come back to you And set the president for the fascist that and especially well especially when the pendulum is swinging back aggressively That's what I'm saying. We talked about this I think I got that Randy can sell a guy Yeah, I mean it's happening in Uganda in Uganda is you can you can actually get the death penalty and go to jail and or go to jail if you are openly Uh homosexual there's no homosexuality is banned in Uganda not not It's banning a lot of places. I'm not talking about marriage. I'm talking about you being a going out there if you are known homosexual They will put you in jail. Yes, so and and that actually when you hear them again I have to give credit to TikTok because I only learned about that through TikTok watching the president Live and speaking in Uganda and he says that you know why because of where a kabama He goes for a kabama when he was coming to help our poor countries He wasn't just helping with aid. He was forcing homosexuality on our culture and We're Americans. So we think it like we're all cool with gay people We all have gay family. We're all friends. We don't we don't we're not Discussed by these people or care. We're also 100 years ahead of them. You understand? They're not They're a hundred years back. Yeah, you know Well, it's it's not even a hundred years back It's just there at a place where the pendulum is because this over the course of history Almost sexuality has become prevalent and accepted and then and then villainized Over and over and over and over again. So it's never actually stayed and you know I think you're making a great point This is a point I've made on the show many many times over the years that you know Like like we really think about how the leftists have treated regular people for the last decade in this country It's fucking bullshit. Yeah, okay, like dude. I've gotten called every fucking name. I've gotten harassed I've gotten canceled. I've gotten told I'm a this I'm a that I'm a this I'm a that might for 10 years And eventually people get tired of it. They're like you know what fuck you Okay, and that's what's happening right now and people like yeah and dude and People aren't gonna have any sympathy for those people no they're they're not going to they're not going to protect them They're not when the shit when these fucking people come in and start fucking up fucking up people who have done this shit The far leftist progressives these people who are ruling ruining our fucking society No one's gonna be there to stand behind them single person. Yeah, no pool news people are gonna be like thimoji Yep Real quick to your point. Uh, this one quick numbers over here. Uh, roughly about 3% of Americans have traveled outside of the country Wow, 3% That's why they you know when they want to be racist towards me Whether right or left, they're always like you just literally know Mexico And I'm like lion America's a big as continent. You know, there's there's other countries out there I don't know the same Not every brown person is a Mexican. You know what I mean? So There's a lot more country. Shit man.
