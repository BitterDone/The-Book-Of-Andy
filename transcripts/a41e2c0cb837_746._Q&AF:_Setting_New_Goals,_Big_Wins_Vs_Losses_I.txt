know if you fucking dead that thing it's gonna make it look cooler might make it look better yeah that's for sure yeah well we'll keep you guys updated with pool lessons the bike lessons we'll see how it goes but yeah man let's make some people better all right guys in there got three govans for you man all right let's do it let's start out nice and easy Andy I said a long-term goal when I was younger to become a firefighter I have since obtained that goal and as the years roll on I'm starting to question what's next there are certifications that I can obtain but I'm still ambitious for more than just what I can do with my current job I love my job but I want to continue learning and pursuing something outside of my job that I am passionate about now what are some of your thoughts you have when it comes to just setting new goals and what is something that you do to find other things that you are passionate about in life like I mean how do you expand expand your your your your circle of life I guess when you accomplish something you set out for yourself you know I don't know if I'm the right person that answer that question because I sort of accepted my path such a long time ago that I don't really look for alternatives I don't look for like for me to expand what I'm doing it would just be I want to create this new business I'm an entrepreneur right so it's always going to be centered around that yeah because that's my skill set and I enjoy it like I enjoy the building process of businesses and companies which is why I do it so I don't really look for you know I guess direction changes because I I'm looking for a new passion if that makes sense but I understand that a lot of people do and I'll try to answer it the best that I can you know I think the big thing is you have to ask yourself what do you truly interested in and can that thing be monetized you know a lot of people have these passions but they're very hard to monetize what are you into what do you what do you like what would you like to do what would you do if there were no limitations because there are none all right you have to be willing to start it's where one you have to be willing to start you know with no skills you have to be willing to look stupid in front of your friends and family and now social media to start something new but if you're willing to do that there are no limitations if you're willing to decide I want to do this and you're willing to go down the path and not quit and you have the basic intelligence to not make the same mistake over and over and over again there's really no limits to what you can do so it's really about asking yourself what situation am I in am I trying to come up with a new passion because I want to make more money or I want to be happier it sounds like you enjoy being a firefighter which means you probably enjoy serving people or helping people so what about that could you turn into a different vertical off of what your skill set is right and that's how we need to think about these things because unfortunately we don't have unlimited time to learn new skills seven eight times over the course of our life so when we think about how we're going to make our living you know we have to think about what skills do we possess what are we good at what experiences do we have and what do we enjoy doing and is that thing open to monetization right like just because you like it doesn't mean you could make money doing it now I would say most things you can because the internet allows us to reach little niches that are tiny and do very well but you know I think those are some reasonable questions to ask yourself I don't really I don't I think you got to be real careful with this because this is what we talk about when a lot of people start to get into a career they dedicate some time they dedicate some effort they put three four five years into it and then they say man I don't like this this is boring and I want to start a new thing that I'm passionate about and what they're actually doing is really no different than what people do in romantic relationships right like in the first six months it's like I'm in love and everything's perfect but what you don't realize is that for the first six months both the all are fucking lying anyway because you're trying to get the other one to like you so of course it's great and then you really find out after the six months what's the things all about right and that's kind of the same with our careers we we have this idea of what we want our careers to be like we put in the time we put in the effort and then that newness sorts sort of wears off for us and then some people say okay it's they understand this they say okay well this is not new to me anymore and then they dig in harder on their skill set and that's where the success actually starts to happen or some people will have that same you know revelation about their own lives and they will get to a point every three or four or five years where they'll find a new thing because it got boring right and that's where it gets dangerous you don't want to be the person that has to learn a new skill set every three or four years because you're bored because now you're in a situation where you're going to run out of time before you ever become an expert and it starts to bear fruit so we got to be real careful I'm not against people changing or evolving or moving forward but I don't want people to waste their life by going from thing to thing to thing to thing to thing and then wondering why nothing ever happened because all of the success all of the you know fulfillment all of the real progress all of the money that all comes after it's already been boring for a pretty long time right like in my case I didn't make over six figures until my 11th year don't you think after like three or four years and making no money it sucked but I kept going and I kept mastering the monotonous things the monotonous tasks that were required for me to become an expert at what I do and you know that's where people mess up dude it's so crazy because I was actually just thinking about this the other day too man it's like and I've caught myself in the same thing but I feel like a lot of people you know they sometimes lose sight on the fact that you're worried like that's where you wanted to be you know it's like three four five years ago you wanted to be exactly who you are right now yeah like you asked for this yeah you know like I think that's a different like I got like I've caught myself in the same thing well I think we're all like that I think all of us especially if you have any sort of ambition to drive now there is people that just wake up and they're like I want to do the minimum I don't give a shit right we're not talking about those people but I think what you're saying is probably rings true to a lot of people because we all start to take for granted our day to day life right like if I could look back 20 years ago when I was five years in the business and look where I'm at now dude I'd be like holy shit right this is the greatest thing ever I did it you know and like but I don't wake up every day feeling that way I wake up every day feeling like all right what else can I do how can I evolve how can I grow and so this involvement that this man is talking about I do that every day by trying to just push further and further and further you know like most people would sell all that shit and just go fuck off right the thing is is I don't want to be that guy that that just made money like that's not what I do I have all these people here that I love I love coming here I love creating I love building I love watching them progress I love seeing our customers do that and yes some days it does get a little boring because I've been doing it for so long but at the end of the day I'm super fulfilled by that even though it's not as exciting as it used to be you see what I'm saying and I think when we when we I think what you're talking about here dude is just like a it's it's a misconception of or maybe just an absent mindedness around gratitude yeah right like we we forget how far we've come because we are ambitious and we want to go and and I don't talk about that very much because I don't think about that very much I never like people are always saying to me man do you ever stop and think like and I really don't you know and and the reason I don't is because I'm so focused on moving and getting better and proving that I don't ever stop to think but when I do stop to think I am like damn that's that's pretty cool pretty bad yeah and then I look around I'm like dude what do you what do you have to worry about man like you're you're working with all these great people you create things you build things you help people with those things you're involved in all these different projects on all these companies and doing books and I get to go speak in front of thousands like bro this is fucking amazing you know what I mean and I don't think about it like that every day because that's just my life you know what I'm saying just like your life is your life and the people listening is their lives so I think you know it's important for us to take you know a minute or two every day at least and say man like five years ago dude I would have killed to be here you know what I'm saying I mean it's a very powerful thought and I'm guilty of the same thing you're talking about man it's a real thing the other way I want to ask you two man you just talk about like just expanding you know there's this idea like you know I think about the fire industry man it's not just like it's way more than just you know you know taking your naps obviously they take naps but like you know putting out fires like they're they're still a vertical inside of that industry that could be you know attained you know whether it's creating a new fire hose or new yeah not like you don't think there's always like and you you've honestly made me realize that too it's like there like it doesn't really matter where you kind of point the finger at in any industry any career path any business there's there's a ladder there in each one of those categories that can be climbed yeah bro you know and I think I think it's just expanding that that kind of that vision on that you gotta just think about it like this let's just say you're an auto detailer right and you detail cars for a living because you love cars but after detailing 400,000 cars over 10 years you're like another car right and you start thinking well how can I change how can I do well couldn't you come up with your own car wash solution couldn't you come up with your own towels can you come up with an entire line of the cleaning supplies or a special sponge you know where is that vertical where where is that thing that you still love but could increase the business right and I think people need to think about that you know there's a lot of people that are really stuck and they look around at all these things they know nothing about and they miss the obvious things that are right in front of their face that they have a very deep knowledge set about so I think is you know it's just about wrangling in that feeling of I need to do something different sometimes bro you just need to go like drink a beer bro you know sand like sometimes you need to go to the river and fucking throw a line you know whatever it is you do it's it's you know that's a feeling we all have you know man I'm not really satisfied here that's a good feeling by the way that's that's not a bad feeling because most people never feel that most people like oh grind it out I put in my 12 hours today now I'm gonna go take tomorrow off and I'm gonna lay in bed until 4 p.m. and then I'm gonna drink like it's just this shitty life dude that's the way yeah so I mean you should feel good that you have these feelings and just kind of try to figure out how to harness them the right way so you know you love what you do but you're also making a little bit of money and you can utilize some of the skill set that you already have I love it I love it guys Andy question number two hey Andy I want to start by saying I appreciate all you do for us been listening for a year now and you've given me the best advice for many one literally ever my dream is to own the biggest cattle ranch here in the great state of Missouri and as well as build a career in the banking industry at 22 years old I've just bought 60 acres to run my livestock and on the same day I closed on my land I got the promotion of becoming my banks official agricultural loan officer I wanted to give the recognition to God my wonderful family who've helped me and all and you for all that you do for all of us I wanted to share this hopefully to inspire others if possible and prove that there is still a real Americans out here working and grinding the American dreams not dead my question to you is how do you continue to build on winds and how to deal with losses when they eventually come after you have had huge winds again appreciate all that you do hope this question helps myself you and DJ and everyone listening because it's not about you and me it's about us well I mean look bro I mean you're the loan officer of ag at your bank bro just loan yourself the money and buy all the farmland you can be the biggest rancher in a week you know um I didn't play yeah yeah don't do that oh yeah can't say that can you say that yeah yeah don't do that that's somebody's playbook yeah so um look man you the reason people struggle with winds and losses is because they think of winds as good and losses as bad it's a framework that people just have wired in their brain right when good loss bad and that's not actually true they're both good okay because when you lose if you have any intelligence whatsoever you're learning a lesson in gaining a skill that you will have forever meaning you will not repeat that mistake again most likely so that is the win in the loss and you have to understand that for you to become successful you're gonna have eighty fuck ninety five percent losses and only five percent wins it's probably more than that's probably ninety eight percent losses and two percent wins and then as you get older and you get more experience and you have more time in it the percentage of wins goes up and the percentage of losses go down to where you know twenty twenty five years into something you're probably winning ninety five percent of the time and you're losing five percent of the time just because you have an educated understanding and you have the experience of the time that was you know put into this so I think for people to really get comfortable with the nature of progressing and getting better and improving and growing and becoming something big you have to look at winds and losses both as valuable and not just try to avoid the losses because it's embarrassing or you feel stupid or because you've always thought of them as bad without the losses you can't have the wins because the losses teach you all the skills every valuable thing that you're going to learn and entrepreneurship comes from the losses that you have and so if you try to avoid them you're just slowing down your ability to learn all right so when we think of these two things we should start to value them for what they are and as opposed to looking at them as a bad thing and if you start to value them for what they are that they're both good and they're both valuable I actually believe the losses are much more valuable than the wins the wins are just confirmation the losses fix your mindset around something that you were confused about that's a completely different thing and it's more valuable and if we could just frame this to understand that like you need to end with the yang to actually get where you're going then you don't have to like get over losses right like there's been times where I've lost legit eight figures in one day all right you want to talk about dealing with a loss lose fucking eight figures in one day bro okay lose eight figures in one day and then be able to turn to your business partner and be like fuck won't do that again right and then you go home and you chill and it's no big deal because you you understand like fuck all right that was expensive but when I'm doing three or four or ten times more money than when I'm doing now that less it only cost me one tenth you know eventually that could be a nine or ten figure lesson that I learned you see what I'm saying so I'm thankful that I learned the lesson at eight figures or seven figures because it saves me when I'm at nine or ten you see so we have to fucking look at these things guys as equally as valuable and stop looking at them as one or the other when you actually have to have both and if you understand the value of the losses then you don't have to worry about getting over them dude you just look yourself in the mirror and you say dude I learned a lesson I gain this skill I'm not going to do that again and I'm going to keep going and then what does it matter it doesn't matter at all right so now you're going down the path with a new tool some new equipment and you're ready for that obstacle the next time it appears so when we think about wins and losses try to reframe and understand that losses are necessary and without them you won't gain the skills and without the skills you can't have the wins long term so if you think about it like that then what is there to get over yeah I love the source you to stop trying to avoid these but more importantly expect them yeah brace them yeah how do you battle that though with with the mentality of still hating to fucking lose how do you battle that well I mean look that's that's a great question but what I'm talking about like there's there's micro losses and then there's macro losses and even that loss that I said was eight fingers that's still a micro loss because it didn't put me out of business okay it didn't really didn't change my my position in the world you know what I mean or what we've done or the things that we've invested in so as long as it's not a fatal mistake and you keep going you don't you're selling a loss it's just something I learned along the way you know what I mean losing is this company beat me and put me out of business or you know I got this thing and and it happened to me and I quit really dude at the end of the day you can only lose on a macro level when you stop and so when I think about hating to lose dude I don't think about like the process because in the process of competition just like a race you know someone gets a good start they're out ahead of you right but you could catch up and in business when you're competing with your competitors you know there's times where your competitor is gonna get like a burst just like there's times when you're gonna get a burst and if you're in the game long enough and you're smart and you have the experience you know that those bursts are gonna come so even when someone like gets out ahead of you or you know is doing better than you that's actually a good thing because you can look at them and you could say right what do they do differently how do they do that and you break down their move and then you say okay then where's this going oh it's gonna go here right all right so let's do this and let we'll move ahead of them because they just did this you see what I'm saying so it's very similar to what I do on the show where I'm deducing through my observations where this is going to go and that's how you need to learn you need to learn how to think three or four moves ahead take whatever is working from the other guys think three moves ahead and then that's your target you know and you don't get pissed off just because they're winning right now those are the battles not the war bro there's a lot there's been a lot of companies that that we've competed with in the different areas of business that I'm in that you know they get a little burst and then their owners and they're they all think they're the shit and it's like yeah right just wait dude I've been doing this a long time you know I'm saying you ain't gonna fuck it stop me and and then when you end up passing them because they're all celebrating like I remember one time dude there was this uh this company that we were competing with they're pretty famous but they're out they're out of business now um the owner I remember I remember this very clear dude the owner of the company posted a picture on his Instagram with him and like three of the guys from that company and it said something like who would have known who would have known the view from the top was so good or something like that and I knew right away like right when I read the photo and the caption I was like this guy's done he's fucking done he thinks he fucking made it I'm right behind you bro and I don't feel like I've even started so you're done and guess what now they're gone we're still here okay so you could identify these companies that are gonna fall apart by the way their ownership and the way their their leaders behave when they win winning is expected all right you're supposed to win that's the expectation it's not really something that you should over celebrate like surprise I'm not fucking surprised when I win that's what I expected I'm surprised when I fucking lose and that's an expectation the champions have bro they don't have this I hope I win you know I want like no dude I fucking won that's what I set out to do I'm not shocked about it I'm not surprised about it I did all the work I that's what that was the result we playing for you know and and and that's people ask a lot you know they're like how come you don't get really excited because I expect it yeah some deep shit man yeah I love it I love it guys Andy question number three Andy how can I humble my go to employee oh there's a deep I've been in the leadership position at my job for six years now I would say I lean more towards humility rather than ego I have an employee that has reported to me for the last four years now he has advanced in his position significantly and I'm genuinely happy for him however over the past six months this employee is slowly turning into an unculturable know-it-all I've had conversations with them and limited his exposure to new employees and training because I feel like he is a parasite to my team I've even went as far as stating he needs to consider moving on to a new position Andy how do I humble my go to employee you need to challenge them all right the when when when you have someone on your team who has mastered a certain skill set and they believe they believe and they are good and they believe they're good the way that you get them to remember that they're human is by tasking them with a new task or a new skill set that they need to learn and make sure they don't know anything about it and tell them to go fuck and figure it out and that will humble them almost instantly so when I have someone who I think is you know let's just say arrogant or cocky about how good they are that's typically what I look to do I look to redirect them into an area where they don't know as much and set them free there and usually that brings their their ego into check and obviously I have a conversation about it too you know one of our core values here is be humble another one is always be learning and you cannot always be learning if you think you know everything so you know because those are our core values you know I'll sit down with someone and say hey look I know you're good I know you're good dude but you're not going to get any better with the attitude that you have and here's why and I'll have a conversation with them and typically you know that that usually goes pretty well but at the end of the day you know when you take someone who thinks that they know everything about what they do and your challenge them with something that they don't know very much about it reminds you as a human that you aren't great at everything which is really what it takes for you to kind of reel it back in right yeah so that's that's a that's a pretty good tactic for getting people to to chill out on them on themselves but I've never that that's it's actually great I've never heard that and I think it's awesome you know it's it's weird like this concept of leadership man and like you said you said before like you you could probably do a course for three weeks straight yeah they'll not cover everything oh yeah oh yeah right but one of the things I think is really really interesting is your stance on this is like a lot of leadership issues then it's not it's not the people who are you're leading has the issue it's it's always internal on your own it's always it's always you you know I think that that's so interesting like I you're not giving him enough that's correct that's good it's not a problem with them it's a problem with you look bro every leadership problem is a problem with you you either didn't coach him right you didn't give him enough attention um you know you didn't challenge them you didn't you didn't allow them to develop these things are usually on the leadership now there are people that will come along that cannot be coached that you have to move on from and that's just part of having employees another thing that you can do to help with their humility is you can assign them the task of training other people to do what they do at the level they do it because the truth of the matter is is you're not a very good leader unless you can create new leaders so giving them the task of bringing someone who maybe isn't as skilled up to par is a very challenging thing to do and it typically humbles people and what ends up happening is those people will come into you and they'll say this guy just doesn't have the skills no you're not coaching him right and that's the opportunity for us to like say no this is what leadership's about it's about service your job is to get him to a level 10 you got him to a level seven and now you're saying he's not good enough what's how what does he have to go from seven to 10 you need to help him do that and you push back on him and let him go out and do it and this is how you create a real leader who replicates other leaders on a consistent basis which is correct because that's like that's the complete opposite of what this guy was doing he said he was pulling away from him employees well I mean he's not wrong to do that in the current scenario because he doesn't know how to handle the situation so what he's doing is he's afraid of culture yeah he's trying to create a distance between cancer and the rest of the team because he doesn't know how to mold this person into an effective asset which that person might end up being your best teacher bro give them some responsibility challenge them allow them to actually teach and learn some new things and you know become a bigger part of the team through becoming a leader and replicating themselves bro the highest paid people in the world are people who can take other people and replicate them at a high skill set especially in sales or leadership if you're in sales or you're in leadership and you can replicate great sales people or you can replicate great leaders and managers bro you're you're indispensable you can write your own check it's the most valuable thing you can have outside the skill sets of sales leadership slash management they're two different things but they go in the same category and then the ability to take initiative from the start of a idea to the end of the idea without anybody having to tell you to do thing that's the three most valuable skills you could have as an employee but the most valuable skill on top of that is being able to get other people to do what you were doing at that high of a level once you can do that bro you're writing your own fucking check I don't care where you are people do not understand how valuable that is because it's super rare super rare there are very few people that can take someone else and make them like them and if you could do that dude you know most people won't do it because they're afraid that that person's going to take their job but what they don't understand is from the view up here you're looking at that guy being like holy shit dude I got to pay that guy a lot of money because he can actually touch these dudes and make them great what's that worth right so yeah he will take your job but you're gonna be moving that's right that's right it's small thinking to think there so um so that's that's my take on how to how to wrangle someone in who's maybe a little bit too into themselves you know and obviously too that comes from your attitude right like your attitude should be I got a long way to go bro I'm just learning I'm here every day doing the best just like you like there's lots of people better than me because there are there are lots of people there are lots of entrepreneurs better than you and better than me period lots of them we got a long way to go sort of think we know everything and to think we're the best at everything is is pretty ridiculous thought you know like mastery one little skill set like oh I'm the best at this bro what are you talking about that's one thing like you need to you need to be able to teach someone that you need to be able to replicate that you need to be able to scale that and then we can talk about like real career opportunities you know what I'm saying yeah I love it. Teaching people shit is hard bro that's why it humbles people yeah that's what we saw by me even just teaching them on the bike like it's easy because like I know how to ride a bike no problem around for fucking years I got all the tips and tricks but like I'm trying to convince us of somebody who had no idea it's like that's it's a very very tough thing to do I have a saying around here and that I've used for fucking decades and it's this unless you can teach it you don't know it unless you can teach it you don't know it if you can't go up in front of the group in front of the whole company and teach what it is that you do you don't even know it you don't know it it's invalid it doesn't matter it's pointless so unless you can go up and teach it at that level word for word diagram for diagram with authority with confidence you got a long way to go and people understand it yeah that's right yeah huge deal man that's really people people think that just executing in their job means that they're going to have this totally rewarding career no that's what you're paid for now what are you doing past that right and they have a misunderstanding of how much depth of knowledge they actually have to have to really be great at something and really that comes down to being able to teach it so if you want to know if you're good enough at what you do can you teach it can you teach it in front of 200 people can you teach it in front of a thousand people and they're going to say damn that was eye opening I learned a new thing because if you can't you're not good enough yet I absolutely love it yeah um you want some exercise yeah we do one more you like sauce right yeah I do I don't like salt and pepper now I like to boil my chicken right right right right just straight just straight chicken I love it um guys any little extra sauce here uh hey Andy love the show my question is quick and simple if you were 21 again and you had all the knowledge you have now what would be the first five things you would do the first five things first five things you're doing you get all the knowledge you know spring chicken at 21 what we do I'm doing exactly what I what I do now I'm just gonna do the quickest things possible to get there I'm not you know what I mean like I don't fuck I don't know I'm gonna take what I know I'm gonna make as much money with as I can and build my ship I'm gonna build the exact same thing but I know I know all the stuff that wasted my time bro here's a deal if I had to start over again and do what I do I could do this in three years period get this like fuck yeah guaranteed no doubt yeah because I know all the people and I know all the shit and I know how it works it's phone calls that's all it is hey I want to do this can you help me cool this is how we'll do it hey I you know what I'm saying like this is dude it's weird too because so many people want to skip that part they want to skip that hard part they want to skip the part where you got to grind it out and what they can't understand because they don't have the perspective of being down the road further is that that hard time that you're trying to avoid that you know that you back at 21 when you don't know shit that hard time where you're struggling you don't know what the fuck is going on that is where you learned 98% of the stuff that's gonna make you successful long term okay so all of the difficult things that you go through those produce the most skills when times are easy and things are going well you're not really learning that much you're just executing on the things that you have learned so just like we talked about earlier where wins and losses are necessary and just part of it the grind part where you don't know shit and have to figure it out is part of it and if you go around that part or you try to skip that part or you buy one of these courses online and you know you become a millionaire in two weeks you're gonna not be a millionaire in two more weeks because you don't have any of the skills to grow and maintain it okay so the grind and the part where you don't know anything is super valuable I wouldn't want to go back to 21 years old knowing what I know now I wouldn't want to do that I would want to go through the process just like I had because now I'm sure of those things they weren't just like downloaded into my brain I know them because I touched the stove so many times and got burnt you have to go through it yeah but I mean like dude these you know look man you're 21 figure out what the fuck you want to do start doing it don't quit learn every lesson you can when you mess up and you're gonna get where you want to go it might take five years it might take 10 years it might take 20 years it might take 30 years depends on how big your goal is right my goal is to be an iconic American brand that is like in the conversation with the Nike's and these other big huge brands and everybody recognized that helps the most people that of any company that's ever existed that's what I want to do and that's a that's a lifetime project that's not a five year plan right so how big is your plan you know you gotta stick to it yeah let me ask you this because you know I'm talking about how necessary that grind phase is have you have you have you also gotten to the point where you realize man like those grind times those are also the best time yeah you know I'm saying you had the most like as sucked as hard as a fucking word when you look back that's what you like I mean where where where you find the happiness when you look back on the trail well you know back then when you don't know what you're doing the expectation of winning is not as solid so like back then when you don't know as much and you do win it's super exciting you know what I'm saying and it's fun it's worked yeah it's more fun but as you get down the path like we talked about earlier things get boring they get monotonous and you know you you know you expect the result because you've gotten that result over and over again and if you don't get the result that you expect you just take inventory and you make some adjustments and you go at it again but yeah dude I would say those difficult times were definitely some of the most fun times for sure there are all the times are fun it was fun in the beginning it was fun in the middle it's fun now and you know 10 years from now I'm gonna be having fun doing that too it's all fun it's just fun for different reasons yeah you know but yeah I do I do appreciate you know I think I think people should learn to appreciate those meager hard years more than what they do you know everybody's in a race to get out of that time which is fine that's that's okay you're supposed to but I think a lot of people are in such a race to get out of that phase that they fail to appreciate how much fun they're actually having doing it so yeah dude I mean it's it's always been fun it's just different kinds of fun you know like back in the day we didn't have any money you know we we had limited options on on the fun you know you know I love it man I love it we're guys Andy that was four yeah all right guys let's have a great week let's go kick some ass we'll see them off with CTI don't be a hoe shut the shut roll can't fold doesn't know here's shot case closed
