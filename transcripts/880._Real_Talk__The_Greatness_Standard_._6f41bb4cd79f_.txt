What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realest say goodbye to the lies, the thickness and delusions of modern society and welcome the mother freaking reality. That's the new rules I can't say the f word. In that right. That's right. All right. Today as promised we have a real talk before we get into that though I do want to address something I witnessed a comment on Monday's episode that talked about how the MFCO project has been massively delayed. It's actually pretty funny because who are made the comment said we don't know what's going to come first GTA 6 or the MFCO and I just want to let you guys know that I recognize that that is true but I will also tell you that when you see what we've created you are going to be blown away. All right. And the truth of the matter is as if we started this project probably three or four times from scratch over to deliver what we've created. To deliver what we feel is going to be the greatest personal development podcast ever. So while I know you guys are excited and I know some of you are getting a little frustrated just know that we are delivering something to you that is it's going to be fucking amazing. All right. So just want to reassure you guys. This isn't something that we're taking lightly. You know this is something that I truly care about is something that is important to me. When we talk about personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion. I want to make sure that we were doing everything that we could properly to make sure that we are helping people become the best version of themselves not just for themselves but for the culture. All right. For your household, for your community. For your state and for the country man we can't fix things if we don't fix ourselves and there's a way to do that right and then there's a way to deliver it kind of right. And if you know anything about me kind of right just not going to be the way that I'm going to launch it so I do apologize for taking a while but trust me when it launches you're going to be very excited. So you know and you know that's pretty consistent with GTA 6 too I think right so it's an accurate comment. But guys today I wanted to give you a real talk or I've been promising you guys real talks I've been promising you that we were going to get more into that and I've got one for you today that I think is very important especially for you young guys who are out there listening. Who need to understand a few things one we are coming out of an era where mediocrity has been promoted very heavily and we have to understand that the reason that mediocrity has been promoted very heavily is because they want you to be a victim they want you to be helpless they want you to think that the standard at which you are held in your external environment. Is excellence and it's not okay no great person that ever existed on the face of this earth ever became great by just living to the standard of the external environment of which they were required. Alright and what does this mean this means when you go to your job or you go to your sports practice or you do whatever it is you're trying to do the standards that are expected of you are not the standards that create greatness okay high performers hold themselves to a higher standard than the one that they are given alright that's the separator between great people and average people that's a separator between earning a living. And becoming wealthy that's the separator between nobody knowing who you are and every single mother fucker on the planet knowing who you are it's about exceeding the external standards okay and we think about great people and we think about greatness some of the people that I admire are people like Kobe Bryant alright Michael Jordan Tom Brady and none of those people lived up to the expectations okay Kobe Bryant worked. He worked exponentially harder than what the Lakers expected of him Tom Brady he worked exponentially harder than what the Patriots expected of him okay Michael Jordan the same way he's famous for being the first guy at practice and starting with chess passes alright think about this this guy so obsessed with being great that he starts and perfects every single practice no matter what you are doing. No matter how great he's been no matter how many championships he's won no matter how many MVP's he starts with the basics to become great at the basics and builds from there okay these people are legendary because they understood something that a lot of people don't they understand that what is expected of you from the outside world is the price of admission to the game this is not exceptional. And we live in a culture where we are being taught that just doing what is basic showing up getting it done showing up on time we have people brag about these things and we've all heard this right our show up on time I work hard I you know do what I'm supposed to do yeah bro that's why it's called what you're supposed to do that does not create wealth that doesn't create achievement that doesn't create greatness and we have been propagated over the last 15 or 20 years to believe that just because we show up we are old the results of greatness without living to the standards of greatness alright so we have to set that expectation in ourselves people who become great understand very clearly that they have to exceed the framework of expectations that are put upon them at their job in the relationship with the teams in their community at their sport at whatever it is that they do you will never become great doing what's expected of you you will only become great by holding yourself to a much higher standard than that okay you can't win any other way and it doesn't matter what you teach your say it doesn't matter what you parents say it doesn't matter what your friends say I'm telling you right now if you want to live a great life if you want the world to recognize you as great if you want to make a lot of money if you want to make a lot of money if you want to make an impact you have to hold yourself to a standard that is far beyond what everybody else holds of you okay and that's going to come with criticism that's going to come with people saying hey man you know why you work so hard hey you know you don't have to do that hey you know you need to take a break yeah motherfucker if I want to be like you that's what I need to do but the reality is is that's not you and I know that's not you because you wouldn't be listening to this podcast if it was okay so we have to understand the external standard keeps us average the internal one is the one that makes us elite all right it's the bare minimum to live up to what other people expect of you and you will look crazy you will look obsessed you will look like you're doing things that are beyond the reasonable expectation and that's because you are because greatness is rare all right and when you're living to these other standards that people put on you you have to understand that that's their ceiling they're trying to get you to operate in a way that produces the result that they want and you will never find someone who will hold you to the standard of greatness the way that you can they don't have your own interests in mind they have their interests in mind and the sad truth is is that most people care about themselves and they don't care about you they want you to function in a way that gets their job done without actually creating greatness in you okay so you have to understand dude if you let their standards become your bar for success you can never be great you'll never find out what you're actually capable of you will live an average life with an average income with an average everything and that might be okay for you that might be what you want but that's not going to create greatness all right if you keep looking for someone to tell you to do more or to do extra or to hold you to a standard you're not going to become great dude it's going to have to come from inside you you have to understand that this is really what you're about and it's really what you want because nobody else is going to hold you to this all right the ones that win they do the shit that nobody asks them to do all right and they don't do it because they're trying to produce a result for the person that's asking to do things they do it because they have an internal drive an ambition a hunger to be fucking great to be good better than everybody else that is okay it is okay to want to be better than everybody else around you society teaches us that oh wow you know what are you trying to do you're trying to forget where you came from or you know hey you know I noticed you changed yeah motherfucker that's the fucking point the point is to change the point is to become better the point is to live the life that you want not to bare minimum of what somebody else wants okay so you don't want to be better than what you want to do I know what you want to do is not to be better than what you want to do standard has to live inside of you. It has to be in your heart. It has to be in your blood and it has to be in your fucking soul and it has to be the way that you live. You cannot live any other way if you want to be great. It's about how you move when no one's watching. It's about how you work when you're not gonna get applause. It's not about what you do on Instagram. It's about what you do in reality. Okay. When the lights are off and everybody else has gone home and everybody else has taken a break and everybody else is just doing whatever they are gonna do. What are you doing then? Because that's going to determine what your life outcome is. And the reason I say this because to a lot of you this is obvious. But the reason I point this out is because a lot of you younger people under the age of 25. You've been taught that it is just about showing up on time and doing the job and going home five minutes after the clock and saying, I stayed at late. No, dude. If you want to be great. If you want to get paid. If you want to build something that matters. Create something that impacts people. To live a life that you're proud of and fulfilled up. You have to understand. You're not working for the approval of others. You are honoring the internal identity of the badass motherfucker that lives inside of you that you are too afraid to let the world see. Okay. The real ones out here they don't wait to be pushed. All right. They fucking push themselves. All right. You can't build power. You know on borrow discipline and borrowed expectations and the standards of others. You have to decide what is it that I want and then you have to set the bar so fucking high that the world's expectations feel like a fucking nap. All right. So that's it guys. You have to understand greatness does not come from doing what you're supposed to do. It also doesn't come from being like everybody else. It doesn't come from you know living the life that everybody else wants you to live. It comes from you deciding what you actually want and you saying I am willing to do whatever the fucking takes to create that no matter how hard no matter how long no matter what I have to go through I will fucking get there. And then on your day-to-day standard you have to live to that in your actions. It's not enough to visualize. It's not enough to talk about it. It's not enough to post about it. It's you have to live it. It has to come from your heart. It has to come from your soul and you can't worry about what everybody else is going to think about it because if everybody else is your parameter for approval you're going to end up living just like they live which is the whole fucking thing you're trying to avoid. All right. So guys if you want to be great if you want to create big things if you want to build awesome things if you want to impact the world and you want to make money and you want to do everything that great people do you have to understand that living to the standards of the expectations of other people will never get it done. You have to exceed those and you can't just exceed them by a little bit. You have to exceed them by a gazillion miles and you have to do that every mother fucking day. It has to be your identity. You can't just fake it. If you fake it you'll end up being one of these people that says, well, oh, tried really hard. Well no one gives a fuck how hard you tried, man. That that doesn't matter. What matters is what you did what you produced and the only way to do big things and produce big things is to hold a higher standard for yourself than anyone else holds on you. Now let's talk some tactics. All right. How do we do this? How do we get better? How do we hold a higher standard for ourselves? How do we increase expectations? All right. It's very simple. You have to learn to adhere to the plan that you set out no matter what. That's the first thing you got to have. That's why I developed live hard and 75 hard. If you haven't done that program, you need to go fucking do it because it's going to give you an unfair advantage over everybody else. Everybody else's living life, having the circumstances of their life dictated to them by outside environments, you know, outside variables, conditions, if the weather's bad, okay, and workout, if the pizza shows up, oh fuck, I'll start tomorrow. If the beer shows up, oh, you know what? I'll just have two. They have no control over their environment and because they have no control over their environment, they're not able to follow through on any plan. So the first thing you got to do is you have to become a discipline human being. And I'm not talking a little discipline. I'm talking 100% discipline in control of your environment and your actions at all times. That's what the live hard program's about. Okay. So if you haven't done it, go do it. You get it for fucking free. That was so 208 on the audio feed. All right. Go do it. It'll give you the biggest unfair advantage you could ever have. And then after you've developed this discipline or while you're developing the discipline, you need to put a lot of thought into where you want to be. Where do you want to be? What are you trying to do? Most people put more effort into making their plans for the weekend than they do for who they want to be and become and create in their life. And when you say it like that, it sounds ridiculous. But tell me that's not true. That is the fucking truth. Okay. So don't be like that. Pick out where you want to be. Where do I want to be? I want to be this. And then work yourself backwards as good as you can into living as you are that person already. Meaning adopt their habits, adopt their work ethic, do the things they do. Roll model their behavior. All right. To become something you have to pretend you're that thing in terms of your behavior before you actually become it. All right. So pick out what you want. Work backwards and behave as if that person is standing right fucking next to you telling you what to do is the person that you admire the most the person you want to be like the most going to be proud of your actions and the way that you're living if they're standing right next to you 24 hours a day. That is a great parameter of your own success. Would Kobe Bryant respect you for your work ethic? I asked myself that all the time. Would Tom Brady respect my work ethic? He's standing right next to me. That's up. That's how you do this. Okay. That's how you should think of these things. Now, if you do those things, if you develop the ability to adhere to a plan, you decide where you want to go. And then you keep the pressure on yourself day by day by day, you will become one of these people that everybody remembers. You will become a high owner. You will become someone who creates greatness. And maybe it's not money. Maybe it's I just want to be great at jujitsu or maybe it's just I want to be great at guitar. Whatever it is, you're trying to be great at. That is the way you should think about it. Okay. We have an obligation to live at a high standard and set the example for people around us because there are going to be people that win or lose in life based upon what they see you do. And you may not think that you're that important, but I assure you, no matter where you are in your life, you have friends, you have family, you have people close to you who are going to look at you and then decide what is possible for themselves. And if we really believe in changing things, if we really believe in creating a better society, the responsibility falls on us as individuals to create that example. Okay. So it's not just about you. It's not just about the outcome for you. It's about what will people do if they see me do what I'm doing? Will they lay down and accept mediocrity and be an average mother fucker and never inspire anybody and be fat and be lazy and be unproductive and be poor or will those people see me do what I'm doing and become fucking great. That's the underlying point. All right. So listen, understand this. The expectations of everybody else will cost you everything. You've got to set your own. You've got to become what it is. You know you can become. You've got to let that motherfucker that lives in your heart, man. That nobody knows about that you know you're supposed to become but you're afraid to. You've got to let that motherfucker out. You got to let him out. All right. I love you guys. I appreciate you guys. Now see you next time.
