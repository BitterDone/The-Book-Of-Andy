You can tell she hates it Bro, she'd rather just go back to assassinating people Oh, we got a guy's distractor from a real job. I got a meeting at 7.30. Yeah, I got out of here. She don't like that Oh man, yeah, Hillary Clinton is very unlikeable. I'll just say it's just so easy. It's so easy to just not like her It's because they try so hard to look like they're having fun when they're clearly not having fun Have they they make they try so hard to make her likeable. Yeah, yeah, that's right. She's not no and so like it's it's just a man Yeah, it's incredibly awkward Yeah, I just wanted to throw that up there again non-biased political Opinions here. Yeah, I mean, I could be a lot meaner. Yeah, you're good. Look, hey, she's just she's just an old lady Trying to still be relevant and it's it's just ain't work, man But why is she in Spain talking to political dignitaries for the reason that when she's not even an elected part of our government That's the bigger question, Andy That's the big ring that uh listen What is she is she making promises? Why why is it these people who are not elected who are not part of our government Are allowed to go talk to other members of other governments? Supposedly probably about what's going on here in America. What else would they be talking about? Where the body's breaking Yeah, man, it's fucked up. Yeah, yeah, just want to throw that in every guys. Let's get to our cruise I remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them There I was that being said headline number one headline number one rates Arizona GOP chairman resigns after leaked audio replaying alleged bribe from powerful people to stop carry lake This was wild and it was wild not because I didn't know this was a thing it was wild if it Finally has been exposed and people are you know, I'm saying they like this is proof like this is evidence here, right um super wild story here, man So let's dive into this. This is a bribe bar article reading Jeff do it chair of the Arizona Republican Party who is at the center of controversial leaked audio allegedly attempting to quote unquote bribe carry lake into backing down Which even eludes to veiled threats from quote unquote powerful people Is resigning from his position citing an ultimatum from lakes team which is threatening to release more audio Of private conversations now. Let's just play a little bit of the clip. You can stop when you want Don't tell people I'm never gonna have try to have me murdered If that stuff that came out last week is right about the cartel stuff I heard the car. They said the cartel's operating in 50 states right now so So what what what's going on? Who is it what? We get to Let me just say that I just say that people call around Saying Gosh, you know they can't be said never be said. No, don't because they I got offered to buy up Yeah Because I'm we lose our ability to get things done Other things future here's this my problem Rather than just say let's work with her. She's a great candidate Because they don't own me and it pisses me off Yeah, I said I don't know what's my ownership It's about control I know it's back control It's about Being on the team I guess that you don't need they want to be on the team They want you to be on their team But if the pushing is globalist agenda, I can't do that. So what do they want what do they want me to do? You want to stay up to this What and tell you what I got to do But As I said you can do it every time talking head this so the ask of me was it's kind of fun So the the ask I got today from back east was There's any companies out there something that could just put it on the payroll and give her to keep around and I said Well, what do you want to do? Whatever we need to do. This is about defeating Trump And I think that's a bad bad thing for our country DeSantis is not America first This is about the final Death blow to Trump and I don't think that's good for our country It's not good for a country, Jack It's not the same time I'm not even sure Trump can make it I don't know the deal I think where it really comes out to a lot of people It's only by the control of gender. It's about the ability to raise mind to it If you really want to know all of those public sports And even on there what makes them an awesome? I know there's all these consultants don't want They're pay they don't I don't want to make a deal with these kind of people This is a hill worth dying on I am not if they're going to steal the election to make me and our our movement go away I'm not letting him do that. I owe it to the people of Arizona or to carry their torch and their voice You don't go away I'll put you past This is the battles right now, Jack No, the battle is right now The battle is right now and we don't have time to pause on this battle bill You're not What you can't scratch this It's not pretty. Yeah You're not And they're sitting on people that have something to do It's just it's it's a it's a fact That's all DC is it's a big discussion You're no you're no position to scratch your body's back and you've already made it known that if you get the And especially respect I all scratch people's back. You know, I was I've been on the out to a lot of people for a long time Because I'm scratch my ass. You know Where are we in two years If they steal the election again Listen to what you're saying Why don't we do something about it so that we the people can pick our what can we do? I'm not willing to accept that then I'm going to be the biggest Pain in these people go back and tell them that I'm running And I'm going to be the biggest pain in their I know It goes on it's about a 10 minute conversation hold on you miss the fucking most important part Yeah, do you have it? I mean that I got the whole clip. That's obviously I just let me know when you want Yeah, the most important part is he goes on to to legitimately offer her millions of dollars 10 million 20 million 30 million And she says no Just to say Is there a number at which I can be bought What it's about you can take a box for a couple years no like a right back to where you're No 10 million 20 million third no no no a billion no This is not about money. This is about our country I think it's disturbing that they would even That anybody would think this is I I'm not to be fair even me even me I'll say this I want fresh weights right now for the reason that I've never seen anyone. I can't think of a single person In a federalist who lost Branding in law Can't think of it. You can think of it. Let me know. I'm not going to let these people who hate our country Tell me not to run you should call them and tell them to get behind me So I'll shit man So in a statement released Wednesday to wit essentially confirmed the authenticity of the audio although he called it Quotes selectively edited throughout the lengthy statement which was two pages by the way Now he expressed more outrage toward lake who he said was employed by his private company for recording their private conversation Then for what was actually said and he claimed that his discussion was quote unquote transparent In quote intended to offer perspective not coercion However throughout the audio recording to wit made it abundantly clear That the conversation quote never happened Which seemingly debunks his claims of transparency to wit did not address the details of the recording including the imply implied bribes In his own suggestion that something very bad could happen to him if he exposed these powerful people a lot of wit Sety intended to fight for his position He said he received an ultimatum from lake's team to resign or face the release of a Quote new more damaging recording Andy, what do we got on this? I think she'll probably release it anyway. I think she has to Yeah, I think she does I think we need to know what we're dealing with and we need to know the kind of people that are that are out here and what they're trying to deal We have to yeah, I agree with that if we're talking about full transparency We have to if you're talking about for your further people and this is the hill work done. You have to yeah You have to yeah, you know now this guy so I mean You know a lot of these people who work on these campaigns and stuff nobody really knows them right But this guy he was a COO and the CFO for Trump's campaign in 2016 And then also the COO for his 2020 campaign as well Jeff DeWitt man, so I mean it's like I don't see this coming from From Trump this but like who is this coming from he's saying these powerful people on these coast Right now It's I feel like a lot of people all you know, yeah, it's Biden administration whenever the case is but let's not forget what they did to air Gritons and who was responsible for dumping 20 almost 30 million dollars within a month Right like there was some ours on that that was showing up in there. Yeah, look dude people can't think you guys can't think of this as Democrat corrupt Republican not corrupt or vice versa. It's these guys are all in together They're lawyers, okay, and the way lawyers play ball is they're all friends and then they talk about it behind the scenes about how they're gonna do business Not unlike what you just heard All right, that's common practice amongst lawyers what you just heard like when you get in a lawsuit or you have something going on Those dudes are having those conversations behind your back you just never hear them or never see them and you're Led to believe that these things don't happen or don't exist and they do and so this is common This is common, you know the common way these people kind of do business and not kind of this is the common way they do business And you know, I think it's important that people recognize that because what you see and what they come out and say at their podium Those are all every single time Those are all rehearsed well thought out messages to deliver some version Of acceptable acceptable information to the public. It's never the full story. It's never the whole And Shalada so to speak it's just the little bits and pieces that they can tell you or want you to know so that you guys won't revolt and you know Do what what what honestly probably should have been done a long time ago, you know So, I mean here's the thing. I mean think about this too, right like the fact that this guy resigned from this position Because over just a threat you don't even know if there's another audio But just the threat of releasing something more damaging than this that means that stuff they got is way worse way worse Yeah, he's probably gonna get macarenaed Well, that was the other thing dude is like This is how this works, you know, they come to you they they try to pay you first All right, and most people take the pay, you know because they understand that Uh It's like Pablo Escobar says in Narcos man. It's it's it's silver or lead You know, and that's the options you got with these people, you know, and the United States being some You know, I think a lot of citizens are under the idea that the United States is some sort of above the board or above that kind of behavior Country when in reality, it's not these people are powerful. They they they want to get what they want And they come and they offer you the reward and then if you don't take the reward that things happen to you And that's how they operate so yeah, it's uh You know, Carrie Lakes got to start being real careful And I'm sure she knows that and I like Carrie Lake. I don't I don't really see how you couldn't like her You know, she doesn't bow down. She doesn't bend an e she doesn't Take any shift from anybody, you know, like how she calls out the reporters. Yeah. I mean dude, you know She's a little bit she does a lot of the same things trump has done But in a little bit classier way And I like her. Yeah, you know, I think she's got a lot of courage and and I respect what she does and Those are the kind of people that we need to have in our government You know, and and by the way on both sides That doesn't mean you have to agree with all her policy issues But you got to have people who are not willing to be corrupted You know, and if you're a Democrat and you believe in more Liberal policy agendas then you should have those people you know, that's the problem with the Democrat party right now The Democrat party has been totally corrupted where they're willing to do anything and everything to win And to the point where a lot of their voter book base has accepted that as well They don't care if it's true or not as long as they get their way and that's what's damaging the country and destroying the country And so you know, what we really need is people on both sides who are not corruptible who are willing to serve and fight for the issues at hand And and let our government work the way it's supposed to work That's how it's that is how it's supposed to work people are supposed to go into a room argue their points and we're supposed to work it out. Yeah, the problem is with trump dude and and carry lake and the like Is that there's too many of these people for them to just assassinate them all or fucking remove them all or jail them all There's too many you know what I mean So that's this is why we're seeing this panic because You know 10 years ago 20 years ago there might have been a rogue person or three or four people that came along that were outside of Wanting to play the game that they play But now there's so many people that are like no man like we're not doing it anymore They're panicking yeah, and that's you know, well plus they know the spread of information too right yeah, you know the majority of those macarena's from Clinton Like that should happen 20 30 years ago, right? So it's like, you know, okay cool plane crashes whatever You know, yeah, it is there is some Some crazy coincidences. Oh, yeah, like the guy who committed, you know suicide shot himself in the back three times Yeah, right like I mean it's it's there there's certain things but again Happened way back then nobody really paying attention because the information wasn't readily available like well Dude that's what I'm saying about the democratic party as a whole bro. They don't care if it happens They're like fuck it. We're getting our way fix it. It's more important than it. No, it's not Yeah, no, it's not and and here's the dangerous thing about the Democrats setting that Standard for so long now that it's by any means possible when that Coin flips over it's gonna be by any means possible And nobody's gonna be able to stop it because the other side of them of the of the aisle has been abused so hard for so long They're not gonna have any empathy or sympathy or restrain or anything. Nope. It's just gonna be straight up Scorched earth and they're already set the precedence. Yeah, right. That's what I'm saying It's like this is why it's always important to be fair to people and to to hold yourself to a higher standard and a higher code Dude brother commonly gets on today and she's like oh if Trump gets back in who he'll he'll politicize the DOJ And it's like lady what the fuck like that's exactly what you got not only that we see it in every city in America right now We see we see criminals who are violent who are creating disruption in the communities being set free with no bond And then we see people like Daniel Penny who's a good Samaritan who stops this guy from going fucking crazy on a subway sitting in jail Right, we see the politicization of the of the DOJ like that's already happening the government system and the court system And the police everything has already been politicized because these people are so desperate, but the good news is Is that everybody sees it? And everybody's tired of it, you know, because people got to live in that shit and they don't want to live in anymore Now guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think I was that being said let's head over to cruise the comments Today's cruise the comment comes from at Kevin coastal 8737 he says Uh, hey, Andy and DJ. I don't think you guys will get the number one domestic terrorist spot because your DEI score is too high Uh, you have a black guy Indian guy and Bosnian. They know white guys Oh, we got a white guy too who? I Get left out. I thought you were so much you would you say black guy? ah Oh, yeah, Joe, well, you got Joe But you know, maybe if you all identify as white males you'll get in the top 10 Love this show grease from Colorado Hey, man, you know, hey, it's worth a try. Yeah, we can all just identify at this point Yeah, I think I think he's actually right. I think we do have too high of the we're too diverse on the show to get on the list man They're like, they all know there's no way. Yeah, there's no way. Yeah Yeah, bro our show would be a lot different like if it was just it was just a bunch of white dudes in here saying all the shit We say these motherfuckers be going crazy. They can't say shit Anyway, did you check his she yeah, there's a big giant black guy fuck He said next to India fuck yeah, hey, we're the United Nations of real shit here. It's what it is Right, that's what it is. Yeah, we appreciate you guys. So thank you guys for all your comments Thank you guys for being real ass fans. Let's keep this cruise moving and head over to headline number two It's looking like it might be a little uh Like like the the civil war going on, bro like American Revolution again It's definitely weird. It's a weird time. Yeah, we got to head down to Texas to check this out So that's we've been keeping you guys updated on these almost going on in Texas. There's been some pretty big developments Let's connect some dots Border battle lines dims call on Biden to seize control of Texas National Guard as GOP allies back Abbott Fox News article reading as Texas governor Greg Abbott continues to tout the states right to self-defend itself from a migrant invasion Some Democratic lawmakers are calling on president Biden to take control of the state's national guard Yeah, you uh can't do that Can't miss it. Yeah, can't you you can't do it And not only that there's there's been some interest in developments even on that part um But as you uh Abbott issued a lengthy statement Wednesday Saying the federal government broke the compact between the US and the individual states So here are some of the I got some tweets here. These are from some of these democratic lawmakers um or law breakers whatever you guys want to call them Like this guy here congressman Greg Cassar he says Greg Abbott has continued to use political stunts and inflammatory language to advance his own agenda violating the constitution and endangering both US citizens and asylum seekers And this is a whole thread he puts out he says Abbott is following the Donald Trump playbook Make immigration harder and more dangerous so asylum seekers are pushed into the hands of the cartels and the systems remain broken I agree with at y'allquan cash strove if Abbott is defying yesterday supreme court ruling at podis needs to establish sole federal control of the Texas national guard We can create an immigration system that is safe orderly and humane It's democrats jobs Uh to push back on razor wire in humane cages and broken policies of the past Um, he goes on for a little bit more you got that this is y'allquan cash strove you sum up um There's directly calling on podis to take uh an established sole federal control of the national guard Even a beta do show roerk he jumps in on the conversation he says uh quote Abbott is using the Texas guard to defy a supreme court ruling when governor Fabus did this in 1957 Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas guard to ensure compliance with the law Biden must follow this example of bold decisive leadership to end this crisis before it gets worse um Yeah Abbott double downed on it So this is a very very small it's not immigration It's an invasion it isn't evasion. It's very very important. We differentiate yeah because again guy like it's the play on words Yes, it's the play on words that they always try to run this is an evasion And that's when he's basing this right to self-defense is based on it's the constitution to write that all states have the right Right um Texas governor Greg Abbott on Wednesday accused the federal government Of breaking the compact with the states following a supreme court ruling on Monday That cleared the way for the border patrol to remove razor wire installed by Texas along the US, Mexico border Um in a statement Abbott said quote president Biden has refused to enforce immigration laws and has even violated them Um in the latest escalation and legal and political standoff between Texas and the federal government Uh though Abbott stopped short of announcing any specific measures um Until now uh he tweeted out this which at this time has received uh received over 40 million views on ex Um he releases a whole statement to uh on Texas's constitutional rights of self-defense Um and in here the important part Um is what he's referencing to this um which is article one section 10 class three Which acknowledges the state's sovereign interest in protecting their borders Um and release the uh he uh List the the case law as well along with that um but basically saying hey Now there's been some uh there's been some some some some stuff that's floating around now Yet to verify 100 percent Um but there's been some stuff floating around of like even the national guards been saying like hey listen If they try that we're standing with Texas and basically saying that they're gonna completely defy any order comes from Biden Well, bro, this should have been done years ago years ago. Okay. Like why did it take Greg Abbott three fucking years or four years to stand up Like look at the problems that we're gonna have from this for the next however many years And let's we take some ridiculously drastic action which in my opinion is what's needed To put these people back where they came from you know, this is This is fundamentally changing the demographics of our country It's increased crime in a tremendous way. We're taking tax dollars that we need for our actual citizens people who could Tribute tax to the you know the piggy bank We're taking money from them and giving it to these people like this. There's so much shit wrong with this you know And it's all political You know these people want to bring in these people for a bunch of different reasons They want to replace the awakening black population who is learning and real time that the Democrats are not their party All right, they want to work in You know, they want to eliminate the white population in this country by making sure that we promote diversity to the point where there is no actual other race besides this mixed race of people which you know People like to argue, but this is what's been going on in Europe for the last decade Okay, and that's how you end up with Ireland having the number one Name popular name is Muhammad is Muhammad right and fucking Ireland right bro And it's not racism to say that every racism is saying that a race of people don't have a right to exist and we're going to integrate other races to the point We're none of them exist. That's racism You know what I'm saying like we have these people who say oh well It's racist to point this thing out that they're trying to integrate all the races together Well, the good-hearted people like the regular everyday people they hear that and they're like yeah, you know Diversity is not bad like I don't have anything against mixed race children or that and this and and dude I don't think most people do But the idea that we're going to remove Entire races of people through intentional migration and interbreeding is actually racist because They're saying that those races don't have a right to exist the way that they are And the culture's in their rights. Yeah, so they do you understand what I'm saying? They say we're racist for saying hey This is this is appears to be what the fuck they're doing When reality bro what they're saying is you know, hey, uh none of these other races you do exist anymore We're going to create this new race and that's bullshit Everybody has a right to be proud of you know, they're heritage and where they come from and all these things But I don't think it's part it should be part of their identity on a daily basis And we should celebrate those things like I don't know man like I like multicultural food like I like going to Uh See art from other cultures or eat you know at restaurants that are not you know white people restaurants Food season right yeah, there you go Shuffle Want to just stop and pop up. I'm saying. I get you know I'm saying like bro We got a good thing here in America. We get stop this shit. It's bullshit and everybody knows this bullshit Yeah, man. The good thing you know, but this should have been done years ago should have been done years again That's always been my biggest crap. I've said it multiple times like dude Abbott You literally bust these people further into our country. Yeah, so yes, you're protecting Texas. Yeah, finally. Yeah, right? But like what about everybody else? Well, what have I been saying that they've wanted to do they wanted to get us in this in these civil street conflicts with these migrants And then close down the border so nobody can escape. Yeah, so what better way to do it than to start it at the state versus federal level And start some sort of civil standoff to ignite you know passions and arguments And this goes back to what I was saying about the migrant riots that I think that they want to happen You know, you know what I mean? This is a great way to politicize that you know They they have the government saying let them in we have Texas and and a bunch of other states saying no and And that's gonna that's gonna ignite a bunch of people to fall. That's right. It's going to ignite a bunch of debate People are gonna pick sides. It's gonna become the next thing and then the next thing we know in June Right on time. We're gonna have migrant riots where military age males from other countries who should even be here are running up and down the streets Fucking our shit up. Yeah, that's what it looks like, man That's what it's looking like, you know, you know I don't think we're gonna get to a point where it's gonna be the federal government versus the state Fucking National Guard really, but you know if it does I think we're gonna see is we're gonna see a lot of people in the citizen Citizenship of this country joining on the state level. You know, in multiple states a lot of people are fucking Salivating for this. Yeah, it wouldn't just be you know federal versus Texas, right? Yeah, there's a bunch of other states that are also jumping in on this right Then they come out in support of of Texas GOP governors back Abbott and border standoff So as of right now You got Oklahoma South Dakota, Florida, Virginia, Georgia They've all said that they support Abbott's actions Um, even the Sanctus he tweeted out on x he said if the Constitution really made states powerless to defend themselves against an invasion It wouldn't have been ratified in the first place and Texas would never Would have never joined the union when it did Um, Texas is upholding the law by biting is flouting it Yeah, dude, it looks like we're gonna get into a standoff between the federal The the Biden regime because that's what they are. They're not an administration. It's a fucking regime Right when was the last time they've acted in the will of the people in any way shape or form Go to Ukraine. You people want to go to Ukraine not really Okay, do people want to be involved in the shit in the Middle East? No Do people want crime in their neighborhoods? No, do people want High gas prices and inflation? No Do people want any of the shit these people have bought? No, and then they go on TV every single week And they try to tell you how they're doing such a great job and everybody else looks at their significant other And then looks at their bank statement and says do what are these people talking about and then their gaslighted in the Made to think that they're the only ones that are suffering like we we must be failing as a family because it It appears that everybody else is doing good and everybody's waking up to it. So we have a we have a rogue regime in our government who quite honestly Is likely to be compromised Okay, there's tons of evidence to say so that's been presented and I think we're going to find out when this is all said and done long term That these people have been paid off by China to destroy our country and they've been doing it and and uh and you know That's everything they do is the opposite of what the people want bro Nobody wants the things that are happening with this with this and they might hate Trump people might still might like Trump But nobody wants what's happening in this country and they continue to come out KGP comes out every fucking day talks about how they're doing such a great job and everybody's happy No, they're happy That's small group of three or four five hundred people in Washington DC They're happy they're making more money than they've ever made They've done more things for themselves than they've ever done During COVID all their buddies and their rich donors they all got exponentially more rich while we shut down Hundreds of thousands of businesses in the United States Okay, well They are doing better, but the average person is not so like when they tell you that you have to understand They are They are not just trying to gaslight you they're also basically saying yeah, we're doing better fuck you It's like it's like a big middle finger to the people right? Yep So I think that that would be one more of my demands right like when all the shit is over all the money These motherfuckers made from inside of trading all of that diva diva it up Stameless check where you know, I'm saying like I won't yeah, I don't know it. I'd be nice These people are completely corrupt dude completely corrupt and they're destroying our country And if this would come down to a showdown between the federal military and a state national guard The you guys who are in the federal military you should stand with the fucking state level these people and if that happens Dude if that really does happen, it's gonna be out. It's gonna be Probably pretty awesome probably pretty exciting. Yeah. Well, I mean here's the thing like Historical context this has happened before right I believe it was JFK they sent the National Guard in to allow the desegregation of schools right The difference in these situations when that Arkansas yeah, the difference in these situations is that What Arkansas was doing was actually violating the Constitution right? It had been made law Right like that here's but here now the federal government is violating the Constitution correct So that's the big difference here. They had like the bro listen the the Biden administration has absolutely no ground to stand on Yeah, you know, so it would absolutely be interesting see how this plays out man. We'll keep you guys updated Um, let us know down in the comments what you guys think on this uh this topic here with that being said. Let's keep on cruising That's uh, let's leave something let's leave something here for a minute Now right now to the slamer. This is a below the line issue, but the hypocrisy of it um, I can't pass it up Uh, just leaving this here Biden's abortion rights rally repeatedly interrupt it by protesters for genocide in Gaza Is that like And it's the same people they don't think of it like that. They just switched their signs. Yeah, they don't think of it like that bro You know what I'm saying? Yeah, they don't think of it like that. They don't they don't think of They don't think of abortion As lives 40 people they don't think of it like that. Mm-hmm. They don't think of it like that Yeah, I know I got a clip. Let's let's watch a clip of the uh of his little uh his rally Joe and I had a chance to sit down Oh I told you how proud we were of your courage a man who's standing up and speaking out on such a personal issue To help so many women Women None of them women got to worry about abortions because nobody's fucking him anyway They're gonna keep it real keep it real. I'm just I just thought the hypocrisy there. Yeah. I mean that's beautiful Let's just leave that right there though Let's keep cruising we got headlining number three Now this is this is uh, let's let me got a lot of dots to connect here um and they there there's been some fudgery Dude imagine hold on imagine voting on an issue uh exclusively When your entire fucking world is falling apart Your economic ability to provide for yourself You're like all these women have husbands their husbands are struggling at work their husbands are fucking Having a harder time making the ends meet and they're gonna go vote On something that does not affect them every single day. I'm not saying it's not an important issue I'm not saying it's something that we shouldn't be discussing. I'm not saying any of that But if we're being honest the the row V-way thing that just put it to the state level okay Didn't outlaw it if you don't like the way that your states handling it Maybe you should go to a different state Maybe that and stop fucking up that state. Okay. Yeah Because dude you but the problem is is they brainwash these people into believing this is the most important issue And then they ignore all the other issues that their party destroys makes their life on a daily basis incredibly more difficult Like you can't fucking like you you can't negotiate a reason with someone who can't even understand that Like you're going to scream and throw this temperate tantrum about an issue that May only affect you once or twice in your life and the option is still there in many different ways. Okay While these same people that you vote for make every rule and decision possible to make your life harder in every single way Outside of this one issue that you're only going to deal with once or twice in your life maximum You see what I'm saying if you're a decent human being Yeah, it's it doesn't make sense Doesn't make sense me. I just love that those are all the people like everybody in that room voted for Biden Everybody in that room is that this is the only thing they care about yeah, they don't have to switch their signs all the Those people don't care about anything else. They don't care about the economy These are the people that like go to the store right now and they're like why why is everything so expensive? Oh the store owners greedy Trump yes Yeah, they have no idea that it's their own people doing it because they only care about this one issue because they've they've joined that cult You know what I'm saying and I'm not saying that we can't have a discussion about that in fact most of you guys You know don't even know how I really think about it You know what I'm saying like it's just not an above the line issue. It's a below the line issue. It does not affect our everyday reality Yeah Yeah, man, I'm with you But let's let's keep this cruise move. We got a third of final headline headline number three Hell on number three reads Not a good night for Donald Trump why never trumpers think he's really losing This is an interesting thing here. Okay, so this is covering the New Hampshire obviously Trump did win the New Hampshire primary right cool great cool Um, but this article I Saw from then this is a left-leaning mainstream media um Just listen to this man. So uh the article reads New Hampshire Uh Donald Trump dumped Nicky Haley in New Hampshire, but anti-Trump Republicans are hardly upset about it Even after Trump went two for two in the early nominating contest the non-Trump movement seems Increasingly positive signs that the former president can be beat in November Poles and exit surveys from Iowa and New Hampshire show swaths of the Republican electorate cast ballots Specifically against Trump And would refuse to vote for him in November Independent to help hand Trump a general election loss in 2020 help fuel record turnout in New Hampshire's GOP primary And Trump didn't take major strides in either state in the highly educated areas uh where he was the weakest in 2016 Quote it was definitely not a good night for Trump mic midrida a California GOP Strategies and co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln project. It must be great strategy Yeah, he's a part of the California GOP and they never fucking have one in like 50 fucking years So I really trust what this moron has to say um Mike. Oh listen I'm about to expose everything because I got something for this whole article's bullshit But this is them trying to push the narrative and push the idea, but we're gonna see what the real numbers are But this last little quote says by most metrics the path to stopping Trump has become much clearer It's said now the anti-Trump lane is discernible. It's palpable. It's big It's something that we can work with in a real meaningful way Now what they're trying to say is Is basically there's there's becoming this massive movement of people saying hey listen We're still Republicans. We just don't want Trump. Okay Um, and I think to combat this let's go to see it in themselves where they break down these polls and let's see what it's actually saying Here take a look at the numbers among Trump voters 70% of them according to our exit polls are registered Republicans Donald Trump his support 27% of his voters are registered undeclared or independence Uh, 3% were unregistered before today. Look at how that compares with Nikki Haley It's a complete reversal. It's an alternate universe among Haley voters 70% are registered undeclared Only And what registered undeclared means Is registered Democrats That was what the vote of turnout was in the New Hampshire polls. Yeah 70% of Nikki Haley's votes came from registered Democrats That's the movement that they're trying to paint as this anti-Trump movement Yeah, I know and there's plenty of videos and here this is where the the Tom Fulery comes into place because There was a bunch of videos. I remember seeing earlier uh yesterday in Tuesday I believe Where they're interviewing these people who are just walked out of the voting ballots, right And they're talking to them about you know, they're voting what they thought It's like yeah, no, I'm a Democrat. I voted because of vote for Haley was a vote against Trump And there brother was a bunch of these videos now. There's nowhere to be found on the internet. Yeah, that's because it's fucking illegal You know, so yeah, I mean what's your thoughts on the Sandy? Well, I actually think that the data shows a favorable percentage of independent voters are choosing Trump or the Republicans over the Democrats Which is really ultimately what it comes down to because it's not gonna be Trump Haley Inviting on the ballot. It's gonna be fucking Donald Trump and and Michael Bama. Okay. That's what it's gonna be That's what it's gonna be What? Yeah, I love you. Yeah, well, I mean, that's what the fuck it's gonna be bro And and so like dude, you know I don't know who knows man. I mean It seems like people are waking up Like I've seen a couple posts in mainstream other than the one we covered the other day talking about Michelle Obama becoming the the nominee for the Democrats and in the comment section dude like Nobody saying yes, this is a great idea everybody saying look at these fuckers trying to stay in for another eight years And destroy our country So it seems like and this is on like Like these are not just like Fox News page, right? Like this is like pretty culturally even pages And it seems it seems like most people are waking up to the fact of who's pulling the strings and they're tired of the bullshit Because all this shit started with Obama back in 2008 And People seem to be recognizing it so yeah, I mean, what do you think? Yeah, I just thought that was crazy man like I Did how they're trying to paint this because it's all about the words. It's all about the perception of reality, right? And I just saw that was crazy man when I was trying to see those videos of those voters coming out and like oh, no, I'm a Democrat like I'm a registered Democrat Well, let me tell you how stupid this strategy guy is okay. Yeah, this is how fucking stupid What's his name Mike Mike Mike my great. Let me tell you how stupid this motherfucker is Their best strategy is to scare people to death that Donald Trump's gonna be elected And here's this fucking idiot who out in California is the GOP fucking strategist Well, and that's probably why they lose Telling him that Donald Trump's losing yeah, right? Okay, and what's that gonna do to the independent voter who's scared of Donald Trump? That's gonna make them stay home So I'm glad this guy's so fucking stupid he doesn't know what he's doing Because the proper strategy for him wouldn't say holy shit you guys better get fucking ready because his mother fuckers are coming That would make sense to me that's because that makes sense. Yeah, but you know when you're a dumb fuck and you know You have one in election in 40 fucking years in California or whatever it's been um I this is why you know you guys in California you wonder why the GOP loses it's because the guy running the strategy is a fucking moron You know I'm set like bro you like I'm sitting here. I if he was in our meeting room. I'd be sitting looking at this guy like The fuck is wrong with you. Do you got to do your face? You got to face when that happens. Yeah, this is it What That's it like are you fucking like are you really coming out of your fucking mouth right now? Right? You know I'm saying and like dude The guy's probably a Democrat dude Who's running that's other thing is you know you have a bunch of Democrats running in in GOP positions across Holding GOP positions across the party You know Who are infiltrating and trying to get there like these people are fucking evil dude Yeah, man. I think this here's what I think I think people that want the country to change Better wake the fuck up and get engaged and get involved because this is they're gonna cheat every fucking single way possible They're gonna fucking do every single thing they can they don't care if you see it. They don't care if you catch him they haven't been punished in Who knows how long they're emboldened they don't care? There's no punishment for anything that they do They're gonna pull out everything and if you guys want the country to change in the short term We are going to need a change of administration if we if we Regardless of Trump like if you say oh, I don't like Trump because he does this three does that or he does this Do you want to be poor? Do you want crime? Do you want your life to look like shit? Do you want your country to be invaded and potentially lose all the opportunity for your kids? Because that's the that's the what we're voting for here. It's not about a vote for Trump It's about a vote for a different America than what we're getting and that's reality and while Trump may not be the perfect candidate For people I have a lot of gripes about Donald Trump. There's a lot of things that he's done where I'm like dude What the fuck are you doing? Why do you do that? Why you know and I've been open about that the whole time And it's funny because people still call me like a trumper, you know when they want to criticize me I'm not dude I just don't want our country to fall the fuck apart all the way and we're real close to it another four years of Biden Bro your kids will never have a shot ever in this country and that'll fucking happen in fact if you own a business you won't have one You're you're not gonna have safe neighborhoods. You're you're gonna pay absurdly more taxes Bro, it's it's pretty well known that The presidents do the most aggressive action in their second term not their first because there's repercussions All right, there's repercussions on what they did in their first term, but not in their second all right, so What you're gonna see in the second term of a Biden administration or even another Obama because that's what that's what Biden really would Biden's a third Obama term and if they give him a fourth and a fifth with the Michelle Obama bro This country's over it will be a communist country The and you're gonna look back eight years from now and say fuck I wish I would have listened and it's gonna be too late So you guys have to get over your distaste for trump however you don't like them Whatever it is you don't like about him. Whatever it is you you know he rubs you the wrong. I don't know what it is I don't I don't like for me I look at trump and I understand a lot of the things he does I also there's a lot of things I don't understand he does you know, I think he I think he got into office Not knowing or understanding how corrupt it actually was a full game Yeah, I think I think and dude I think he doesn't know exactly what he's doing In that regard, you know, he appointed all these people that all kind of fucked him over and people like to say Oh, he's exposing the swamp at what cost So there's a lot of things that we have to you know look at trump and say okay, I'll be honest about That's all I'm saying and and it's not the like or dislike for trump. I actually very much admire his patriotic Drive, you know, this man was a multi-multi multi-billionaire. He didn't have bro This guy live the life that you would you guys would all kill to have any fucking gave it up to come do this shit for you And while he may not be perfect He's the best chance that we have right now in my opinion Okay, and and if we don't if we don't get over it and we don't go to fucking battle for it We're gonna pay the price and it's gonna be steep and I don't think people understand that I think a lot of people want to say never trump because he handled things the wrong way like one of the things that I don't like about trump Is how he handled the vaccine shit and the covid shit and now they're acting like it's irrelevant It's not irrelevant though to lots of people have fucking died from the vaccine Lots of people are sick from the vaccine. They closed millions of businesses or hundreds of thousands of businesses because of the shutdowns On that that's those are facts right and then on the other side I can look at it from a person who's been in pressure situations and had to operate you know on a much smaller scale than that right but You make decisions based upon what's going on and the information you're told and if you're surrounded by a bunch of corrupt people who are telling you Information that isn't actually the truth You know imagine being this dude and these guys coming in saying if you don't close the country bro millions people are gonna die Right so now you have a you have a lose lose situation. There's no way to fucking win that you know what I mean The one thing I think that would serve him very well is to address the vaccine situation and the operation warp speed Because I ultimately think that's what's gonna hurt him the most I think there's a lot of people I hear who are pissed about covid who are pissed about what's going on with the vaccines How that all went down and the mandates and all this shit because it all started with him He had the power to say no or say something else And I think if he just came out and by the way you're welcome to come on the show uh Trump like I would love to have you on the show just to talk about it not to attack not not to but just hear it like What actually happened and what What's your side of the story because just brushing it under the rug is pushing a lot of people away You know what I'm saying? And and dude I'm one of those people like I look at Trump and I'm like, Fuck can I trust the student? You know like if if I could trust you bro tell me the real deal on this vaccine man Because I know dude. I know people who fucking died from it personally two You know what I'm saying like That's all I'm saying man. We just need a little bit more Explanation I think would help him a lot I don't know. I mean do you think so? 100% I think it's needed yeah I also want some more tactical fucking what are we doing about the shit? Yeah, I agree with that. He's kind of letting the vape talk about that a lot. Yeah, you know, which I like Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, a good cop back hop. Yeah well, but We'll see I mean dude at the end of the day, bro. Here's the deal You got this or you got that and while neither one of those are ideal And neither one of those are gonna align with you You've got to pick the one that's gonna serve you the best selfishly. What's going to serve you the best? What's going to get you to a point where you're not suffering the way that our country is suffering right now because The the what's happening in our economy and what's happening is being widely ignored in reality Okay, credit card defaults bank defaults repossessions these things are sky high most people It's 70 like it's like 78% of people that make a hundred grand or more are living paycheck to paycheck And the people below a hundred grand I don't even have this valid dude me neither so like bro We have to fucking be really honest about what we're doing here and put away this mentality of I don't like the way he talks to people what the fuck are you talking about you like to eat right you know I'm saying So yeah guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments. Let us know what you guys think But that was our third and final headline man. This was a nice little speedy cruise. Yeah, got through it It's time for our final segment. I don't have the same energy as normal bro. I'm wearing it pretty hard. Oh, we're good man I like it brother. We just put that cruise control in removing.

I don't want to know the magic bro I want to know I just want to see it and be like damn ever could that was awesome You know like because dude I have like an investigative like Uh, like a critical mind right like I dig deeper. I'm a problem solver. I'm an entrepreneur You know, I got to solve problems. That's how I think but it's nice Sometimes just to look at things and be like wow It's for real dude, and this is one of those things. I'm not gonna think too much into it. Yeah That's cool.
