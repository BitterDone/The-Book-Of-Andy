two that's right yeah so it's good I just got done lifted my uh lifted my weights masculine weights yeah yeah I got very toxic uh and then I decided to come in here with all my rage and anger and testosterone and do a fucking show yeah let's do right so uh we do have a special guest on the show mm-hmm would you like to intro our guest yeah we got super awesome guests for you guys today we got the CEO and founder of Red Balloon and you crappy shits it's going on brother are you doing I'm just grateful to be here it's nice to see you guys you know it's going to be a good show when the guest just does double front the code is right where we go and this is what we're going to do I'm down all day like that energy yeah so what's up man yeah I'm I'm grateful to be here I love the show I love I love seeing Americans actually start thinking about stuff right taking responsibility uh I've you know I used to run a lot of different businesses I've done housing development commercial real estate um doing red balloon now getting to be part of this freedom economy that is growing up all over the country right now and it's really fun to watch because what we see is we see the small businesses who just take responsibility right and when you take responsibility whether you're successful business or not and you probably will be you're going to be more successful at life and it is just fun to just be part of that um we're partnered with public square I think you had Michael on a little while ago yeah awesome dude and and yeah we'll talk more about it but I'm excited to be here yeah real real quick um tell people just how you came up with the idea for red balloon what it does because uh it's an important resource that people need to know about for sure for sure for sure so two and a half years ago I was a CEO of a pretty big tech company and um as an unapologetic conservative Christian my board was uh uncomfortable with who I was and look we were growing 25% a year with a 40% margin so I was like vomiting cash on them um we didn't have any concerns at the office I just was bringing my whole self to work and they basically made it clear to me that that was not something that they wanted in their company because it was an ESG fund and ESG is bad for America and I was not the right fit for them so uh I got kicked to the sidelines I was going to take at least a year off maybe play a little golf maybe um you know do whatever and I already had a housing development I was doing I had a bunch of commercial real estate I'm gonna I'm gonna be a real estate guy and a friend's like hey you should do a job board that connects people who just are in the same situation as you they just had to make a decision between their values and their job right and I think that's wrong and so like okay fine red balloon dot work it's called red balloon because if you've ever been on a hot air balloon it's a little bit terrifying and a lapid fund kind of like looking for a new job kind of floating sensation with a hard landing um and then red because people are moving to red states they're moving to red businesses and they're looking for freedom and and then dot work because dot com sounded too much like communism to me and we don't want communism we'll work that's right right so red balloon dot work so we're this job board and I kind of started as a hobby job but I started getting these thank you notes from perfect strangers all over the country saying you changed the trajectory of my family because I've been working at a company for 10 years who hated me hated my world view hated my way of life and was actively trying to destroy that the DEI training was a liturgy trying to change the way that I thought about everyone around me right and put everybody in the suppressed and oppressor framework and so I certainly think you know something like well maybe this is the thing I'm supposed to be doing now because I didn't want to start another tech business I've done a number of tech business over the years I've had six successful exits I was just going to take a hot minute um but it was clear and then then I get a call from Fox and friends and they said we heard that you have the nation's largest job board for companies that don't have a vaccine mandate um and to show what a uh not news nerd I am I heard Fox and friends I'm like is that a kid show like I don't even know what that is like hey mr. Weasel what are we gonna do today right Fox and friends so I'm like oh sure I'll get on there so then we start adding hundreds of customers a day um because businesses are finding that if you hire people who are actually not whiners but actually just want to show up and work your business will be some more successful you're going to be more joyful and those people are going to build you value and make you a bunch of money because they think capitalism is actually a good thing right shocker so today we are the largest uh job board in the country we've only been around for like a year and a half we've got over three thousand businesses over a million job seekers and we are connecting the the real America with uh with people who just want to work hard and it's been a really fun adventure so we work with businesses two different ways you can post a job and you I don't know if you saw indeed dot com um they kick businesses off all the time so construction businesses that say they're freedom loving and godfiring if you describe your business like that they'll kick you off they kicked off answers and genesis because they didn't want them to participate in the ability to find this and then indeed announce this week that they're going to pay up to ten thousand dollars for employees who are trapped in states that do not have hormone therapy for kids and they're going to help pay for those employees to go get their kids mutilated somewhere else right so that's indeed dot com that's the big job board out there and so we are the alternative to that you can post your job you can be in front of um millions of freedom loving americans and you can make sure that you're hiring people are going to build your culture not destroy your culture the second way we work with businesses is we can actually take over the hiring process because if you're a small business in america hiring is terrifying because if you ask the wrong questions in the interview you're going to get a lawsuit but if you don't ask those questions you're going to get a bad culture fit you're going to have a lot of heartache and then three months later you're going to get a lawsuit right and so we come alongside and we actually started with this with louder with Crowder um we do all the hiring for them we basically help write that job posting we post it multiple places we filter all the candidates given professional response and then we do a first cultural interview for you to make sure that the person in your four walls that are building your business are going to actually build your culture not wreck it right doesn't seem that complicated but for a lot of small businesses it's a huge deal yeah and dude another thing small a lot of small businesses don't understand that one single bad hire can wreck your whole company completely completely we were working with a business who actually in texas and they had hired a head of customer service who was actively trying to destroy them because they were a patriot run business who was unapologetic about who they were and the person was actually hiring bad people into the business around him he was leaking information about the company he wanted to destroy it I mean who has time to go take a job take a salary to try and destroy business but it happens it happens all the time it happens all the time yeah it's internet culture too dude yeah it's this it's this internet call out culture like you know when we when we think it's it's interesting to think about because if you think back just you know five six ten years ago you know all we heard was we need to be more tolerant we need to be more tolerant we need to be more tolerant of people's views we need to be more tolerant we be and now the enough of these people have gotten into a place of leverage where they're the exact opposite of what they preach which is the mark of an actual communist and a tyrant people who claim and preach tolerance until they get an inch of leverage on you and then they are become the intolerant they become the oppressor they become the destroyer they're just they're virtue signaling they're saying look I am that kind of person and you know they're going to be that kind of person every day when they show up right you have to be uncomfortable around them you can't say what your beliefs are everything's got to be offensive you've got to walk on eggs shells in the minute you don't they fucking sue you where they go online and blast you and like this is what you're dealing with with this woke culture so like what you're doing is extremely important because I believe that most people like most regular Americans common sense are I mean this most like by a vast majority are so sick of these squeaky wheel fucks coming into their companies and fucking it up because they feel entitled to have their beliefs these people believe that they're destructive ways are justified as long as they get the end result and like that like dude if we want to play that game then we'll play the game because we got the fucking numbers motherfucker right you know and we're the hardest working people yeah the reason why this is important and why I'm throwing myself into this now yeah is because if you're conservative if you get canceled from Facebook you're like okay I mean not the end of the world I can still communicate with people if you get canceled from your ability to pay your mortgage and feed your kids you're going to be very tempted to compromise something you hold dear right and so we needed to give a landing place for people and I talked to a guy and he says you know what I just got the vaccine and he said I you know whether it's right for someone else I don't know but for me I knew it was the wrong thing to do but I was gonna lose my job yeah and he says I feel dirty inside yeah he said because I know wherever the wrong thing for me forever and the thing is if but it's hard to be brave if you're alone yeah right and but if you are in a position where you're at a big woke company and they're telling you to do something I want you to know red balloon dot work has thousands of employers that would love to hire you and so be brave at work stand up for what you believe and if you get fired we've got your back yeah and that's it and if we can do that for millions of Americans I think you're right most Americans would like to just go to work do their job stopping a whiner not be offended constantly go home raise their families and that's what's gonna make the American economy fantastic again instead of what it is today well bro it's noble work man really yeah and we talk about on the show too man it's like you know I think us as Americans we see all of these you know you name all the big woke companies that are you know doing these crazy things what people perceive is just crazy thing when really it's intentionally coordinated yeah but to see these new like these new companies that are challenging these big woke companies right like you got the public square like doing amazing things red balloon challenging all the big indeed monsters right like it's cool to see that you know there's not going to be this massive vacuum of like okay well what do we do once we get rid of these companies we've got to have the other thing ready to go for sure it's cool to see that you know you took the steps to do stuff like I actually think that what public square red balloon or doing will actually become the way it's done and I think what will happen is most of the employees that are so sick of this bullshit being jammed down their throats are gonna convert I said this years ago by the way where I talked about all the the opportunity for great employees to relocate their careers and to move into companies that are not that way and I see it more and more and more I mean dude we get people in here all the time that are new hires and we're like well what brought you here and you're like bro I'm not putting up with that bullshit you know and I'm like well you don't have to put up with it here man we hate them too right you know I'm saying to be cool for sure like when the new disney's come up you know I'm saying the new animators yeah there's a whole new economy forming dude massive and I think people I think people don't understand that this will become representative of most of America at some point you know these things take time it takes how much did you say you went from you've been around for a year and a half year and a half yeah year and a half and years and here's things so I was talking to an executive at a big job board he's like look I don't agree with your politics but the reality is you just found a market niche that is half the country yeah and in business that's business gold yeah and so it takes a lot of courage right now and I do think the pendulum is going to swing back because people are just fed up with it and I think the companies like you like public square like red balloon that were brave enough to be there first there's going to be a huge market opportunity for them in addition to just doing the right thing even if I lost my shirt in this whole thing it would be the right thing to do and I would do it yeah but you're not gonna know and also I think it's important for consumers to start adjusting their shopping habits I mean I see it we see it happening but I think it's important for consumers to become more aware to support companies that are standing for their beliefs for right like we mindlessly shop at companies that do not support what it is that we stand for all the time because it's convenient or because they've been established or because it's been something we've grown up with it's been an iconic brand right it's part of our lifestyle and we don't typically can like 80% of the common sense America I don't even say conservative I just say common sense we've never really thought about it like this because we're not like that like we're not politically driven to the point of we want to we have to shop with people who think exactly what we think because dude we are very tolerant and open-minded to shit but the problem is because we're open-minded and because we're tolerant we're actually not adjusting the buying habits properly towards the companies that actually stand for our value system which is important to reignite the actual culture that we want on the ground level because most of the culture that comes into your community comes from the workplace most people don't realize that you want this is why they're pushing ESG and DEI and all of this stuff through the big corporations because they know that if they make their employees behave that way at the workplace they're likely to take those same reservations and that same behavior pattern home all right and then spreads into the community and what you guys need to realize listening is that there's a dual responsibility here if you hate what's going on one of which is if you run a company to not run it like these big companies and run in line with the values that you stand for so it's quit adopting their policies and their practices just because they're big and secondly the consumer base has to now turn and say okay well who's been standing up for me who's been standing up for my value system who actually stands for the things that I believe in and we need to spend our money with those companies that's those are the two things that need to happen and they're happening it's just slow little by little by little but we're seeing it in the data I mean we're seeing smaller companies gain market share that bigger companies are losing because of the political agenda that they're so intent on pushing down well and the reality is you don't realize how much of an impact it has when you're at a big woke company and you're just you know well I'm just going to muscle through another DEI training I'm going to go through another micro aggression trade I talked to an employee who had just gotten fired from Silicon Valley Bank and he said we basically had a weekly micro aggression training and he said there were people in the credit department that knew that the bank was going to go out of business but if they said that to anyone it would be considered a micro aggression and so they thought well I'm just going to lose my job because you'd be saying oh you're doing a bad job therefore that's a micro aggression but I think people don't realize wait so telling someone they're doing a bad job now in corporate America is considered a micro aggression which means there will be no innovation that means there's going to be no performance correct at all correct that means these companies are just waiting to be slaughter it's just it's just a matter of time and if you're in one of those companies you think well I'm just kind of grinning barriens going to be fine you need to understand that when you're swimming in those waters eight to ten hours a day like if you meet someone new you ask them what do you do right and you're asking them what their job is but it betrays that job is not a nine to five hobby it is a defining feature of who you are it is your vocation and if you are just grinding it out in a horrible company then it will have an impact in every other area your life and I know this because I've gotten a lot of thank you know some people saying you saved my marriage because my husband was in a job that was it he was in a bad spot and he brought that stuff home and when he was free at work he started being free at home they started getting plugged into their community they're like we started thinking differently about voting right these the corporations know what they're doing when they're pushing an agenda on their employees it's it's what you spend most of your waking hours doing and we need to push back against it well Larry thick talks about this openly yeah you've probably seen the interview right yep where he's sitting there and he basically straight out says we force behavior change through these companies like he talks about it and then he talks about how once they pick up on you know these terms will just change them into new terms like ESG is not a thing no more right they redid the the the vocabulary on it but well bro hey listen appreciate what you're doing appreciate you coming in being on the show sitting in letting people know what you do this this man is providing the link between you and the companies that you see on public square so that you could build a career with a company that you actually believe in so if any of you guys out there are in these positions where it's just miserable you know Andrew will link you with companies like us companies that are on public square I mean companies that are out here aggressively growing and taking the market share from the companies that you happen to be in because they're micro aggressive whenever they talk about actually fucking winning it's crazy yeah and we did this survey with public square the freedom economy index where we survey over 50,000 businesses in this area and there's a tale of two economies happening right now so you have the hardworking just normal economy where people show up and do their job and then you have the liberal whiner economy and they're you're right they're right for slaughter they will lose they will lose those people will lose because showing up doesn't equate winning it never does this is the law of natural order if it's survival of the visit fittest it's the best product the best company the hardest working people win this is no different than pro football or pro baseball or pro sports out here in the real world we're in the big leagues out here bro and any of you guys who think you're going to come in here and sit on your fucking ass this ain't the place to fucking work okay because we win and companies that win play like that and companies that don't win get beat by companies that play like that it is natural order it's undeniable it's unavoidable and it doesn't matter how big these companies have gotten it doesn't matter how bloated they've gotten cash eventually it will end so if you work in one of these companies you don't need to understand that just over the horizon of what you could probably see is the end of your career there so it's probably a good idea to start going with someone you believe in yeah love for sure we've ballooned that work check it out guys I love that you use that work yeah I like that too I didn't know that was like becoming a thing where you can change the yeah the end domain yeah that's called the internet yeah listen yeah I we have a webpage too oh yeah yeah you could put like dot all kinds of stuff like that idiot I had no idea yeah yeah let's get into this show guys you just got burned by our guests I did I told you my head you might be get a trophy don't forget I know that last name you know what I heard the gym gym teacher store mm-hmm truly true I shared all you want I don't care all right so what we got going on let's get into it man we got some good headlines to get to guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures links videos articles go to Andy for seller dot com you can find them link there if you're watching on youtube drop down in the description below you'll find them link there as well so that being said let's get into our first headline headline number one now this is a very very interesting topic okay and it goes back to conversations that we've had on cti before but it is so interesting to see this stuff fold out so let's get into headline number one headline number one this is coming from CNN okay headline number one reads Biden's unpopularity could give Trump his shot every claiming power shocking shocking yeah it's yeah that we'll call that fake news yeah yeah and actually here so here's the thing so we we interviewed all these businesses or we surveyed all these businesses freedom economy index and of course these businesses are going to be more in support of Trump or republicans in general show it was interesting is 60% of the businesses this is thousands of business we talked to 60% of them said they were more likely to vote for Trump because of the indictments yeah right 60% not just like a couple of them 60% said more likely to vote for Trump because the indictment so yeah it's just interesting the CNN's coming out with this and let's see how this unfold so so they're saying this CNN article reads the devastating verdict voters deliver on president Joe Biden and a new CNN poll is especially stark ahead of the most unprecedented election in modern times 14 months before his fate is decided Biden's unpopularity may be brewing the only possible conditions in which it disgraced an anti-democratic ex-president who might be a convicted felon by election day would be able to squeeze back into power I love I want to read I want to read this from our perspective Biden's unpopularity may be brewing the only possible conditions in which a celebrated anti-communist ex-president who will not be convicted felon by election day would be able to landslide his way back into power correct yeah so like that would be on Fox News sure this is great it's interesting though that even CNN is now they're like it used to be they're not even allowed to talk about the Biden's or anything bad so that tells me that there's a plan of brewing and smells like fear yeah and Biden's not going to be running for president it's going to be somebody else and like we have alluded to this before on CTI's but it's like they are gearing up to get this guy out yeah and this is very evidence so like let's keep looking into this so it says Biden has frequently been underestimated that's it you know what it is and a national poll so far ahead of an election that will be won in a handful of tight battleground states can never predict how it will turn out there's an added caveat in 2024 Trump's multiple looming trials could reshape the electoral terrain significantly and they go on to talk about his Biden's deep political challenges they even have this nice poll here that shows most democratic aligned voters want an alternative to Joe Biden and CNN's latest poll many say they prefer another presidential nominee in 2024 although few have anyone else in else specific in mind Trump and they go in like do they go all in on this they bring up stuff about his age his mental capacity this is all within the last couple of days right political they're even on the bandwagon Biden faces continued low approval ratings concerns about age poll finds right now we know we have we have you know president's sister's pants he's walking out of metal all honor ceremonies you got Hunter Biden there's an indictment coming on him right um you got Kamala Harris uh they're now you know gearing her up to become in the spotlight you know articles talking about you know she's ready to take over the president's office if necessary um they're actually you know left media they're talking about they're they're arguing over whether or not she's going to be the next president or whether or not she should be the next president um and not talking anything about the elections my question is you guys do you think they're about to move to get this guy out I think that's always been the plan I think these people are off smarter than people getting credit for I think they understand that Biden was put in a power and positioned to do a job which is going to be a very unpopular job he was going to be the person who they put in because remember this guy's a swap creature for the last 50 years all right he finally wanted his turn he you know his turn and because he put in his time and they knew that he was going to go in on the first day and sign all those executive orders they knew that he was going to uh turn the DOJ into a two tier justice system they knew that he was going to open the borders wide open they knew that he was going to send all this money you you crane and they knew that most of America was going to say that's bullshit all right and because they knew this I believe personally these people planned on him coming in being the deliverer of bad news and then replacing him with someone else and like we've talked before on the show you know a lot of people say it's going to be Gavin Newsom could be uh I think Gavin Newsom is a pretty poor choice when you consider the actual track record that he's created in California all right he's created the literal worst state in the union uh and they have the biggest amount of people leaving that state of any state in the history of the United States okay so there's that so then who else is there oh well there's Michelle Obama who fits right into line with everything they believe these people don't believe in meritocracy they don't believe in someone who can do the job they believe in images and first and I'm the first female I'm the first trans this I'm the first this look look they their whole goal is all based around identity politics and cultivating votes and division around the identity politics and so with them slowly losing the black community which is happening inch by inch now uh and verifiable in the polls and I think it's I think it's even more prevalent than what the polls are actually showing because of what Andrew you just stated about them prosecuting Trump I think a lot of the black population in America is recognizing that these are some of the same techniques that they've used against their own black men uh for decades and un lawful unjust prosecution and so that's pushing a lot of black voters and so I think they're gonna scramble I don't think these people uh I still think these people believe that nobody sees through their shit and I think they're gonna move this dude out and put Michelle uh I think they're gonna put Michelle Obama in that's what I think they're gonna so you think he'll make it to the next election but just won't win I don't know I think they might just try to run her instead I dude for some reason there I have this gut feeling that it's not new some it's Michelle Obama you know there's been enough little signals of it uh I believe that Barack Obama is the person is calling the shots behind all of these moves he said that before there's clips of him saying I wouldn't run or run again but I wouldn't mind being the guy behind the scenes in fact here's the clip I said this before I uh people would ask me knowing what you know now do you wish like you had a second a third term um and I used to say you know what if if I could make an arrangement where um I had a I had a uh stand in a frontman or frontwoman and they had a near piece in and I was just in my basement and my sweats looking through the stuff and then I could sort of deliver the lines but somebody else was uh doing all the talking and ceremony I'd be fine with that so he says this so I I believe and I think a lot of people believe that he's running shit anyway and what better way to stay in power than to continue you know this little gang of the Obama's the Clintons the establishment uh then putting in Michelle Obama and then trying to proper up as like you know the hero for black people uh and the migrant population you know and and I I see that as being moved that's how these people traditionally think and uh I don't think that there's any question that these people are not going to try to run this dude I think they're gonna have it's gonna have a medical issue or he's gonna have uh there's something's going to happen I wouldn't even be I wouldn't even and look this is my personal opinion but if I the way these people operate I wouldn't be surprised if they shot this dude and then blamed it on the other team that's that's part you know or just look at how shit came well I'm just saying like what if they fucking assassinate the guy and then say oh it's it's these guys over here like Magna X yeah dude like these people are evil fucks yeah so I don't think you know I don't think anybody in their little gang is safe I think it's all about you know how can we maintain power because their ability to maintain power is now equated to their ability to stay alive because they understand that if they lose power at this point they're going to be executed or put in prison for the rest of life I know I you know Biden won the election won the election from his basement right they were putting him in in a position because they wanted to have a yes man that they could do whatever they want right I don't think that Biden's been running the country for a long time I think they they just needed someone that they could run all over and again do a lot of their dirty jobs and blame it all on him Gavin Newsom would have to be putting himself much more forward already if he was going to be the next candidate I don't think Biden my personal opinion I don't think he survived to the election I don't think Kamala Harris can put a sentence together let alone run a campaign and so no I I don't know what the play is but it smells dirty yeah it does yeah I agree I just thought it was interesting man because like the stuff with Hunter Biden comes out talk my how they and they're they're gonna indict him and then all of a sudden you get all the head not saying yeah we're allowed to talk about the Biden's now and it's interesting because we've helped we've helped hire some people out of Fox News and one of the reasons they said that they didn't like being there is they weren't allowed to talk about the Biden's at Fox News right and so the media is running a play as much as the people in power oh yeah this is a coordinated rowing it's a rose like these people are all rowing towards a globalist you know communist type got world government they're all bought in they're all bought and paid for it they're all selling their souls for for a few dollars they're selling their fellow man their fellow citizen down the drain the idea of America down the drain they're insulting the history and the honor and the sacrifice that has been made for this country to even exist for a few bucks it's disgusting

from these are my pants you know all right head line up to let's get back into it now this is the interesting like let's get real on this topic real quick I tried not to laugh um but I we we love to show the dichotomy of of the news right like what one side says versus what the other side says and then what's kind of in the middle truth right and I couldn't find I mean I don't think you could have found a better example of that um then this second headline topic here so let's dive into it this is a an associated press AP news article headline reads an influx of migrant children test the preparedness of New York schools okay um and this article you know I'll briefly go over it just intro in it um it says uh Damien H5 was giddy with excitement as he left a man had an homeless shelter sometimes running and skipping along the side to walk accompanied by his wistful mother a migrant from Ecuador quote what I want from him is a future Kimberly Kerapuchja said in Spanish of her son one of nearly 800,000 New York City public school students who headed off to class Thursday for their first day of school uh of the new school year that is what school officials want too uh as the city's classrooms work to accommodate nearly 20,000 migrant children newly arrived in the US a number that could swell as record number of families cross the border from ex-going hopes of gaining asylum now this is a long article and they go through it it's very it can touch you make you know they got all these nice pictures right but what's really happening in New York it's kind of scary right and it's just scared everybody so let's let's dive into what's really going on in New York this hell on roots some New York schools forced to turn away kids on first day of school as influx of migrants join classrooms which AP News didn't touch at all thousands of kids have been turned away because there is no more room for them um the article goes into are they turning away the migrants or they're turning away the American citizens so the first day of classes kicked off in New York city on Thursday schools grapple with the influx of migrant students with some buildings turning away kids as 21,000 children seeking asylum in a day did already jam packed classrooms are the line to get inside newcomers high school and long island city uh stretched around the block early Thursday as frustrated teachers vented that the building had already hit capacity pushing students at goth them a different school inside the building uh to a facility across the street uh quote it's a capacity issue a teacher told the post they should have worked this out two days ago uh many of the migrant students were beaming and proudly wearing their queens shelter IDs around their next um now the Department of Education did jump in on this pathetically um this hell on roots uh department of education offers a pathetic letter of guidance to teachers about influx of migrant students during ongoing New York city crisis so this was the the letter that was sent out to all the staff members for all of the schools in New York city um let's briefly summarize in it um the main points were the uh the the Department of Education does not track immigration status suggesting that it can't give schools any idea of how many kids they'll be taken but then warns all administrators that they should not turn any students away uh the second point that the DOE made to this letter that says students may not arrive speaking English schools should find a teacher who speaks that language if available if not available then use federal funding to hire some translators third point was it uh it is up to the schools themselves to identify how many English language learners they have within 10 days uh the kids might not have school supplies so again the city tells them to use federal funding to buy some uh encouraging schools to quote create care package closets um and then offering uh if they're saying uh if they're still in trouble please complete the central project open arms team support requests form now it's all interesting because there's also been a flip from mayor Adams which I thought was pretty interesting uh mayor mayor uh Eric Adams warned that the raging migrant crisis will destroy New York city and touring to President Biden for ignoring his please for help uh let's jump to the video see what he has to say this issue will destroy New York City destroy New York City we're getting 10 000 migrants a month one time we were just getting Venezuela now we get Ecuador now we get Russian speaking coming through Mexico now we getting uh western Africa now we getting people from all over the globe have made their minds up that they're going to come through the southern part of the border and coming to New York City and everyone is saying it's New York City's problem every community in this city is going to be impacted we have a 12 billion dollar deficit that we're going to have to cut every service in this city is going to be impacted you you asked for right so it's very very interesting to you question that I was not I did try to dig I wasn't able to find you know which kids were being turned away if they were Americans or not but it's still a very very troubling thing to say and obviously I don't know if they ever come out and admit who was turned away but what do we got on this guys I mean I you know I mean we real be real people look y'all motherfuckers talked about this and wanted this and rooted for this and cried for this and clapped for this and y'all bitched about how Trump wanted to build a wall and how it was racist and how you know these things were immoral and Trump's a piece of shit and all that you have a OC at the border crying cheese from New York you should blame her okay this is the United States of America this is not the world's dumpster this is not come here uh and expect all of us to take care of you this is this is again this is a building upon the the comment that I made a few shows ago where I talked about Americans being the slaves of the world all right we are expected to work our asses off we are told that if we work our asses off that we will achieve the American dream and then they take half of the money that we work our asses off to earn and then they do things like give it to these people who shouldn't even be here in the first place and so I'm actually kind of glad that this is happening in New York because you guys are the guys that vote for this shit you're the people that come on the internet and trash everybody and call everybody racist and yell at everybody and shame everybody for everything that is common sense that America is supposed to stand for and now you're getting a taste of your own policies and you don't fucking like it I actually don't care it doesn't bother me I live in the Midwest I live in the Missouri bro we got common sense here all right this shit doesn't bother me that's a big problem for you guys because you guys are assholes and you don't listen to people like us out here who still believe in America and still understand what American culture actually is American culture is not unity amongst the people of the world American culture is unity amongst American values and American belief systems and if you want to come here cool you go through the process just like my man right here went through just like my other guy on the team s i had went through and then you become an American citizen and then when you become an American citizen you adopt American values you learn the language you you behave as if you are a part of this country and that's not what's happening what's happening is these people are being brought over here they're being told to come here they're being shipped here by third world countries they're emptying fucking prisons in some of these countries and sending those people here and the Biden administration is allowing it to happen because they want the fucking votes to stay in power they also wanted to loot American culture they also wanted to moralize and deconstruct and destabilize what we have had here for the last two hundred and forty seven years all right so that's what this is about and I don't feel one bit sorry for any of you in New York because you don't speak up you don't say the truth you don't say what's actually going on and now you're dealing with this and you act like everybody's going to feel sorry for you I don't feel sorry for you one bit no not at all and I got two things on this because I mean the first thing is people used to come to America to be an American right not for a giant daycare where they're just going to be taking care of right we and they wanted to come they want to learn the language contribute wanted to pay taxes they wanted to be part of the of this great nation that was a beacon of light for the entire world because we had freedom right and that's entirely different than what's happening right now where you were the melting pot people would come they were part of America because they wanted to be part of America not just get as much government funding as they could right right the second thing that I think is really interesting so I totally agree with you and like yeah sometimes you get your own cooking like you you vote for terrible people and you get terrible bills and then guess what bad things happened to you I don't actually feel that bad for you second thing is he talked about the budget deficit he's like oh man we got this big budget deficit well guess what your policies do make a big impact the tax data for 2020 which is most recent tax data 19 billion dollars of annual taxable income left the state in New York for places like Texas and Missouri and Florida these are people who are the hardworking Americans are tired of being taxed death regulated to death have a homeless problem have poor policies everywhere they're like fine I'll just up and leave and the thing is a lot of those people they don't want to leave right because if you've got family roots there if you're if you're entrenched in your community you don't want to leave but they've made it so bad that they had to leave well when the hardworking Americans leave the ones who make a lot of money and then you import people who aren't working but want a lot of government handouts turns out you have a budget deficit I mean I'm not a mathematician but I'm pretty sure that's how it works and so that's what's happening in New York whereas states like Florida are flush with cash because they actually have hardworking Americans you know the Citadel CEO making half a billion dollars a year moved from Chicago to Florida well I bet he pays some taxes and I bet the Chicago budget is going to be hurting so the thing is the the nice part is there's a scorecard now right you have blue states that are hurting they can't pay their bills you see this with California talking about Gavin Newsom's track record there which is gross Illinois has a real problem because of Chicago you have places like New York well those states are just going to die just like these businesses right bad policies get bad results and then you kind of have to deal with the results I don't care yeah your thing it's natural order yeah it's it's natural reality of how things work here you know in a lot of here's the next thing just so to put this in your ear we don't have any politicians with the balls to actually solve the problem that's a big fucking problem okay if if I was in there and I was president all these people would be deported I would round them all up because this is what's going to happen somebody's going to get in and they're going to we're going to have to get somebody in there doesn't give a fuck okay just for a little bit yes because these people these these fucking far left progressive people that can tribute literally nothing to society at all okay they shouldn't even be allowed to vote if they don't pay taxes most of them don't pay taxes but yet we're allowed to have their input on the policies and the direction of the country and we're a bullshit okay these people and I'm I'm know I know some of these people are great people and I feel for their children and I understand why they want to come here and I get all that I totally get it but the reality is this is America this isn't a world this isn't the world homeless shelter and these people are going to have to go back where they came and that means we're going to have to round them up we're going to have to put them on an airplane and we're going to have to send them fucking home all right and that's going to be a very hard thing for most Americans to like accept when they're watching it happen because there's going to be crying and it's going to be disruptive and it's going to be emotional and it's also reality of what needs to happen it has to happen and it's not just people from Mexico that are coming right he's talking about it's a fact for people from Mexico have been coming here for fucking a hundred years no one actually gives a fuck at the Mexicans are here especially that show no let's be really hard that's right they're good people yeah they can tribute they end up becoming citizens and they they're a big part of our economy and actually dude we love our Mexicans welcome but yes but these people from China and Russia and and western Africa and all these other places bro they got to go they got to go all right like that's reality and the thing is you got us just send them back to it like we don't know where they all get you're talking about put them on a plane and send them home like I don't even care like they came from Mexico Mexico needs to deal with the fact that they let them all in and then shove them across the border like no you go back to Mexico they can deal with that yeah well and and they're then they're gonna learn real quick oh we don't want to do that anymore we should stop allowing that to happen yeah for sure I agree with that yeah we we fly them all back over the border and we put them right back there and we good luck maybe this next time I agree consequences have impacts yeah I agree dude guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys I like that idea better than my idea all right I like that a lot better all right like that's a lot cheaper too it is a lot cheaper yeah this house think of this plane tickets to Russian China like no they're not gonna take them to Mexico they're not gonna take those people no so so dude that's a great idea just put them right back over there and let them deal with it yeah do it yeah because I think that would be the challenge right because a lot of these border crosses when they come to the border they're ditching all of their IDs and passports and like for sure so it's gonna be hard to there's another thing it's happening too as those people come across the border they're being registered to vote Democrat just so you know right there on the fucking spot okay so when you guys wonder why Biden smirks and he laughs and doesn't give any shits about the stuff that he does it's because he knows that he has 40 to 50 million votes on day one that are already coming in without him having to do shit that's why he doesn't care about campaigning that's why they can put him in his basement that's why he's not doing debates that like you guys are not understanding the game that these guys play I'm have to and the conservative side the Republican side isn't playing the same game they're saying oh that's cheating that's actually not cheating because it's allowed by the law and until you play the same game that's allowed by the law meaning early voter registration mail-in votes all the shit you're gonna continue to fucking lose if people really care about this next election and their neighborhoods and their communities they will get engaged in the actual voting process they will get engaged in registering votes they will get engaged in in a heart ballot harvesting they will get engaged all this shit that should be illegal but isn't that the other team is doing this is like saying oh well the steroids at baseball should be illegal but they're not illegal right so like I'm talking about back in the 90s okay you have you have all these dudes using steroids and it's not illegal and everybody's saying whether cheating well they're actually not cheating and if you don't start to use them guess what happens you lose to the people who do okay so this is the reality of the election cycle it's no different than performance enhancing drugs in sports like when Andy Pettic got popped for performance for taking steroids 20 years ago you know what he said he said yeah fuck man I'm getting paid 20 million dollars a year these dudes are all doing it I had to do it too and you know what everybody said I get that right who was the guy that had the shit in his locker on TV interview that was Mark McWire but it wasn't it wasn't that was a supplement it was called andro six by EAS all right it was a fucking testosterone precursor that converts in testosterone like that was that was kind of a lie got you all right so I'm not sitting here saying that he didn't take the shit because the motherfucker look like Zeus Greek guy all right but at the same time I also condone steroids for professional sports I want to see home runs it goes 600 feet I want to see athletes when fucking three nine 40s like I want to see that shit if you're going to be the best let's take it all in bro fucking back yeah I like that area sports so like I'm all about I was a big Barry Bonds fan like yeah sure his goals growing a little bit yeah you know man he could hit that ball yeah yeah guys jumping on the conversation let us know what you guys think hashtag back to his killer but if you guys think you're gonna hit a fucking 600 foot home run without playing by the same rules of these motherfuckers play you're sorely mistaken yeah for sure it's a fact man guys get on to our third and final headline headline number three headline number three reads and definitely wasn't baroque's first time oh buddy video is now live took a call to the interviews Larry Sinclair on his alleged gay encounter with Barack Obama in back of limousine this is a gateway pun to article um those are our buddies yeah good good guys like us again I like the gateway pun I listen I still read and I like the dudes that do it yeah man they're awesome but yeah so they're going to put it on a reading Larry Sinclair the man who claims to have had a sexual encounter the former president Barack Obama in 1999 took to x formerly Twitter Wednesday to issue a statement promising explosive revelations uh Sinclair specifically thanks Tucker Carlson and unnamed others for inspiring him to come forward and put and quote put everything on the table on Tuesday Tucker Carlson released a teaser of his recorded interview with Larry Sinclair which is scheduled to air on suckers show on next Wednesday at six p.m. has come out since then um so Larry Sinclair first made his allegations public in 2008 uh just before Obama's first presidential election claiming that he had smoked crack and had sex with Obama despite Sinclair's criminal record and the widely disputed nature of his claims Tucker Carlson has has been vocal in his supporters Sinclair's story insisting that the allegations hold truth he was willing to sign a signed affidavit and a polygraph which they actually did and it didn't come back with any any flags so here's the intro video for you guys that have not seen uh seen this just yet you're just a guy who's in town for the night and it sounds like you're looking to party yeah hold up in a bar outside yeah there's this guy that's introduced to me as Barack Obama I had given Barack $250 to pay for Kurt I started putting a line on a CD tray to snort and next thing I know he's got a little pipe and he's smoking so I just started rubbing my hand along this line to see where it was going and it went the direction I had intended it to go even though you had sex with him twice you did cocaine with him watching smoke crack twice you had no idea who he was I had no idea who he was he just asked the obvious question what was Obama like on crack um is it your sense that that's who Obama is just transactional or that he's bisexual or like what is that it definitely wasn't for rocks first time and I would almost be willing to bet you it wasn't as long the guy's running for president and credible information comes out that he's smoking crack and having sex with dudes that seems like a story well I would be a story of the media really cared about telling people the truth so first of all didn't this guy look like he would be on the episode of like 1990s fucking cops yes you know what were you doing sir I was just trying to suck a little bit you know say it like I was just smoking like he'd be the guy that was the guy he says it's so like like you did nothing like nothing out of the ordinary man I was just in there smoking crack and I wouldn't suck some dick you know like that's that's that's what the fuck he sounds like that's why it's so believable right listen listen I don't think he's lying man I don't he doesn't feel like he's lying I don't think he's lying and like here's the thing man like so obviously he looks he looks rough there right yeah yeah he's old and there's pictures of him like back from those signs regular good looking dude you know I'm saying like to like he suck his dick I know no no no no that's it good laugh it's so much bro this is a very interesting story man and and so must he chimed in on it this headlight says you you know must slam Tucker Carlson interview he didn't really slam it okay all he said was quote of course the probability that his claims are true would have to rest on objective evidence rather than claims made by someone with a dubious history that's all he tweeted out and listen I think I swear I think that is fair yeah um you know we could make all the jokes we want brother but like at the end of the day really fucking cares that's what I'm saying where's it yeah I mean yeah I don't really that's the other part of it too right like you know but it there is this trend of just you know interesting thing right you guys remember a couple of weeks ago there was this whole thing about Obama's diary coming out this headline reads Barack Obama told ex quote I make love to men daily but in the imagination and that's because he already did it in person you know I'm gonna get some to work with yeah you know and then his brother comes out Barack Obama brother claims he's definitely gay so I mean like dude listen yeah I don't know listen I think in terms of chess yeah what did I say earlier in the show who did I say the nominee was gonna be Mike all right so what better way to create fanfare around that candidate Michelle Obama then to run a smear campaign against Obama for being gay and have all the conservatives laugh at him and make fun of him and and say duties you know like you know I do real real talk I don't care I don't fucking care that he likes to fuck dudes or whatever I'm give shit nope I don't think most people give a shit but what better way to create a vacuum for momentum then to slam him and and and make him shame him for being gay or doing gay sex um and then bring his wife out and I mean dude this is way out there like I should probably put on my tinfoil hat always because I don't because yeah because I don't fucking look dude I don't fucking buy into this big mic shit like everybody does like I don't I don't know I don't like I think I think I think it's I think it's kind of bro look at those shoulders listen I get that she's a big woman but you know what dude like there's lots of women out there that are bigger women like you know uh I actually think it's kind of cruel how people treat her and I don't like her at all I I'm not a fan of her I'm not a fan of him I think it's cruel how how people treat her but but let's say it was true all right what better way to create a vacuum for momentum than for him to come out and say you know what actually I am gay and actually Michelle is trans and actually we've been ashamed our whole entire lives for it and now we're okay oh you understand uh that's how I see it and we're all talking about Obama right now that's right we said we're we're using the name constantly everybody's talking about it Tucker just you know and I love Tucker but he just gave him a big microphone yeah and and and I think you know all press is can be good press yeah and I think this is just an example of like well now we're talking about Obama we're now allowed to say the Biden's RMS I have trouble arguing with your Michelle Obama argument on the nominee like yeah I can see that and so like dude think of like what all the momentum has been for the last two or three years it's all been around this trans it's all been around this this pulling to me yeah right what a politicization yeah that word all right um it's all centered around the trans community for the last two and a half years and there's so much anger and so much dividing and so much frustration specifically about this stuff making its way into the school system and um you know the conservative side or the 80% of common sense people have made fun of her I mean like dude that's that's a real angle like like if she really is trans I don't think she is but let's just say I'm wrong and she is bro and they come out and say yeah by the way we've had to hide our who we are because of the soul of this country and blah blah like bro that's a fucking strong argument I think I think I think I think that's the strongest play that they have in their fucking arsenal you know I'm saying that's definitely some tinful but I also I know it's way out there and I even by my standards is way out there I'm just being real but like we have to think through all potential possibilities for sure you know for sure I mean I I did love reading the the counter counter arguments to this on how they've been doing it um I just look at her face she looks like that woman who yelled at that kid for having the gatsom flag on his backpack she does yeah yeah she's making the same face yeah they all make that same face they do this a little bit of well look it's not me but yeah yeah okay they've been trying to save them I don't like he's I don't know man it's just it's just a whole lot well look dude I I I uh I certainly fall in the middle when I think of my I don't believe that people should be shame for being gay or even being trans no all I simply want is for you to leave little kids alone let them have their childhood and discover who they are on their own and not make this seem like it's some normal thing it's not a normal thing it's less than 4% of the actual population and now it's become a trend where a lot of children are now have now and this has been going on for long enough to where we have had lots of children transition chemically or through surgery and then there's enough of them they have the created a movement called the detransition movement where these people are out on the podcast circuit now on the mainstream they can't really get mainstream coverage but they're out on the podcast circuit talking about how they were manipulated course and really not educated on what the decision was that they were making and their lives are ruined and uh you know but when you consider how these people think and what they value these people don't value meritocracy they don't value who can do the job they value who represents this certain they value representation right um and it's all for it's all for bullshit they don't really value representation they just understand that that's the way that they can maintain their political momentum so um you know like I personally like if I'm being real like I thought the story was I I thought I think that story is beneath Tucker being honest like I don't I didn't think it was cool I saw him doing it and I was like this is fucking stupid like I don't really give a fuck and I don't think we should give a fuck if men are gay in this country I don't I don't know but all that though I mean what what here here is something though there could be a thing right because this dude came out in 2008 before the election yeah we talked about how before our elections we don't know how long they've been unsecured and we don't know how long they've been stealing them you know was did they do a dry run of like you know the whole suppression ship when it comes to major news don't DJ they've been depressed they've been suppressing the news look listen here's what happened with that to me that's the story yeah but see let me explain something to you because you're not old enough to to know this I don't mean that and I just mean physically you have you haven't been through enough of it the news manipulation and the narrative manipulation was much stronger before the internet it just feels stronger now because we can see it right all right the internet has become this double edged sword at first these people thought they were going to use it and they did use it to control everything going on on the internet they created political movements like political correctness don't offend people silent majority don't speak up for your beliefs cancel culture if they don't step in line let's get them fired from their job these are all things that they the tyrant class the elite quote unquote class of people created via the technology of the internet they never thought that it would actually provide the transparency would and actually show people what they were actually doing so they created this tool that they thought would push us into a more controlled place meaning they would have more control we would have less freedom and it's actually backfiring in their face so back when they had mainstream narratives and there wasn't like you know the internet all over like dude there was all kinds of this shit happening that we never ever just didn't know about yeah we never heard about it we know about and I hate to tell you I read a john Adams dot you know book talking about his life and for like the first and second and third presidential election in the United States George Washington you know john Adams the media was trying to manipulate information to get people to elect the president that they wanted right there's a long time ago I just think the issue is normal America has been really bad at this game right the the elite left has figured out how to use the media to push on these things and I actually think Twitter the internet has is is our only chance of actually finding out what's really going on and obviously shows like this but but I think this has been happening for a very very long time we just didn't even know about it I just think we're finding out more about it which is encouraging and people are waking up and they're starting to think in a way that they haven't in many many years well that's why we see them getting more aggressive too because the reason it feels more aggressive now than it did 20 years ago that those of you that have old enough to remember that is because they see us waking up yeah and they're flailing yes and their reaction isn't to be cool and back up a little bit see if they were smart they're they're their reaction right now would be okay they see what we're doing meaning introducing communism into the United States that's flat out what's happening yep and if they were smart they would say all right they see us let's take a step back that's not happening and the reason it's not happening is because most of these people are elderly and they realize that they're only five to ten years away from being in the ground and they want to see this happen and they're junk on power that's right so they're pushing it now in a way that's actually exposing them more and more and more and this is why you see Trump gain more power the more they push on him yeah for the top of the fact that you know if they don't continue to push it's accountability you know I'm saying like yeah but see they would avoid accountability by backing up okay but they're not these people are not in a position to back up yeah because it used to be they would dial it up to 11 yes every the conservatives the normal Americans would kind of wake up and then they dial it back to eight and we'd be like okay everything's fine now we get back to him where you right and used to that and then they dial it from there they used to do that and they're not doing it anymore no we're at the end because these people are old and they're going to die and they want to see the realization of what they've dedicated their entire life to like any of us would yeah they've lost our actions this is why Trump in my opinion is the guy for 24 because Trump is the only candidate that actually has real life motivation to clean this up yeah all right you can have the vague you can have all these other guys but the reality is they've ruined this guy they've they've tried to attack him he has a personal vendetta against him and by the way when you have accomplished things such as you know building multi billion dollar empire such as Trump has there's other things that begin to matter because while most people look at that and they say holy shit that's a great life accomplishment once you've accomplished it it doesn't mean as much because you've already done it you're looking at it you're like yeah that was cool but like I can still do more he's got a typical aggressive type A winners mentality about him and I think his next I think his thinking is right now and and I'm willing to bet that this is his thinking is like fuck it I'm gonna clean this shit up and when I die they're gonna remember my name for a thousand years for canceling these fuckers out okay and so like dude I'm my number one issue here is accountability for the crimes that have been created I'm never going to forget I'm never going to forgive I'm never going to stop talking about it because it was so bad okay the next one is the economy we have the best economy we'd ever had in 2000 fucking 19 that's unarguable fact 100% all right so when you consider those two issues I purse and it doesn't matter if you don't like his tweets it doesn't matter if you don't like this or that or whatever the reality is is if you want America to look like America we need a mother fucking sledgehammer to come in and swing that's what's that man guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think hashtag sin dudes that's that's don't laugh don't laugh funny it's not funny black people can't laugh that's sex and dudes let's know so that was our third and final headline so now it is time for our final segment of the show as always thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is what we bring article up we talk about it it'll get one of those two options we'll vote on them at the end so that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads couple claims they're actually cousins but refused to break up three year marriage I wish we were joking all right uh here we go on hey what state yeah what state let's say let's take let's take let's take a guess what are you saying I'm going to Arkansas Arkansas where are you going uh West Virginia yeah those are two good guesses yeah but I also think a third guess could be Missouri hey listen we're sleeping on this state here man because it's actually happened in Utah oh well that makes sense yeah actually makes sense yeah this is only wife this makes a lot of sense now bro listen so so the couple was told they looked alike before and now it's pretty clear as to why in a viral TikTok a married Utah couple claim they are actually cousins and don't plan on ending their marriage according to the Daily Mail uh tiley uh and Nick Waters said that they have been married for three years but somehow had no idea they were from the same family treat quote I wish I was kidding the video which has been viewed over 5.7 million times captured here's the video oh shit so so the video starts out with Nick wrapping one arm around as supposed cousin wife tiley cousin wife the new show as in line as they share a kiss to Leonard skin it's iconic tunes sweet home Alabama viewers flooded the comments section and demanded a follow-up vid from the couple to explain how they are related the Utah couple revealed in a quote silly facts video uh they share the same birthday and also admitted they were told that they looked alike however the pair never explained how they are related um and neither did they spill the beans on how they found out quote I just need to know if you're kidding or not I need the algorithm to bring me back to the story time uh one comment replied in the last uh follow-up video quote that's disgusting uh we are not going to take incest relationships and try and make them normal both of you need therapy and angry and angry reply or voiced uh a different Utah couple experienced a similar outcome uh documenting that they found out that they were third cousins after they got married Marcelo Hill found out about the shocking development when she and her husband looked at their family trees for baby name ideas she revealed on tic-tac that's when he'll and her husband realized their grandparents had the same first and last names so he calls his grandma and I call my grandpa and we asked them if they knew each other sure enough sure he'll recall the relative's answers uh guys we got a good old Utah versus Alabama showdown well we got on this this thumbs up or is this double smuck I'm confused I don't know I don't know that I care that much like okay I like it's like if you like in America today you can kind of marry anything you want like why is this anything worse than you know well this isn't worse than like cutting off your penis right for instance like okay like sure I don't I don't know why five million people thought this was very it's it's it's funny it's a little weird you know you're married like whatever once you find out though like now you're kind of stuck like you know what are you gonna do with this man they don't have kids yet yeah I'm saying so like they seem happy I mean isn't that the standard we use now you know I mean dude I don't know what to think I think it's messed up that it happened but now this happens like okay whatever like yeah I will have no impact on the rest of my day whether they stay together or not look I you know it's Utah yeah that's obviously what's going on in Utah bro yeah right Utah is different place man like people are different it is what it is I I like Utah I think Utah is a great place yeah beautiful people do it different out for sure we got on the thumbs up thumbs fuck I got no comment I like like I like yeah I'm standing from above frankly scarlet I don't yeah this is the first time this has happened on on CTI where we have abstained from thumb I'm not gonna fucking stay here and say oh yeah they should get divorced or would I like I don't I don't know man thumbs up if they're happy it's whatever yeah do you do you do you boo boo yeah I mean it's probably good idea to check family tree and Utah before she before you get married as a note to everyone else listening you should check some background before you marry someone yeah probably maybe on the first date yeah you should find out like you know are they relative or are they actually a dude or actually a girl like there's a lot of things you want to look into before you get married that's important I would encourage that very very important dude that's I don't know man yeah that's weird that's wild man we're guys Andy Andrew that's all I got yeah brother
