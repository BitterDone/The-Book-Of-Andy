let's take a drive through these headlines and let's just see what's out there let it let's do let's let's do that remember as always if you lovely folks would like to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy forsella.com you guys can check them all out there for you with that being said head on number one so we obviously World War 3 is it's happening I'd imagine a little bit more a little hot snack bars happening but it's interesting so let's let's let's talk about that how it you know what we're at right now how it got here we got some updates Trump claims Israel Iran ceasefire is in effect despite initial violation so this has been going on for a couple of days I think 12 days so far that's what they're saying and it's been hot it's been hot but but basically Israel launched a surprise barrage of attacks on sites in Iran on June 13th which officials said were necessary to head off an imminent threat that Iran would build nuclear bombs the two nations valid strikes for several days and then the US military struck Iran's nuclear sites on June 22nd dismissing assessments from Trump's own intelligence agents that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon so that happened Trump tweeted put this out on truth social saying we've completed a very successful attack on three nuclear sites in Iran including Foto Nantets Nattans and Estafan yes to yeah glory yes definitely yeah there we go yeah and for those that are not geopolitically astute geographically as well yeah and geographically astute they're parallel right they're right there next to each other in the book I gave you yeah yeah here's a map but and the crazy thing is dude like there is some interest in like coordination that's happening about I think on the diplomatic front as far as like you know hey hey bro I'm gonna know I might be doing this right because this came out that there were some satellite images that show trucks lining up at these locations days before the B2 bombers came in and and now actually at the time of recording there's reports that are coming out from the post bombing I guess site surveys that not much really was damaged at all so it's been like a lot of you know circuitry circuitry around this a lot of barnum and daily a lot of debauchery yeah no that's not the right word there's been a lot of there's a lot of theatrics I don't know around this and it's interesting you know shortly after the bombing Iran then launched a missile store it's one of our bases in Qatar but then that came out that that was coordinated right like there's a lot but then there was the ceasefire deal which is where I really want to dive into because the ceasefire got really really weird and a pissed off jump a little bit right what first before that what what should take what do you think was happening here because like said there was a lot of coordination you don't just magically know days before that you know these specific sites are gonna get bom and then you have the enough time to move resources and people out of those areas so they're you know to limit the amount like there's a lot of coordination and it makes me feel like there's a plan but like how do you see it how do you see that piece you know I see it a different way than I think I've seen anybody else say that they see it um first of all it's been being in business for as long as I have you know I've developed the skill of wait and see all right let things play out and you can't just rush to judgment when you're dealing especially at the highest levels of strategic action it's been fun watching literally almost everybody be fucking wrong about this entire thing right um this is gonna happen yeah right and you know I can't believe I voted for Trump and you know this is what I voted for yeah right it's been ridiculous like y'all are bunch of idiots okay uh pro next time instead of trying to be first why not try to be right and I think the bigger point of that is we have a lot of people that are trying to be right and then actually being wrong and dividing people along those lines which is stupid okay we need unity we need people to get along we need people to understand what's going on and a lot of these people aren't helping and the reason they aren't helping is for their own attention their own ego and they want to be the first person dude you mother fuckers are always wrong okay real talk um I here's what I think okay and I don't know anything of the situation I haven't talked anybody this is just what I observe first of all like I've said over and over and over Trump is not an idiot he's a very smart very very smart man I don't agree with every single thing that he does but I think that's very fucking healthy all right I think you know people have to give this man credit for where he is good and what he's really good at is structuring deals and playing the strategy to his favor that's how you take a million dollars and turn it into billions of dollars so I see it differently than I think everybody else is seeing it here's what I think is actually happening and this is going to make some people fucking uncomfortable but I don't care for the longest time forever and ever and ever my entire life the United States has been beholden and attached to this idea that Israel is its greatest ally and we have so much financial manipulation happening in our government from the country of Israel whether it's through packs like a pack or whether it's through you know media manipulation or whether it's through people serving in our government that are dual citizens there's just an overwhelming amount of influence from Israel to our government onto this country which I don't agree with we shouldn't have any of it it should be illegal no country should have that much influence over us or really any influence we shouldn't take any money from other countries we shouldn't be allowing people that are citizens of other countries serving our government there's a lot wrong it's funny because we can call out like Ilhan Omar right for you know when she says oh you know I'm gonna support the people of Somalia any country you know I'm saying but like what I'm saying is like everybody can pile on them like oh that's fucked up but you know let it be a white flag with a blue star David and it's like oh hold on that yeah yeah but you know a double standard 100% it is but like dude that's the psychological manipulation the culture manipulation that's happening and that's not happening from the Jews it's happening from the the Israeli government and their intelligence agency so they manipulate this country to get the people in power to do what they want and whether they do it with the carrot via money or the stick via punishment they do it and everybody knows they do it and anybody says they don't do it is it has their head up their ass so what I think is actually gone on here is that Trump has historically taken money from these influences in order to get elected which makes him beholden to this narrative that he's on Israel side and he's been a very vocal supporter of Israel for a long time but for the last I don't know year and a half two years whatever that's been this thing that they've done in Gaza has continued to sour the taste of anyone who has human decency because of the brutal nature of it and it's tried to be explained it's tried to be communicated it's tried to be justified but it's just too much for the average person to say hey I'm okay with that and I believe Trump believes that too and so when Israel struck around which that's how it happened they they set their shit to Iran first when that happens that sort of puts Trump in a weird position very similar to like what happened with COVID where people around him came to him and they said hey we need to shut the country down and he didn't really know what was going on he had these people around him he shut it down and ended up not working out in his favor in fact I think it ended up really screwing him over so I think they try to do the same thing here I think they tried to pin him into a corner basically saying is or around has all these nukes which comes from Netanyahu Netanyahu has been saying that for 30 40 years all right I believe what has happened here is that Trump has started to understand that Netanyahu is not a good dude and he's doing bad shit and I don't think Trump wants to be affiliated with him the way that he has been in the past so they come to him with this narrative that says hey these guys are a week away from having nuclear weapons and you have to do something or they're going Israel won't exist right so I think what he does is he ends up realizing that he's pinned between these two options because one option is attack around and piss off your entire base outside the hardcore mega neocons right and while also pissing off for shit ton of Muslims yeah the muslim nation or you have to stand by Israel and you know piss off basically all the people who have the neocons and the you know the the Jewish influence so either way which is very powerful in this country okay so either way it's a lose lose for him all right so so we didn't hear anything for him from like five or six days about any of this and I think what he came up with was a way to decouple himself from Netanyahu and I think that's what we've been observing so I think what happened here was because people don't realize they did not attack all of Iran's nuclear sites only three and there's many more that didn't get touched or the mines or right so so I think this is how it went down I think Trump calls Iran and says hey man we're gonna shoot these three facilities with bombs get all your people out this is happening it is what it is after words you can shoot rockets at us as long as they don't hit us and then we will declare a ceasefire and this will be over that satisfies everybody correct except it doesn't yeah because Netanyahu will never be satisfied with peace their agenda is not defend Israel it's actually grow Israel and it's opened everybody else correct and we can do that because America's got our back okay and that's what's happening and and and if you don't think that's what's happening then you are not seeing it clearly so when we think about what's actually going on here and what we're seeing I think we've seen I think Trump knew that Israel would not obey the ceasefire yeah all right and and I think his plan which you know this morning he came out and he said hey I'm pissed off at Israel now I'm pissed that I ran to but I'm way more pissed at Israel and that was kind of how he said it and then you know where he said do you not fucking understand that or whatever right I got the clip yeah play the clip here's the clip yeah do they violated but Israel violated it too Israel as soon as we made the deal they came out and they dropped the load of bombs the likes of which I've never seen before the biggest load that we've seen I'm not happy with Israel you know when I say okay now you have 12 hours you don't go out in the first hour just drop everything you have on them so I'm not happy with them I'm not happy with the run either but I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this morning because of one rocket that didn't land that we shot perhaps by mistake that didn't land I'm not happy about that we have we basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing you understand that so that's the clip all right and what I read from that is exactly what I'm saying I think dude listen I think Trump is like one of the strategies one of the smartest people strategically there is I think he has a blind spot in regards to the people around him that he chooses to listen to and I think he underestimates how evil some people are because I think he's actually a really good dude and when I observe what's going on here and I hear him say that what I what I observe happening is he's decoupling himself from Netanyahu all right because most of his base like the 80% in the middle okay not the not the you know not the not the far right quote-unquote mega loyalist israel's our best ally not those people I'm talking about the common person has started to see very clearly israel's influence over our country and they're very pissed off about it and Trump's been you know being accused of being part of it he's been being called netanyahu's puppet and all of these things but he can't just turn around and say hey fuck you guys because there's so much influence behind that so he has to make it appear which I think he's done that netanyahu is just a bloodthirsty fucking crazy person and he can now step back and kind of go like this and I don't know if this will happen you know this is pure speculation but he can now step back and be like look I did I tried to create a ceasefire Israel broke it there's nothing more I can do and and then let and then he could say well you know that you got to deal with your own because they're not capable of dealing with their own fights right so if you think about what the result of that is the result is one most of his base comes back and says fuck yeah dude like they see him say that well he just said this morning all those all those people who were like dude I shouldn't have voted for him he's he's a pup now they're all like oh shit hmm because this is of a first actual resistance to netanyahu and Israel that we've seen from him publicly yes 100% so I think this was all played out intentionally for him to decouple himself from having to support Israel in this crazy shit that they're doing yeah because it's not just him just like oh okay fuck it I'm not I'm not doing it yeah no they they they have my hands on here like they they did this himself yes exactly and I think that netanyahu is insane I think he's a terrible leader for that country his own fucking people think he's a terrible leader in fact his government was about to be dissolved and and like the day before this this missile attack for around happened people don't know his government because Israel's government works completely different than ours basically the majority comes together and they form a new government and then they elect the leader okay his party of government was on the verge of being dissolved and replaced with a new one which means he would likely actually face repercussions legally in Israel for what he's been doing yeah so it's funny because it also happened to you before October 7th I know right before October 7th right so there's a string this is netanyahu's way yeah of keeping himself in power and avoiding any accountability for the things that he's done so I think Trump I mean you don't think you think we fucking can see that and Trump doesn't see that Trump knows exactly what's going on dude so yeah man I just think that's what's happening I think he has strategically played this in a completely different way than almost anybody saw coming I think he called around and he said hey these motherfuckers are fucking crazy you know I got a support him because of this and this and this here's what I'd like to do I'd like to symbolically quote unquote bomb your nuclear sites take your trucks take whatever's out we're gonna throw these bomb we're gonna leave the rest you are then going to shoot these rockets at our base and they're not gonna hit then we're gonna declare a ceasefire and the rocket attacks will stop on a run and we'll have peace again and if they don't and and Israel starts to do that you could do whatever the fuck you want and that's how I see this playing because I don't see Trump after Netanyahu totally disrespecting him backing them again allowing that I could be wrong but I don't see it happening and I also think it dissolves all of the Trump is a you know these things that everybody says Zion Don and like he's Netanyahu's bitch and all the shit people in the scene about him like bro I think out of all the people in the world Trump probably that really pisses off so and if that was the case he wouldn't have said what he is no I could you can't say that yeah I think he's trying to I think he I think he knows I think he knows what Netanyahu's doing I think he's trying to decouple the United States responsibility to defend them and that way he can look at like you know all of his the Congress in the Senate and all of his advisors and be like what do you want me to do I got him to do peace and the guy went and did it anyway he get whatever the fuck he's getting now he deserves yeah and that's what I see him doing yeah 100% well let's talk about Congress for a second here because there's been some interesting things coming out from from Congress this headline reads raskin Trump authorizing Iran strikes likely impeachable so this is the new the new thing now right we gotta get him impeach yeah right for what he did right um and for those that don't know Jamie raskin this is the same guy who literally led the impeachments uh in 2020 in 2021 this was January 12th of 2021 where uh raskins direct quote was quote uh there are three ways to protect the nation against a president whose conduct poses a clear and present danger to the people first first way is to remove them by vote the second way is to remove a president who is proving himself a danger to the republic is to impeach him in the house for committing high crimes and misdemeanors within the meaning of the constitution or the third way is enact the 25th amendment and allow the repeat except up and and take it um so now raskins on here talking saying that um uh that he thinks it was an absolute violation of the constitution right now he's not the only one uh one of our favorite uh favorite people we'd like to bring in uh jasmine crochet crochet uh she had this to say let's check this out it's to understand enough about the constitution to the extent that i'm the one that's supposed to make the fucking decision or at least get a vote yeah so one is telling me um right so literally like i i i yeah she's complaining that she was not told or a lot like it should have been her decision yeah no she said that uh trump should have hollered yeah hollered hollered hollered no no it's interesting right and now she says i should be the one making the fucking decision no lady you shouldn't thank god yeah but but it's interesting right because they're saying the trump used you know uh you know he doesn't have the power to declare war this was a war that you know declared on the run by by doing those bombs and i i have this clip that i think is very very important for context and i think we should all watch this real quick check this out these are the countries that obama bombed in his final year of office Syria 12192 times iraq 12195 times libya 496 times Yemen 35 times Somalia 14 times and Pakistan three times 26172 bombs for a total of three bombs every hour of every day in only one year yeah but you know that's obama yeah fine nope when that was happening nobody in our country even knew it was happening it wouldn't even make the news didn't even say anything these people are total hypocrites they will lie cheat steel to get whatever they want them trying to push trump out i think this whole thing was just another covid trap to try and get him because like oh so he bombs around and he's in violation of the constitution if he doesn't bomb Iran he's a traitor to israel our greatest ally right if if everybody's gonna die from Iran yeah right if he lets Iran have nukes they're gonna new guts right right everybody has nukes okay Pakistan has nukes fucking North Korea has nukes North Korea has nukes that can hit our country okay Iran doesn't have nukes they never have had nukes this story's been going on for 40 years man so what are we doing we're we're again falling in to this cycle of media manipulation to turn the public narrative into something that destroys the country and people to vote for trump are falling for it which is absurd like like the amount of people that were like oh dude you know trump's this and that and this you know i regret voting for him what can we just wait and see what happens bro like can we just wait a second like what it's just it's indicative of how people have been finally tuned to react immediately emotionally like cancel culture shit oh he did one thing that like he said one thing out of ten you years of good shit he did one thing fuck him like that's people's attitude you know okay so with anybody i'm not just trump and that's what he's seeing and people that want this country to return to something that is recognizable as the United States of America have to understand that there are gonna be decisions that our leadership makes whether it's trump or anyone else that you personally may not agree with or may not agree with because you don't understand it yet and the biggest thing that's been getting on my nerves this last few weeks is the amount of fucking knuckleheads out there that think they know shit that know nothing they know nothing they fucking bought a podcast microphone off fucking amazon and they make content and they think they understand the dynamics of strategy or really anything okay let's be real what the fuck have you done okay you haven't built a business yet dude and people that want to have to do with well a lot actually because there's a lot of the same skill sets involved in running a company as running the country all right this budget is gotta be balanced there's a gazillion things you gotta keep everybody happy you gotta navigate the politics you gotta have good strategy you gotta there's some rules that dude sometimes you gotta make statements some like people just don't understand because they don't have the perspective of anything else than sitting in their fucking living room and talking about shit on their fucking phone okay so we're dealing with a bunch of people that because of their selfish desire to make content and get likes views and shares and internet cloud they're actually destroying the ability for our country to have any sort of unification whatsoever and these are the people that love America so like I don't doubt anybody's love for this country but maybe we should stop and say is this helping or is this hurting and am I supporting this or am I not am I contributing to the country getting better or am I dividing people and like dude I've seen so many people like bro even even people in Trump's organization saying shit like I mean better Trump and these other guys there was tweets that went out and maybe they were fake I don't know but there was tweets were saying if you didn't agree with Trump's decision to bomb around this is before we knew it was there was a call ahead of time they're saying you're never mega we don't want you well that's not the right attitude either you know what I mean like like dude there's people that do not want their sons and they're terrified they do not want their sons and daughters to go over into another country after we were just in a rack and fucking Afghanistan and before that we were in desert storm like people that are my age we've been at war in the middle east region since I was fucking 10 years old man you know what's funny about that too well it's not funny but you know all these left Democrat congressmen and senators and stuff they're like oh congress can only approve a declaration of war it's like bro you know I just think of America is only declared 11 times a declaration of war from Congress the last one that we declare it was in 1942 which means which means the Korean War the Vietnam War Operation Desert Storm war on terror none of those yeah but none of those but yeah but bro the average person doesn't understand that so when you get Jasmine Cracket and aoc and raskin and all these people who are scum of the fucking earth okay let's be real they don't give a they don't give a shit about you they don't give a shit about this country they are there to stay there to insider trade and make fucking money that is what they are they are trying to do just enough to pretend like they're helping the people so that they can stay there and walk out worth tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars that is their fucking purpose okay this that information that you put up there will never be shared it'll never be shared and our average person has no idea what we're talking about so these people get on TV and they're like he didn't go through this matter this service for this and everybody's like oh he's a fucking tyrant he's eight off Hitler he's and like dude it's just all fucking bullshit because neither the Obama neither the by yeah neither the bush neither the Clinton and dude you know I'm saying oh yes go all the way to 1942 DJ I've been alive to see this it's crazy like I'm I'm not 20 like I've seen it I see everybody that's my age is like here we go again another fucking bullshit war another you know weapons of mass just like everybody that's my age or older knows that this has happened over and over and over and unless there's some dumb fucking 75 year old fucking boomer tart okay real talk that just loves fucking fox news and they think Sean Hannity's the greatest mother fucking thing in the world like I'm being serious dude they do they love his Sean Hannity and his tyquan no he is fucking Krav Maga he kicked your ass talk to him like the brother guy's 70 years old whatever the fuck he is okay these people love war because they make money on war and none of their kids go and die none of their fucking relatives go and die and people the citizens do not want that because we've had it for three or four fucking decades straight and nothing's come of it the only thing that's happened is the people up in government and the the weapons companies and all they've gotten richer and richer and richer and richer while other people lose their sons lose their daughters get economically ruined like dude people are tired of it so I don't blame people for being pissed at Trump for launching those attacks but after you see how it was done it should be understood that this was a chess move and now he is backing himself out and I could be wrong about this for sure but it appears to me that he is backing himself out of his alignment with Israel to recapture this big large amount of his base that has thought like hey this guy selling us down the river to fucking Israel like everybody else has we don't fight American wars bro we fight Israeli wars that's the truth okay so uh and this isn't about the Jews this is about a fucking corrupt group of people at the top of the government of a country very much so like we have all right very much so like a lot of countries have so and people don't realize dude you know because people most people are good dude they don't realize that like there are people out there who dedicate their entire lives to gaining positions of power so that they can hurt other people because they like it they like hurting other people and there's a lot of who who likes hurting other people fucking a lot of people like this okay there's two kinds of people that rise to the top of power structures one is a fucking psychopath the other one is someone is usually an idealist slash realist blend who's like this is what it is and this is how it should be and they're working to bridge the gap all right this what we're dealing with in Netanyahu is a fucking psychopath a fucking psychopath and I think Trump knows it and I think Trump's tired of getting disrespected and and he's created a scenario where if he doesn't back him who the fuck's gonna blame him yeah but ultimately dude I see this as a as a trap to fuck him up and tag him in controversy keep it from making any real changes potentially get him impeached you know that's what they did the first time they locked him up and all this shit so that nothing could get done and a lot of that comes from the Israeli influence in our government so because they don't want that to change why would Israel want that to change why why they wouldn't bro because the minute that Israel doesn't have the United States stand up behind them they've pissed people off for fucking 56 60 70 years a few thousand maybe no I'm talking about the current Israel yeah okay dude it's it's dangerous and it makes me feel bad and I feel bad for all the innocent people that are in Iran and I feel bad for all the innocent people that are in Israel because bro these fucking dude listen we need a world revolution to get rid of all these fucking corrupt legacy leaders and free and motherfucking world that's what needs to happen yeah like there's too much corruption too much legacy power these people are not untouchable like for real like revolts have happened for thousands and thousands and thousands of years and uh it sure does seem like it's getting close to time for another one globally for sure well they like those regime changes we need the global one yeah but I mean dude you know like it doesn't have to be this way dude it doesn't have to be the way it is doesn't yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments of that being said cruise show continue to cruise let's go check these comments out um this first comments from uh JJK 9275 AI girlfriends may run out of memory but the real ones remember everything that's a fact that is I you know what no comment I know my fucking eyes have been blurry all day I got to take your word that's what it's like I can't see yeah I got out let's see if you see this one that uh at night hawk 5301 uh the person who could uh commented about their parents listening to this channel sounds like they are on puberty blockers you know we I can't see that one we don't make fun of kids but if we did I'd agree with you haha we got some heat man people be rolling man I bro are people gonna fuck around yeah now they don't uh until that point you know what I love the Clydesdale cartels back and action they are back everybody's back everybody's done taking a high row we're down the gutter fighting it out bro they know I see some people they see my videos and they go on there and they talk mad shit and our people come in just fucking give them puberty blockers now they're like saying biles put their balls off well now they're like some own bio they delete their their their accounts that's where it should be that's how it's about he's fucking now be fucks have gotten too much too comfortable I'm cool with it I am too I'm cool with it get on we got one more comment from McGail my routine my my my my routine is uh he says uh trump is a clown period bought and paid for uh to which um a black man said uh says the person that haven't accomplished vi irony i i make it strongest comments if y'all you saw that one yeah you see this no i'm just making it i was just speaking proper oh god yeah so uh trump is a clown period bought and paid for you know what's interesting is that every everybody accuses everybody of being bought and paid for like you you take one sponsorship deal and you're bought and paid for you know like i definitely don't take sponsorship deals but if i did i'd certainly consider it from this amazing four-manager drink i'm saying great for life if i'd be fine with that well that's not free energy drinks i am drinking for the audio listeners this amazing screaming freedom go get you some joes got the orange the orange fury typical dj's got the grape somebody stole it that's a stereotype no you stole the grape yeah no but it was stolen for me you stole it from yourself probably reverse double stole double stole it reverse theft yeah so uh yeah i mean i'm definitely not bought and paid for but uh look man you know i i like like i said i said this a hundred times like you shit i like trump i fucking like him i would love to hang out with him dude i think he's fucking hilarious i think he doesn't fuck around did you see him today when he leaned in on those motherfuckers and said do you fucking understand like bro you know that's how you run shit in the back that's how you got to run okay and uh you know i saying he's bought and paid for it appears to be that sometimes but that's why i say let it all play out because right now it doesn't feel like he's bought and paid for now it doesn't appear that i agree some you know with the Israeli money that he's taking and the uh yeah i mean it has appeared to be that way but it doesn't it isn't a true though too like you can't really control who's who gives you the money it's not like they go to you like hey here's them you know do this and or and then we'll get like no because like dude a lot of those times they just start fucking funding that shit the funding those campaigns is not like you're like you can send it back with there and so it's kind of like a old gave you money already so now you have to fucking support this is a problem with our government system okay personally i think there needs to be a better system than being able to take money from private citizens where there's implied alignment right like when you give big money to a politician there's like an implied understanding that you're going to vote a certain way or at least like have a special relationship and the A-PAC and the Israeli influence has taken this to like a level to the point where allegedly every single member of Congress according to Masi and a bunch of other people have a fucking handler yeah okay A-PAC guy a rep yeah okay so and then by the way like Kanye said a lot of these actors and all these people have that when that becomes the level of influence that's happening to almost where our government has to answer to these people that's not a real government so definitely not by the people no and that's that's what we're dealing with and people understand that at this point in time yeah so and pointing it out and being called anti-Semitic doesn't work anymore just like it doesn't work to be called racist because you point out the crime statistics that we have like the shit doesn't nobody cares like fucking call people whatever the fuck they want everybody sees what's going on and it's you can't put it back in the bottle bro so all of this like slander and social pressure and name calling and it doesn't work yeah I mean it certainly doesn't work on people I mean you but I believe that for the average person they're like they're like fuck they're starting to get like that too so that's real man yeah I you know at the end of the day right now at now by the end by the end of today it Trump may go back with Israel I don't fucking know but right now it sure doesn't seem like he's bought and paid for you know yeah well guys we do appreciate you for being a real ass fans and if we're being real what better way to open the eyes of everyone to what you're actually dealing with with Netanyahu like bro Trump is treating Netanyahu with very very strong respect for example like when Netanyahu came to the White House and Trump pushed his chair and pulled his chair out and pushed in people saw that as a sign of like supplicating weakness to Netanyahu by Trump but Trump is a Trump is by all accounts a very proper man when it comes to manners and those are the big deal for him I mean that could also be looked at as like a dominus move bro it's no different than how he pulls people in for the handshake yeah I know but it wasn't seen that way yeah it was a ticket yes yeah so when we look at how Netanyahu has treated Trump back I don't think Trump you know Trump's biggest asset and his biggest liability everybody knows is a fucking ego which is a lot of leaders okay that's why they're fucking leaders man they have no problem stepping up and taking their position like it is what it is I think what I said on this show is what's happening I think Trump is exposing what Netanyahu is really all about to everybody including his neocon pro is real I mean it would be really hard to defend him right now people are doing it oh yeah mark Levenz on TV fucking saying whoa whoa whoa you still got Sean Hannity on TV whoa but we got to ask ourselves why that is I think we you know what where's the money where's their where's their where's their where's the belief really coming from hold on you know if their finances were public what would we find you see what I'm saying so there whatever's going on here I'm making my best educated observational assumption but whatever's going on here is not what it appears to be at service level no not at all man not at all let's keep let's keep cruising yeah let's get into headline number two so it's always interesting a lot of the stuff's happening there's always other stuff happening in the background nobody really pays attention to these are the headlines they get left out let's go to New York City because there's there's something important happening up there there is a mayoral election happening mayoral mayoral mayoral man a election happening up in New York City what's a watch when that sounds racist man did it look and shit it couldn't be that's okay though there's not even one white person that's in I mean, you say the mayo. Man, mayonnaise, that's mayonnaise. Yeah. What's a watch for when the NYC mayoral results come in? So yes, so there's a race going on right now. The elections are today when we're recording this show. But there's some interesting stuff happening. And it peaked my curiosity when I saw it. It tipped it peaked. I tipped it. Trying to get me. You said, it. I was by the way, I said, tipped. No, I know you said, it because I saw Z-Sharm's fucking eyes get big when I said, it. Yeah. You know what's his birthday? No, it's not. Is it your birthday? Is it really? What are you getting for your birthday? Corrast, hurry. All social media is tender if you're Indian enough. That's right. But you have to get some bobs. Some bobs maybe. Maybe bobs are on the menu. Maybe a little side of a gene. Yeah. Is it really your birthday? Yeah. Happy birthday, man. Thank you. Yeah. All of you. I stopped counting after 24. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Whatever it is, you look good. Thank you. Yeah. For real, dude, happy birthday, man. That's fucking awesome. Thank you. All right. So after show, Curry, special. But yes. But my curiosity went up when I saw this specific headline. I know it titted. It titted it. New York City mayoral results may take time. Here's why. I said, oh, shit, man. Here we go again. Well, you know that the guy running is a straight communist. No. You have socialists. Yeah. No, he is a communist. He wants state run grocery stores, which by the way, have never worked in the history of earth. You know what state run grocery stores do? They cause everybody lose weight because there ain't no fucking food. He should be running on. I'm going to get everybody in shape. Just go that way. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, so you got these elections going on. All right. Now, like we've seen this before. I was going to take some time. We've seen this before. Let's go to the ACLU because I remember they made a headline why counting the vote can and should take time. It's insane. Come on, man. Everyone remembers the four days it took to officially call the 2020 presidential race for your Joe Biden. While that election seemed to take an inordinate amount of time, it's normal for it to take several days to process all the ballots. Yeah. Of course it does. Now, here's what's weird. Okay. So this election in New York right now, it's a close contest between Andrew Cuomo. Okay. And this communist assembly man, Zora Zora, Zora, Matt Donney. And they are saying drumroll here. July 1st, it could take even up to a week up to two weeks to get the results in for this election. Two weeks. Now, I did some math here, right? Because like that doesn't make sense, right? I pulled up New York City data, voting data. This is the primary. This is the primary. Yeah. Now I pulled up some because they're both contested, right? Like I mean, they're either open communist is going to get it or a guy with a really bad sexual potential. And only sexual. I mean, the code of shit. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot here. Yeah. So I got some on that too though. But I put up the data from New York, and this is straight from New York City. They have 4.7 million people inside of New York City that are active voters. So as you're telling me, it's going to take, in for perspective, right, our 2024 election, when we had 174 million people vote in that election, which only took two days, three days, it's going to take a week to count fucking 4.7 million. That does not make sense to me. I does. It makes perfect sense because the communist way of winning shit is to wear people out to the point where they don't care. And then they just step forward. Okay. So if you're going to take two, three weeks to count votes, you know, you're basically betting on the fact that people that are your opposition are eventually going to lose interest and you're just going to take it. That makes perfect sense because that's how they operate. They wear you the fuck down to where you get comfortable. You feel like everything, you know, it's not that big of a deal. And then they just fucking take it, dude. Yeah. I thought this was crazy to look just looking at the numbers in New York City. There's roughly only 500 and 58,000 registered Republicans in New York City. But it's like that's not a lot at all up there. I just thought that was interesting, interesting data numbers. But I want to get into Andrew Cuomo here for a little bit because there's a new thing that just came out about him. Andrew Cuomo was blackmailed as governor. Some sexual allegations were 100% fake. OMG undercover video. So this has to do with that COVID stuff. Okay. Now listen. I already know before you fucking go into it, here's what I bet. I bet he threatened to tell the truth about COVID and then he figured out how to get him to fuck out. Let's check it. Let's check it. Do you? Okay. When you're your Cuomo before you even get into this. I got to be Cuomo. Listen. The listener as a person. Your Andrew Cuomo. They come to you and they say, Hey, we're going to need you to go with this narrative, which is how they do it. That's exactly how they do it. Andrew Cuomo and any elected official, they are not allowed to come up with their own opinions. They are told what to say and do. Hey, Andrew, we're going to need you to do this. This is what we're going to need. He says fine. It goes along with it. Then all the sudden people out here that are against COVID, enough of them, start to realize that holy shit, this guy sent old people with COVID and made them give COVID to the other old people in these nursing homes. A whole bunch of people died. They pumped the death roll, the death toll. So he starts seeing the backlash and he's like, fuck, that's not what happened. Here's what and then before he can give it out of his mouth, oh, really you did this and this and this to these people. You're fucking out. And by the way, if you say another word about that, I'm going to fucking kill you. I'm going to kill you. Dude. This is how people think that's out of hand, bro. We're talking about the highest level of government, the most money with the biggest implications. You think that these people don't straight up tell them like, dude, if you fucking open your mouth even more, we're going to kill you and your family. You're insane. That's exactly what they do. It goes from say this will give you money to if you don't say this, we're going to black mail you to if you don't say this, we're going to put you in jail to, we'll kill you. Yeah. Yeah. Listen, you can see the pattern. Look what they did to Trump. They did it. I mean, they do. They've done this a bunch and I'll say like I'll say this like I'm not an Andrew Cuomo fan. I'm not either. I'm not like, oh, yeah, you know, I'm going to rally behind Andrew. I think he's a turd. However, what I will say is wrong is fucking wrong. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Wrong is wrong. And if that is the case, okay, if that is the case, let's fucked up. And I don't think he should be being held accountable for those things. But it's exactly what you said. So there's this undercover video that was just released from O'Keefe Media Group. It features a senior New York health department lawyer who revealed that Andrew Cuomo, when he was the governor of the state, was forced into signing a nursing home bill into law due to blackmail. Huh. It's literally what he's saying. The video was released on the eve of New York City's Democratic mayoral primary in which Cuomo is neck and neck with socialist communist Zorin, Madden, maim Donnie. Jacob Wilkinson, senior counsel for the New York State Health Department, told undercover OMG reporter, quote, so there's a new law that governor Cuomo signed when he was at the end of his term. When Cuomo was getting that investigation, he didn't have a lot of political power. His political power went down, right? And so he was pushed to sign this group of legislation. So it's like several pieces of legislation that are like all together regarding nursing homes. Let's check this video out. Some of the allegations are 100% fake because those girls were sitting on his lab taking selfies with them. So he was being blackmailed. It kind of was. So there's a new law that governor Cuomo signed when he was at the end of his term. When Cuomo was getting that investigation, he didn't have a lot of political power. His political power went down, right? And so he was pushed to sign this group of legislation. So it's like several pieces of legislation that are like all together regarding nursing homes. But it was written so poorly. We can't implement it. We can't do it. Who wrote that? We have some sort of versus association. So that he was forced to sign it. Yeah, really. On the eve of the New York mayor's Democratic mayoral primary election, former governor Andrew Cuomo and Zoran Mamdani are neck and neck in the bowls. In question, Stalinger about Cuomo's final days in office as governor. Last year, New York State Department of Health, senior counsel Jacob Wilkinson, who worked for former governor Andrew Cuomo and governor Kathy Hocal, met with our undercover OMG journalist in New York City. Wilkinson revealed that when Andrew Cuomo was in office, the former governor was forced to sign a poorly written nursing home bill that Wilkinson states the health department can't implement. Wilkinson explained that his former boss, then governor Cuomo, lacked political power ultimately leading to the signing of the nursing home bill. And what they do is they require, for one example, what I look at mostly, require spending requirements for nursing homes. So, nurse must have requested to spend 70 percent of its revenue on direct resident care. And that's like defined. So they can't spend it on paving the driveway or fixing a roof. It has to be like direct resident care. Yeah. And then 40 percent of that has to be resident-facing care. So that's like actual people. And so when Kathy became the governor, you wanted to change it. Right. So you think you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't, you can't look pretty well. Yeah. Yeah. Or there are any like lessons, Lyred, like mistakes, and things. Oh, yeah. Like around nursing. Yeah, I think he had to handle it well. And the, the piece, because I looked more into this too, the piece that's important is that at 70 percent of the talking about spending, that was an additional to the current salary and it was all spent on COVID, moving patients, all like filling the fucking nursing homes. Like, and people will say, why did they do that? Well, they needed, if you could, I know people have a short memory. He said who the fuck pushed it. It was the nurses association. I know. I know. But when people say, why would they do that? They don't remember that, Como, the deaths that happen in New York with the old people are one of the biggest drivers of the COVID narrative. Yeah. Those were the first big like clusters of people who passed away that they pointed to. It's like, look at all the people dying. See, the old people are dying. Yeah. So juiced the narrative. I mean, yeah, man, it makes sense to me. It's so crazy. Like I said, I'm not a fan. I'm not saying that like, you know, oh, Quattro's an innocent guy. I'm sure he's done some fucked up shit. I don't like him at all. Yeah. I don't like his brother at all. I think these guys, oh, his brother, I really can't stand. Look, dude, these people are for sale and they don't do the right things. And that's not what the government is supposed to be. And it's not about personally not liking them, but they have a character flaw, which is, I am for sale. My influence is for sale. And if you pay me money, I will make decisions that aren't good for the people who elected me for my own benefit. That's a character flaw that I can't get down with. Yeah. No, that's, that's real. And I think this whole thing about, you know, why it's going to take so long to get these votes back is because they're going to use these next, this next week or two weeks to Tim check Andrew Cuomo and see where he is. If he's going to be able to fall in line again or if not, and if he can fall in line, he'll be the next fucking primary. Here's a bigger question. Can't do it. Here's a bigger question. Why hasn't Trump fixed this situation yet? Why haven't we fixed the voting problem in this country yet? And are we, are we planning on doing it? I'm going to tell. Wasn't that one of the voting reform, like one of the big promises? So this could never happen again. And here we are people doing the same old shit that they did to him and that they didn't the fucking 2022 primary and they tried to do this last time, but they made it so it was impossible. Cool. But you should make it so it's impossible in every election, not just your presidential election. We got to fix this forever, man. And it should be fixed already. We're six months into this shit, bro. It should be fixed already. Like that should have been the first thing that happened. Hey, all voting is going to be reformed to this paper ballots. One day results counting like all the holes, all the gaps should be corrected. They should already be done. Yeah, man. Guys, jumping on this conversation, if you're from New York, if you're one of those half a million people up there, let us know what you guys think down there. But that being said, let's get to our final headline of the day. This is another one that got missed. Headline number three, this is another small one. This is wild. J6. Okay, there's still people that are dealing with some ramifications, right? This is, I've got to show this is for context. This is an MS or NBC news article. Okay. Jury, jury orders man to pay half a million dollars for assaulting a police officer who killed himself after capital right. Read that again. Listen, Jury also read that. Jury orders man to pay $500,000 for assaulting police officer who killed himself after the capital riot. The jury ordered chiropractor David Walls Kaufman 69 to pay damages to Aaron Smith for assaulting her husband, Metro, Palitin, police officer Jeffrey Smith on January 6, 2021. Yeah, I'm going to have to hear more about this because that doesn't, that doesn't make sense. It's wild. So am I seeing this correctly? So apparently during the J6, they must have had some sort of scuffle. And then the guy went later home and killed himself. And they're saying that the scuffle was the reason that the guy killed himself. That's what they tried to say. But that's, there's no fucking way. Well, that's what they tried to say. Let's dive into this. So a federal jury on Monday awarded half a million dollars to the widow in a state of a police officer who killed himself nine days after he helped defend the US capital from a mob of rioters, including a man who scuffled with the officer during the attack. The eight member jury ordered that man 69 year old chiropractor David Walls Kaufman to pay $380,000 in punitive damages, $60,000 in compensatory damages to Aaron Smith for assaulting her husband, Metro, police officer Jeffrey Smith inside the capital on January 6. They also awarded an additional $60,000 to compensate Jeffrey Smith's estate for his pain and suffering. Now the judge presiding over the civil trial dismissed Aaron Smith's wrongful death claim against Walls Kaufman before jurors began deliberating last week, US district judge Anna Reyes said no reasonable juror could conclude that Walls Kaufman's actions were capable of causing a traumatic brain injury leading to Smith's death. On Friday, the jury sided with Aaron Smith and held Walls Kaufman liable for assaulting her 35 year old husband and the counter captured on the officer's body camera. Quote, Aaron is grateful to receive some measure of justice that David P. Webber, one of her attorneys, Walls Kaufman said the outcome of the trial is absolutely ridiculous. Quote, no crime happened. I never struck the officer. I never intended to strike the officer. He said, I'm just stunned. Now, after the jury left the courtroom, Reyes encouraged the party to confer and discuss a possible settlement to avoid the time and expense of an appeal and for the sake of finality. You guys settle, you can move on with your lives. Walls Kaufman's attorney, Hundy Hunt or Huey, was a Huey Hunt? Sorry, sorry, Huey. Who the fuck, who the fuck spells that shit like that, bro? Just be normal. You described the jury's award as shocking. We're talking about a three second event. He told the judge. It's not shocking, Mr. Hunt. A lot of things can happen in three seconds. That's right. And that right? That's how you got those three kids. Reyes, Jeffery Smith was driving to work for the first time after the Capitol riot when he shot and killed himself with his service weapon. His family said he had no history of mental health problems before the J6 riot. And Smith claims, Walls Kaufman struck her husband in the head with his own police baton, giving him a concussion and causing psychological and physical trauma that led to his suicide. Walls Kaufman, who lived a few blocks from the Capitol, denied assaulting Smith. He says, any injuries that the Alfred suffered on J6 occurred later in the day when another rioter threw a pole that struck Smith around his head. Now this is what makes it crazy. The police department medically evaluated Smith and cleared him to return to full duty before he killed himself. In 2022, the District of Columbia Police and firefighters retirement and relief board determined that Smith was injured in the line of duty in the injury was the sole and direct cause of his death according to the lawsuit. But that's not what the medical examiner's report was. That's not what the doctors that cleared him report was. None of that. On top of that, Walls Kaufman, he served a 60 day prison sentence for pleading guilty to a Capitol riot related misdemeanor in 2023, being pardoned by Trump in January of this year. Of course, but you know, J6 has always been this crazy mystery, right? Because they always say, well, you know, officers died that day, right? Like, that's what they like to say. Of course they say it. They say it, bull, they say, yeah. But I want to show this because this is the first time that NBC and MSNBC has, I don't know if you call this saying the truth. Now I will say this, this is the last paragraph of this article and it reads this, more than 100 law enforcement officers were injured during the riot. The police officer Brian Siknik collapsed and died a day after engaging with the rioters. A medical examiner later determined he suffered a stroke and died of natural causes. Howard living good, a Capitol police officer who responded to the riot also died by suicide after the attack. But like the narrative up until I saw this article, I mean, you asked them, no, officers died that day. Yeah, of course. They've been lying the entire time, the entire time. Yeah. And like, it's just so crazy, like even AP, like everybody's starting to like, I guess, admit what the actual truth was. And it's just so interesting, man, because like when you compare this to other things that have happened in the country, every single person who lied about that belongs in prison, because of the damage and the division that it caused. Bro, yeah, bro, it's crazy. And, and dude, now where are their officer injured? Of course, I'm sure there was. People who intentionally lie in the media belong in jail intentionally lie to hurt people and cause division belong in jail. Well, my sources say, now you got to name your sources. It's bullshit. Yeah, it's bullshit. Yeah. And like I just hate the again, this double standards, we know it is, right? Like because when you compare this to others, there's a big difference between making a mistake and falsely reporting or speaking out of turn and intentionally lie, right? But like when you compare this other several, so 100 officers were injured in the line of duty during J6. Cool. Got it. But we don't talk about what happened in like, let's say 2020, where during the 2020 riots, there were more than 900 off-worship officers that were injured, including 277 officers are injured while defending the federal courthouse in Portland, Oregon. No talk about that in direction or the 60 secret service officers defending the White House or how in September of 2020, a gum and ambush to LA Sheriff's deputies as they set in their squad car. That's, I saw that video. That's fucking brutal. You know what I'm saying? But like we don't talk about this. Where nobody, like none of the left cared about police during that time. And you know how many people were arrested during any of that, specifically connected to officer injuries? Probably nine, six, six, six. But they locked up 1600 people for J6. It's just the double standard shit, man. It's insane. What do you got on this? You know, I don't, I don't look. This is wall scoffering by the way. Look man. I don't want to. It's hard to believe. It's hard to believe that a two second thing would cause a man to kill himself on his first day back to go it later. Why didn't he kill himself at another time? You know, ideally, I don't know enough to really make a conclusion on it. But it doesn't sound right. And it sounds a lot like how people that seem to know how things are going end up committing suicide. Because there was a lot of suicides a day, man, from officers or not that day, but around the event. Listen, man. Our country has become so corrupt that it's almost impossible to know what the fuck's going on. And for us to sit here and continue to point out the double standard makes us stupid. Because it's very clear that unless it backs the leftist communist narrative, it is ignored. So we don't ever see the news that represents both sides ever. And everybody who isn't in line with that leftist narrative continues to say the same things over and over and over. This is a double standard. This isn't true. Can you believe they're doing this? They won't let us say this. They won't let us say that. It should be very obvious at this point in time that we are dealing with a level of influence that is completely one sided and to expect it to be fair is a very ignorant and dangerous expectation because it never will be. We are dealing with a media. We are dealing with a power structure. We are dealing with a narrative creation machine that is designed for one purpose. And that purpose is to divide and remove the power from the citizens of this country so that they cannot effectively challenge the power structure that is in place. But they keep everybody fighting, the police and the citizens, black people and white people, men and women, gay people and straight people. If they continue that narrative, there is no chance for unity that allows any sort of resistance to happen. And our machine has become so corrupt and it's been going on for so long that younger people just see this as the way it is. You would have to be 38, 39 years old to really understand that this is not the way that it's always been. And if you are 20 years old, it would be very easy for someone to point and be like, look at these crazy people on the right. Look what they're saying, look what they're doing. And it would appear from that point of view that those people are crazy and they're trying to revert back to some super fucking racist, bigoted America that they teach these people that existed not that long ago. When in reality, in the 90s, in the early 2000s and the 80s, people were getting the fuck along. Okay. And, but how would you know that if you didn't witness it? These people understand that. So right now, they're poisoning the minds of every single person that lacks the perspective of having lived through a time when things were actually good or considerably better than what they are now. So this to me and you is very confusing. We're like, why the fuck would they do that? And to most Americans, like when they hear you and I say, look at all this stuff they're doing. It would be very easy for someone who was younger to be like, these guys are fucking crazy. These guys don't look like a little bit like you're talking about. Yes. Right. Yes. But like, they don't have the perspective of seeing it. And that's the danger of what's been going on for so long. And you teach people through the media that and through education that the country's racist and white people are inherently racist and black people are inherently victims. And the system set up for white people and not black people. And you know, we're the most racist we've ever been and fucking all this crazy shit. If you're not, if you haven't lived through any other time, why the fuck would you question it? Right. And I've been alive long enough to have seen what real journalism looks like. And what we have now is not real journalism. It is the product of communist ideology infiltrating our schools and universities. And then those people now being in the position to write these articles and create these videos and perpetrate propaganda that they were taught was the way that it is. It's just a, I don't really know what the solution is. Other than the like I. Like I said, if you lie intentionally in the media, you should be in prison. I don't know. I don't know what the solution is. Do the person who fucking wrote the script who's what teleprompter like because it's all they're all complicit it. I don't man. It's just a it's just a it's a fucking shit show. I'm also starting to feel too like I don't think we'll ever get the full truth on what happened on J6 and like how many FBI informants were in the crowd or like we're not going to get any of that. I don't think we'll get the truth, bro. I think that the debate on the backside is like with cash for tell and bongino and shit. I think those guys went into it feeling and believing that they were going to tell the truth. And I think they get into those meetings and then they are explained why the truth telling removes the power of these agencies. And then they are convinced to go along with the quote unquote way that it always has been. The so quote like this like DJ listen man. I know that you and by the way dude you're right. What you're saying is right but here's the thing. If we fucking tell the truth then we lose the ability to do this and this and this and this and this and what's in the greater good of the people. It's these things that we do behind quote and that's a very easy line of shit to make people feel okay with hiding the way things actually are. So I don't know man that's what I feel like is going on. If we don't get disclosure and we don't get the truth for real. This country is fucking done. The corruption is too deep. There's too many hands in the cookie jar. There's too much bullshit. And if we don't get you know if Trump doesn't follow through and cash but tell doesn't follow through and Bangeena doesn't follow through and these people don't follow through our country's done. It's done. It's done for good. The only hope I really have right now is twofold. One that Trump is doing what I think he's doing at this point in time. Now like I said by tonight I could change because things could change. But as of today at fucking three o'clock in the afternoon it appears that he's distancing himself from Netanyahu intentionally. And it also appears that he's trying to raise the curtain on how fucking psychotic this dude actually is. And the next logical steps of that curtain raising would be the pointing out to the level of influence that they have. That man his funders have in our own government. And if that continues to go that way we could see some truth. If and the only other way it could go is if people get so like we talk about personal excellence becoming the ultimate rebellion they become so intelligent, so fit, so successful, so willing to lead by example, so willing to change the culture that this shit just doesn't work on him anymore. Because the way it works is by basically a nutshell promising people free shit in one way or another easier life. And all it does is make it harder. So I just think I think there's a lot man. I think every single person should be working to become the kind of person that is not able to be controlled regardless of what they think may or may not happen because at the end of the day that's the that's the final straw. If we become a citizenship that is strong, intelligent, not dependent, independent thinkers, not consuming their addictive food, not consuming their medicine, not becoming mega consumers of their data, not allowing our lives to be captured into this online matrix, etc, etc, etc, etc, that keeps them from fulfilling their agenda of creating a fat lazy, supplicating defenseless, controllable populace that becomes mega consumers of all of their shit. But that's a big ask because most people are fucking too late to good, man. That's what I'm saying. So we're in a very important, pivotable situation where people need to ask themselves, what the fuck do we want to happen here? Because the way it's going, man, it's not going to be good. Yeah. Guys, jumping on this conversation, there's no down in the comments, which you guys think that being said, let's get to our final segment. Yeah. As always, we've got thumbs up, we're dumb as fuck. So we're bringing a headline in, we talk about it, it's one of those two options, Andy, let me ask you a question. You like tattoos? It depends. Right? Yeah. How many hours you got on your body? A few hundred, two, three hundred. You know what they're two. Yeah. Right. Okay. Yeah, let's check this, let's check this tattoo or just artist out. Tattoo artist roasted for demon-like image of clients, baby. I'm sorry you lost your dog, bro. Okay. So let's dive into this. It's a terrible tattoo, it's timeless, but as of late, it seems like more and more inked up individuals are taking to the internet to share their strange, questionable and sometimes even trashy tattoos. Between Gen Z's recent revival of the tramp stamp, that's coming back. No, it's not. It's his. It's back. Tramp stamps are back. A Swiss woman's viral $600 Red Bull Barcode tattoo. Social media users seem to agree that they could go a while without seeing another mega-viral miss in the tattoo department. Unfortunately, the aforementioned members of the public Cairo-based tattoo artist Thomas tattoos proved to be the latest object of ink-based ridicule after he posted a video whose Instagram account inked by Thomas presenting his latest piece. The piece was presumably intended to be a portrait of the client's daughter, but commenters saw more resemblance between the final product of golem from the Lord of the Rings, the demon various animals and the fictitious ogre Shrek, was also popular comparisons. Quote, beautiful tribute. I'm sorry you lost your dog, bro. Quote, one sarcastic user. So here is the picture. That's not a... Well, I mean, it looks like the stencil. Those two things kind of look alike. Maybe that's just an ugly fucking kid. That's a good take. I mean, that's the stencil. So he laid that on top of a photograph probably, stencil it out. The tattoo and the stencil don't look that different. Do they? Now, is somebody who draws for a living you right? Yeah, so I mean, I think the kids just ugly. Let's check this clip out. What? I mean, listen, this is why you don't go to fucking Shet tattoo artist. Okay, so that was my first thought, right? Okay, well, let's check some of his other work. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like, we got to be fair here. Okay. So this is some of his artwork. It's not terrible work. Yeah, but realism is different than, okay, that's pretty big. Yeah, he's not... That guy's not able to do humans portraits. That's what it is. Yeah, he can't do portraits. There's a certain nuance that comes with drawing. You have to understand what to draw, what not to draw. So for example, you don't draw that. If I have a photo of you smiling really big and you have all your teeth showing, it doesn't necessarily have to be drawn because teeth specifically in drawings don't look really good. I think that's the thing that's happened with the baby drawing. You have to have a nuance and make a decision what to draw, what not to draw, how to shade it. Otherwise, it's going to look horrible. Yeah, I mean, look, dude. Real talk. Here's what I think we got going on here. I think we got a Shetty tattoo artist and an ugly baby. So you multiply it everything. If he would not have shaded it and made it exactly like the stencil, just a long line drawing, it would not be so horrible. Yeah, it would be alright. Yeah, I mean, it sucks. But probably you're right. Yeah, I mean, if you want a portrait, you go to someone who does fucking portraits. For a living, exactly. Like not someone who's got Harley Davidson catalog tattoos on his fucking wall of his tattoo parlour. This was not terrible. It's pretty terrible. Okay. It's terrible too. I mean, look, here's bottom line. You get what the fuck you pay for. Get what you pay for. That's cool. Yeah. And people come in all the time to these tattoo guys who aren't fucking good because they think they're getting a dude. It's like, it's like girls that get boob jobs and they get a fucking $1,000 or $2,000 boob jobs and their titties look like shit. Yeah, that's not enough. You know, like, it's the same thing. Like, it's a cosmetic procedure. That's right. Tattooing is a cosmetic procedure. It's like getting your fucking boob's done. It's like, you know, teeth. Yeah. Like, oh, I'm going to go get my $500 veneers. Well, they're going to look like $500. You know what I'm saying? You look like George Washington, motherfucker, you're one D. You know, like, that's, you get what the fuck you pay for. There's been my experience with tattooing and like, that's why I only have one guy that tattoos me and that's it. I wonder how much he pays for, he pay for that. Not a lot. That's like going to LASIC, bro. I mean, like, I'm going to get the cheapest LASIC. I can't see shit. Yeah. And then, and then getting mad about it. Compared that to what you have on your hand is night and day difference. Yeah. Well, I mean, my guy is the best in the world. Because, you know, why? Because that's the fucking shit that I want. I didn't want to, you know, I don't want fucking fucked up looking shit. Baby. Oh, the comments from people. Yeah, prayers for the baby if it looks like that. Well, it's not nice to say, but not all kids are pretty in cute. I mean, somebody also commented, I'm not 100% sure how anyone can see your page and think, I need a title from him. Yeah. Yeah, I don't, I don't get it either, dude. I think that somebody said, bro, doesn't have customers. He has victims. Bro, that's the truth, dude. Oh, fuck, man. These people are ruthless. Well, hey, man, what is what it is? I said, what day are you closed? Yeah. Hey, yo, do you, you accept walkouts? Hey, you know what, man? Good news is you can get the shit lasered off. Don't get a cheap place. I don't know, man. Oh, man, that's, I would recommend that here's my take on tattoos until you are able to afford the legitimate shit that you really want. You shouldn't get tattoos. Okay, I didn't get tattooed. So I was like 33. Yeah, at that time, I could afford the best. So I didn't have to live, laugh, love, shit, and you're, well, also, dude, remember, you're not going to be the same person at 20 that you are at 30 or even 30 that you are 40. Which, you know, so, you know, and people like say, like, oh, fuck, dude, it's a part of my journey. Yeah, I know. Sometimes you want to forget those parts. And, you know, like, yeah, so I, I, you know, I mean, let's be real, dude, that baby's ugly. It's me. It's me. It's me. He's a, that's an ugly fucking kid. That's an ugly kid. I don't care what you look nice in person. No, it probably doesn't. It's probably a sweet kid, but it's probably ugly. There's such things as ugly kids, bro. I don't do exist, bro. Yeah, I know. I've seen a whole bunch of them. They do exist. Yeah, there's one. I've been blessed. My kids listen to you. All I'm saying is this. It doesn't look that far off from the stencil. No. So accuracy from students like, a for that. No. I'm checking this guy's work on his page. He's good with line work. If he's just lines, he's pretty good. But it comes to shading like that. Yeah, like this isn't terrible. Well, that's like getting someone who paints houses to paint fucking Mona Lisa. Not gonna fucking have it. There you go. This wasn't terrible. This wasn't terrible. Dude, look, it's not terrible. Those are fucking shitty tattoos. All right, I'm just gonna say it. It is what the fucking is. The dude could get mad at me. He could fly over here from Cairo or to fuck his from and get pissed. That guy's a shitty tattoo artist. And anybody who gets tattoos from him should be able to understand that you're going to get shitty tattoos. Some people like shitty tattoos because it's like a whole look. Yeah, it is. So, but that's what you're gonna get from my homey here. Well, here's the good thing. What's his name, Tim, I think? Thomas, you can, there's always room for improvement. You can get better. Whatever. Anyway, thumbs down. This is fucking horrible. The kid's ugly, the tattoo's bad. It is what the fuck it is. Fucking don't have me. No, that, guys, Eddie, that's all I got, man. All right, me too, fuck. Don't be a hulk. Shut the shut.
