Those are the questions that we like but we'll take some about anything whatever you guys want to know. Other times you tune in we have CTI that's where we talk about what's going on in the world. We speculate on what's true what's not true and then we talk about how we the people are the solution the problems going on in the world. Other times we have real talk that's just five to 20 minutes and me giving you some real talk. Sometimes we have full length that's typically what you see whenever we have a guest come in and we have a conversation and then sometimes we have 75 hard versus and that's where someone who comes in who's completed the 75 hard program comes in and talks about how they were before how they are after and how you can get your shit together with the 75 hard program.

So with all that being said we have this thing we call the fee you'll hear us say pay the fee that means hey man we don't run ads on the show you're going to realize that unlike most shows especially shows of this size I pass on the income to run ads on the shows for a specific reason and the reason is first of all it's annoying but second of all I don't want to be told what I can and can't say I don't want to have to filter my opinions or anything for for money that's not what I'm about I'm an entrepreneur I built successful companies I don't do this for the money I actually pay a lot of money to produce this show and all I ask in return is that you guys share the show all right so when I say pay the fee I mean share the show we get banned we get censored we get throttled and you know if this information is to get out in the world it has to be shared so don't be a hoe share the show all right all right what's up man Monday yeah Monday morning what you got there uh this is a little scream and freedom first full of energy you're switching it up I like this dude orange no longer number one no orange is orange I actually think the traffic lightning yeah has has it's equal to the orange at least it's very very good um but I like this too you know like before the man and the zuri man they're kind of the same yeah that's right yeah yeah they're cousins that's right they're first cousins too yeah no they're probably married yeah uh nothing man just just here to do the shit man you know it's been uh it's been a it's been a weird couple weeks been traveling a lot been have a lot of stuff going on and you know here we are thanksgiving it's crazy that we're in the week of Thanksgiving you know this year has gone by so quick bro you know the one thing like as you get older the time definitely goes faster and I know like that sounds weird to people who were like 25 they're like what's that mean like bro you'll see like like they were putting up the Christmas tree here at first form headquarters that's what we do the show for you guys that don't know it's one of the companies that that I own um I'm watching them put up the tree and I'm like fuck dude it seems like they were just taking that down like a week ago I know right you know like it was weird and Santa's coming back yeah you know so it's crazy man um well what what did you like did you ever believe in Santa and when did you stop I mean yeah everybody believed in Santa when they were kids right yeah and then you know you get on the school bus and the kids the other kids tell you that it's bullshit yeah I think of the school buses where I learned a lot of my stuff you know what I mean like I wrote the bus with some older kids that were four or five years older than me and they they were kind of shut the fuck up kids it's not right exactly like they were assholes yeah so it is what it is but um that was just one year Santa brought me uh the presents it was wrapped in newspaper though because everybody's got one like that we couldn't uh everyone's gotten one like that that's not it that's not your thing like oh I think most people have gotten a present wrapped in newspaper you everybody was shaking their head yes yeah no I'm gonna die you know have we got oh yeah I'm with that I didn't celebrate Christmas oh no Christmas for him yeah fucking sucks yeah yeah huh I'm trying to think we're like what age I was with my kids like all right I see your mom it's you yeah I don't know there's something magical about Christmas man like when you're a kid and you don't know any better in the shit you know it's just cool yeah yeah huh yeah they are the magic parents are the magic why don't you say like how do we know Santa's not though you know I'm saying like there's a historical context and like you know like we got big foot explorers and shit like bro come on we got a show to do we got let's get into it man and you guys I got some good was for you I got three up uh let's get with the first one though hi Andy uh like some things you just can't entertain dude like I can't entertain a 28 year old man talking about fucking Santa Claus like when we talk about handling your family members if fucking Thanksgiving that's how you handle him okay oh I'm uh I'm a she her when they're clear almost she heard all right look bro we got Thanksgiving to do you know like let me stuff the turkey yeah but you like that yeah I bet you like that all right guys Andy question number one Andy what is your take on the saying that money isn't everything when it comes to job opportunities okay so I currently work for a small young company with the great work culture environment that has none of the corporate bullshit but I get paid below my industry standard I've advocated for myself and asking for more money but the response was not promising I was recently contacted by a company that provides a 40% increase in my salary on top of bonuses and benefits but the company boasts about their ESGDI agenda which is a huge turn off yeah what is your advice on staying with the company versus chasing higher salaries well first of all money isn't everything okay like you have to make enough money to live your life look there's a lot to this all right let's this is kind of an involved question it depends on where you're at in your life first of all okay you have to consider all things all right do I like working here do I like the people I'm around do I feel like we're on a worthy mission do I think the work that we do is real do I think it actually matters these are questions to ask because you're going to spend most of your time at your work all right we spend what we go home at five o'clock and we spend the evenings at home and the most of the week during the day in our productive hours we're spending at a job yeah it's very important to spend that time in a place that you enjoy but here's the tactical advantage to doing that when you're actually in a place that you enjoy you're likely to get in a position where you make much more money because you become better at what you do because you enjoy what you do all right and where a lot of young people make mistakes is they put themselves just like this person in a situation where they kind of sell their soul for some more money and they put themselves in an unbearable miserable situation that they can't last in all right so how good is that right raise and pay if you can't go to work and perform because you hate what you do you hate the people around you you don't believe in the mission and that's going to handicap your work ethic and likely what'll happen is you will stand out as someone who's not performing and eventually lose that pay anyway okay so we have to think about this from all different directions when you're young and you're let's say under 30 years old the biggest thing that you're looking to gain is actual skill set you are looking to pay your bills yes you are looking to take care of your responsibilities yes you are looking for a company that has massive career upside yes but at the end of the day what you really need to develop is skill set and so you have to get in an environment where you can learn a whole bunch of skills that'll be valuable that you can take anywhere that you want to go in your life right so when we think about these these incredibly you know nuance and difficult life decisions that we all have to make it's never just about money it's only only about money when you don't have any okay but the reality is is broke you're you're mental well-being you're drive you're ambition you're fire for what you do that's the thing that's actually going to help you create more money and sometimes you don't get that up front sometimes you have to just get in a situation that you really enjoy that you find purpose in where you're actually contributing to people you believe in the products that you're selling or that your company selling and you work in something that you really enjoy and what that does is that develops not just a skill set but also the passion that you have for it will allow you to move up the ranks and then the money starts to come right so there's all kinds of ways to think about now sometimes when you're young and this is a very important thing like a lot of people put themselves in highly leveraged positions when they're very young right they go out and they get in a lot of debt they go out and they have you know kids when they're 20 years old and I'm not I'm not knocking that I actually think there should be more of that but the reality is is that the more debt and the more obligation you have the less flexibility you have to move forward in something that you enjoy and so this is something to think about as well you know something my dad always told me in Salas weird as it is is hey man don't do drugs and don't have any babies okay like he would tell us that when we were kids because like he knew that like if we got into drugs or we had kids at a young age like got some random girl pregnant that would significantly hinder our forward progression in life okay so these are things that we must consider when making these decisions and if you are someone who's let's say 25 and you do have some obligations then you're probably willing to go somewhere that pays a little bit more money and and deal with something that's a little less passion based right to take care of what you do and here's the ultimate reality guys we do not always love what we do there's days when I come in here in this building which by the way I believe that we run the best cup first form okay I believe is the best run company of any company on the planet I believe in every single entrepreneur that comes here high level doesn't matter who they are I mean I've had everybody in here whether they've been on the show or not they agree they're like dude there's nothing like this and there are still days when I wake up and I'm like fuck I'd rather do something else you know what I'm saying like it's not always fun like we're gonna have to fight and I think with young people there's this big misconception that every single day that we wake up there's going to be it's going to be amazing and when it's not amazing and we go through these stents that last you know weeks or months where things just don't feel right we quit and we look for something new but here's the thing it's like chasing a relationship right like a lot of people will go relationship relationship relationship relationship relationship because they can't figure out that the only reason that the shit doesn't feel right is because it's not new anymore you know like the newness of a relationship that new car smells yeah bro and people believe that like that's quote unquote love that's not love that new that's infatuation it's lust right that's lust and it's new and people people will throw their entire lives away chasing that over and over and over again thinking that you know they're not in love or whatever right but they really just don't have an understanding of what that really means and this people do this in their careers too they'll spend two or three years out of career and when it starts to get a little monotonous they go to something else but here's the problem when it starts to get a little monotonous that's where the separator happens that's where you have to push through because everybody else kind of stops they find their ceiling or they move on or they go somewhere else and you start to push through the monotonous and then eventually an opportunity comes that's a new opportunity within the same organization and you move up this is how when you look at organizations and you see people who are on the board of directors who started out in the warehouse at seven dollars an hour this is how they did it they put they didn't show up here every day and say man this is the fucking this is great this is like going to Disneyland right like they showed up well that's not great but you get what I'm saying like not now yeah it's not like you'll end up walking out like you know in debt yeah right yeah no shit pronoun badges you'll walk out fucked up that's for sure but the point is is that no Mickey no don't touch me there I said her like dude but here's the point mini now yeah that's right it's mini okay look dude here's the thing we have to push through these monotonous times in order to come out the other side with a new skill set a new understanding that we can then utilize to progress our lives yeah so like bro this idea and it's I feel really bad for young people man because you guys have to watch all these fake entrepreneurs and fake successful people on internet and short form content all fucking day long I didn't have to watch okay like I didn't I just knew the people in my life that I knew and I knew most of my friends were going to school to get a regular job and I was doing something different and I didn't have to watch all these people who were my age saying oh dude check out this I made $7,000 last you know week doing this and this and this and I slept in for half the like all these lies and all this marketing that's that's presented as real life through these fake entrepreneur people that corrupts people's mind that makes people think that they they don't realize that these people are completely lying to try and sell things to them right and they start to feel like they're doing the wrong thing by working a regular job or building a career I'm here to tell you bro the real shit our pure newer life is not for everybody it's it's fucking seven to eight percent of the population and less than one percent of that seven to eight percent is a million dollar a year earner that's reality those are the stats that's the data okay so it's very very very hard it's no different than being on the University of Alabama it's no different than playing on the fucking Kansas City cheese like you have to be that good to become a million dollar earner all right but if you become that level of employee there's lots of companies where you can make that kind of money and potentially get equity and potentially get stock and it build a real life for yourself and that comes from not changing the direct like what if Patrick my homes every time he had two or three bad games growing up he said I'ma switch sports would he be Patrick my homes no you see what I'm saying and this is what people do with their lives is what people do with their relationships and and then they wake up at 40 years old and they're like what the fuck happened well bro you didn't listen to your uncle Andy man I told you what would happen I've been telling you what would happen for almost a decade now you can't get caught in the hamster wheel and the way you get caught in the hamster wheel is by switching your life up every two or three years when the newness wears off and doing something else true greatness comes with time as being a part of that recipe and if you do not put in the time the greatness can exist nobody builds a great life in three years it doesn't happen no matter what the internet says no matter what anybody on the internet says so pushing through the monotonous shit is a requirement you just don't realize that after you push through the monotonous for a little bit it gets cool again and then you push through it again and it gets cool again and this is phases it goes up and it goes down it goes up and it goes down and if your performance is consistent through the ups and downs eventually you find yourself a million miles away from where you are in a much better position and so money isn't everything you should ask all these questions you should consider what it is you're doing because the reality is if you don't love what you're doing you're very it's it's highly unlikely that you're going to be successful at it anyway so like if you take a little bit more money up front what is that costing you on the backside value is right well dude it's costing you real success later yeah you see what I'm saying so there's a lot of ways to look at this and it just depends on where you are in the journey you know if you're a 30 year old guy who has five kids to support bro you got to do what you got to do and there's nothing wrong with that do it well set a good example you know what I mean like if you've got if you've got to become a tradesman or whatever it is you do there's a noble thing it's a noble thing to do that kind of work it's really a noble thing to do any work and do it well in my opinion I don't really care what the pay is I don't have a it's the ethics it's the work it's the example it's the ethos huh it's the ethos behind yeah that's right and like dude there needs to be a lot more I'll tell you this I respect to dude who is a plumber who does great plumbing work of fucking gazillion times more than some dumbass on the internet talking about their Lamborghini right real talk 100% who would you rather hang out with who would you rather be around who would you rather have the kids around see what I'm saying absolutely so there's another wrong with doing those things guys don't let the internet fool you that having a career and working hard is some sort of you're you're fucking it up these people those people that you see will be broke their entire lives they're pretending they will never figure it out okay so that's my answer I love it man guys any question number two Andy I've been in no man's land for almost five years now with the company I'm building all I can do without the finances is network and build a following which is going great my problem is the loneliness of no man's land how did you make it more tolerable how did you stay in the right mindset when it seemed like everyone disappeared well a couple things one we have to understand the reality of life okay just be there's not a single part there's really not a single person that exists that has the same friend circle that they had when they were in high school unless they've never grown or never evolved and they just stay where they were and kept doing the same things kept going to the same parties the same bars the same activities and you know they don't have much else in their life and those people will are very good at that like propping up I'm my friends and my life and I'm loyal and loyalty and all this shit right but the reality is is anybody who's building something good is going to cycle through relationships over the course of time you're going to you're going to find friends and then those friends are not going to want to grow at the same way you're growing and and you're going to feel alone and then you're going to find new friends and when you find new friends they're going to be more aligned with what it is you're doing and if you keep going you'll outgrow them as well and it's painful to outgrow those friends because you also you you end up having if you're a good person you end up having a little bit of guilt you like kind of think like fuck man you know I wish I could go but here's the problem is that when you're around those people because you're trying to grow and they're not they try to convince you that you're doing something immoral that's just the way culture is you know you're you've changed or you're greedy or you're different than you used to be when in reality on your what you're trying to do that's the point I'm trying to get better I'm trying to improve I'm trying to become better at what I do and they're shaming you for it and that's not good for you to be around so when we move to these through these friend cycles we have to understand that if you're an ambitious person you're committed to growth this is a natural reality of the path okay and eventually you'll find yourself in a network where everybody's kind of aligned and everybody like like my friend network now I don't see my friends my friends are all over the country or they're here in this building right and I don't have to like be around them all the time to know that they're there and when I have problems that I care about guess what I do I call them up or they call me up and we talk through things and so the the reality of the game is is that friends rarely stay forever and so there's this thing in society where it's like that's how it's supposed to keep your friends for your whole life and and dude that's just not real it's not a real thing no okay not if you're trying to do things um you're not gonna you're not gonna be worth a billion dollars and go hang out with people that that you know think you're bragging because you're just talking about things going on in your life it's not fun to do yeah right so that's the first thing the second thing is is no man's land shouldn't last for five years bro like you should be working to maintain like a lot of people will say oh I'm in no man's land but they're also not putting any effort into networking or having relationships or building friendships and they're just pouring themselves into their work so much and they're neglecting all the other things and then what they do is they make it everybody else's fault nobody wants to be around me nobody likes me nobody and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because you're not making any effort yourself you can expect people to come find you you have to make some effort as well and so getting around people intentionally and this is where something like the artisynicate is a good thing for people okay because the artisynicate if you're unfamiliar as a group that Ed my Latin I put on which is real business owners doing real things in real life and what happens is is people find new friends in that group that support their vision that work with them and help push them forward so you have to proactively seek relationships that make sense for where you're at and that's a real thing that you know a lot of people neglect because they think there's some sort of badge of honor of having no friends or being all alone but bro that creates misery man like one of the most anxious feelings that you're ever going to have is feeling like everybody else doesn't give a fuck about you when in reality that's not really what's going on what's going on is you've been so dedicated to your own thing that you haven't put any effort into anybody else's stuff or talked to anybody and they're just doing their own thing and you can't be mad about that there's been periods of my life where I have become borderline bitter thinking like well nobody likes me but when I really am honest with myself it's not that nobody likes me it's that I'm not giving any effort into those relationships as well so like because I'm so busy I'm focused on my own shit I'm not calling people saying hey man how you doing or what can I do or this or that and that's something that you know you have to be proactive about if you don't want to feel completely alone because if you don't do those things you'll stay in that position of no man's land forever so especially because we have to remember you're moving up right so when you move up into a friend group you're the new person that these people aren't going to come to you like you're not going to just start making a million dollars a year or a million dollars a month or whatever it is you're trying to make and all the people of the same caliber are going to find you they don't care they're already been living that life you're going to have to insert yourself by making effort and making value for them to become friends with those people so like if you're not actively doing that yes you're going to feel alone so you know ask yourself you know are you making a real effort or are you kind of waiting around for people to join your thing yeah can you can you touch on this a little bit because this is actually something I feel like I've seen this in action a few times just being around you but can you talk about the intent behind making those new relationships when you're moving up that next wrong and that matter can you talk a little bit about the intent right like because there is a sniff test that those people on that ladder have and the intent will get sniffed out very very quickly can you speak yeah so so here's what happens so when you have a young buck coming up the up the ladder right and they're doing good they're maybe they're making some money they're doing they're becoming successful they start thinking they're like the smartest person ever like you they start thinking like fuck I'm the only person of all my friends making all this money but you don't realize bro you're not swimming with the big dogs in the ocean bro you're swimming in a puddle okay like you don't recognize that you're not in you're not even in the real game yeah so you sure as fucker not the smartest motherfucker in the world yeah all right and what happens is is that these people start making some income and they start to believe they're real smart and real slick and they believe they can kind of fool the people up the chain but look dude there's been a million of you you don't understand this there's been a million of you come along that come in with the intent of I'm gonna try to get close to this person so I can get something right okay and so people who are up the chain they are fucking highly tuned at sniffing out people who are hanger honors or trying to get all right so there's this long lag time period that you have to basically like prove that you're there to contribute not there to take and eventually the guard gets let's down and you start having a real relationship but a lot of people aren't willing to put in that time because they're so focused on what they can get not what they can give and so you know I get this all the time bro I get DMs from people all the fucking time who like man you know I'm doing this and this and this and this and this and this we should hang or we should do this or I want to be in your circle I want to this bro there's zero chance it's not happening it's not happening unless I've known you for like years and you know a whole bunch of people that I know that all voucher you it's not fucking happening bro I've been fucked over by so many people like I've been I've been embarrassed I've associated with the wrong people there's so many people that I've associated with over the years that I wish I hadn't because I didn't know any better or they were good at pretending and that's over 25 years of experience and when you're a good-hearted person you know you want to welcome people in and you want to take care of people and you want people to win but you have to realize that most people aren't good when they're trying to get right and so like if you're a young person and you're trying to move up in your circle and you're trying to get into a group and you're trying you have to put your individual desires on the way back burner and those should only come out when someone in that group asks you what can I do for you after you've already done a billion things for them you know what I'm saying you have to yes you have to pay your dues and this is reality bro like if I was working to get into a higher friend group I'm not fucking asking people for shit the minute you ask somebody for shit they fucking ghost you bro you're out you're out so like and dude it's crazy how many of these young people will hit me up in DMs like cold up asking me for shit you know what I mean like yeah like you guys are you guys are not aware of how it works and then you realize like you you you can't figure out why you can't get in somewhere and you know then you end up thinking like those people are all assholes well no that's not actually what's going on what's actually going on as they've seen a million people just like you come in and fucking causing problems whether it be drama or or screw them over or bullshit bro I fuck man I could tell you a million stories like this yeah so the more successful people get the more the guard goes up because there's so many people coming at them that they're like no I don't need any more friends right like bro I don't want any more friends I thought and I'm talking me literally I do not want any more friends I don't want anything I don't want anything from anybody I don't need anything from anybody I don't I don't want anything like if I if I am putting interest in you it's because I see something that I believe in that I think I can help with and I don't expect anything in return like I have given away I have just subscribed myself to this mentality of I'm if I give I'm giving I'm not loaning I'm not expecting in return you know like I'm some one thing I like to do is I like to meet with young business owners locally like sometimes I meet with young business owners at my garage at my house I invite them over locally we have a cigar we talk about business I'll do a whiteboard and I don't need they're like well what can I do I'm nothing I'm not doing this I'm not I'm doing this because I think I can help you and it doesn't really cost me shit I don't want anything in return but also I'm not giving you any more than that you know what I'm saying like we're not going to fucking hold hands we're not gonna I'm not drinking beer with you yeah I'm just trying to give you a little bit of fucking info so it can save you some time because I believe that entrepreneurs are the cure to what's going on in society so I try to contribute in that way but I mean dude the reality is is it is it you have to pour into people before they'll actually accept you into their group after you're moving up the ladder and and a lot of people aren't willing to put in that time or effort or energy or they misunderstand the amount of time effort or energy that it actually takes you know like and those are just throw imagine for 25 years of like 80% of the people that you let close to you turn out to be flakes and either fuck you over or cause you drama or cause you gossip like dude I'm at the point now where like if I do something for someone they cause me any type of fucking drama whatsoever where I just cut him the fuck out I just don't even deal with it I don't care you know and that's how all those people are yeah so you know if you want to move up in your friend circle the answer to the question is this make sure that you're you're put make sure you're not you're not I would audit whether or not you're actually in no man's land or whether you are actually not putting into any effort to build a new friend circle and I would take advantage of groups like RIT syndicate I would try to get around people who are higher up the chain than you and I would work to contribute value to them anyway possible and that doesn't look like you know hey man what can I produce to provide value for you that's not what we're talking about we're talking about you using your own skill set your own perception to do things that benefit those people to show them that you're not there to take you're there to contribute and it once you're there to contribute everybody's there to contribute and you'll get contributed to as well over the course of time yeah but it's not a transactional thing you'll get sniffed out you could kicked off the ladder I love it fucking love that guys any question number three third of final question hey any my husband and I are 30 years old and we have three kids under the age of five he has always wanted to start his own business but how do I support him in doing this when I'm fearful of losing his income to build his company I don't ever want to hold him back or be the reason he doesn't pursue something but I don't think it's crazy to be concerned about the money and having his income on top of mine to keep the bills paid any advice on this yeah I mean a lot of people make this transition the okay yeah I have a lot of advice okay first of all you have to understand like to do entrepreneurship in a real way it's probably the hardest thing that you're ever going to do in your entire life all right you have to be mentally prepared and you have to be built for this is why I cannot stand the online entrepreneur space quote unquote because so many of these people make it sound like it's so easy and it's so quick and it's so fast and it's for everyone and what ends up happening is people when they get into the game they get their ass beat and they're like fuck I'm doing something wrong no you're not doing anything wrong man it's just hard yeah and so I come from the place of this understand this is going to be the hardest thing you've ever done and work to prepare yourself and build yourself into someone who can tolerate that path all right so that's the first thing I want the first thing is this make sure that you're not just buying into the idea of becoming an entrepreneur because it's what going on in the world right now this idea that you're you were more free you have more free time you make more that's fucking bullshit that that will that happens when you're like 15 years into the fucking journey not a month okay not the next week when you quit your job like the amount of misunderstanding when it comes to this is insane to me and maybe it's just because I've done it but we're propagated day in and day out by these messages that entrepreneurship is very easy and then anybody can do it and that's simply not the truth statistically it's not the truth all right so first question is is this something that you're truly committed to over the course of your life or is this something that you want to do because it seems like everybody else is doing it or is this something you're wanting to do because you're upset with your current situation okay because if it's not something that you're going to commit to from here until the time you could see it through tradition which is probably your whole life it's not worth doing because it's too hard of a journey you won't be successful and you'll find yourself right back in the position where you are doing the same thing you're doing now three or four years down the road and you've just lost three or four years of progress in that thing all right so first off are you really committed to this is this something that you truly want to do secondly transitioning from a regular job to a business owner or entrepreneur people think they got to rip the bandaid off and just jump in that's not actually how most successful people do it how they do it is they work their job and then at night time or the free time they have they start to build their business and it becomes like a side project at first all right and then they make a they get a little bit going they get a little bit more going and they get a little bit more going and then they come to a point where they can't get anymore going financially business-wise without the time available from their day job right when you get to a point where you can cover your bills and you can survive financially and and the day job is holding you back from growing this further that's the time where you make the jump from your rain gig to the side gig and make the side gig your main gig does that make sense okay so people people don't do this transition properly and it ends up ruining their whole thing because you know they pull the bandaid off and then three months down the road they can't pay any other bills okay another thing is when you make that jump you should be in a position where you could financially float your bills for a number of months in advance and this might require you downsizing your life this this might require you going from a three hundred thousand dollar home or two hundred thousand dollar home back to an apartment this might require you selling your nice fifty thousand dollar pickup truck and go into a ten thousand dollar beater okay so when you downsize your lot your financial liabilities you have less restraint on and more freedom on what you can do so these are all things to consider but when I hear questions like this the main thing that bothers me the most is I worry that people are jumping into things because the internet culture makes it seem like it's something that it actually isn't and that concerns me entrepreneurship is incredibly rewarding but it's also incredibly difficult all right I'm very good at entrepreneurship that my my wins my my scoreboard has a hundred motherfucking points on it okay it's there are days when I wake up where I'm like I cannot fucking do this you know and I'm good at it dude you know what I'm saying yeah and let me tell you something all these other entrepreneurs that you know on the internet as like these main fucking top level guys I'm tell you I'm friends with them there's days where they had that too where they're like fuck bro this is fucking hard so if it's hard for them you have to understand how hard it's going to be for you not knowing what they know it's it's dude it's the hardest thing you will ever do in your entire life and I'm not saying that to scare you I'm saying that so that you can prepare yourselves mentally for the fucking path that you're about to embark on it's hard and that this is why I guess so frustrated with the culture of this game because everybody makes it seem like it's not it's just not for everybody dude yeah it's like it's statistically what it is it's it's seven eight percent of the population with less than one percent of those earning a million dollars a year that's reality okay now if you're gonna become I'm not saying every single one of you out here could likely become one of those people making that kind of money but the reality is is you're gonna have to trade a lot for it it's not gonna be easy it's not gonna be as simple as downloading a course or a program or a funnel or a this or that or this it's gonna be incredibly difficult you're gonna lose a lot of sleep you're gonna wake up with a lot of stress you're gonna live a life of anxiety and frustration and pain almost every single day like it's just something that most people are not cut out to deal with it's a different level of responsibility that is hard and so you know to answer the question and I'm not fucking discouraging you guys because you can do it if you become the kind of person who does those things you just have to prepare yourself for it this is why the live hard program is such a valuable program because it increases all the skill sets that you need discipline grit fortitude self confidence self belief self esteem the ability to endure this is what were these are the skill sets needed an entrepreneur ship to succeed so if you don't have those go do the live hard program and do it every single year because those skills need to be sharpened over and over and over and over and over and over again as you go down the path so that's why I did the program all right but here's the thing ask yourself what is it and why is it that I want to do this and be honest what do I expect from this am I committed to this for the rest of my life is this something I'm doing because it's popular or is this something I'm doing because I'm called to do it do I actually love what it is I'm trying to do and that's an important factor too there's a lot of people who say you don't have to love what you do I disagree I believe that you do have to ultimately love what you do because it's so hard at certain points in time that the love for what you do will be the only thing that pulls you through that process right like there's been a lot of times dude where there's been a number of times I just be candid where I've had the ability to sell my entire company and we're not talking about a little bit of money we're talking about money where I never have to shit ever again and what I've thought about during those times is okay well what do I love what what I love is as I love seeing people change their lives I love seeing people go from a place of confusion and uncomfortableness to a place of confidence and certainty and physical you know a better physical state a better mental state I love helping people develop their careers I love seeing people progress and that's not worth money to me you see what I'm saying so we have to like there's all these things that we have to consider when we think about should we do it or should we not and I'll close this question with this very simply there's nothing that any of you can't do it's just what is it are you willing to pay to do it and if the answer isn't I'm willing to do whatever the fuck it takes then you shouldn't do it because that's what it takes I love that man I love it well guys Andy that was three all right guys appreciate you guys I love you guys go pay to fee case
