be a hoe share the show all right what's up dude what's going on just get us some water you know you know so what the last CTI people like the little conspiracy intro which part oh the Titanic is the Titanic so I got another one for you okay so yeah see how we do on this one right so you know those those pyramids yeah in Egypt uh-huh apparently there is there's a new conclusion on how they were built and you'll never guess I don't know water powered elevators water in the desert water powered elevators never heard this one before yeah and like you know let's let's dive in let's check this out so researchers have uncovered a potential explanation for how the iconic pyramid of joseir believed to be the oldest in ancient Egypt was built the step pyramid located in the secara necropolis which lies on a limestone plateau on the west bank of the nile river may have been constructed with the help of an ingenious hydraulic lift system a study published in the journal plus one proposes the study author suggests this system involved water flowing into two shafts located inside the pyramid itself enabling a float to be raised and lowered in order to lift the large stones used to build the structure quote this discovery provides a coherent answer to a question about the construction of the pyramids that has remained unanswered for several centuries study let lead author Xavier Landro from CEA paleo-technic institute in France told newsweek so here here is the pyramid okay everybody is seeing it it's a pretty it's one of the famous ones it's big it's pretty fucking big all right now this is what they're saying is the the makeup of the land you know what 4500 years ago and then they also made this nice little great these are not the geese pyramids something else right okay a little bit further away but these are older than geese okay but they're saying that the Egyptians had an underground network of water pipes that lifted these hundred tonne stones up by water into place well I'm the fuck I don't know I think it was giant giant swinging dick mandingo guys that built them I I mean that's as good of an answer as this I mean dude look I think it's one of the biggest mysteries in the world you know nobody really has a sound explanation for it you know everyone tends to make pretty equal sense you know like the aliens yeah maybe maybe you know I don't know Hillary Clinton yeah I mean maybe it's maybe they excavated from the top down oh you know that's a lot of dirt though it is but it that's a lot of weight to lift too so would it be easier to lift the rocks up higher or would it be easier to move the ground around them that makes sense I mean to me that makes more sense that's what I've always like my own brain you're good no just by you know 40 years of thinking about this that's what makes the most sense to me is that there was excavation from the top down but I mean that's just a guess yeah hmm it's fucking weird like and they're like some weird stuff to like like the alignment of all the pyramid like the pyramids of geese are like they're alignment yeah like there's some weird deep shit there too that like you know I think I think I think the baseline is this like they paint you know the Egyptians they tell like you know that yeah they were advanced but they were not I think they were 10 10 thousand years ahead of where we are right now yeah bro I think there was a lot of advanced technology that's been intentionally held from us and for many different reasons including the power of the human beings mind which I think is the biggest secret that's been kept from us I think that they have worked very hard to make us believe that we are less capable than what we are so that we will think that we are dependent on their systems and their authority to handle us so you know when you think of like all the things that they've done even just over the last four or five years to clearly make us more dependent on them wouldn't it make sense at some point in time if you if that was your goal that you would have started teaching them something different like like think about like this like look at them what they're teaching or have been teaching these kids from the last decade or so about you can be a woman or you can be a man you can be anything you want math is racist right well I mean bro we all know that's bullshit but now they've taught it to enough people were those people a lot of them believe it's true so what if they taught this the truth out of society right like what at what point in time over time did they choose to convince us that we are less capable than what we are for their control we don't know when that really started but was it like was it a hundred years ago was a thousand right and we don't know because we don't know and you know if you had a group of things that were equally as strong and intelligent as you but you knew the secrets and they didn't why would you let them know the secrets you wouldn't because if you let them know it and and everybody knew it it would make your secrets less powerful so I think there's been a history of lies told and and didn't and you know intentional molding of people's reality so that people don't believe that they're capable and and they believe they need these people to rule over them and they believe they need these people to take care of them and I think that's been going on for a lot longer than just you know a few years here in the United States yeah yeah and the other weird thing too like Egypt does not they only placed it like they have found pyramids like like the same like setup right yeah it's in the mind culture yeah right I mean places in Mexico I mean I guess it's not it was not just like what's crazy is dude a lot of the hieroglyphs that are on all of these pyramids are the same so how how would somewhere in Egypt have the same hieroglyphs and drawings as somewhere in Mexico as someone in South America as somewhere in Asia how yeah okay well that means there had to have been uh you know worldly travel and the story of all of these civilizations is that a fish man of this is what it is I'm just going to describe it like very similar a fucking half man half fish fucking came to civilization in a boat and taught him all the shit and then sailed away and and that's the the story that's told over the course of humankind um in a very simple explanation so not only are the hieroglyphs the same the story is the same the ancient story but you know they don't really tell us this right they don't tell us any of these things um make sure wonder why yeah well I'm sure it's because knowing these things for fact make us more powerful and then less powerful guys jump in on the conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think uh with that being said man let's get into this cruise guys remember if you want to see uh any of these headlines articles pictures links videos go to andyforceler.com you guys can find them all linked there uh with that being said man let's take a cruise got headlight number one biggest talk of the town of day there's a few of them all happening at once so let's connect some dots but let's start with the stock market stuff. I had a lot of these US stocks plunge as recession fear takes hold so the decline highlights the level of worry among investors since economic data released last week which we covered on the show showed unemployment rising and job growth slowing more than expected surveys of manufacturers also indicated a steep fall off in activity in the sector which is often a bell weather for the economy and we covered that last week but now you have the the seabow a volatility index or the the VIX often called the fear index exploded higher prior to a sharp rise in Friday the VIX had been on a 190 day streak of closing below the historical long term average of 20 along a stretch below the average since 2018 on Monday morning it hit 55 the highest level since the pandemic's worst days um so you have that and I think the interesting thing is not even a week ago not even not it wasn't even a full week you got Joe Biden boasting that he cured the economy this was just days before this global uh and this is not just you it is global right absolutely global let's let's see what good old Joe had to say guys here's the economy right in the environment there's no other small thing she asked him what she was I've cured the economy and the environment and a few other small things very smuggly yeah she asked the question was what do you want your legacy to be yeah I cured the economy um and and here's the thing like I mean all the markers are here curated of all its money and here's the thing but like like it's almost like all the the what's that uh the story like the the beast you know like all the beast like the marker the beast is here you know I'm saying you got magnificent seven those are the biggest uh the seven top stocks that are frequently trading um they have lost over six hundred and fifty billion dollars in value at the time of this recording um so that's your that that's in the video that's alphabet that's Tesla, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon um they all have plunged uh more than five percent top 10 when you look at the top 10 stocks okay that that as of the time of this recording uh they have cost investors a staggering two point six trillion dollars all right to the point where they've had to close the market early um stop trading um to prevent a all-out blood bath who didn't somebody say sure did something about yeah a blood bath sure did um and it's interesting because you know this this stuff is it's it's wild because if we if we go down memory lane we go back to May 24th of 2024 you have the Kamala Harris HQ uh put this tweet out and the tweet says four years ago Trump claimed the stock market would crash if Joe Biden was elected the stock market has reached the highest levels ever recorded under uh in history under President Biden it's interesting because here the fuck we are this is what Trump had to say and you know what I'm not so far away from that again believe it or not but if Biden gets in the market will crash things are interesting but you know what do they call it binobics that is called bi-denomics a fucking horrible uh we are very proud of bi-denomics very proud of bi-denomics and what do you got on this I mean look dude uh I think we've all been expecting something like this for a long time if you've had your eyes open and you have any sort of uh financial savviness to you at all and I think that you know small businesses and medium-sized businesses have been feeling the change in the economy I know that certainly families have been uh that that data is through the roof right credit cards at an all-time high defaults at an all-time high uh uh you know expenses as an all-time high and these guys come on tv every day and talk about how their economy is great the economy is great that's because these people don't talk about the economy in terms of mom and pop middle class middle upper class mid-sized companies they talk the economy uh from the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq and that's not the economy and how much foreign money has been in these uh indices for the last I don't know five or six years that has you know been I don't know unintentionally uh are falsely propping up the number you know I'm not a financial expert by any means on the big market but the my friends who are uh they all expected this to happen a long time ago and you know who knows what's going to happen over the next you know three or four months but I think I just said just the other day that we're gonna run into a situation where we have the great depression all over again and um these are the kind of things that happen before that happens so I mean it doesn't surprise me at all uh it seems like a lot of people are surprised but I'm not surprised no the only thing that is I think it is weird to me is that like not only are the stocks in liquid cash you know that's obviously taking a dip and not just in the US as global but there's also all the crypto shits yeah one down yeah I see that too that that is weird to me this is like if people are pulling the money out of here where where is it going then well I I'll be honest I don't know yeah um this is not my I am not I am a entrepreneur I'm not happy to do this shit but it's not that it's that there's a difference between and this could be a good lesson for you guys on the internet um an investor is different than an entrepreneur I'm the guy who you give the money to that could build your company I'm the guy that can take the thing from idea to business and scale up I this is not my area of expertise um I don't really invest that way and so I'm not the most savvy person to comment on this but I I you know like I said my friend a lot of my friends are and they're big investors even my brother's a big investor and uh you know they're they're they're not surprised yeah it was kind of a wait and see what happens um but I tell you what it's fun watching all these rich fucks get their ass beat uh after they've put in all these crazy policies for so long and taking advantage of the middle class and taking event because dude this shit doesn't really affect the small and mid-level person that much because those people are just fighting to survive in their businesses so it's nice to see the big boys take a fucking ass beat and once yeah instead of all of us who are in the mid-level uh you know and and mom and pop level type businesses which are the ones I care about and the ones that I build every day yeah for sure I mean like I know in video just alone you know people don't know if you guys forgot we did cover it a couple of months ago um when Nancy Pelosi was at office and she bought a shit ton of this stock yeah because they had that insider training knowledge about the chip lobby uh the chip act be I wonder how many of them shorted oh well see that that's gonna be the question yeah maybe she lost maybe she didn't yeah I'm saying she might have been all right but I know she had a shit ton of fucking she bought a shit ton of shares in the video yeah you know yeah man it's it's weird it is weird and I think it it does me look dude when you have when you have the ability as an entrepreneur to build companies and you have that specialized skill set there's a lot of people who think that entrepreneurship is the same as investing trading the stock market or investing and they're different skill sets man totally different thing yeah so like for this to happen you know it sucks for the people who are like the mom and pop investors you know they're on e-trade and shit and they're getting taken advantage of by financial advisors that don't know shit uh but you know the reality is there's a lot of this is over inflated dude and the the economy's been labeled as a false strong economy for a long time it hasn't been strong for a long time yeah so guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think uh with that being said let's go check out some of these uh how these comments let's go cruise them uh this first comment comes from uh the debt one two three I can't get past the intro to his podcast so misogynistic what part is when you say guys no I think it's don't be a hoe what guys can be host I don't even know what this person's talking about it's probably best that you don't listen yeah like because misogynistic is to get past the intro yeah okay to post the intro to his podcast oh my god yeah well how mentally fragile are you definitely don't go to uh 18 minutes in because it's going to get you well definitely don't you know be alive when the civilization falls apart you know because you certainly won't be able to handle that yeah I know my intro's you know so maybe we should what are they talking about what part are they talking about do you even know I think it's the guys I would guys what should I say guys and girls yeah let's try how does this sound what's up guys and girls which I say ladies and gentlemen hey are you cool then I forget all the fucking the the XXYY fucking you know he heard they them what's up y'all that might be I don't know uh let's go to another one and I've been seeing I want to judge I thought this was really cool to see um people kind of standing up for themselves yeah and like you know because there's trolls on my for sure and there's a lot of nameless faceless people out there you know like Vadek like you're fucking anime yeah which is fucking furry what is what is I mean like that's a furry no but what could really be massaging is to go about what I said what are you talking about what's up guys welcome to the show for the realists say about a lot of thickness and delusions of our society and welcome to my fucking reality guys guys I think guys is the hangout there you know it would be a listen you're a hell stay off the show yeah man um yeah next comment man I want I like to I like to see people stand up for themselves yeah um you know because there are trolls online this shit happens um I thought this was just a nice very respectful example of this so uh Velkin um uh reply I believe it's probably to one of the rules or something about you know you're talking about hey we should not be voting for people on the basis of their skin for sure Velkin agreed um Velkin said uh he said so true voting just because of sex or color of skin is just showing the ignorance of those people that do that shameful correct to which uh 80% of the country magad basher no what is that maggot T basher maggot maggot T basher says maggot maggot basher maggot just doesn't know how to spell maggot got okay yeah all right so I'm gonna assume that you're black um oh I got an answer he says 80% of the country is going to vote for Harris because she is the best candidate and Donald Trump isn't even qualified to be president he's an insurrectionist traitor who should be dangling from a tree that all right it's a lot that sounds racist that sounds a little a little bit that sounds racist just a little bit um a tree I mean shit man could have said like what else I mean what else do you hang from monkey bars yeah let's not go there there's you what's wrong with you no I didn't

for being a real ass fans keep liking keep commenting keep subscribing make sure you guys hit that bell notification on the tube stay up to date with the latest episodes that we drop that being said let's drop headline number two this is the second marker of the beast all right in my opinion and let's dive into it have a lot of them to reach us shifts aircraft carrier to middle east amid fears Iran may attack Israel all right um and it's not just aircraft carriers we we we are shifting troops other military assets to the middle middle east right now to defend Israel and American forces against what is expected to be a complex attack by Iran and its proxies the Pentagon said Friday a defense secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln which is currently operating in the Pacific and it's destroyer escorts to the region along with additional squadron of fighter planes additional ballistic air defense units will also be deployed to the Middle East not only to defend Israel but to protect US forces in Iraq and Syria who have come under attack by Iran and its proxies the Pentagon said this is the second time since April that the United States has acted quickly to defend Israel after the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu conducted targeted assassinations of Iranian officials and militant groups backed by Tauron now US assets already in the region include ground forces air forces as well as newly deployed destroyers amphibious ships in an aircraft carrier to help repeal attacks from Iran Yemen and Lebanon we are just now increasing that support Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina C said earlier Friday that Austin was preparing quote multiple forthcoming force posture moves to bolster force protection for US forces and Israel now real news no bullshit to great page if you guys don't follow them follow them they have a lot of they are very good they're very good very unbiased just like this is what is what's going on yeah for sure and so they posted out about about two hours ago before the show saying amid growing concerns about a potential Iranian attack on Israel US central command commander general Michael Eric Corella has arrived in Israel for high level discussions with defense officials the talks are focused on joint preparations and the dissipation of possible aggression from Iran and its proxies meanwhile Russia has since Sergei Shoygu the former top defense official and current secretary of the Russian security council to meet with Iranian officials here's a video of both of them arriving simultaneously to their sides right so that's coming out today now there's a couple of other things that are also happening while all of this is going on you got president Biden he is left Delaware he is back at the White House allegedly for a meeting with his national security team and vice president Harris you got g7 leaders they're pressuring Iran not to strike Israel you got Saudi Arabia they told around that they cannot use their airspace to launch drones or rockets at Israel I mean you have multiple airlines cancelling flights from Israel Lebanon Iraq Jordan and Iran so you got that happen him and then this this this dude this guy it's fucking cheesedick clown Lindsey Graham huh oh buddy yeah he is this wooden fucking teeth he is he is rattling the sabers all right here we go warmonger Lindsey Graham introduces joint resolution to authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against Iran this week Nioh Khan GOP Senator Lindsey Graham introduced a joint resolution to authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against the Islamic Republic of Iran reminiscent of WMDs and Iraq Graham's submission presents Iran as an eminent nuclear danger characterization that conveniently aligns with longstanding political concerns and justifications for military action in the region these were a couple of key points from his his release that he put out and then he also tweeted this out he says it is always good for any American administration to reassure Israel that we have their back against Iran and their proxies and will provide the necessary defensive capability however it is long past time to start talking about offense when it comes to Iranian threats against Israel the United States and the world Iran is running wild throughout the region as my recent legislation indicates an attack by Hamas, Hezbollah or the Houthis against Israel should be considered an attack by Iran all of these proxies are provided weapons and funds by the Iranian regime to spread their terror Israel should have every right to know who provided the Iranian regime with the funds what was it like six billion dollars that was us hmm the same American administration that now have to reassure Israel the same one exactly same one I mean he says Israel should have every right to not only defend its territory from Iranian attacks but also hit the regime hard Gagatola and this henchman have one source of revenue oil and gas so wait so it's two sources technically three sources if you count the US tax dollars that keep going on shit you put the refineries at risk and their behavior changes the best way to prevent escalation is to show a willingness to go on offense now is the time now like you guys to try something because I did this I did a little just quick image search with with our boy Lindsey Graham and not just from this year but for many years you can go down the path and you can look how happy he is with his Irish and American flag pin on his lapel so happy and you know what I think is interesting Andy is that Lindsey Graham received over a million dollars from APEC shocking which is a known pro-Israel lobby it's the most powerful lobby in the whole country we got a million dollars for him and now he's beating the war drum Andy what have you got on that I mean that's that's no different than a lot of a ton of our politicians okay I mean that's the reality this pack supports politicians on both side of the aisle and those politicians are pro-Israel over pro-America they make decisions that are in the interest of this small country all the way on the other side of the world that are not in the interest of the people that they walk by on the streets every single day and this is why I said when this whole thing started that I am not pro-Israel or pro-Palestinian pro-Fucking America and we have a problem here with these people who do not represent our country and do not represent our interests taking our tax dollars and sending our brothers and dads and sons to die in wars halfway across the world that don't mean shit to anybody but these guys pocketbooks and that's what's going on and that's what's been going on we have been the iron fist of globalism and by the way Israel for the course of since they were first fucking founded in 1946 okay our seven or eight or whatever it was we have been their military for that long okay anytime someone fucks with Israel the Americans got to go fuck with them right and now we have Israel attacking Lebanon we have Israel shooting fucking you know what 50,000 fucking civilians and then we have our politicians over here standing on the stage and saying I'm pro-Israel what do you why why aren't you pro-America why aren't we taking care of the people here why are we taking care of the people on the streets here why aren't we taking care of the cities here why are we sending our money to Ukraine and these other places we shouldn't be sending money to any other country on the planet until our country looks how it should and it doesn't look anything like that it looks like a total shit hole right now so I don't support any of this shit the war I don't support a sending foreign aid to other countries for any reason at this time and I think most of the middle class and most of the people who actually work for a living and pay most of the tax in this country agree they don't want to pay tax for us to go to war over and fucking the Middle East they don't want to pay tax for us to go to war over in Ukraine no regular people want this war politicians want this war because they own stocks in Lockheed Martin they own stocks in Rathion they get kickbacks from these situations and these deals and this is how they make their money but they make their money on the backs of the service of American men and American women that go over there and put their lives at risk who are your sisters and brothers and sons and moms and they get killed for this so you're going over there getting killed for their financial interests this is this is bullshit it needs to stop Lindsey Graham as a fucking traitor to this country period okay and we need to get all of these old disgusting fore sale fuck faces out of our government that's that's what I think about it you know what else something is is is thought provoking the fact that the same people who said that Donald Trump would crash the economy and lead us into World War Three have now have now crashed the economy and are leading us into World War Three yeah but the same people devoted for those people now have some sort of fucking way to justify it they they justify everything they justify everything because they hate Trump so bad they hate Trump so fucking bad that they would vote outside of their own personal families interests to not read mean tweets and to feel virtuous because I'm voting for the first black female who ain't even fucking black okay so it's it's insane dude like that is those people will not survive that's that's that's against your own survival instinct that is beyond reason like if you're going to vote yourself into a poorer position into a harder position into a more difficult position to seem virtuous or to fight wars that do not benefit you or support things that do not benefit you you are beyond saving you are beyond saving in the real world and natural order those animals like we're talking about those animals die they don't survive it's Darwinism and right now because most Americans who are intelligent and work hard and embody the ideals of American culture have gone out and built companies and built businesses and worked hard and and taking care of their families while they trusted that the government was doing in their best interests and they weren't for the last 20 years so now we have a lot of unwinding to do and it's I think it's become very obvious to every common sense American that like this is a problem and when we're asked to vote for someone because of their skin color or because of their gender and not because of their policies when 60 or 70% of the country can't even make it from paycheck to paycheck that's absurd shit to be putting down people's strokes so that's what I think dude dude the other I'm looking I'm trying to pull up the like how far we are how many days out are you from the the election we're like 90 70 some days right isn't the timing of this also very thought provoking right like when you look at the fact that like you got the economy the global economy which is you know very directly tied into the US economy having major issues right now this war drum beat and I don't pull this like I don't like to do the war drum shit or even bring the shit up unless I feel like it's concrete shit that they're actually moving forward through doesn't that put us in a very very a great spot for defeat of course like our economies to shit right now of course our strategic oil is drained our a lot of our equipment has not been replenished from the withdrawal of Afghanistan three years ago we have low morale we have people not wanting to participate in these wars we have millions and millions and millions of people coming across the border we are intentionally being spread then so that we cannot defend ourselves and people don't understand that they're creating something in Ukraine they're creating something in Middle East they're creating something at the border they're creating something in Taiwan and if that's the case who's going to fight all that war okay you got every other country the BRICS countries all in order about that rushes over in my room yeah where are the fucker all these european where's all their financial aid to the fucking Ukrainians where's where's their involvement where's their troops right like dude we're setting ourselves up for the conquering of our own country based upon identity politics that people who have no concept of what violence is actually like or what war actually does voting for ideal shit oh I want the first black this or the first woman this you don't care like you told if you die because of that you know I'm saying like that's where we are with society and like you know it's very dangerous and this is exactly what I've been telling you uh was going to happen they were going to start massive disruption and massive war and do everything that they could do to fuck up the election and it's right on fucking cute like I told you yeah yeah man guys jump it on this conversation I want you guys to tell us down in the comments what you guys think uh let us know man that being said let's check out our third and final headline that number three now this one is interesting uh because again you know you know you remember that term code switching yeah it was like how you did I don't code switch I do code switch I code I code switch it's fine um and guess what Andy it is fine yeah people code switch all right all right because AP News said that it's fine the common code switches uh down the Trump question and common Harris's race shows he doesn't understand code switching we don't code switch your race no no you do Andy it's called having a range Kamala has range that's what it is all right let's hear that Kamala Harris has range man that's what it is she can grill nominees for the supreme court or meet with our foreign dignitaries then pivot to hosting a duole celebration or dancing enthusiastically along side of HBCU style marching band she she has range she's cultured it is a dexterity that Harris the first black woman an Asian American to serve as vice president developed as a person of color to navigate the corridors of power or main street in a nation where race and identity influence how one is received or embraced yeah so so okay so it's fine who's making the nation uh based around identity influence who's doing that oh that's the media oh that's the people writing this oh that's them fucking idiots now you know and then listen Harris the article continues the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India is an and wrote code switcher a term that can include deliberately adjusting one speech style and expression to optimize relatability and ensure she gets a message across that's what it is um and former president Donald Trump during a contentious interview session at a meeting of the national association of black journalists showed no familiarity with the concept he implied that Harris is an authentic for embracing all aspects of her heritage his failure to recognize code switching also speaks to a prevailing belief that whiteness oh boy here we go often correlated with speaking and plainly enunciated English is the default in our politics or democracy that's because it is the language of English it's the language of English okay like are we really gonna are we really going to identify ourselves based upon uh the informalities of language like it's not that she's code switching she is manipulating people she's paying to yes to pander to their racial identity when her racial identity is not the one that she's claiming that is manipulation she's saying she's uh African-American she's not African American her father was black and oh by the way her father was a fucking Marxist Andy I'm glad you brought that up he was a Marx he was a Marxist let's fact check it yes it's fucking true this is snopes yes this is snopes I don't fucking miss and by the way did you see that picture of fucking Kamala this weekend the Democrats posted oh I did man that was fucking weird that was interesting that was very interesting bizarre official Democrat X page uploads photo of Kamala Harris with Michelle signs and background that is fucking weird now that's weird because that picture is from 2008 right but the Democrats just decided to post this hmm now I know I said last week that I would it looked like I'm wrong about that because they actually named her the official candidate of the Democrat Party but at the DNC they still have the right to change it and you said when I said it looks like I'm probably wrong you said still got time still got a lot to go they got time and it looks like you might have saved my conspiracy which I'm very thankful for I got I'm a coast which I got you yeah bro I'm just saying like I mean like that's the other like how much black does he need him to do it bro black people wouldn't say he was racist Karen's would say he was racist true I'm so offended for black people when black people laughing at the fucking jokes he's telling you know I think you see the clip of the actual audio from that fucking they fuck with the audio bro they fuck you audio there's a clip there's a couple clips this person did a this person did a comparison I saw in the audience yes of the actual laughter and the laughter from the crowd was muted so it was actually way more than what we saw on the show now don't believe us let's go to our audio producer here this man is a triple platinum recording producer Joe is it possible to tone out you have a fucking clip can you can you is that possible to do like like for real no bullshit so they can bring the crowd noise down or up yeah you can separate it on stems yeah that's fuck yeah well yeah that's fact check well I mean dude I you saw that right I saw the that was crazy but like do we do we like I mean do you really hold them past like remember when they made fucking Joe Rogan Gray no you know I'm saying like it's not or when they change the fucking like faces on the secret service guys to smile yeah you know like it's not fucking like far fetched it's not far fetch now man I don't know what I know is Kamala Harris every single day reminds me more and more of that dude from fucking split oh yeah like this is like this is a good movie it's a great movie it's underrated he's a great actor yeah he did really really well in that I just think that you know there was so many people that watched this and like I want to be him yeah well look dude come on I think I think she's a piece of shit and I think that anybody who legitimately votes for her is legit and look dude I have my criticisms of Trump people say all the time that I'm a magnetard and I'm fucking mega cult and blah blah blah no I'm not but I'm smart enough to decide between two people that we have the choice inside between right and I would rather choose someone who's run multiple companies with hundreds of thousands of employees or the course of his life who's made billions of dollars from the American system over someone who hasn't done shit and who's only gotten to where she is because she is a fucking DEI higher okay and people are DEI as the new N word no motherfucker the N word is the fucking N word is that what they say oh fuck yeah bro every time you mention DEI it's oh you racist no DEI is an actual program she was chosen by Joe Biden in public through his own fucking words because she was a black woman that's it okay he said that and you all ate it up at the time yeah woo black woman first one this now you failed to think what does this mean to me what will this do for me how will this affect my family and because you can't conceptualize that these decisions actually affect you and affect your family and dictate the highs or the lows or the foundation that you're going to build off of you continue to vote for these people because you think it doesn't matter more than just whatever choice you make regarding their identity oh you know what I don't like Donald Trump I don't care if he can run the contrast don't like him like okay so what's that mean for you well that's gonna mean this and this and this and this and this this right like dude there's so many lies going around about Donald Trump right now that it's absurd you know he wants to eliminate abortion no he doesn't he said so a bunch of times he said dude there's exceptions in this rule which are always the exceptions that the far left rings up otherwise you know you could do get the crazy abortion people that just want to fucking you know kill babies right but those are not the majority of the people on on the left the majority of women on the left just want to have an option is something where to get fucked up I think everybody understands that and then you have the people on the right who are like you're going to help look dude ain't your place to say who's going to hell okay like you you need to stay to fuck out of it this is America let the states decide like it's supposed to be how our country's supposed to be set up some states are gonna say no you can't do that here some states are gonna say yeah do that here and that's the reality of it that's how the country's supposed to be and by the way even if it was banned even if it was blocked you're still gonna vote for killing your fetus over how much money you're gonna have over the food over the safety of your community over us potentially being invaded or nuclear bomb you're still gonna vote for this one issue alone that may affect you once or twice in your life unless you're a fucking horror and you can't keep your legs shut right okay like just being real just being real fucking pull out man we're a fucking kind of swallow the shit like dude you put it on your titties I'm being serious bro like everybody else does like everybody else does like fuck rules are twinkies baby I'm just saying man and and dude like it's a lie right that's the point now then they lie about this uh what was the fucking uh gender 2025 oh yeah that's fucking bullshit okay but now that you pointed out I read it I'm like uh it sounds alright not that bad yeah but Donald Trump that's not Donald Trump's policy right if you go on Donald Trump's website he lists out his policy if you go on Kamala Harris's website there is no policy to be found because their election strategy is not about policy it's about voting for identity and and dude you so you're gonna tell me listen this is the same look dude I'm speaking to the people who who think that Kamala is a great choice you cannot objectively look at her accomplishments and say she's accomplished anything she hasn't got a bill passed ever she was fucking pushed through it's San for say by the way if you want to look like what if you want to know what her shit looks like oh look at San Francisco it was the first fucking liberal city to fall okay she's from there do you want the entire country look like San Francisco no you don't but you want to be able to say to your friends oh I love Kamala she's so cool she dances and she you know I just like her because you know she's a woman and it's great all the while all the people you care about are gonna suffer because of that decision and your kids are gonna suffer because of that decision and you are gonna suffer because of that decision because you're uninformed you don't understand what's going on and you have the inability to look past liking someone if I'm building a country or if I'm building a company or I'm building a small business and I say fuck all right we got to build this this company up all right I got I got Steve and I got Suzy and man Suzy's a dumbass Steve's a fucking asshole I don't like Steve but at least he's done this about 20 times he knows exactly what to do it's not looking real good on who I get to choose from but fuck I'd rather us at least get somewhere than us destroy it with Suzy's leadership like that's what we're talking about it so it's such a simple it's a it's a very simple choice that people cannot if they think logical minds can figure this out but people who vote on emotion can't and a lot of these people that are voting for Kamala are people that don't pay taxes they are not paying into the system they they they have been purposefully impoverished and had their communities destroyed black people for the intention of creating a voter base for the Democratic Party okay and when the black people in the in the inner city started to wake up the the Democratic Party said fuck they're waking up so what do we got to do oh let's bring in all these other migrants though vote for us because they don't have shit and because they don't have shit they have to vote for us all right so that's the game the game is make you poor make you suffer make you think that you have no hope and no opportunity and no ability to pursue the American dream and then vote for me because I'm like you and I'll give you their shit that's the whole fucking play so so like dude anybody that votes for her is leader either a literal communist or someone who's so fucking dumb they they can't even think past their motions at all 100% man and the other parts who are or there's people who are very rich who are connected to these people who know they're gonna get a bunch of favors and so they come out and support they'll be safe the other part two man and I think I think I'll try to address this whenever we can man it's just like just to remember I know when you guys out there you scrolling on your your social medias it may appear that she has a lot of support it may appear that it is manipulated it is manufactured all right here's more proof just so you guys know this headline reads gay only fan star claims Kamala Harris campaign offer $1,500 to bash Trump on TikTok all right now this is not just a one off thing let's dive into it a gay only fans content creator who was approached by a left wing agency to make anti-Donald Trump video for a Democrat superpack said he refuses to whore out his values or sell out for Kamala Harris Michael Dordry a 22 year old social media influencer who posts explicit content to his only fans page and more safe for work LGBT related posts on Instagram is not the average Trump fan quote I'm conservative leaning I even wear American flag underwear and shoot guns on my only fans the long island native toe of the New York post happen to like dicks yeah he just likes massive cocks yeah yeah this what nothing nothing nothing despite his right wing views Dordry was solicited by influencer marketing firm palette management on behalf of forward future the largest Democrat superpack and operation quote hi Michael I hope you're doing well I'm reaching out on behalf of one of palates partners with an exciting paid offer to create and post anti-Trump content on tics look how like they're just blatant with it they're not even like yeah no I need you to make anti-Trump here's something like because Trump hates you Trump hates you Trump hates you because you like dicks yeah right and uh and and yeah that was from a senior marketing coordinator for nanda uh I think I fucking stupid that sounds what that real talk that fucking message no like just how stupid that sounds Trump hates you because Trump hates you because you happen to like dicks like that's what they're trying to say right like we're past that in America bro we're past this you know we're we're progressive enough in this country and and the problem is is that this kind of shit is pushing us back so far that that that that do gay people are going to have a lot of problems now because of what's been going on I I feel good that they're standing up to strength though yeah for sure yeah um now I am not a biologist but let me calculate this real quick um because here's the thing for future just took in another hundred and fifty million one hundred and fifty million dollars yeah all right just that organization alone to do this all right and so 150 uh million dollars uh and they're doing the pay-in I'll 1500 each that's a hundred thousand people right there yep that that could definitely create some and manipulate yeah and by the way they they don't disclose as the FCC forces people to disclose that it's an actual paid ad exactly so that's that's how they get around that and like bro these people are not playing by the rules that they force on companies to play right they're making it look like it's an organic ad what I mean by that is this if I were to pay you to make a pro trump ad you would have to disclose that you were paid to make that ad that's the law but they are not disclosing that and they are not disclosing the anti-Trump so what they're doing just like they did with Twitter back in 2020 and all the social platforms is they are manufacturing perception uh as as a case of marketing right they're trying to manufacture perceived momentum which is what the Twitter files was all about exposing all right with the polls the box yes the polls are lies the bottom they they they build up narratives that they want and they squash narratives they don't want with cancel culture bots and bad traffic or traffic throttling and then they you know these celebrities say crazy shit and then they put all their fake bots onto those traffic to create the perception that everybody's with this and you're out you're out in the cold if you're not with this so you might as well join that and that's how they pray on weak people bro because they know that most people don't have the ability to stand firm in their beliefs and in their their identity uh when everybody else is saying you're wrong right we saw that during covid dude you know how many people wore the mask and and played by the rules but actually knew it was bullshit a lot but that's how they got it to work because they made the perception that everybody was with it how many times did we walk through a grocery store walk in public and you know people see you not wearing a mask and they're like fuck thank god bro you're one I can't stand this shit I don't even know why I'm wearing it right exactly exactly but that perception of everybody doing it is what made it work and that's what they're trying to do with Kamala okay and this is what they did with Hillary too they tried to make this is the same play they ran with Hillary they try to use the bots and by the way nobody knew about the bots back then that was my first experience you had a person that was my first experience with the bots I was on Facebook I made a pro Trump post and within like five minutes I had like five thousand comments which was like I was like how the fuck did this happen damn I'm gonna know that yeah but I didn't know about bots so I was like fuck yeah what's going on I got no idea like I'm like holy shit dude look at all these people they're crazy and and then you know I deleted the post because I didn't know what the fuck was going on and then I figured it out and I'm like holy shit because I figured it out because I talked to one of my buddies who was in you know in the in the Facebook but the point is is that normal people don't know that bro they don't know that like a lot of these people that come on your posts and trash you are just bots that are made up to fucking keep you intimidated from not posting and so they ran this same play with Hillary they tried to make her so much more popular than what she was and Hillary is not a likable person bro people people don't like Hillary they just didn't want Trump to win right and uh and then they built on that for four years with the Russia collusion and all the shit and they you know they were able to do that same play with Biden you know he's much more popular than what he actually is and they use all the text so they're doing the same thing with Kamala this is the play and I still think after that photo being post yesterday that there is a strong possibility that Kamala because of whatever negative will happen between now and the DNC well you know because dude she's already getting trashed today you know she's gonna hit about their comment fucking Friday she was a hero right Wednesday she was a hero two three weeks ago she everybody hated her nobody knew her right and then everybody likes her when they fucking start putting her on all these uh you know Hollywood shows and making her seem like she's this amazing person and she's gonna save the country and all this shit well if bad shit continues to happen which it will because the the these bad things started happen a long time ago like they're coming to fruition now and as bad things happen uh people are gonna get more and more disenfranchised with her and then you know that's the where I get into the possibility of them bringing Michelle Obama to to ride that wave of perception so that it's close enough to when they get to the election they can steal it so I don't know man they didn't post that by accident I can tell you that dude that's bro I don't think anything that they fucking do is by accident they're not stupid they're gonna like they're gonna drop some bleminal fucking messages yeah I think that's exactly what the fuck this was yeah man guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think that being said man let's get to our last segment that thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is where bringing in the topic we're bringing a headline we talk about it it'll get one of these two options so with that being said that dicks dicks
