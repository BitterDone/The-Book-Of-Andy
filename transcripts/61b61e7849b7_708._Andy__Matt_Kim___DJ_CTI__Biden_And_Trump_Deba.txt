oh thank you yeah if you guys don't follow Matt you should be following Matt he does some of the best content on the internet in terms of what's going on the world it's a very common sense factual unemotional presentation of what's going on which is what I think we need more of so where could everybody where can everybody find you at I mean at this day and age if you really want to find someone you can find someone she's got to go looking for yeah that's true if you search Matt Kim on pretty much any platform whatever your preferred platform is like you'll find me cool cool yeah I like that he puts in his bio free thinker because like I mean there's a lot of people that like to claim that title but like you you actually do it yeah you actually I like the way he presents the his content yeah it's I mean it's super authentic how'd you get into like pushing out that content because you only you have been doing it long I've been doing it about a year yeah and I try to do it in a way that is shareable so I want to make it obvious for people that people feel comfortable to share the content actually it's funny quick story I got a message from these grandmother's the other day 70 years old and they're like we love your content because I can share it with my grandchildren because they are so liberal they're so woke and I can't have these conversations with them so I send your videos to them they'll watch a one or two minute video it's really hard to convince someone to watch a two hour podcast if they're not buying into the message and I really love that I think that under that made me understand why people are watching it because it's so shareable you've been killing it man oh dude I think you do a better job than almost anybody with presenting comprehensive reviews of important topics in short form I think that's definitely your bread and butter dude and I don't see anybody doing it better I appreciate that's really cool yeah so so here we are not a nation that's a united nations a freedom not the real united nations of tyrants communist yeah so what's going on dude is it we got stuff going on today or is it slow day busy day I mean listen I'm glad you asked that and I think yeah I accidentally I asked you asked it okay got it I gotta represent over there right yeah yeah it's a lot of interesting stuff happening man so you know it's cti I'm gonna recruit some headlines of course but before we get into that man we got to address something because I feel like there may be I mean in listen I don't know if this is like lawsuit worthy all right but 75 hard you guys know we've talked about it plenty of times you know it's been covered by quite a few different very notable news outlets new posts yeah mainstream media hate it yeah me too they do yeah I love it interesting because you kind of got like a little nod from a very very unsuspecting place and I should say thank you to you guys because you guys have actually been hitting up the email you know and I don't know even know how we miss this but thanks to our listeners you guys have there's a bunch of a lot of emails about this because our listeners caught this so the Biden Harris campaign official accounts all right is now trying to dub 75 hard to attack Donald Trump and it's fucking great it's great it's great so shut the fuck up the official you know you know I we've we've mentioned this account a few times right this is the tiktok account it has a little bit over 320 thousand followers they got about which is horrible yeah on tiktok there's nothing yeah there's nothing there's nothing there's nothing but we on the room I could I could literally post a picture of myself picking my nose and eating my own boogers and have more than that yeah for sure yeah have you guys seen the picture of the team that runs Biden HQ you can find it on the line you can actually find that are running the page wait wait wait where should I type in who runs the Biden HQ maybe search their ex they took a picture because they were trying to keep them private and they took a picture and somehow leaked onto the net and they look exactly like what you would think they would yeah like you probably don't even have to find the picture they look exactly like what you would expect that that can't be it no we'll try to find it the doubt about it I'm gonna find it but yeah so the official this official account which we've covered you know when they did that whole picture with the red eyes shit right yeah they they uh they came out with the 75 hard impossible trump edition all right and this is the actual post bro this is the actual post shut the fuck this is an actual post 75 hard trump edition um which they've uh outlaid uh the the five critical task on 75 hard for trump uh which are uh no following the sleeping court no golfing no attempting to overturn an uh an election no bragging about overturning roe v wait and no running mate that has killed a dog pro the left cannot do funny shit oh like it is literally a possible like you don't have funny you could actually make this if like no running mates that killed a dog yeah what about you guys with no uh no run and makes it actually just kill people yeah about that about that no man we're gonna have to make our own 75 hard version for them yeah yeah let's do it i think there's the irony in this that i love man the irony i love is they don't understand how much i fucking hate they have like bro if they actually knew they wouldn't be giving me any credit that's for sure that's a beautiful part about this man and i was looking through some of the comments the top this is one of the top ones uh by the mix we throw up well they get hammered uh and then like it's just full of things like this trump 20s before trump 2020 i mean i like i don't know i mean is that lawsuit worthy can you sue them is that i could but i mean no i could trademark him but that's a trademark value yeah right well people don't know that i like people still think that's like some shit that belongs to tiktok i gotta send out more letters on fucking 75 hard yeah it's insane but now you know we'll let this slide you'll have a slide yeah i don't know if the attorneys will let us slide but i'll let us slide i mean hey they're getting you some clout bro yeah appreciate it yeah with your with with the okay i just got something to say there's only 175 hard motherfuckers you don't get them pick and choose yeah trump can do it you can do it i yeah i doubt it well we got that man and then real quick i wanted to bring this other thing up because i saw this right before we got we got to covering some stuff uh did you guys see that another bag of cocaine was discovered inside of the u.s. capital police headquarters surprise surprise yeah another one was found and there was a press police on it's it's a real deal per the u uscp the united states capital police is investigating a roughly one inch by one inch ziplock bag with a small amount of a white powdery substance which filled tested positive for cocaine small bag was found on the floor of a hallway inside u.s.cp headquarters a hallway is on the second floor in an area that has been a staging spot for furniture and supplies the area is heavily trafficked by various contractors and employees there's also near offices such as prisoner processing crime scene intel and reports processing um yes they found this little cocaine uh in another news uh hunter-biden applies and gets a job as u.s. capital police it just shows how sloppy like haters will say that's Photoshop it just shows how sloppy they are bro because in previous administrations at least they would hide their cocaine properly that's right you don't leak it like in their nose yeah you know it's keeping your pocket you know where your drugs are at all times they're so sloppy that they're just dropping it everywhere like it's just it's indicative of how the administration is run sloppy is it sloppy or is it just is it more like arrogance you know what I'm saying like there's just this like I don't care what are you going to do about it listen if you can't have your shit together about where your drugs are yeah what makes you think you can run a country that's true there's somebody freaking out looking patting their pocket right now I think I dropped it because he's fucking about to fall asleep yeah man I just thought I thought that was great but how did that do on this you crushed it decent right this decent huh all right you that looks like I did it all right well guys let's get it to our headlines man let's let's knock these out we got uh let's go ahead get the shot we're headline number one headline number one reads uh let's get ready to rumble Donald Trump ready to confront Joe Biden on the debate stage so we got debates they finally uh semi somehow agreed to some debates with some caveats which we'll get into uh but we got Joe Biden and uh Donald Trump going to be debating um for president Donald Trump immediately accepted president Joe Biden's proposal on Wednesday to debate in June and September uh but requested more debates and slammed him as the worst debater I have ever faced uh political pundits previously doubted that Biden who's 81 with whom special counsel Robert Herr described as an elderly man with poor memory with debate Trump uh even though he said in April he would Biden released a video Wednesday morning proposing two debates in June and September here's clip Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020 the sense that he hadn't shown up for debate now he's acting like he wants to debate me again well make my day pal I'll even do it twice so let's pick the date style I hear you're free I'm lunch these I don't get the joke I don't either I don't get the joke because there's no court there's no courts on Wednesdays uh is that like a real thing yeah like yeah yeah you can't make sense that it's funny hey I know he looks like a fucking corpse like he really shit does I'm wondering like I've seen people laying in a casket that look better than that how many takes did that take oh dude I was taking the same thing I was like dude 20 tanks he wore them out that's his whole day of work you hard drive let's do it again I want to see the boobers I want to see the fucking boobers what's the what's that drug that open like you know how like old people like when they get like dude I'm telling you man he looks just like that dude from fucking the Indiana Jones movie man that I talked about earlier what's the last crusade when he drinks from the wrong cup you don't do type it in okay well listen he looks just like you got to throw it up there on the screen so people know I'm talking what is it last crusade you you have just put in last crusade you have chose poorly last crusade you have chose poorly so learn how to work this computer so I know well you know oh yeah you know what they say they say you know black people don't know how to use computers yeah yeah yeah wait okay this guy yeah storm right up there like guy yeah yeah he looks just like that guy but like scroll down there's like a there's like a time lapse of where he's not as skeletalish yeah there he is there he is it's fucking Biden bro I mean I do see it I see it yeah he looks like that he's about a year away from that do the overlay yeah I mean I can see it yeah I see I see it yeah man I do see it yeah I do see it um yeah and so like and then he puts out like you know I don't listen I don't know who the hell's running his Twitter account it has to be some like 22 year old millennial that's like think they're hip right it has to be the coolest person but it's just like this it's like spunk they're trying to give him like that's not real bro like that's not you you know spunk yeah like this fucking like apparently he likes giving the spunk till whole watch people yeah they put this uh put this tweet out for all of your fucking own kids yeah yeah oh I saw that BA says I received them accepted an invitation from etc and then for debate on June 27th over to you Donald as you said anywhere anytime any place you know like all right bro but yeah so and then trump actually he accepted and agreed on both of those the June date and the September date but trump won up them and said let's do one every month so he offered June July August September so four debates but here's the caveat here's the catch so we got debates this first one is in is in June June 27th but here's the catch no live audience hmm per the specific request of the White House and the Biden campaign Biden wants to ban presidential debate audiences right so yeah we'll do a debate but nobody can watch it live I think the last time CNN did the town hall with trump he ended up winning over the audience yeah it's supposed to be a rather independent moderate crowd right and they were cheering him that's when he brought out the tweet from January 6th yeah he's pocket and yet that set up and ready to go they're probably worried about something like that for sure where they should if they see the shift in the energy in the crowd that'd be really bad they're probably what they're most scared of well also dude like you can't really find people that want to support Biden you know even the people that vote for Biden they're not voting for Biden they're voting against trump so when when we go out and try to find people like they're gonna the people that are gonna be for Biden are gonna be very obvious to spot right like they all look the same you know it'd be real smell the same yeah the same color hair right um I mean those could be generalizations but probably not uh but we have this situation where you know they couldn't get anybody to even show up in 2020 and that was in my opinion a lot of what the lockdown was about and you know the they didn't care that a million people were in the streets for BLM right they didn't you know trump was having rallies of a hundred thousand people every third every day leading up to the actual election which was amazing this guy couldn't fill up a gym this guy couldn't fill up uh even a tiny venue so so you know like an easy way to really solve this would be say hey we're gonna do this at uh you know in arena and say here you guys get 50% of the tickets we get 50% of the tickets and see what that looks like because they won't have anybody show up dude no this is definitely in Biden's favor obviously yeah because of trump really feeds off the energy of the crowd and without that crowd he's gonna lose kind of that the energy that he pulls from I think uh with Biden they don't want to see what he is in natural environment you know so they're probably gonna hop him up with a bunch of drugs like they're for the state of the union to ask and he actually does pretty well in those type of situations if it's super controlled and they have plenty of time to prep for it and they're able to get that concoction of drugs just right yeah to give him that one hour of maximum performance yeah which is what they did for the state of the union I think it'll be really interesting I think it'll be the most watched political debate in presidential debate maybe in the history of the world yeah everyone's good to it just sucks man because it's like you know I feel like you know presidents they're I feel like there's an obligation to be on the stage in front of people you know I'm saying like yeah you should you should you should want more importantly you should have to be able to have you know give your answers and hear the live reactions from the people yeah and it shouldn't be just a bunch of hands-selected people either it should be people from the general public bro and then he said you like Biden should be able to hear the booze that's my that's my take bro and they know that's what's going to happen and I agree with you Matt like Biden when he people underestimate his ability to communicate the center right underestimates his ability to communicate because if you look at any sort of Fox News or any sort of the stuff online they always pick his very worst moments and they that's all they ever show so people think he's like legitimately way gone which I think he is however he is able to put together a short amount of time of competent speaking yeah coaching of ability listen it's hard to do it's hard to go for an hour straight and talk like that for an hour straight and and I I'll give credit where it's due the state of the union even though I disagree with everything he was saying and everything was lying he was lying about everything his delivery was convincing to someone that didn't know the facts just like Newsom is right like Newsom lies so confidently that people that are uninformed they're like oh this guy's great this is like Obama Obama is that way too yeah I mean the state of union the point of Joe Biden was to show the world that he is not senile yeah and if that was a goal like he did a pretty good job at that I think right now he has five weeks to prepare they're gonna get it just right they'll probably leak all the questions to him in advance you'll have he'll have the zingers prepared and come back ready to go and it's gonna be a tough test for Trump I think they think that he's just gonna go in and steamroll and run over what that's right I think that's maybe underestimating the opponent you never want to underestimate your opponent yeah I agree what's the concoction of drugs I got no geratol is a real thing what else do you think they're pumping in there a lot of Adderall yeah probably cocaine no I'm being serious if you're seeing a movie flight they're searching for their dealer now yeah we're Denzel Washing and they get them all hopped up for bro cocaine's part of that dude cocaine's a hell of a drug yeah yeah but yeah I saw I mean so that's going on the so this is a CNN one is Jake Tapper and Dana Bush um totally unbiased completely unbiased even though Jake Tapper you know there's a history of extreme one lies obviously but I mean he hates Donald Trump and I don't know if that's a genuine hate or if he's just being paid and told to hate um you know but like there's a lot of receipts here and they show the unbiased right so you add that into it you add in a closed no audience environment where there's zero feedback there's the zero you know I'm saying like there's going to be Trump against everybody in that room you know I'm saying I think it's kind of messed up but um yeah they they've uncovered a bunch of stuff I mean going back to the Russia Trump collusion the Russia gate shit that uh Tapper spearheaded on CNN um uh the 2020 presidential elections talking about all that stuff the COVID stuff I mean Tapper is kind of like let that on CNN um bashing Trump so we'll see final update uh with all of this did you guys see that uh with that that that Robert Herr Joe Biden um uh interview right there was a 40 requests to get that released out uh in White House Joe Biden they just deserted executive privilege to keep that from coming out which I think also lens to the whole like it's gonna like that tape's gonna show how see now and bad this guy actually is and he can't handle the fucking interview to release that five weeks out from a debate I think they're obviously doing that in Biden's favor for for the for the debates um I think this is a huge opportunity for Trump to really take control if he goes out there and the whole world at this point knows that this is a biased debate that everything is not in his favor that he has to go into enemy territory in CNN enemy host enemy enemy moderators and he has to show up there and if he crushes it like it's over you know this is the time and this is a moment that he needs to be prepared for ready for which I'm sure he's doing and if he's able to kind of take over the conversation I think they replaced Biden yeah oh yeah I think that's in the cards anyway I think they've already planned on that I was talking to a couple people that would know a little bit more than us I just leave it at that and they said that that there's a lot of people that highly expect a different candidate to be introduced at the DNC in August yeah so they have until August to figure it out yeah and if Biden picks up momentum then maybe they roll with them if he just keeps on going and if he gets crushed by Trump and these debates it's only two they get crushed by them yeah all they gotta do is replace and they just have to make it last until the convention you know one thing I've this is a little bit off topic but one thing is that's super interesting to me is how they are already like painting his 2016 to 2020 presidency as the worst time ever like Jack Tapper just said what are you talking about what he statistically that is a complete lie and it's interesting how these people are trying to portray what happened in COVID differently and what happened at these different events differently just a few years down the road you know it makes you wonder like what have they completely lied about in history what have they completely washed over or made up because Trump's presidency from 16 to 20 was statistically one of the best presidencies that the United States have has ever had maybe the best okay and these people are out here now saying remember what a nightmare that is no the only nightmare is part of it was the constant assault on Trump and the intolerance for any sort of peaceful coexistence and the intentional division that was created by the media the entire time you know the media is what's created that disruptive time and amplified it and I think people have woken up past that I think people realize who the culprit is and you could see that in the data too when you look at the data of all of these liberal news outlets they're all in the shitter they're all losing their ad revenue they're all losing their viewers you know that's a statistical fact and statistics tell the story like people like to say oh well there's more to it no not really there isn't it is what it is and when we look at the statistics of you know what the country looked like and what foreign policy looked like in the state of the globe and all these things from 16 to 20 it was one of the greatest times in American history and the reason that there's people out here that are screaming like it was the worst is because the media was pushing these things like me too and you know misogynistic and grabbed them by the pussy and all this shit these mean tweets but everybody had money in their pocket everybody had a good good thing going on there there was not all this legitimate crime happening in the in the inner cities like it is now and I'm not saying there wasn't crime I'm saying it wasn't like it is now we didn't have 20 million immigrants crossing the border you know like let's be real about the way things were you could not like Trump's demeanor it's like having a doctor like a doctor comes in who's the best doctor in the world and he says hey man you got cancer and this is what we're gonna do and he happens to like not be as not have the bedside manner that you think you should have does that mean he's a piece of shit no I'm probably still going to listen to him if he's the best doctor you don't have to be I probably say that guys just a little different you know and we as Americans have to have to get behind that and you know these people who don't like him who continue to vote against him just because they don't like him if we look if we really examine who those people are it's really just two classes of people it's people who don't understand what's going on who live a very comfortable life who usually don't have to work and when I'm talking about legitimately is white upper middle class women that are liberal those people think that they're virtue signaling by hating Trump and then we have people who don't pay taxes who don't have jobs who don't have anything who want to vote Democrat because they believe that somehow they're going to dissolve the wealth of the country and it's going to go to them and we're on the brink of a literal economic collapse and people don't realize that dude we had two and a half trillion dollars of personal savings in this country that has now been drained to zero over the last three and a half years all right we have credit card limits at their all-time highest in history and if credit card limits at their all-time history and savings at their all-time low what do you think happens next what happens in your house when your savings are gone your credit cards are in the max well that's what it's like in the country right now and so people are still you know they're not understanding what can happen here and a lot of people who don't understand economics and don't understand the way businesses work we're very close to not even having small businesses to not even having anything that represents capitalism or America or an American economy we are very very close to that because once there's no customers there's no business I think the there's a I think there's a political theory question that a lot of people are internally fighting with that they don't even realize they are and that's what is the role of a president some people believe that the role of a president is to lead and create policy and enact policy that actually makes a difference there's another population of society that believes that the role of a president is to be a figurehead to represent the country and if you are on the side of we want a president that represents us then I can almost understand why some people may not like Trump because they don't like his personality and they want someone that mimics their personality in their views and values if you want a president that is more operational focused then how can you not like Trump because of the presence we've had he's the only one actually that is competent in that area so I think that's kind of the divide people don't really know what they want in a president anymore because we're told that if you're a Democrat you kind of like that there is a top down system that their machine works for them but it works and the Democrats actually don't invite very much no they're unified right there so if you want to get behind a unified message that almost makes sense to you there's almost safety in that that we're looking out for our party's interest some people just want to follow they don't want to deal with that and when you think about the conservative side and you think about Republicans there is so much infighting and some some people some part of America they're like well they can't figure out themselves they kind of have it together yes it's a little dystopian yes it's a little controlling yes there's a little bit less freedom but at least we don't have to deal with the fighting so I think we also have to understand why people are where they are because it's not always that they don't want America to be America they people just don't like chaos and if you create a bunch of chaos and you say one party has no chaos and one party has a lot of chaos some people's just natural gut reaction is to go towards what they feel is safer well when we look at that and we think about the chaos right the the Republican party may not have as much chaos or may have more chaos in the government but the results of their policies create far less correct and when we look at you know I think a lot of people I think you're completely right too but I think there's also like another aspect I think there's so many people that don't really know what the Democrat party has become they are voting Democrat because they've their parents were Democrat they are told to be Democrats they are they think that the Democrat party is the Democrat part of 20 years ago which it isn't you know if we're being honest the over to Windows shift so much that the right is almost the Democrats of 20 years ago I mean the party of free speech is now the Republican party now Democrat party which is wild yeah right shifted so far left dude that like it is that and I think a lot of people haven't really examined that and then you know when you think about human psychology right it's kind of like picking a sports team you know I'm a Kansas City chiefs fan to my down to the bone how well how are you going to convince that Kansas City chiefs fan to ever be a raiders fan it's pretty hard to do right their life has to get pretty miserable the team has to be pretty bad and that's what we're dealing with we're dealing with a lot of people who build their identity in these things because they are followers they say I'm a this and I'm a that when really their identity should be like it says at the top of your Instagram bio I'm a free thinker and I'm going to side with the people who have the best ideas and that's what I think we're missing a lot of in this country we're identifying with a team instead of saying what is best for the situation that we're currently in I think that's why what you guys do is so amazing because you guys are bringing political issues to an audience that maybe few years ago weren't thinking about these things right because when you thought politics you thought you thought of like really stuffy conversations that people didn't want to have this was not mainstream like hanging outside and having political conversations like you didn't do that I think a big flaw of maybe conservatives growing up is that remember when we're young they said at the dinner table you don't talk politics you don't talk religion right that's how we were all raised yep I think that was a huge mistake because we almost shied away from the idea of having these very difficult conversations having debate having discussion about things that we may not agree with because no one wanted to offend each other while eating dinner but the reality is if we were taught to have these conversations early on then maybe more people would be involved now what do you think that idea came from to not have that conversation I think it was just trying to be polite really I think that's the way more paranoid I think it was a social initiative that they were put into play sign up yeah I really do I mean everything was I think you I'm like I'm because my mind you know I'm an entrepreneur so my mind always goes to what is actually happening here and what's causing it and usually in business there's a couple of layers to that so when I dig into things and I realize I have a tendency to look deeper than most people you know when I look at things like cancel culture and political correctness and you know 10th place trophies and all of these things you know let's shut down the bars during COVID so the people can't have conversations about what's actually going on it just makes me wonder you know if not having discussions about politics or making it painted as rude with some sort of early cultural weapon to where we couldn't discuss these things yeah well I definitely think we are in a culture of a lila people like to call it a mind virus where people are infected where people are shoved into a certain matrix and you're almost locked in your own digital dungeon your own digital ghetto and it's really hard to escape it and some people that believe certain things don't even realize that they were indoctrinated to believe that certain thing and a lot of times if you just show them the crack in that matrix one time then all of a sudden they see more irregularities in the world and I think that's really what we're doing right you're trying to show them that one thing one time and for everyone it's a different thing it's a different issue some people it's racial inequality like wait a second that BLM thing that that was kind of weird some people it's war some people it is whatever some people it's economy right economy yeah there's different triggers and different levers for every single person what they most care about I think that's why it's important to keep on talking about all these different topics because you get them for that one thing all of a sudden like huh that makes sense they've been lying to me right and when you find out for the first time because it's like seeing light for the first time and you've been blind right it's a scary moment actually you know like you had no idea your whole life that everything that you've been told was a lie that the media and the news that you trust for all your information it's been complete propaganda the entire time and when you find out you're like fuck dude what was that for you I for me for sure it was COVID me too the thing me too you know before COVID I just watch the news in yeah I would watch conservative news but I just blindly believed everything after COVID you're like dude it's not just one side that's lying to you they're all lying to you they want you to pick a lane stick in your lane and don't question what our lane is it's like pick a niche and go in it and you're never allowed to escape it because you're controllable they want you to become a data set and they don't like variables they want like known quantities you'd be here you'd be here you guys stick in your lane and we will shuffle you accordingly if you are an outlier if you are a free thinker if you question narratives dude they really don't like that that's what gets you canceled these days you know if you are a I'm a Republican and I will only regurgitate Fox News talking points they'll never come after you now because they know exactly what you're gonna say if you are a flaming liberal and that's all you talk about they will never cancel you if you encourage people like dude what's really going on in the world make your own decision stop listening to them stop listening to them think for yourself if you're that person they will come after you they've been killing those people man they killed those are the ones that get canceled yeah in history man they killed those people they can't kill those people anymore now because there's too much interconnectivity so fuck you guys but yeah dude COVID was that for me too man like when they when it first started coming out in March I'm like no this is bullshit and I could tell and I'm you and I are of the age where we've been through pandemics before and we like a lot of the younger kids they never been through it right and a lot of older people they were able to scare enough to say oh this fuck if I catch this I might be dead so but the people that were like 35 to like 45 who like we were all like oh fuck is this bullshit don't go to the park they filled the skate park with sand they put blocks on the hoop what do we this can't go outside they try to get us off the fucking trail you know we're breaking down the bro the trail in our old age barricades there was this uh there was this like walking trail you could take right they they put this like on you know the orange like construction safety net shit yeah they put that up and it's like I'm the first day we got it down I was just like ripped it down they kept going they kept putting it back up we kept telling it down and then we made it to that that that that like park police guy or whatever it would he didn't want to talk to us because he would roll the window down he would roll his window down I'm like whoa fuck on it dude I think the first six a month first six months of COVID I thought it was bullshit I didn't want to deal with it but I I stayed home I complied yeah and I say that only because not because I believed it not because I was scared there was a part of me it's like man I think it's bullshit what for that one percent chance because every day they're like you're gonna kill grandma if you go outside you're gonna kill grandma you're gonna kill grandma it's so fucked up what they did yeah you're gonna kill grandma and not only gonna kill your grandma you're gonna kill your neighbor's grandma you're gonna kill your cousins grandma you're gonna kill everyone's grandma if you go outside I'm like damn what if that one percent chance that I'm wrong and I'm responsible for killing your grandma and your grandma like that would I couldn't say with that you know so like dude I'm just gonna stay home I'm not gonna deal with it I'm gonna stay away from it and I think that's why I'm even more bitter now because they weaponized your grandparents against you when you have a weaponized your neighbors your friends your family called the cops on their neighbors for having a barbecue you remember when Fauci was on TV telling families did not have their certain family members over for Thanksgiving bro was insane and then he was out there at the baseball game yeah I had on maskless yeah and when in reality they were killing the grandma's yeah no shit yeah that's the real treat like yeah because that was a lot of forcing them to die alone bro so much fucked up dude but the COVID thing it led me down a rabbit hole dude because like here's what I caught myself saying and I even said this on the show I would say stuff like this because it's like you said you're like holy shit that you mean this is all bit of lie yeah you know it's like this so so I would say stuff like this I'd be like yeah man the news isn't like what it used to be used to be they just reported the news and they gave it and then I was like wait a minute have they been doing this the whole time right and then I started looking back in history I'm like holy shit I've been doing this the whole time yeah for a hundred years the aha moment yeah dude and then I got into like the all the crazy shit and like that you know people aren't ready to talk about and I mean it's becoming more and more acceptable dude some of that like they're we all know what people are there yeah like dude it's just fuck it's a lot yeah it's a lot yeah man well guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think uh with that being said let's keep this cruise moving uh let's head and check out some comments all right all right let's cruise some comments uh this first

doing the same so that we can do our part to ensure election integrity that's great that's awesome that's great that's a big deal man i'm telling like listen oh we got to get the good people engaged i got to do it bro i think that one year i might even you know do it this year yeah we'll see because i mean dude it's important you got to get out there yeah good job Jennifer that's awesome yeah sweet well guys we appreciate you we appreciate all the love uh the feedback appreciate you guys for being real-last fans uh stepping set let's keep this cruise moving headline number two uh headline them two reads king Charles the third's blood red portrait it's a stylistic mess do you guys see this that's a crazy picture dude you saw this crazy dude okay crazy dude a wild all right let's dive into it uh oh dear really it could be worse i suppose but i spent a little time looking at images of Jonathan Yo's confused of sequisus oversized and unaccountably frightening portrait of king Charles the third and after trying to like it a critical first responsibility i've realized it's as bad as i first thought i mind you this is like a super liberal guy too by the way um you spend most of your time as an art critic trying to express why you think art is if not great then somewhere in that uh post code falling near the edges is where most of the fun lies a lot of criticism is about border disputes but it's always instructive to reflect on straightforwardly bad art here then uh as a handy example thank you Jonathan Yo thank you kings Charles for commissioning him so here's the here's a clip of the reveal okay uh first of all this is a massive portrait it's a massive portrait this thing's like nine or ten feet tall like it's massive um here's the video of the mumvelling it i don't know where i gotta play i don't know if he was scared of the thing falling or if you got scared because of what he saw wait look i think it's scared bro dude that picture is wild that meaning is wild it's got like like legit satanic undertones and overtones bro so from my understanding that the painter is a known political satire painter did they know that they were gonna do something like this or are they mocking you because the globalist elite love to mock you and humiliate you right to your face right are they purposely commissioning this type of painting with blood in the background to show and signal that you know like we know what we do and we don't care um i mean it's about that time isn't it dude like just they haven't been hiding anything for a while they don't have everything is in plain sight i mean just that's the thing you got cloud shwab writing books and covid-19 the great reset in 2020 right and people are like oh that's conspirator what do you do it's a book you can buy the shit on amazon yeah he talks about what they're doing you know like so many people are to me i don't understand what the resistance is here like why why are we still calling these things conspiracy or we like acting like this is no we have a group of globalist people in the world economic form and other organizations who are straight up communists who are working to create a one-world government and they're shoving it right in your face and you guys continue to call it conspiracy right what is that i don't know man this there's a lot of stuff about this i think you're correct on that that's what i think too i think people just have a natural inclination for fear of the unknown and if you actually were to know that there is a concerted organized agenda to change human race forever like a lot of people aren't ready for that yeah i think even though they consider and think about those ideas they they don't want to think about it because that means everything they believed in a life like we talked about would have been a lie and bro like imagine imagine an entire world of people finding out the truth yeah how do you even deal with that how do you even put that together well i mean i think you want that do you really want everyone to find out the truth at the same time i do because here's why we're in that called create chaos yeah but out of chaos comes order and that's what they say you know what i'm saying so i actually look at it that's their slogan you know out of chaos comes order and it works for us too and i think if everybody were to have a full disclosure of what's actually going on yes there would be some panic but after a short amount of time of panic these people would be held accountable and we would be able to open up the future for something that is real and something that is truly free and not this tax slavery system that we live in here in the united states and these manufactured wars for economic reasons and all of this tyranny that is disguised as freedom would end and we'd enter an age of actual freedom at least for the next few generations until they forget again right and i think this is one of the key times in in history where a revolution is going to be required at some sort i believe it's a cultural revolution that's happening right now we see the tides turning on the internet we see the tides turning in culture we see those tides and they are not just going to allow that to happen without violence there will be violence at some point in this transition period but i do believe that if people were to wake up and realize that the the people doing these things are in such a small number that we could run them over in five minutes we could open up the future to a brand new set of possibilities that would benefit humans in a much more favorable way that have never existed before i mean i see all of these kind of protests going on at the same time and example if you started at BLM which was everyone hit the streets and maybe the energy was a little bit misguided but at its core it was a pushback against establishment maybe just the energy was in the wrong place but there was people frustrated with the covid frustrated with what's going on they just needed a cause and maybe the people that are in charge weaponized that cause but at the core of the movement where people that were really upset with the establishment where things were done even if you watched the pro-Palestine protests maybe a little bit misguided but there are people that are frustrated the way things are done frustrated with existing establishment and they're pushing back i'm seeing this trend on tiktok and instagram of people blocking and unfollowing celebrities i love that i do too they are taking power away from celebrity it's a pushback against establishment media that's been pushed to them that say you have to love these people like no we don't even the trump mega movement are people that are reacting to corrupt government and like hey this guy at least hears us this guy at least understands that this is how we feel and trump is a societal reaction to the corrupt politician politicians if all of these organizations and all these movements and all these protests were to realize that we're not actually fighting one another but actually we're all fighting the same war we just don't realize it yet well this is why they call trump hitler this is why they call trump hitler because hitler was a result of this same kind of shit in society in the 1930s the removal of morals the uh propping up of you know basically immorality as a as a whole you know mother daughter prostitution child prostitution the first sec changes in history nobody talks about you know they talk about oh they burn books but they don't talk about what books got burnt and what books got burnt in the 30s were the same books that people are trying to get pulled out of libraries now history is simply repeating itself and the truth is and i'm not saying like other people will say that it's the Jews it is not the Jews there's a whole bunch of Jewish people that are against this shit too just like there was back then all right but there is a group of very powerful criminals who are happen to be mostly Jewish who are pushing this agenda that everybody's resisting against you know the the border crisis all of this shit is manufactured by these guys at the world economic forum and if we go look at what they belong to it is what it fuck it is and until we can address the truth of the situation we're not going to be able to solve what's going on and so you know I think a lot of people should really talk more about what the problem really is in that scenario because it's they want you to say it's the Jews that's what they want they want people to get so pissed off and say it's the fucking Jews because that's the way that they hide that's their protection mechanism all right it's no different than saying all of Palestinians are fucking terrorists that's not true either right all of black people are criminals that's not true these are all generalizations they want people to buy into for the fact of division so when people notice what's going on and they say oh it's the fucking Jews what they don't realize is that they're playing right into the the defense mechanism of these elite people and there is a group at the top of the food chain who have all the money all the power all the control they do run Hollywood they do run the media they do run the government and these people hide behind anti-Semitism as their defense so when we say it's the Jews in general we basically buy right into their ability to defend themselves and say you're an anti-Semite you're an anti-Semite you're this you're that look what happened in the Holocaust they killed 50 gazillion of us right like this is this is what they do and so we have to be very careful and and people like why do they call Trump Hitler because Trump is a reaction of society just like Hitler was back then and you know do I think Trump's gonna come in and exterminate people no I don't think anybody thinks that but I do think they think he's gonna come up clean shit up so what do you think about that conversation you've done a few you've talked about this about the drill and Paul yeah they're I mean look it's what people's talking about right now they're obviously there's a group of people that control the world they also happen to be heavily in one type of people and group of people for sure I don't think anyone can debate that there is plenty of infographs and data to show that that's true I don't think all Jewish people are bad actually I love a lot of Jewish people say I think they're very smart in general very good at business and to say that people call that anti-Semitic too like if I'm gonna if I need a lawyer and I'm in a lot of deep shit and I need the best of the best I'm calling a Jewish lawyer yeah I want to go back that's amazing that means you had success in your life and as a people you've done very well people don't like to hear that too people don't like generalizations but yet you know if I go and I'm doing playing pick up basketball and I have I can pick from anybody I want and there's one black guy and one white guy and I don't know if any of them can ball I'm picking the black guy it is what is and we're in a math competition probably you'll pick me that's right that's just how life works and sometimes you're right sometimes you're wrong but I think that's fine you know I think we people get so upset that you generalize people but stereotypes exist for a reason it doesn't mean it's bad yeah you know and dude I I could tell you from experience it's just the truth I know a shit ton of Jewish people none of them are with this shit they're all like fuck these guys they don't like it either and they also don't like the fact that they're lumped into this shit right you know I'm saying so here's a hypothetical question I was just thinking about so if you were picking a team all right to commit a crime I'm getting a little jj there's our lawyer shit yeah I'm just over here eating my baloney bro I think it's important that we start identifying these people by their names let's make a fucking list who is it here's the top 300 motherfucker's doing this that's what we need and that's the hardest part right yeah if we're at war with a global elite that are making decisions playing God with our lives how do you fight an enemy if you don't know who the enemy is well that's the point of their defense mechanism and they want people to say it's the Jews and then they don't get called out by name right so why don't we just call them out by name here's the top 500 people destroying the fucking earth this is the list hey if they're in your neighborhood handle them like bro that's a real point to the two men because like you know and I feel like I've said this on the show before right but you go back to like 2001 right you look you look at 9-11 post 9-11 that was the most united this country was why it's because we had a common enemy right and it may not be the right enemy but it's the one that they gave us we had a face we had a name in a location we were the most united because we had a common enemy right and so I think to your point and he like it's important we need a list like let's let's make let's make it let's make it and put it out as soon as you start writing that list and start writing other names that's when it gets really dangerous yeah and that's the scary part of it and I'm gonna call Goldblurt yeah because then they start telling they are they start saying you have an intent to act right yeah and that's where you get into the problem people people on the internet are like why don't you organize a rep I'm like do you know what happens the minute I fucking say that right like they kill you yeah they put you in prison forever and you become a misogynist you become a rapist you become everything that they throw at you yeah because as soon as you have momentum as soon as you have people building behind you they they do it to everyone it's you know it's it's interesting people keep talking about the revolution you know like dude well first of all we we need a cultural revolution first we need to understand what what builds a successful strong independent populous and that is what we talk about on this show all the time it's personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion don't be out of shape get your money right and consume the right kind of info be good to each other don't hate each other work together do everything to take the power away from them that you possibly can that has to happen we can't just see either in America anymore and kind of ride the bus down the road and say oh we're free to do what we want no we are supposedly free but freedom has to be exercised for it to exist and the only way for it to be exercise as if we go out and do that in our individual lives but then we talk about the revolution part of it you know the the revolution everybody wants to have happen but can't run they can't run 50 meters down the street right and you know I was thinking about this if I were to write a movie about a revolution right hypothetically I was going to write a movie about it you know a lot of people think that movie would go like millions of people storming Washington DC but I actually think that that movie would go like you handle them in your local neighborhoods wherever they are across the country you know that would be the movie simultaneously yeah like an omnipresent revolution you know kind of everywhere at once yeah you know that would be more fun seems like it would be pretty easy to do if we were writing a movie about it yeah you know a good movie I think I think we are in a digital war not an analog war therefore that a revolution won't actually be physical anymore I don't think war is physical anymore I think the what you see as far as war it's like if you remember October 7th the image that they showed you and they talked about constantly to validate that it happened was that they had paragliders flying all right paragliders were able to infiltrate the iron dome I don't know how that makes sense but that's what happened up supposedly allegedly if you want to tell the world that you rich that you've made it what do you do you go to Miami you rent a Lamborghini you take a picture and you put it in a screen but like look I made it you have the war is digital and you show the media and you show the footage and show the picture to validate the actual war going on analog war is messy you have death you have guns it's unpredictable you have to clean it up like it's not actually we it's not actually viable in the big in the big sphere of things military have weapons that they can deploy without ever having to shoot guns at each other it's so anal it's so digital at this point I think the real world the real war in this war in this world is digital I think it's for our minds and I think the more and more people wake up and the more that their programming doesn't work any longer I think they lose their power because they can't control people in an analog fashion there if everyone turned off the internet how would they ever convince you of anything how would they ever tell you what to do they can't there's no way for them to physically do it what they do send people on horses to come after you right if you're able to turn off and control what you consume who you consume and if you're able to call out the bullshit on the people that are trying to propaganda is you and try to control your minds I think we would be free I think we have to free our minds first and then everything else follows I agree with that to you I never really thought about as deeply as that that's an interesting point because the truth is is once they lose their power these people just go away they become noisy and annoying nuisance they are not physically to leave their castles to come and force you yeah that's right yeah and especially in America where we have all the guns yeah they're not we're thinking to start drone drone missiles striking like citizens like they'll never happen that'd be crazy yeah well they're playing the war that you're describing by things like when they deleted your shit or like how they got me right now which they're not going to keep me down but I'm just saying you know that's the game they're playing that's the game yeah we are in a clicks and views economy the even the politicians even at the higher levels of society they are deathly scared of the internet they're deathly scared of influence if you start building up picking up too much momentum if you start gathering too much people behind you that's who they shut down oh that's like what they did to take that's exactly what they did because you know I was out in Romania I spent four hours talking to him and he is number one extremely smart he is not radical at all he's a professional so common sense he just has the ability to say things in a certain way that really reach the hearts and minds of young people and once they realize that because he was a societal reaction to COVID that's exactly what he was right 2020 happened 2021 all of a sudden this guy is talking common sense talking right in your face talking in a way that young men can relate to because they were most young men especially three four years ago they were raised on participation trophies for the first time of their life so it was like get off your ass and do something and at first like holy shit because men like direction especially when you're young you push back authority but you also respected right and for the first time they're seeing it and they're mobilizing and people are getting his shape and people are understanding and thinking for themselves and questioning the major narratives in the world and they're like dude get paid off the internet yeah because same thing happened to him it happened at the same time oh yeah he lost his discord he lost his YouTube he lost his intersting in a fucking day there's a button yeah these people have a button it's sitting on their desk they get lists of people that you should be out actually it's funny because well what the it's what happens is the FBI the three-letter agencies fucking message these people through the they're running basically liaison program from the White House through the three-letter agencies to these social platforms and literally handing them lists of people to take out and that all came out with the Twitter files you saw that well have you seen the YouTube and Facebook files that were just released on May first no so they really the congress released the Facebook files and basically they have all the emails from the Biden administration telling Facebook and now it's meta Facebook to remove certain people to censor certain posts and I'm talking about specific posts specific videos they're like why the fuck is this video still trending why didn't have you not removed it and Facebook goes dude they didn't violate the terms and conditions your terms and conditions are working make it better so they are literally telling that's coming to shit people realize that communism is here they are sending lists of people okay here are the top 10 trending videos about the covid vaccine why are they still trending they email saying how come Biden pulled at poachess account is losing followers and Facebook goes like dude we don't know why something's maybe something's wrong reality is your Biden is just unlikeable and people don't want to follow him like why are they he's losing followers why what's wrong with this account and when Facebook said we can't we're working on it we'll figure it out the very next day Biden goes on the news and he says Facebook is killing people with misinformation they didn't like the response that Facebook gave to them they didn't like that they didn't act and act quickly enough so he goes on news and he says Facebook is killing people that's insane you can't do that that is literally overreach of your power authority and that is manipulating what people see think here the scary thing is is it's setting a precedent yeah it's setting a total they've broken all these these laws and all these customs and all of these things that we've had in this country forever and what's scary is and I don't think they realize this but what's scary like Trump's been pointing this out if you listen to him he's pointing it out he keeps saying president if president doesn't have immunity then no president has immunity and the left is all like well who cares we're going to get him anyway not realizing what he's actually saying and what he's actually saying is if you do this shit to me I'm gonna fucking bury you when I get back in power and he's gonna I think I think I hope I think he'll try yeah I really wish he had I really wish those more unity in the party I know we don't agree a lot with all the Republican party has to say but this is not the time to invite yeah you know this is not the time to go after each other this is not the time to be removing speaker to the house yeah to try to remove other like this is not the time to do it I don't think so no I don't think so either but I also think the reason they act that way is because a lot of the guys to say the Republicans aren't actually Republicans I think they've run under the a public Republican flag but they're actually part of the establishment that infiltrates the entire government I think you know we like we I think we both agree on this we have establishment Republicans and then we have what they call mega Republicans what I would call pro freedom Republicans America first you're right exactly the and that's that's where the split is the split is between the America first and the establishment people and so you know when we have like when we have guys like Lindsey Graham like that guy's not a fucking Republican no more more more more more more more yeah he's disgusting he looks he's the most disgusting looking greasy politician I've ever seen in my life like when he smiles as teeth are all rotten and shit like he's just like when I think of a dirty politician I think of him or I think a new sum yeah those are the two guys that come to my mind it's like it's a very stereotypical look like when you watch old movies of like greasy politicians like I'm pretty sure they were all Lindsey Graham like it was actually him he's probably been alive for like a thousand years probably yeah most likely we got jumping on these conversations down in the comments let us know what you guys think now that being said our third and final headline headline number three uh hell on them three reads uh NFL says they do not agree with Harrison Bucker after he voices Christian values you guys catch this you'll see this it's a big deal uh so chiefs kicker Harrison Bucker delivered a powerful address espousing Christian values to a group of graduates at Bendicting College on Saturday now the NFL is saying they disagree with Bucker in this commencement speech uh the Bucker blasted president Joe Biden for his pro abortion stances urged male grads who embrace masculinity and championed the virtues of motherhood by telling female graduates there's no higher calling than being a homemaker on Wednesday in a statement to people uh NFL senior vice president and chief diversity and inclusion officer Jonathan Bean clarified that Bucker's values are not the NFLs here is a uh about a minute and a half clip um of Harrison's uh commencement speech at Bendicting College bad policies and poor leadership have negatively impacted major life issues things like abortion IVF surrogacy euthanasia as well as a growing support for degenerate cultural values and media all stem from the pervasiveness of disorder our own nation is led by a man who publicly and proudly proclaims his Catholic faith but at the same time is delusional enough to make the sign of the cross during a pro abortion rally he has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that i'm sure to many people it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro choice he is not alone from the man behind the covid lockdowns to the people pushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of america they all have a glaring thing in common they are Catholic this is an important reminder that being Catholic alone doesn't cut it these are the sorts of things we are told in polite society to not bring up you know the difficult and unpleasant things but if we are going to be men and women for this time in history we need to stop pretending that the church of nice is a winning proposition we must always speak and act in charity but never mistake charity for cowardice it is safe to say that over the past few years i've gained quite the reputation for speaking my mind i never envisioned myself nor wanted to have this sort of a platform but god has given it to me so i have no other choice but to embrace it and preach more hard truths about accepting your lane and staying in it yeah and i mean you know and he goes on like that he talks about you know women's you know place in the household and how you know it's these are important things and nothing like oh you didn't say anything about sandwiches did he no i mean but i mean you know i'm just saying but uh but no i wasn't like uh you don't know you have to do this you know but just generally speaking of you know his christian faith at a christian college um you know i thought that was awesome yeah the statement uh continues uh from the diversity equity inclusion guy uh for the NFL quote heroson bucker gave a speech in his personal capacity being wrote his views are not those of the NFL as an organization the NFL is steadfast and our commitment to inclusion which only makes one which only makes our league stronger stronger you know it was interesting because i'm on so they're inclusive of other things but not that right and it made me think it got me thinking Andy i'm like well you know what else has you know you would think would be like a personal view thing that the NFL has taken over you know it just got me thinking right like i mean like what else out there have they done you know on people's you know personal beliefs and they have kind of like you know brought in under their own umbrella as a marketing campaign as a marketing campaign and you know it just got me thinking and i'm like no you know they've never done anything like that before yeah if you're not watching the show he's putting up pictures of George Floyd on the back of people's helmets Brianna Taylor who was a fucking drug dealer on the back of people's helmets uh picture of uh Colin Kaepernick you know what i'm saying like that's never happened that was never a thing right right but like i mean here's a guy expressing this personal you know religious beliefs at a religious college and it's not it's they don't include that in their inclusive views you know it doesn't really sound that inclusive to me now it gets a little it gets even interesting how that term inclusive works right like it's basically means like no white Christian people that's what the fucking means it means no white dudes and no fucking Christians that's what it means yeah like that you all want to wonder why I fuck people like need don't get with that shit because it means everybody but you right right for it would be or you who is a black man who has different views than what you're supposed to have right you know that you probably learned on that computer you don't know how to run exactly you know yeah and it gets even more fucked up man this is the story so apparently uh the Kansas City chiefs they retweeted a post from Kansas City officials with a page they doxed this guy they tried to dox Harrison Bucker who did the chiefs the chiefs and the city of Kansas now I'm reads Kansas City deletes tweet disowning chiefs Harrison Bucker is backlash intensified so there was a tweet from the official Kansas City account okay um and then the Kansas City chiefs retweeted it this is the original tweet because nothing is ever deleted off the internet guys um just a remind quote just a reminder that Harrison Bucker lives in the city of Lee summit they tried to dox this man that is wild I feel like they have some sort of legal records there though dude here's what I see this is what I see when I see that I see here's what I think I think that a lot of these teams and organizations and we see this with like local newspapers here they've got like a 20 year old social we 22 year old far left view social media person who's typing in this shit and these people are not realizing because they've had the power for so long they've had the cancel culture on their side for so long that they have not realized that they have lost that and it has flipped over and when I say when they say the backlash I'm pretty sure what they mean on the backlash is backlash from people supporting Harrison Bucker 100% yeah one there's been a lot of that which is why they deleted these people are stupid as fuck they don't realize that their time in the sun is over they don't realize that the narrative is switched the pendulum is swung and the more you act crazy you're going to be on the receiving end of the shit you did to us for the last 10 15 years since social media was actually a thing since social media started bro if you didn't have progressive viewpoints or liberal viewpoints they attacked the shit out of you and when we saw with the Twitter files was that Twitter was made up of more than 50% bots 50% bots and you wonder how they control the narrative well it's very simple when somebody makes a post who's a celebrity that they is it is in line with their viewpoints they send the bots the traffic goes up the comments go up everybody thinks oh well that's what's in so I'm going to get in line with that right and then when someone like Matt or myself we post something that they don't like they shut it down you don't get any traffic you don't get any likes you don't get any comments and then people are like oh that must be the minority flavor right now but the truth of the matter is the pendulum is completely swung and these people are so used to getting their way and they're so used to bullying that they're still trying to do it and it's not working they have gotten it's going to be dangerous for them soon if they keep pushing on this like these people are going to learn because like this ain't no bots these people out here that disagree with you these are real fucking people this isn't bots anymore when we were out there doing it there was no real harm you know many times I've been canceled you know what you fuck food you know many times we count this hundreds of times okay not a single fucking time to never affect my business not a single time not a single time you know why because it's all bots but here's the thing do you know why like bloodlust 20 billion dollars in cap because when they got canceled that was real people and that's the thing you guys lived you progressive fucks lived in this fake cancel culture where you thought you had power and reality the powers completely on the other side right now and they're going to learn it the hard way yeah I mean until the point I mean it was the backlash on this was so bad when this tweet went out and then you know subsequently delete it that even the mayor of Kansas City had to make a statement he tweeted out quote a message appeared earlier this evening from a city public account the message was clearly an appropriate for public account the city has correctly apologized for the air will review account access and ensure nothing like it is shared in the future from public channels yeah so what happened is exactly what I said we fucked up or it's the same guy that's tweeted both yeah you know but you tweeted out like oh fuck I'm in trouble yeah go the other guys account that you're also managing yeah that was a mistake this doesn't work yeah could be could be I love it man I love and listen I like Harrison man like you know it's not like you're listening like at the end of the day and this is this is this is a message to progressive levels right the end of the day I don't care what you believe but I actually believe it let's stand up for it like it can actually be convicted in their belief no exactly why you believe something right like no that's the key that's the key no why you believe it don't just believe it like how many times have we seen these interviews on the streets where they go up like especially these women they say do you need a man no do you need a man no do you need a man no and then they'll be like what about this and they'll be like I gotta go right right right like you think these people cannot back up it like if you cannot back up why you believe what you believe you do not even believe it you've been taught you've been indoctrinated you're repeating talking points like you should be able to explain why you believe that and if you can't you can't be taken seriously that's my thing you know and so I got like Harrison Bucket right I mean like it's not like he's a fucking you know he's a kicker on the trees he's done a great time it's great he's awesome kicker but then today that's what he believes and you can tell he believes it and he knows what he believes and he can offend what he believes you know I'm saying it's like to attack this guy it's not like I mean he's that a he's that a Christian Catholic school man like given like they invited him there is obviously they invited him for a reason that he didn't get no booze from the crowd you know I'm saying it's what's like like people just losing their mind man and the power is gone on all of this shit so they can all fuck off I agree what do you think that well I'm a free speech there's two things are my two tenants in life that are non-negotiables number one family is the most important thing in your life number two is that the government has no right or place to tell us how to live our lives and within that category would be I'm a free speech absolutist because the government should not dictate what we speak about or think about these are our thoughts our words were a lot of think free speech only works if you hear something you don't agree with that's only what you know what right so anytime someone gets pushed down for something that they say I'm against it even if it's something I disagree with because I think you have to let all ideas out and only then do you get their truly great ideas I love what he said I don't agree with everything he said but I don't think he should be taken out did the NFL punishment or did they just speak out that's also different I think that's a time of the recording there hasn't been any any backlash yet or any negative consequences at the time of the record yeah but the fact that they even dress it yeah it's weird it's just like why why are you addressing it not only that I mean it also just continues to show you bro like how far off based these people are because dude like who watches NFL these are majority I mean dude the country's majority Christian is a majority you know I'm saying like who are your actual supporters bro you know I'm saying to come out to make a statement saying that you don't support Christian values okay I'm sure there's some marketing there's some strategic I think the NFL's an anomaly in that regard I think the NFL's product is so good that people don't give a shit and they've got to wait look dude nobody's gonna stop watching football everybody says it every year I'm not fucking watching the NFL but they still fucking watch okay I'm watching the Taylor Swift pull but everyone watched it right exactly so like dude until people start doing what they say they're gonna do it's not gonna change for this because their products so good yeah like where where can you get that level of entertainment you love football I love football really off two new TTIs on two days no I'm just saying dude like they're not like the NFL is an anomaly in their ability to get away with pushing this far left shit because people will just ignore it to watch the actual players play okay but when it comes to like other areas where their product isn't as good like for example when Antis or Bush did that shit with Bud Light and they put whatever that thing's name is on the fucking can Dylan Mulvaney they've got a $20 billion hit because people said well Bud Light's alright but I'll drink this instead you can't there's no alternative product for the NFL so like they get away with this shit and Roger Gidell and all the executives they're sitting there and they're saying well it's not really hurting us and we're in line with that and you know what it endears us to the biggest companies in the world and the biggest donors in the world and the you know we're doing what we're supposed to do we're in line with the BlackRock financial agenda right we're in line with the world economic forum agenda no we're doing our part and so he can go say face with the world's richest most powerful people and it doesn't really affect this product but that's not the case in most companies because most companies have a product that is interchangeable at some level it's a commodity at some level yeah the other NFL football is not a commodity yeah right so if you have a let's say you know for example a beat like I just said a beer if you have a beer that promotes this shit it isn't gonna fucking sell and if you have a beer that promotes freedom in America and 1980s you know I think that'll sell very well you know and so I think that they're a little insulated from the backlash because the people that that show up they don't really give a shit about any of that stuff they just want to watch the game right hmm it's good point man it's not making the players play any less no just look a little game but I think it's weird don't you think it's weird that they feel like they have to make a statement about it I feel like it shows that they live in a certain level of fear I feel like it shows that we're actually winning because this is not something that they have to react to this this is not something that they need to put a public response on like it would have just disappeared they're so scared of being canceled by each whatever side and right now liberals kind of own a good portion of the internet they're so scared of being canceled by them that they feel like they have to react I think if anything this shows that the movement of pushback against existing establishment is working and that we're actually gaining ground because this is so trivial this is not something that they needed to react to yeah but they did it's almost reactionary right like a knee jerk reaction again they didn't have to react this one they could have just ignored it completely and it would have never been a headline how do you think this went like they're just sitting in the office and somebody runs up who's like dude we're gonna lose everything you see what Harrison Buckter said we gotta do something about this right probably someone clipped it put it on Reddit somewhere red Reddit is where the armpit of all liberals live and I think they're solid maybe a few people start commenting on it they're like oh man this could become a big thing let's get ahead of it while we put out a statement they're scared yeah they're running scared is what it is people love Reddit because they don't have to be accountable that's why they love it like a complete end on the md yeah I mean why do they cancel people off of every platform and every platform is at risk TikTok is dangerous for society and this court is dangerous and telegram is dangerous and Instagram is dangerous and Twitter is dangerous but Reddit they get a free pass every single time and if anything if you look at the history of every single mass shooter we've had in the last three years they've had a Reddit manifesto they've all been indoctrinated on Reddit yeah but no one ever talks about Reddit no one ever talks about the fields that goes through there because that is a really toxic place yeah everyone to know look up Ashley Babid look up Ashley Babid Threads on Reddit the amount of negative comments that are just absolutely disgusting it's unlimited but yet that shit that people would never say in real life too and no one ever talks about the negative impact they're ready because it is a CI sign up for their side they're perpetuating information that is dangerous society but it's aligns with their vision so they don't touch their own yeah guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think with that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is what we bring a headline in we talk about it it'll get one of those two options so with that being said our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads terrifying moment family comes face to face with Kougar caught on camera and we ain't talking
