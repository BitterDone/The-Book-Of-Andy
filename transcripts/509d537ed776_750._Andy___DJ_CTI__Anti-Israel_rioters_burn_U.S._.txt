that's good it's funny so I know you I know who your favorite college football team is right yeah Texas long horns right but there was another option right that you were interested in Notre Dame yeah right I still I know I still like Notre Dame yeah it's a great team yeah great playing each other I root for Texas but other than that I like both the team yeah Notre Dame's great team man and you know they're not Oregon is known for the for the uniforms but Notre Dame apparently is getting lit right now why destroyed before their new uniforms wait they changed their uniforms they got some new uniforms come on man and they're getting fucking blasted online you can't that's one of the iconic uniforms of sports you can't change it and if you do change it it's gotta be good it's gotta be fucking great no bro you ruin in tradition this is stupid I can no matter what it is it's gonna be bad you think so yeah all right yeah so so let's dive into this I thought this was cool because like I said I know you like your fan of Notre Dame and uh let's let's check this out so Notre Dame is getting cooked for its uniforms for the team Shamrock series series game this season the fighting Irish will take the field November 23rd in the Bronx at Yankee Stadium for a showdown against army and prayers up to anyone's eyes that manages to see the game Notre Dame Shamrock series uniform feature blinding gold numbers that are beyond ugly bordering on offensive take a look below for yourself so this is their post uh that they put out um saying it's in the details and uh these are some this is the Shamrock series uniform now I'll be honest that's not terrible it's not that bad it's for one game and it's for one game okay and on top of it that's not terrible it's not that bad it's not that bad I mean look bro Oregon goes out in plays and uniforms that look like shit every single game of the year and nobody says it's cool when they do it yeah it's a problem when I do it but yeah I don't think there were too bad like people were talking about how like the numbers like you're not gonna be able to see him or some shit nah that ain't too bad I thought one game I think those are actually kind of cool they don't look too bad yeah I agree I don't look too bad now if they went that way full time I would definitely have some things to say yeah because I mean you can I like their green uniforms and you ever seen a green shirts those are freaking sick I like the ones they do like their old school where they paid the the homage back to like their original uniform like shit like those are fire yeah um you know I don't know but like no this is bullshit I think it's fine it's not that bad but they get they're getting blasted I mean it's all over there okay I will say this too you know because here's the thing everybody that's blasting them none of them actually have to wear the uniform yeah I also think it's important the players they always vote on this shit like that's what they voted for that's what they wanted I think I actually think they're kind of good dude yeah they got like a raised they're like raised numbers are embossed or whatever you want to call them and they're playing army like it's a series game like yeah yeah that's cool I like it I think the gold numbers are a little reflective or something though yeah whatever yeah it's better than a bunch of fucking rainbow shit yeah like most of these fucking teams do no no that shit on the uniform that shit out of here rainbow shit yeah tell you another thing back in my day but not be none of that uh that uh you know that stuff they put on them them jazzy yeah that stuff yeah yeah none of that dark stuff none of that dark meat stuff white meat only yeah yeah we got we gotta keep it pure I think it's fine that's fine guys that's what you guys think I thought they were fine I know that's that's way better than I thought they're gonna be I thought it was gonna be way worse yeah I'm like it's right everybody's upset about that's all right that's okay no idea all right well shut the fuck up that's what it is man that's what it is but uh but let's get into this cruise guys remember if you want to see any of these articles pictures links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find them all links there for you uh with that being said let's get right into it headline number one uh gotta talk about it something big is happening in DC right now it's been happening over the last 24 hours um so let's let's address it um headland of one reads anti-Israel writers burn us flag attempt to breach capital police line as netanyahu addresses congress um so this was interesting uh this was definitely interesting uh there's a lot of weird stuff happening with this um a lot of interesting people talking about this and the things are saying it's interesting but yes so anti-Israel writers burned the us flag flaunted blood red paint soaked effigies and even attempted to breach the us capital police line in Washington DC on Wednesday as Israeli prime minister Benjamin netanyahu address congress the hateful demonstration got so out of control that capital police were forced to deploy pepper spray and other defensive measures to beat back the aggressive mob the writers also tore down american flags flying outside of nearby union station before hoisting Palestinian flags up the polls and burning the stars and stripes here's a video yeah so that's somebody I was trying to save the flag you got a piece of it try to take the american flag that was burning yeah what a piece of shit trying to take the american flag that was burning yeah 100% but later that night speaker a bunch of house Republicans uh they actually went back out to the flag poll that they uh they they took the american flag back down from and they replaced it with a brand new american flag that night uh here's a clip of that so that is video of late last evening on what turned out to be one hell of a rockest day in Washington DC a hoisting in american flag torn down by anti-azero protesters earlier that day now how speaker mike johnson was there last night he's with us today and sir thank you for your time and thank you for coming back here to our program um what did that moment mean to you it was an important moment i mean i think it's appropriate for the elected representatives of the people i was gathered there uh with uh patriots and veterans who served our country in the military representative branded Williams of uh New York had the idea to go out there and put the american flag back in its rightful place we cannot allow the pro-terrorist mobs to win they're trying to intimidate Jewish people and all those who support israel and we will not stand for it so it was a proud moment for us yeah but see that's that's where you'll lost me yeah this um you know this is about america this isn't about Jewish people that flag does not represent israel that flag represents everybody here in america dude look man it's yeah you got more it's fine it's stupid i got i got a few things um but yeah so and then you got you got uh vp come queen she reacts to the to the violence happening in DC finally we're starting to get some type of denouncing of this crazy shit and again i don't care which way it goes crazy shit's crazy shit um but she released a statement um on twitter uh that she put out saying yesterday at union station in washington dc we saw despicable acts of unpatriotic protesters and dangerous hate fueled rhetoric i condemned any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization homos which is vowed to annihilate the state of israel and kill Jews pro-Mosc graffiti and rhetoric is a current and we must not tolerate it in our nation i condemn the burning of the american flag that flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation that represents the promise of america it should never be desecrated in that way i support the rights of peacefully protest but let's be clear anti-symmetism hate and violence of any kind have no place in our nation um and the the same on here why is america the third paragraph that should be the first fucking thing you should have said right there's no room in this country for that um condemning the burning of the america flash in the first part of your statement right like it's just it's just goes along the same rhetoric now here's what's interesting what about that what about when uh 2020 was coming around and blm was writing a nace and she was on tv saying they're never gonna stop they're never gonna stop do you have that no okay yeah she was on it's never gonna stop it's not gonna stop post the election look this is radical she is a radical communist who is now playing the part of normalcy to attract the independent voter back to the democrat side so they have pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed on this far left bullshit that we're all sick of and she was voted the most left senator in the united states which by the way they went back and deleted off the internet so right now what she's doing is she's trying to appear to be reasonable and quote unquote normal so that they can attract voters that have been disenfranchised from the democrat party that are now looking at trump possibly back to them as an option now 100 percent there's evidence of that because the thing is well with that too it's like but i believe that's exactly what her mission is but i don't believe they have enough of their other democrat you know counterparts on the same page because you got people like a keem jeffries uh he's saying that none of those protesters were left wing at all or they're not left wing and maybe not no more but they definitely were what do you what do you mean he's saying that that like the protesters that were burning the flags and stuff they were not we weren't in progressives who were they that's a good question man because no they were there's video of the people listen there's video of them being bust in first of all and they ran a cell phone device search and hundreds not a few hundreds of those same people that were there yesterday were also at Kamala speech in uh west constant i believe it was the day before so they took these people directly from west bust them to dc for net and yahoo to be here and then turn them loose and told them to go do shit yeah it's ridiculous man and bro um you know how are you going to say that they're not the left wing when you know the right wing and by the way i don't agree with this either um but most of those guys are sucking Israel off right now okay so like i don't agree with that either no no and it's hard to say that they're not your people when you got people like Rashida to leave uh during net and yahoo speech you know pushing this narrative here so it's like yeah but oh but Jeffery's didn't see that yeah he didn't he quote i didn't see the activity of her she didn't come on man look bro these people are total liars they have no problem lying they have no problem gas lying they have no problem saying i didn't say that when there's they know there's video evidence of them saying you had kgps today on uh her presser saying that she did not think that uh you know basically that there was no cover up for Joe Biden this whole time right when there clearly was these people went from Joe Biden is fine to Joe Biden's terrible to oh look we got come on in like a week right there listen these people don't care about you and me and they don't care about our country they care about maintaining control and power and they don't give a fuck if they lie to you or cheat you just because you have good heart and good beliefs and good ethics and uh you know a moral standard that you live by or a code they don't have that you gotta understand this they don't have and when you assume that someone who is in a position to hurt you has the same moral code as you because you're a good person that's a rest of people you get killed all right so we have to recognize what's actually going on and who these people really are and what game is actually being played and what's being played right now is that Joe Biden was a corpse everybody knew it and now they're trying to paint Kamala as some sort of savior when in reality she's been a part of this destruction she was the quote unquote and is the border czar and now they're trying to say that never was the case like Bernstein Bayer yes like bro for the last four years do you not remember who are going to Mexico early on and saying do not come do not come oh they came yeah right and they all fucking and and dude and there's not a border crisis that's misinformation that's a lie look dude these people don't have the same morals or the same code of ethics that you and most people have especially the democrats because i feel like democrats for the most part vote on their heart and their emotion and what they believe to be right sort of an idealistic viewpoint the way things should be and they ignore the way things are because they're voting on emotion and i don't think these people they vote that way or bad people i just think they don't understand that these other people who tell you all these things exist evil people exist liars exist manipulators exist gaslighters exist and their entire party has been hijacked by people who are those people and who do not represent what we would call traditional democratic values whatsoever these are legit far left communists that you know they're trying to sell you on and and you shouldn't be so you know so stupid to fall for it yeah yeah so he had his uh he uh some men yahu he did his address to congress yesterday and then today he uh he met with biden um and uh that was a really interesting exchange here um that i would love to get your take on andy um because net and yahu opens up with a very weird opening very weird opening so you met you met with uh midbiden thursday afternoon um and he opens up their meeting by saying quote from a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist i want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of israel 50 years of support to a mara Irish what huh yeah that's a very interesting thing to start a meeting off with why calling calling the sitting president of america Zionist well he says he's a Zionist he says it openly he's been asked that he says that hmm what google scientist what's to say Zionism is an ethno cultural nationalist movement that emerged in europe in the late 19th century and aimed for the establishment of a Jewish state through the colonization of land outside of europe so a Zionist would be somebody that is in support of that okay so you're so so you it's come to it's it that's that is the technical definition are you in support of the state of israel yes or no but that is evolved into a definition now where do you support the state of israel above all other states right and that's yes and that's where the problem is okay and we shouldn't have anybody in our government that supports any other government more than they support the one that we have in fact we should have nobody in our government that it contains dual citizenship of any other country in the world that's not what this is about this is our country this is the United States for america we have the right to to have people represent us that are from us that are our people without having to worry does their loyalty lie with another country it does their loyalty lie with us and this is why I say there should be no dual citizens in our government when in fact there are a shit ton of them and guess what country they're from no yeah it's it's it's interesting um stop provoking it's lovely uh the other part of this two men is like you know comula you know i'm starting to become more and more aware of like she is playing a very key and very central part in this whole communist push that I had definitely missed for the last couple you like I have not I just haven't been that aware because they've been keeping her in a closet for the last four years right but uh this guy by the name Chad Prather um watch Chad uh he put he make this compilation this video compilation man and and it's it's definitely I open it man let's check this out it has to be about a goal of saying everybody should end up in the same place and since we didn't start in the same place some folks might need more equitable distribution giving resources based on equity understanding that we we fight for equality but we also need to fight for equity understanding not everyone starts out at the same place so there's a big difference between equality and equity equality suggest often everybody should get the same thing well that often assumes everybody started out in the same place as opposed to equity which is everyone should end up in the same place and if you then understand not everybody started out in the same place you understand some people need more so we all end up in the same place right no we are proud of the fact that equity is one of our right guiding principles proud of the fact that we understand equality is important but not everybody starts out on the same base we see that people in our country are having an experience that is not equal so when we talk about the work we are doing here together it is recognizing that and being guided by this principle of what we must do in the spirit and in the interest of equity to put equity firmly at the center that's that's common as shit 100% bro why do you think they want all these people to come over here they are trying to throw the balance of the population between the doers and the not doers between the creators and the consumers between the workers and the people who do not work they want as many people in this country unemployed they want as many people in this country not seeking work they want as many people in this country pissed off about the differences between those who produce and those don't because if they have more of those people then they get to maintain power on that message you see what I'm saying that's what this is about she is saying these things in terms of what it's going to do for her they are pandering to a the larger population base which is what they've intended to create so that they can maintain control and power and there's a whole book about this called Atlas Shrugged I've mentioned in a number of times that you all should read because this never works out because what ends up happening is the people who are the producers it becomes so burdensome for them to produce and so unprofitable for them to produce that they don't produce they start just producing from themselves and then everybody else starts okay that's where we end up in what she's talking about that's what she means when she says the same place we yeah we'll end up in this place yeah it will be mass poverty and then they control us that's the point that's happened over and over and over and over again in history and this woman her father was a Marxist professor what she's talking about are Marxist policies and ideas that have never worked and have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of millions of people that philosophy that she's talking about in those clips has killed more people than any war than any pandemic than anything else combined okay because it does not work and it throws the balance of power so far on to the ruling class that the rest of the people are helpless and dude what is the saying about about power corrupting yeah absolute power corrupts absolutely that's right and that's what happens and she's in that game right now and so what they're trying to do is mask this fact that she actually believes that now remember she grew up with that ideology she believes that shit 100% they're trying to mask that right now and make her seem like she's the reasonable normal choice that's why she's on there saying you shouldn't burn American flex where was she saying that in 2020 right how many times does she say in 2020 not to burn American flex not a single time okay how many times does she condemned any of the unrest that's happened over the last four years these four yesterday no zero it's never happened so why all the sudden now well the reason all the sudden now is because everybody's so tired of this ridiculous shit that a lot of their quote unquote base which I would consider good-hearted people who have identify themselves as Democrats over the last 30 40 years right and you know if you're a young person you grew up in one of these houses you think you're a Democrat those people who say I'm a Democrat but then think of being a Democrat like 30 40 years ago like their parents those people have all left the party they understand what's going on is wrong and they have switched and they have said you know what this is going to kill our entire country it's killing me it's killing my household we're not able to make living the way that we need to and I'm going to vote for Trump and so what they're trying to do right now is they're trying to frame her as the reasonable option hoping that Donald Trump's attempted assassination will spark radicalism on that side so that they will look crazy and these people will look normal that's the game they're trying to play yeah it's so crazy and I've been seeing more stuff about you know her her background and like you know that she's an Indian Jamaican you know hybrid humane society thing or something's happening there but it's funny because this this clip comes out check check this out Kamala Harris you are not getting any vote from the Indian community specifically because you do not talk like this you are have Indian and I've never seen you eat chicken dick masala Kamala Harris have you even seen Om Shanti Om do you even know how to say hello in Hindi it is kyawa by the way but don't use that in your speech I have not seen you wear a sorry once in your life Donald Trump will get the Indian vote however do you know who runs all of Trump's IT software that is correct Indians we run all the tech support on truth social Kamala I don't ever want you using your half Indianness ever again we revoke your Indian access you are not allowed to Uber from any Indian restaurant ever again Indians shame Kamala had it shame well no it's like yeah Indian delegation to spoke that's right the Indians have spoken it is crazy now I mean like in listen like on a serious note though I mean we still have to understand that there is still a image of America that is being projected right now and it is it is weaker than it was two weeks ago much weaker yeah and people will take advantage of that did you see the stuff that's happening right now off the coast of Alaska yeah man right we got two Russian bombers and two Chinese bombers flew into Alaska air defense yeah like and and again like I mean when you have a country that's in the state that we are in politically right like like our political stature in the world is weakest fuck right well do you know why that happened do you know the backstory here so we we flew a B-52 a couple B-52s into the airspace last week they didn't get reported on the news and they landed in Romania that's okay yeah yeah and so then they their response was to send you know the four bombers into Alaska airspace which then we sent two F-16s and F-35 and then two Canada F-18s and basically told them to get the fuck out and they did yeah quickly yeah it's funny but they they they out Russian media laughed at us for that and then they actually posted the video of them doing it did you see have you seen the clip yeah I saw the clip but I mean they turned around right away and went home I don't know what they're bragging about oh I mean I mean they're flying a hundred yards away from them so they're flying a hundred by the way look how shitty their bombers are compared to it looks really old yeah it's a B-50 like you fuck you motherfuckers once so I'm come get it okay you might think we're weak right now because all they show on TV is a bunch of rainbow weirdos I'm gonna tell you right now we'll fuck you up period we will fuck you up to the worst extent possible so bring whatever to fuck you think you need to bring and we'll see what happens with your old ass shit I'm just saying yeah see bro I need to be president that's exactly what I've gotten to be and say yeah yeah yeah yeah God fuckers fly those pieces shit over here again I'm making a point that make you understand why you shouldn't have such pieces shit you know what I'm saying yeah fucking idiots dude it's crazy man it's crazy guys well we're real close to to a conflict dude I mean it's it's note it's no joke and you know those of you who have children and I'm gonna say this too because this is a point of contention that I've noticed over the last few days first of all they're inflating the polls for her did you did you see the ridiculous you see how they how they're fudging the donations bro they're bait yeah I mean dude there's nothing new that donation number that they did they're wandering money through through fucking act blue is what's happening um but anyhow you know those of you with children I'm just gonna say this because I see a lot of women saying you know I'm gonna vote for Kamala because we need a woman president and to you I would say this if you're married and your husband has a job and his job is to go out and make money and take care of your kids you better understand that by voting for her you're making his job almost impossible okay you you can there's a lot of people on the right wing that are unpalatable they're unpalatable to me I can't fucking stand them like these people who like we could joke and we could say shit right like you know and tell jokes but like there's people over there on the far right that are just as nasty as the far left and women need to understand real real talk here like I'm talking to the brunch girls that don't really know they're not really informed and they want to just vote for a woman because it's a woman and it's exciting you are killing your your own family and your own sense and your own ability to progress to have progress because of how hard it will affect the economy and in four more years you you think Biden was bad it'll be a hundred times worse so I would just I just want I just want people to understand that like if you vote because of someone skin color or because of someone's gender you are falling into their trap to put in someone who's going to greatly harm this country greatly harm your household you think your household is more difficult now wait until they got her in there and it gets a hundred times worse and so dude like you know those women like because I've heard this dude like my wife's voting for Kamala I'm voting for Trump bro your wife's intentionally destroying your family and a lot of women need to really understand this they need to really understand because dude the truth is there's still a lot of households that are in the middle class where these women that we make fun of a lot that go to brunch and with the pinkies up and shit these women don't necessarily are not the breadwinners of their household okay and you're putting your husband or your significant other in a very difficult spot where they're not going to be able to fucking make as much money or survive the way that they could under a you know a traditional capitalist me healthy economy that Trump has proven that he understands and dude it's very very dangerous and I think women especially need to really really really think about it and on top of that you know do you really want this to be the woman that becomes president and represents all of you guys because I'm gonna tell you dude I know a hundred women off the top my head that are better than her okay and if she goes in there and totally destroys it dude they'll never be another woman president again never happen no it'll set it'll set the whole women's rights movement back fucking 200 years because what'll happen is at the end of this four years when the country's totally fucked every single dude in the world is going to be saying women should need be able to vote women shouldn't even be able to fucking do this like it's gonna set that backwards by putting this woman into office yeah dude and people people don't want to talk about that because it's a mean conversation to have quote unquote mean but like bro that's what's gonna end up happening you're gonna get somebody who's so radical in power they're gonna say dude women can vote look at the fuck I did yeah that's right yeah man and it's very dangerous dude yeah not like for those brunches I vote for her that means less brunches for you so well yeah times are gonna get harder but they're gonna be real listen they're gonna get way harder and you know I think I don't think that she's taken the way that they're portraying her to be to be accepted right now because like as much as they're hyping her up on media like I saw her little campaign the other day dude there was like 400 people there there was nobody there and then on top of it it wasn't even 400 it was probably 200 and then on top of it they're they're you know they're trying to paint this picture it's just not accurate bro like what if they you do you want four more years of what you just had an accelerated pace yes or no because if you do vote for her if you want you to get better you got to vote the other way no guard regardless of what you think of the man running and this is like an emotional thing right like most people will totally fuck their lives up by making emotional decisions right like if you make an emotional decisions about almost anything it ends up bad people say what about falling in love well that's that's an emotional decision and that person might not be the best partner for you which is why the majority of people to get married and up into forces you know when people quit their jobs because they're pissed off usually they regret it right because it was a highly emotional decision and they're gonna pull this play that I talked about a few shows ago where they're gonna put her in she's the the polls aren't gonna move the way they want them to move and then they're gonna sub in they're gonna sub in Michelle big big that's what I think and I think I think we're you know they talked about oh well she already has all the delegates they're gonna try to force her in you understand like they're expediting it I know they're trying to do a virtual confirmation so that like the the actual DNC doesn't even matter at all and how does that represent the voters will well they're trying to say it's because you know there's an August 7th deadline for the state of Ohio right that's the first deadline that they have to get the official nominee on the ballot and so they're rushing this in saying that oh well you know but y'all set the date for August 19th why didn't y'all set it for you know I'm saying to actually respect the process how it's supposed to be so they're trying to rush this shit because they have until August 7th they don't get the official nominee on the ballot for the state of Ohio by August 7th there will be no democratic nominee on the ballot let's not forget this they were counting on Trump's head exploding on national TV completely which means they would have two candidates neither of which anyone voted for right to become president of the United States and you

tube to stay up to date with the latest episodes uh so you don't miss those with that being said let's keep this cruise moving we got headline number two head on up to reach FBI director questions whether Trump was struck by bullet as ex-presence team decries conspiracy bullshit did you see this fucking guy oh bro what happened oh bro the FBI director the hey of the FBI made the stunning assertion Wednesday that former president Donald Trump may not have been struck by an actual bullet when a deranged government attempted to assassinate him at a political rally and was instead injured by shrapnel shrapnel from hitting what bro I had people who believed that he had a catcher packet this fucking bro okay and these these are people that are like on the on the right like yeah you got it listen you got to be a certain level of stupid I think there's so much conspiracy and so much misinformation I mean I think people I think it's very very difficult for people to take things at surface value because we've been so conditioned to look under the surface that it's hard for us to recognize what is actually real and what is conspiracy nonsense bullshit and the conspiracy about the Trump shooting is not whether or not he was shot it was who did it right and it certainly wasn't some 19 year old or 20 year old soy boy pussy who was acting alone who got within 130 yards of Donald Trump that's not happening that doesn't happen okay and that's why there was so much you know gatekeeping and and blocking from the the lady who was in charge of the secret service and why there hasn't been any information come out I believe that this wall come out and we will find out that it was members of our own government it was exactly who we think would want Donald Trump assassinated who is behind it and I think those people are panicking I think this is the I think this is the first move that has happened in a long long time that didn't go the way they thought it was going to go because we what we see right after immense panic oh miss me right I mean that's the thing and like people got like my take on this man is that you have to understand what like look at the timeline of events right and so what I believe is is that they were completely sold that Donald Trump on July 13th would be that would be no more I agree right in the hey we talking about the head of this mega party whatever they want to call it the leader of whatever they want to call this would no longer be existing right a week before that you got them putting and setting off these these stock trades 15 million right where they would have stood to make anywhere from 700 to almost a billion 700 even a week before that it was days before days before right but like that's when they they started trickling them in there and they's flooded it two days before right where they would have stood to make anywhere from 700 million to a billion dollars just off the death alone yeah okay so you look at that you have you have that which is double the size of the fund that actually shorted the stock correct the fund is only a billion dollars correct which is a small fund very small okay so they would have doubled their their fund size off of this short had Donald Trump and killed how do you die just just off of that and Blackrock and Vanguard are the two funds that own that fucking fund majority ownership okay and then there was a there was a clip going around that said Larry think maybe Trump's treasury secretary and he came out and say that's complete bullshit so all of you guys saying oh he's in with all those goods no the fuck he isn't no you know but so so you look at that you look at this the stock and this is just me like just looking at the timeline of things right assassination attempt assassination happens on that Saturday right by a Sunday they probably would have announced his official death right and then come Monday everybody's okay well what the fuck like you know come by Wednesday it would have been complete chaos what happened Thursday crowd strike blackouts right that was that was intentional I agree like that was like that was supposed to be the head that was supposed to be the full shutdown right but because Donald Trump did not die they had to pull the plug on that which they did I believe it was like that Saturday evening a week later I'm going into Monday you're saying you're saying that you're saying it would have been way worse that would have been permanent yes it would have been weeks or months what did no when no fucking internet what did it affect flights nobody could move so you're stuck in these cut can get their money out can get your money out yeah so instead they they what you're saying is they pulled the plug on the total shutdown and it was too late for them to stop the entire thing because it was all planned ahead of time I already put in place and they utilized that shutdown to erase evidence whatever who was responsible for this all right turn to this turn that was the plan all along the plan was it raised evidence of who did it right then we blame it on Iran we go to war with Iran right and then we say magga guys they killed your hero let you not as Americans and let's go get them and their plan was that all of us quote unquote deplorables would say yeah kill them there took a lot of it and then we would go over there and fight another fucking war with another generation of our strongest men and get them fucking killed so that we could relieve ourselves again of the exact people who were most likely to rebel against this nonsense you know and then thing is it's like you know but that did Trump Trump survive right which means that there was no mass chaos and all of these you gotta understand this because this is the important part all of these questions all of all of these questions that we're asking right now all this information we're seeking for had Trump died we would have not had the opportunity to ask because we would have been in chaos right but because it didn't happen we have the opportunity to ask there's those questions that we need answers to and there is stuff that just does not make sense right like you know the three explosive devices they have its entire search history is entire search history and they were able to conclude that with about seven days before so one week before the rally is when he concocted this plan to do this and so you're telling me and there's no evidence of any search history about how to make explosives how to make these pipe bombs how to do any of this stuff and so one week before all of a sudden he grabs this knowledge to make three explosive devices with remote detonation by himself it makes absolutely no sense these are all the points I just want to lay this out there's all the points that they want us to believe this is their narrative that they want us to believe that he flew a drone or that they want us to believe that he did all of these things without any type of help right okay let's read through them I read them yeah fluid drone over the Pennsylvania fairgrounds and got aerial footage of the rally layout on the day of the event including two hours before Trump took the stage point two got a rangefinder through security point three they did law enforcement officers from several different state local and federal agencies point four somehow climbed up on the roof with his rifle 450 feet away from Trump bear crawl to the perfect vantage point as bystanders alerted police and was still able to take eight shots at Trump next point parked a vehicle full of explosives near the Trump rally even though there is no online search history of crooks researching how to make at home explosives next point crooks was able to walk around the premises after snipers took a photo of him looking suspicious next point a sniper located in the second story window which was only 40 feet away from crooks and didn't neutralize him next point Trump was still able to take the stage after crooks was pegged as suspicious by secret service he did all that about all by himself even though he was on a bike he was also on a bike during that you know and then you add in this this other part that's coming to fruition out which I've been like waiting on to put in because I wanted to make sure that was legit there this there there is someone's phone somebody's cell phone someone's mobile data has been tracked to regularly visit Thomas crooks home and also visit another building which is directly down the street it's next door it's the next building over okay it's not down the street it's not close to it is the next building over from an FBI office so you're going to tell me this dude did all of that alone and then on top of it there was a person who visited his home several times to the days leading up to the assassination who also frequented the building right next door to the FBI office seems perfectly normal he must have done it on his own yeah completely normal man who's on is it and by the way it's you know it's normal how they reacted right it's normal how you know we're not we haven't had a single press conference about it like with details we haven't had Trump come out say much was his interesting why doesn't Trump come out in like detailed this you know he's kind of chilling under the covers and my take on that is that Trump knows exactly what's going on and it's being handled in the background okay so yeah um which dude if you want to put on the tinfoil hat you go to the song that he played after the convention at the RNC when they were leaving the convention he played an opera song did we cover that on show he played an opera song that is actually uh was used in the movie um from back like in the 90s with Ben Afflack and Morgan Freeman uh what's the movie called it's uh some of all fears some of all fears it's a great movie and in the end of the movie okay it's some of all fears it's the movie is about an assassination attempt on the president and at the end of the movie the all the people who conspired to kill the president are all being retaliated and getting killed like car bombs assassinations all these things right and they're playing that song okay so Trump just happens to play a song at the end of his RNC that's that is the same song that's played in a movie about assassinating a president when the bad guys are getting their justice behind the scenes that that seems like he might know what's going on you see what I'm saying that's deep that's deep I think he knows exactly what's going on and I think there's a lot going on in the background here that we're not hearing about or knowing about that will potentially come to light soon um yeah that's what I think dude no but I'm only kind of to that though man and like I'm cool I'm cool with that I want to know I think I want to know too don't don't just kill these fucks off in the background I want to know listen we deserve to live in a open free society where we know the truth about everything we should not be held as a lower level citizen that is too dumb to understand that is fed the excuse over and over and over again of classified information this is our fucking country we pay the taxes here this is this country exists for us not them they exist to serve us so what right do they have to keep any information from us about anything we need someone that goes up there and says all right this is going to be tough for all you swallow but here's what's been going on here's the truth all right this this this this and this and until that happens we're going to have to sit out here and try to play games trying to figure out what's going on which is what they want they do not want us to be able to pinpoint what the truth is because by not knowing the truth it creates division which helps them we get to argue over what's true you better wear the mask because if you don't wear a mask you're a grandma killer bro the mask doesn't work fuck you no fuck you that's what they want it was a catch-up package right exactly yeah well and and they want us doing that on everything they want us doing that about you know covid they want us doing that about the election politics race gender all this shit they they do not want peace and understanding and clarity because it does not serve them okay we deserve that because we are the ones that have built this country off of the backs of our fucking tax dollars and our family sacrifices all right how do we not deserve to know what's going on well people in our families have died for this country and they're not going to tell us the truth that's bullshit all right and we need some real leaders to go up there and fight for this like I said the other day I'm tired of these people coming in and saying oh we we really let them have it we ask them a lot of questions no what comes of that right this is getting old you know all these people going up there and saying oh we fucking grill them no one cares we want to see accountability we want to see some action we want to know some shit yeah bro and we need full declassification of all information if we are ever going to trust our government again it is a required it's required otherwise they'll never be trust ever again I won't trust them ever again no no guys jumping on this conversation let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that being said let's get to our third and final headline headline number three headline number three reads mr. Beast breaks silence on former co-host Ava Chris Tyson's grooming allegations I am disgusted yeah mr. Beast all right so let's let's check it on this because this is not granted this is new this is developing there's a lot of interesting things happening here let's try to collect some some connect some dots here so youtube star mr. Beast everybody knows him uh it's probably the most famous influencer on youtube that's where he started on the planet yeah yes fucking chocolate bars question I mean he's crushed it it's killed it yeah totally redid the entire game in terms of content creation 100% icon yeah at 25 years old super young super young but he has broken his silence on the allegations of grooming and minor minor against this former co-host Ava Chris Tyson Tyson who's 28 this week announced that she's quitting the popular channel after she's not a she yes I listen that's not my language okay I know but it's a heat I mean you know I'm not I'm not playing that that's a dude that's a dude Chris Tyson this week announced that he's quitting the popular channel we're not playing that game I'm ready I'm not playing the game ever I'm down ever now with it um but yeah so you see we announced that uh and and it was hold on I want to say something about that you cannot play their language game you cannot play their language game communism is all about language control you cannot play the game they will shame you and say you're being unkind and unfair it's the truth the truth has to be said the way the truth is I'm not trying to offend this person I'm not trying to make them feel bad I'm speaking the truth because if they make me audit what I know is the truth that I am compromising my integrity my confidence my belief in myself which lowers my ability to think for myself okay this whole we're gonna use the language that shit is not happening here it's not happening with me don't ever fucking expect me to do it because I'm not doing it I will never compromise what I know to be true for someone else's fucking feelings it's not gonna happen it's a real shit man um but yeah so it came out after he was accused of sending inappropriate messages to a then 13 year old uh when he was 20 okay um so this this uh boy is now 21 now um so in turn mr. B's whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson uh said that he would no longer be working with Tyson and reveal that he is uh hired a third party to conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations so this was his full statement I said quote over the last few days I've become aware of the serious allegations of avatisans behavior online and I am disgusted and opposed to such unacceptable acts during that time I've been focused on hiring an independent third party to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure I have all the facts that said I've seen enough online from taking immediate action to remove avatisans from the company my channel and any association with mr. B's I do not condone or support any of the inappropriate actions I will allow the independent investigators to the necessary time to conduct a comprehensive investigation and we'll take any further actions based on their findings and with that he released another video um um that's fucked up that's fucked up come on man all right sorry come on um but here's a weird thing man so here's the thing so the the 13 year old or then 13 year old that they uh you know that was the inappropriate messages were alleged um it goes by the name of lava um they released a statement he released a statement saying that quote these videos are massive lies and twisting the truth ava never did anything wrong and just made a few edgy jokes i was never exploited or taken advantage of can you do me a favor and comment on these videos and tell them to stop spreading lies this situation takes away from children who are actively being exploited on every day online i am not a victim of anything being claimed in these videos or at all um to which uh on twitter he's been these are some of the responses um one saying you've been groomed man you're a victim you don't have to protect these people another person replied saying that's called grooming you're not supposed to feel like it was wrong um another person put put this out there saying show us on this teddy bear where christis and touched you um you know and like listen like do i believe that that christis and actually did some weird stuff i don't know well the i don't know if you have this in the story but there was a number of other people who were actually coming out and said that he had done that shit with them yeah that's what i'm saying like so while the main person in question here is saying no it was just other people that came out but and we have to say this dude when you're famous and you're rich people lie okay so we we i think i think mr. beast jimmy is doing the right thing by hiring an independent uh investigation i just think he needs to stay out of it and let it be what it's going to be uh because this is a dicey situation for him and that brand that he's built which incredible yeah but it mainly you know children are his biggest fan base it's a massive family yeah and uh you know you can't have any of this shit a thousand miles around you if children is going to be a big part of your audience so um you know how i see this it you know i don't really know much about mr. beast i've got some friends that are friends with them and shit and they all like them and you know they say he's brilliant um but he's also very young and he lacks experience of being that famous i mean who the fuck could prepare you for that i know i'm not even one tenth as famous as this motherfucker is now and i know how people behave about you know they start seeing things and then they whether it's true or not they see ways to take you down uh their jealous or they want some money and you know people lie dude i get people that lie about me every mother fucking day every day they fucking lie and you know what i've learned to do is just stay away from those situations ever i mean this is really why i stay home most of the time and um you know i there was videos coming out that said mr that mr. beast knew about all this shit you got this video some other he knew about it there's you know now and like and here's the thing man when there's blood in the water shots shit's gonna come out right yeah and and and like you know some of the stuff you can write off some of it yeah it's it's questionable you know i'm saying and like and i will also say this too we are in a day and age where you know we we we we we just so easily question the you know that phone call that Biden had with the campaign office yeah you can't you don't know if it's true or if it's AI like we get an audio clip that comes out of the woodwork you know years later and that's guaranteed fucking real yeah and so it's so i've seen AI audio clips of me and i have a very distinct voice yeah yeah yeah and and it was i i had to ask one of our guys i'm like hey where the fuck is this clip yeah and they're like no that's AI i'm like i don't remember saying that we're like you didn't say that yeah it's insane yeah you know so like we we the my point is is that like we have to be very very careful with what we jump on to believe one way or the other that's all i'm saying um but yeah so like there's a video uh you know one of the the things that have come out is that apparently a video resurfaces of mr. beast making sexual comments about then 14-year-old bad barbie the girl was like cashmiao side how about that um days after the co-host avicris thyson has been accused of being a child predator here's a clip and he did say that he um enjoys the cashmiao side girl i think she's funny so let's just so yeah so that just shows what just let's do something you want to put your I mean that's it's probably not enjoying and enjoying someone putting your foot in someone as a whole there's a story yeah yeah yeah i'm gonna try to get these aids she's like 14 years old try his aids already well i was saying i've you guys seen that on one video uh my wife actually showed it to me because she saw there is one video of like it was on her channel i don't know if it's a vlog or something but it was like her producer or manager or something was like add up on fire with her and uh he's like grabbed her boob and she's like 14 right yeah like he like grabbed her boob and like at first it looks like he's just like like holding his hand on honor chest i which no i don't know why you do that and uh they turn around and his hand just stays on her boob and as they walk it's just like grasping your boob he's like 30 years old it's like why is no one saying anything about this it's a 30 year old man just groping a 14 year old girl but you get like that like underground weird hip hop culture i feel like that acceptable you know definitely do like that is acceptable no it's under his hands as long as there's no I mean what's age anyways right i'm just saying i know i think she's 14 the two big to the 14 she seems older than i don't think she's real yeah so he's the one that made the comment about i don't think she's 14 those boobs are way too big well hello was she when she was on dr. Phil because that's what made her famous yeah i think that was probably like 16 or 17 double check that 13 oh yeah oh shit well i didn't sound too good yeah no no you know but again like there's AI i need more proof i need more fucking you know i'm saying she's just go one way or the other man look man when you're in the public bro everything you say gets twisted and never in your favor always against them um which is what part of the reason why i just say whatever the fuck i want because and i stand by it like it is what the fuck it is i think different than you are said something different than you if you're gonna talk for 10 hours a week on a fucking microphone you're gonna say some shit sometimes um i don't think this is a good look for him i don't think having that person around is a good look for him i think we have to admit that there is a real situation with pedophiles becoming trans women in reality okay there is a lot of men who are pedophiles who become trans women and then try to use that to get closer to children in a lot of different ways and uh it appears that this is just another case of that we see this with the drag queens having to go and shake their ass and their ball sacks in front of little kids a drag queen story how can we never see women pretending to be men trans men doing that same thing right it's always men doing it and they're always around children and the question isn't why are they allowed to do it it's why do they want to do it why do these grown men when addressed up as women and then be around and have an audience with children why the answer is very obvious okay so we the trans community which i do believe there's a lot of uh trans people that just choose to live a different way and i don't think that's a i don't in in my opinion if you're gonna be trans i'm gonna open mind a person okay what whether you think that or not i'm very close minded to tyranny and i'm not some extreme right weirdo if someone wants to live their life and not bother anyone and beat treated normal i think that's an acceptable expectation in the United States of America but when you start doing goofy ass shit like dancing around people's kids or trying to shower in women's locker rooms and see women naked and you've got an fully exposed penis with a hard dick like we talked about when Riley gains was on the show and all this shit that is predatory nasty shit that cannot be tolerated okay if you're gonna be a trans woman and you're actually a man you should be using the men's restroom and if dudes look at you weird tough shit you chose to be that okay i don't say that it's right but you know i mean dude that's consequences for your action listen bro listen dude and there's no consequence listen bro you have to you we cannot i mean it's getting him in trouble right now hopefully you learned his lesson you know because you eat a lot of these people are mentally fucked bro and they're mentally fucked around the topic of sex yeah it's a fetish okay it's not a it's not a uh you know i was born in the wrong body it's grown men who have a fetish for cross dressing which is existed for fucking thousands of years okay who have now taken it from just cross dressing to actually like having surgeries and transitioning and a lot of these people are mentally ill don't you left two kids in a life that's right and if you if you are someone you black hold on you didn't have any great great just saying bro if you allow these people around you and import you're gonna have to understand that there's probably a lot of secret shit they're doing they have no fucking idea about yeah and i will say this and i'm gonna give credit here the trans community is pissed about this because they said that this will set the trans community back hundreds a hundred and i agree that it will and this is why i said do you remember that clip that went mega viral for me like a hundred million views like a couple years ago where i said that we never see trans women we never see men are women trying to be men doing this shit it's always men trying to be women right when i said that a couple years ago you know a lot of people got upset but now it's becoming more and more and more and more and more prevalent and it's becoming more and more and more and more obvious and if you're gonna have one of these people in a key role around you you have to understand there's very likely some goofy shit going on all right so i hope you learned his lesson dude and like i commister b seems like he's doing a good enough dude bro like you know like he's done all kinds of shit for people he you know a couple of us talking about it listen man aside from his personal success he he you know he's done a lot of really good things and i just hope that he gets you know a little bit more discerning around about who he allows to be around him and dude we get pressured into allowing these people around us right like if you don't allow them around me you're a bigot and then we're starting to be like we start to feel like sorry for him we're like no you know it's cool yeah like i got you dude like even though you're different because dude i i'm of the of the opinion that like you know i try to be extra kind of people that are different you know when i got stabbed in the face bro my fucking face was swelled up the size of grapefruit for over a year and everybody looked at me like i was some sort of deformed person that changed me in that way so now when i see people that have differences i go out of my way to make them feel more comfortable and i think a lot of people do that because they have good hearts but a lot of these people that are in this scenario here these are mentally ill sexual predators who are pretending to be a victim class which they are not and people feel sorry and they say oh you should we'll take care of you because they're good people and these people you're protecting are not good bro you're not a good person if you're messaging a 12 year old fucking child when you're in your fucking 20s dude period there's nothing it's not a mistake you have no business talking to him um and that's that dude i just you know i think having i i don't even go so far say this i think having trans women or men who are dressed up as women around you is a liability i think it's a liability because it's been so it's been so sexualized at such a scale and so accepted that now we have people saying minor attracted people and shit that no that's not gonna fly bro and and if you're associating with that and protecting that you're gonna be lumped in with them all right so like dude understand what i'm saying i actually believe that the women who are trying to be men are fucking pretty normal they're just trying to be men you don't see them out they're doing this weird shit with kids you know but i'm saying men that are trying to be women you need to be really fucking careful about that's real man yes real guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck this is what we bring our headline and we talk about it to get one of those two options um there's always some weird shit happened in in India India and Florida like
