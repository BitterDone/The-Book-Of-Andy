We have Q and AF that's where you submit the cues and we give you the AFs. Now you can submit your questions one of a few different ways. The first way is guys email those questions in to ask Andy at Andy for Stella.com or if you go on YouTube and you click subscribe and drop a comment in there on our Q and AF episodes which drop on Mondays you can ask your question in the comments and we'll pick some from there as well. Other times we have CTI that comes out on Tuesdays and Fridays that stands for cruise the internet that's where we put topics up on the screen we speculate on what's true and what's not true and we talk about how we the people need to be the solution to these problems going on in the world. Other times we have real talk real talk is just five to twenty minutes of me giving you some real talk. Other times full length full length is what you see when you watch most other podcasts we bring in a guest we have a conversation and then we have seventy five hard verses, seventy five hard verses when we bring someone in who has completed the seventy five hard program we talk about how they were before how they are now and how you can use a seventy five hard program which is the initial phase of live hard program to recalibrate your entire life. So you can get that program for free as well as the live hard program for free in episode two oh eight of the audio feed okay it's not on YouTube because we just started YouTube this year consistently and maybe we'll drop that episode proactively eventually but I'm not sure anyway it's for free right now on episode two oh eight and if you want to buy the book the book is at Andy for seller dot com it's unnecessary all the info is in the podcast for free but if you're somebody that wants to know in depth information like I am the book is very useful so you can check that out as well. Now we do have this thing on the show called the fee the fee means in exchange for me giving you valuable information about how to become successful better based on my twenty four years twenty four actually twenty five years here in January of business experience that I give to you for free I ask very simply that you share the show all right we're constantly being shadow bam we're constantly being fucked with and if you don't share the show the information doesn't get out so I make a deal with you I don't take ads for the show and I ask you to share the show I think that's pretty fair you guys go listen to everybody else to show you got fifty fucking minutes of ads it's a bunch of bullshit and then the reason those people can't speak out is because they have to bow down to the people paying them well guess what I don't have to bow down anybody so I say whatever the fuck I want in exchange for that I ask you to share the show so we have this little saying it goes like this don't be a hoe show the show all right so what's up man what's going on man oh not much yeah we're talking about how fucking stupid something new movies are yeah we're just like the new ghost busters it just comparing it to like you know yeah two fifteen years what was that movie you were just showing there that was scream no that wasn't scream that was scream is the real movie that was the scary movie yeah both on the yeah we're laughing our ass off a doofy yeah doofy some of my fingers what is that my ass die guys eighty question number one eighty your message of personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion has become a new mission for me in my life but I need some some direction as all of those areas you talk about in my life need improvement so do you have recommendations on which to tackle first right like what's the priority physical fitness first then financial independence then overall mindset I notice my life looks like shit I just don't know what to start okay well first of all we have to recognize that being personally excellent by no means means that you have to be like this perfect human being all right there's this like I was reading the comments of the of the day in the live show and like they were very favorable right yeah but I almost started to get the feeling like you all think I'm some kind of perfect motherfucker like let me tell you something bro I struggle every fucking day this shit is hard as fuck okay different areas different areas and over the course of my life in every area of my life I've made mistakes okay and I fucked up my life over and over and over again all right and this is called living a life because there's really only two ways you can learn over the course of your life and one is by learning from other people's mistakes and the other is making your own mistakes and learning from them and so if you're making mistakes in your life and you find yourself in a place where you know you're not happy with who you are and what you've been doing you have to realize that that's normal and that's okay that doesn't mean you're a piece of shit but if you do nothing about it and you become aware of it and then you choose to do nothing moving forward that makes you a piece of shit all right so like if this guy here like if you look around at your life and you're like fuck he's right I do need to fix my stuff and then you choose to continue to go now then you start to become a piece of shit and what you'll notice is is that you never really feel bad about how you're living your life until you become aware that you're not living up to your own true potential and you're not actually trying to achieve it and then you become aware right except that yeah and then when you keep doing the old habits then yourself esteem and your confidence everything is driven into the dirt because you're aware that you're doing the things that are wrong so understand that this is not about perfection this is about learning and moving forward and continuously becoming more and more and more aware so that we can continue to evolve so don't beat yourself up but just understand like it's time to do something about it all right secondly where do we start well listen everything that we have in our life starts from our mind it starts from from where we are with our mind and then goes into our physical and then our mind and our physical lead to creating reality outside of that so when you say okay my whole life is in disarray my mental game is messed up my physical is shit my finances are poor blah blah blah we have to arrange those into a hierarchy of things to address right so when things flow from our brain to our body to the world where would you say that we start start to bring right we start with our brain okay and this is the purpose of the live hard and 75 hard program all right a lot of people call it a challenge a lot of people think it's fitness is not that it is an actual program that is designed for you it's a tool for you to use to recalibrate your brain to create awareness around the conversations that you have inside of your brain that either tell you to actually follow through with things or to pass on things that you know that you should follow through when we call those things the bitch voice and the boss voice all right and the bitch voice is the voice that you hear when you get home from work and you know you're supposed to train because you told yourself you're going to work out and you're like fuck I'm tired and and then it starts in with this well hey look you had a hard day you worked really hard you did all these things you know let's take it easy tonight let's order a pizza and for sure we'll start back tomorrow and the reason that this voice is so bad and so damaging to us is because it happens again the next day and then it happens again the next day and then it happens again the next day and sooner or later when we're telling ourselves we're going to address all these things the natural response as a human being is to kind of go hog wild when they don't hit the first day right so like let's say you promised yourself let's today's a Monday and let's just say you promised yourself today today was going to be the day that you started and you're listening to this at eight o'clock at night and you're sitting there and you're like fuck I really want a pizza right and so instead of like just ordering the pizza right what ends up happening is you're like well fuck I'm starting again tomorrow so I'm going to order the pizza and the fries and the wings and the ice cream and I'm going to get it all in and then tomorrow I'm going to start right but what happens is you don't end up starting tomorrow and tomorrow you tell yourself the same story and so then this process repeats and this is how you end up at 300 400 500 pounds with a total dissatisfied life right so becoming aware of the voice that tells us what to do in our brain is super important and then we follow that by developing the skill set we need to listen to the voice in our actions in reality and that's discipline grit fortitude the ability to endure the ability to persevere all of these things that we call an encompass what's called mental toughness right and then when we start to developmental toughness because we're able to follow through on the actions that our boss voice is telling us hey no bro you told yourself today you were going to get after it get your fat ass off the couch and get on the fucking road and go to your work okay that's your boss voice well it's an abusive voice no the abusive voice is the voice that tells you to keep eating like shit and to take it easy and to take you know give yourself a break motherfucker you've been on a break for 10 fucking years that's why your life looks like shit okay so that's abuse all right so when we talk about when we talk about the real voice that you should be listening to it's the voice that tells you to do the things that you know you're supposed to do and that's the voice that we have to become aware and tuned into and then we have to follow that up with the skill development all right so most people's problem is not I don't know what to do most people know what to do they just can't do it okay so that's what that program is designed to do that's why for 75 days there is zero compromise there is zero substitution this is you know you were in or you were out and a lot of people don't get it because they've turned it into their mind as some sort of fitness challenge or some sort of tick-tack challenge no this is a mental recalibration program and this is why when you go fuck with it and you're not qualified to fuck with it oh I'm gonna make it a little easier I'm gonna make it more sustainable you don't even understand the program you don't even understand the point of it and nor are you qualified to make those adjustments because the reason that your life and the whole reason you want to do this program is because you're dissatisfied with your life and your bitch voice is so strong that it's telling you to compromise the very thing that it's going to fix this problem all right so when we think about like how to view this program you should be viewing it as a tool that we use to recalibrate on as needed basis okay and the live-hard program is designed for you to go for 365 days and spend less than 50% of that time working on your sharpness and if you spent less than half the year working on your sharpness every single year and you were able to adhere to the plans that you lay out in front of you without compromise what would your life look like okay let's let's have an honest question here if you went back for the last five years of your life and every single time you told yourself you were going to do something I'm going to go on a diet I'm going to get in shape I'm going to build a business I'm going to increase my income I'm going to get more serious at my career I'm going to be a better better partner in a relationship and you had done all those things where would your life be it would be completely different than where you're at now all right so it's not that we don't know what to do or that we can't see the path it's that we can't follow the path and so what should you do first I would take care of your mental first and then allow your physical to manifest along with it which is what the program is all about and then after that and as you're doing that you're going to notice all these other habits start to materialize and rise to the surface things like your ability to execute on your game plan for your career your ability to execute on your game plan for your relationships your ability to execute on your game plan for anything that you think needs to be improved is going to rise and when you can execute on the plans in all these different areas what do you think that does the quality of your life it makes it better okay so a lot of you guys don't know what the fuck you're talking about when you talk about 75 hard to be completely honest because you saw some tic talk talk about it and like tell you it's this or it's that or some trainer that's threatened by it like I get this shit a lot too a lot of personal trainers are threatened to buy it because it's free okay so they go out and they trash it and they talk shit not understanding that if I purposely designed the program so that you could plug in your programming your meal plans and the training into the program into the framework and you will actually not just produce better results for your clients but you will fix them permanently and if you fix them permanently and get that by way when I say fix them permanently that doesn't mean you never do the program again fixing them permanently means becoming aware that they need to constantly sharpen their spear when it gets dull over the course of time that's the only permanent fix it comes to when we talk about discipline mindset mental toughness all these things are skills these are perishable skills just like swing a golf club just like shooting a pistol if you do not practice every day your skill set is going to diminish this is the same with discipline it's the same with grit it's the same with fortitude it's the same with your confidence it's the same with self-esteem if you do not make investments into them they get weaker and when you become aware of the weakness happening and you're able to adjust track and fix it how much more powerful do you become that's actually the permanent solution of the program it's not that you do it once and you're fixed okay it's a it's an awareness and an understanding that for us to have these skill sets we have to build the skill sets they are not traits they are skills all right so yeah I think I think one of the implications that people kind of miss over is like you know when you talk about hold on bro think about this when with these trainers I want to get back to this yeah the trainers who talk this shit right why are they talking the shit because they want to sell you some shit and they can't sell you some shit if you've got some other shit for free okay so let's be real what is their actual objective for you is the actual objective for you to fix you so that you can actually get better results and by the way it would be better for their business if they did that if they actually fix someone to where they created the awareness in the person could self-regulate their own discipline that person would associate that success to those trainers and then be your biggest advocates so it's a bunch of short-sighted shit that these people do when they talk shit like that and then they get blasted by the millions of people that have actually had success with the program so the point is in a long answer the the short answer to the long answer is start with your mind do the program do it fucking without compromise don't make up your own rules you're not qualified to make up your own rules if you were qualified to make up your own rules your life will look like mine not like yours okay so do the program exactly as it's fucking prescribed and then 75 days you will understand what i'm talking about now and you will be a different human being and every plan that you lay out in front of you from here on out will be a plan that you can stick to and if you can stick to any plan that you decide to stick to where are the limits in your power there are none okay so it's that's the thing so what were you gonna say one one one one connection i want to make to like you know for for people out there listening to that right well Andy okay i do i get my mind together how's it gonna make me more money you know let's say you're an entrepreneur you work for it for somebody true or false when you see a person that works for you and you can just look at them and they take care of themselves right you could tell that they respect themselves doesn't that translate to okay well that person's probably gonna do a pretty good job committing to whatever i have to them that's that's every every listen bro every human being understands what you're describing yeah when you are it doesn't matter if you understand this or you don't understand this there is something mystical about walking into a room and being in better shape than everybody else people look at it and they say holy shit that person's got it together that automatically raises your score in terms of your personal brand equity and what they think of you anywhere you go without saying a fucking word yeah you might not be able to do shit now listen i know your mom tells you you're perfect and i know your wife tells you you're fucking great with your dad bod and i know this and that and this i know all this shit okay but here's the reality the truth is is the better condition you are the more respect you have without saying shit and when that comes into who i want to do business with or who i want work it for me or who i think dude that's a huge it's a huge deal our best performers in this building you can look at them and tell who our best performers are yeah real shit yeah and that that equates to the sense man because okay you're doing hard shit in the fucking gym you know what hard work takes you know what fuck you know input output like you know you understand that process so it automatically translates into any facet of your life i don't know one true high achiever that that doesn't understand what i just said yeah i don't know one think of one high achiever think of one high achiever i'm talking i'm not talking about somebody who's born into it i'm not talking about someone who inherited a family business i'm not talking about someone who's won a lottery i'm talking about someone who built something from fucking scratch built something from fucking scratch and they've been doing it for a considerable amount of time and it's come into something that is uh universally respected as successful i'm not talking about a small business that's kind of on its way i'm talking about something that is undeniably a win who can you look at that doesn't follow what i just said it's a requirement it's a requirement and and that's the way it is i didn't make the rules but to answer this man's question brain body reality that's the flow okay so fixed the way you think which will also fix your body which will fix a whole body shit in the real world and give you the skills to adhere to any plan that you decide that you lay out uh for your path i love that man i love that guys any question number two and i'm currently facing multiple decisions in my personal and professional life is there a way to differentiate between opportunities that require additional time and effort versus distractions that present themselves as opportunities have you found a sure method to help you notice the difference between those two things that are just completely wasting a time that look good versus things that actually are going to require a time that that can work out i actually think this correlates to the last question i asked pretty well because it's i think this is an awareness problem all right you don't want to be uh you know the the squirrel that is always chasing the next new nut right like that's that's what people do and it's because it's not because they have trouble recognizing opportunities from distractions so to speak but it's more so they don't have the awareness to understand that their energy is a limited resource okay so what i mean by that is this you're working on the thing right whenever the thing is that you're working on you have to understand that unless you are at the peak level of that game and you have developed the infrastructure and the people and the systems and you are undeniably winning you cannot afford to take energy off of that thing to do other things it's just not reality you are not that good you are not that skilled you are not that talented and neither am i and that's why it's important for you to understand that we only have so much energy to put into something and let's just say we're working on a project right and this particular project we're working on is a project that a hundred other companies are also working on all right but we're putting all of our energy into this into this and into this project and these other companies they're doing five other things or six other things or 20 other things right and they don't have what i said the foundation set up to do so so you're talking about a dedicated 100% energy resource versus the splintering of energy resources that you're competing against and when you are you which none of you that are listening here at the peak of your game you're just not because i'm not none of us are all right not how many of you are running a fucking Nike or an apple or an amazon Jeff Bezos you listen yeah none of you are okay so let's just get on the same page we're all here yeah so whatever it is that we have that we're focusing on if we take our energy off of that for the next thing or the next thing or the next thing we're gonna be still competing with people who are focusing all of their energy on that thing and if we take our energy off of that thing and they keep theirs on that thing it would be an arrogant assumption to assume that we can beat them with less than all of our energy you understand so you cannot make the mistake of assuming that you are better than the other guy because if the other guy even if he's less skilled in you and he puts all his energy in and you're only putting 80% in that guy can beat you yeah that's the reality of competition all right so it's not about you know what's the distraction or what's the opportunity it's that you haven't exercise if you're fulfilled your your original opportunity to begin with which is why you're struggling and looking for other opportunities it gets a little hard you change correct and this is where people really fuck up their lives dude because this is what happens to them and this really happens to entrepreneurs are people with careers a lot all right they get into something they pour three years into it after the end of three years they're like fuck this is so hard I want to do something else so they they say fucking I'm gonna start something else completely different they go over here they put three years in and after three years they're like fuck this is hard I don't want to do this I want to start something else and then they do that again for three more years now that's nine years of your life okay we don't have unlimited opportunity here and by the way the person who who started the same day you did they have nine years of experience now that same thing exactly so like dude this is how competition actually works and people don't understand it because they bought into this idealistic bullshit on the internet that oh there is no competition I'm just competing with myself I'm just bro that's bullshit you're competing in a real game and there's other players playing it and if those other players put more energy into their craft you put into your craft they're going to beat you and you're going to struggle and because you're not putting all the energy into your original opportunity the way that it was laid out for you or the way that you went and grasp it and you continue to flop from thing to thing to thing to thing this is how you end up at 45 years old with nothing to show for it you see you don't say it's okay to do that once it's it's it's it's it's maybe okay to do it twice when you're early in your 20s but like dude if this is your game you can't win it's impossible to win how can you how can you complete a marathon if every time you get to mile 14 you fucking want to start over right you can't do it it's impossible okay so this is not so much how do I how do I recognize the between the opportunities and the waste of time this is more so how do I become aware that for me to win I have to pour all my energy into the thing and stay on that thing yeah I love that so follow up on that right nuance is aside okay based off of that argument is could you also argue to them like it doesn't matter what you do because the equation of success is universal no matter what you do whether you think it was a distraction or not if you focus in on that you can eventually reach some level of high success yeah because the game isn't the absolutely right if you're operating with intent yeah okay there's people that operate with intent right what I mean by that is they're working they do the work to produce an outcome like in the gym right yeah there's people that you see in the gym for five years that never look any different it's because their workouts don't have the proper intent they're not working out to produce a result they're working out to say they worked out all right check in boxes correct and so if you operate with the proper intent for long enough no matter what the thing is you're eventually going to be successful at it because the game isn't always and usually not who is the best it's usually who can last the longest okay because when you start out on day one and just like I described a minute ago three years in nine out of ten of your competitors are quitting now you're only competing with one person right right now there might be a whole new group of people starting out on day one but you're three years ahead of those people okay and then you go another three years and maybe that person's quiz so now maybe you're the one of the only people doing it right now there's other people doing it in other cities but not in your town right now all the sudden you get to nine years or 12 years in and now there's only there's only three other companies out here across the whole globe that are doing what you've done for as long as you've done it and you're by default experienced you've built the connections you've stuck to it and you've been operating with intense so by default you're getting the business and you're becoming successful and people get misconstrued and confused because they look on the internet and they see all these fake mother fuckers talking about how much money they make and how successful they are and bro let me let me ask you something send me a picture of their company send me a picture order their product online not coaching a product their service where where are their employees can we see their employees can we see their headquarters can we see their business if the answer is no you shouldn't fucking do anything with them because they're probably lying they're out there standing in front of a rented lifestyle trying to pretend that there's something they hate so that you'll make them rich okay this is the game that is being played on the internet right now and because it's being played you guys see them as opportunities and you give up on the thing and you become one of the people that falls off and somebody else who's sticking with it you're gonna look back in six years and say fuck I should have stuck that through this is makes sense absolutely man you have to look at it the right way it's an awareness problem it's not a how do I identify the the the waste of time up where everything's a waste of time if you're not at the top of your game okay like if you're not at the top of the thing that you're working on then anything else is a waste of time all right and of course there's nuance to this of course there's things that you could break into that vertically integrate into your business and make them better right like when I was doing retail a natural alignment was after nine years of doing it was to start my own brand to sell in the retail that's called vertical integration that's a different thing that's things within the thing that's a whole different lesson plan and by the way yeah yeah I was actually just gonna say that by the way that's why we do RIT okay and my let night do RIT syndicate and you can go to RIT syndicate.com and we cover all of this type of shit every single fucking week and this is what we do we coach people through these kind of things because you guys go on the internet and you see these people who appear to be successful ask yourself what have they built what have they done okay I don't care if they got some flash I'm saying where is their company where is their employees where is their product or service can you order it is it known how successful are they really what have they built because if they haven't actually built anything then their knowledge resources going to be limited all right and this doesn't go for people coaching people to get their physical and all that shit better that's a different thing I'm talking about business I'm talking about building a real business a real fucking thing not you know hacking some fucking lead funnel on the internet I'm talking about real shit yeah okay so that's my take bro there's there's so much bullshit on the internet like like there's more coaches on the internet than there is people to coach more coaches and yeah and it's it's become this it's become this thing where people just do this because they can't make it any doing anything else you know let me coach you how to get somewhere okay but here's the thing you know people will say well they're you know they're making you know this much money okay that's fine they're making that much income that's like a tattoo artist getting paid to tattoo all the time they got to put their time in this that the other if they were a real operator and they built a real business they they know that the equity and the value in the wealth the real wealth is created on the equity value of their brands and the things they actually build I build real companies okay I got a whole bunch of them it's not just first form there's a whole bunch okay so I build real shit and when I'm teaching you as real shit not fucking you know how to fucking hack Amazon drop shipping for a week like that's not we're not we're talking about real building real things yeah it's very important for you to be able to recognize the difference I'm not saying that someone who is a coach who you know there's very few coaches out there to offer real value there is a few though all right I'm not saying they don't offer real value I'm not saying they won't help you with your mental game I'm not saying they won't help you get out of your own way and get going but what I am saying is that when it comes to actually building something you should be trying to learn from people who have actually built shit and the internet fuck set up for you guys and because it's so flashy and so fucking quick and so you're you're working on this thing and you're over here thinking like damn dude look at all these guys doing all this bro I did that for 10 years man I had to watch every single person I know go out and do better than me it sucked it was horrible but guess what not a single one of those mother fuckers earns as much as I earn in a fucking week at this point in my life okay that is real shit so all those people that I went out and fucking watched and had to listen to telling me to get a real job and to you know get realistic and when am I gonna grow up and when am I gonna do it those same people who told me that shit okay 20 something years ago those same people now are wishing that they would have joined me then you see so you're gonna get the last laugh don't think just because you're working on this thing right now and everybody else is out here smiling you're seeing their highlight real bro you're seeing their smiles you're seeing what they want you see it's fucking marketing this shit is hard and it takes time it takes a lot less time that it took me because I didn't have the internet I didn't have social media okay so focus in on the thing become great at the thing and understand that the game isn't you know how many home runs I can hit it's it's bunch and singles and stolen bases that's what the fuck it is over the course of 20 years that's what it is can you order their product can you see their building can you see their employees are they known how many companies have they built what are they can I order from them right let's ask some qualifying questions stop just believing mother fuckers the post shit on the internet that it's very simple guys Andy question number three hey Andy I've been a business for five years and every year I've made progress a few months ago I had an old friend who owns a business not necessarily a competitor but he approached me asking about some inside logistics and information on how I run my business I was more than happy to help but a couple of weeks later I noticed that they were not only copying the information I gave them but also copying little small details that only our company does what do you think I should do to address the situation should I just stop sharing information with them and cut him off completely or continue to work with them and only share select an information well look um I share things with my friends okay like when I talk to Ed or I talk to Alex Ramose or I talk to any of my friends we share information with the explicit understanding that we're not just going to straight fucking copy each other and rip each other off okay we understand as brand Alex's brand at all different things different ideas can work within the brand but unfortunately most people don't understand that because they're just in this rush to make as much money as possible so they can't understand that they have to create their own brand and then use tips and tricks within their own brand okay so in this scenario this is happening to me before too where I've shared in goodwill and then had someone just straight up rip off my shit um for a bit of them sometimes yeah absolutely happens all the time there's there's a there's a fucking new I don't know I don't get into it yeah it's all the time like I have to send out fucking lawsuit letters every single week because of the the level of copying that people do on my shit um so here's the thing they've already displayed that they're not trustworthy enough or intelligent enough to apply the information that you're giving in a specific way all right so immediately cut off sharing anything with them and furthermore understand that you're going to continue to do your thing and then they're not going to understand what you're doing okay and this brings us into like a further a deeper discussion because people always say this saying and it gets on my fucking nerve so bad you know imitation is the sincerest form of flattery know it is it it's a fucking form of you don't know what the fuck you're doing okay you you can't think of an original idea so you got to steal it from people and so there's a number of reasons why you don't want to straight up copy someone's shit and I'm going to break them down for you okay first off you have no idea if what they're doing actually works when you look at a brand and like I just said in the previous question you don't know who's who there's a lot of people out here who are fake and if you choose to copy the wrong person all right you're copying on it's like copying a math test when you're in school like you don't know if the person of the right knows what the fuck they're doing so you're copying something that you don't even know works that business or that company or that person could be massively in debt and on the verge of failing and because you don't want to go out and develop your own brand and you think they're doing well you're copying a faulty play okay which is very dangerous all right second point is if you do copy a brand if you do end up copying a brand and saying you know okay you pick the right one who actually knows what you're doing you have to understand that there is a time lapse framework to the ideas between when the idea has first come up with and when the idea is seen in public and that's usually about a year to two years all right maybe three so what does that mean for you when you copy someone's end result on the internet right you see a brand let's just say like mine and you're copying it okay but what you don't understand is that I already have the next two to three years planned out and I'm working on those things now so what you're copying is actually a version of what I was working on two to three years ago which means you're always going to be two to three years behind no matter what I do and that's not a good place to be all right so not only do you not know if it's working or not if you do happen to fucking pick one that's working you put yourself in a position where you you are automatically always behind always forever okay third people recognize a copycat brand people recognize that immediately like you think you're fooling everybody to do people are smart they understand and so when they look at you and they say okay that person is just a different version of that all right instead of being the market leader in what you do what happens is your brand equity automatically shrinks and you get slotted as a copycat and never get the respect that you're looking for and the brand never grows the way you want it to grow and so when you hear people say imitation is the highest form of flattery understand those people are not the fuck they're talking about okay because imitating another brand when you don't know what the fuck is actually going on is very risky and highly damaging and probably going to end up with you and whatever it is you're working on going broke all right so for this person here stop talking to understand that they're going to steal everything they can from you stop giving them any help and they will fail on their own because it's clear in my mind from the information that you've just shared that they don't know what they're doing and they're looking for a hack or looking for a quick fix or looking to copy and let them go copy someone else and learn this lesson on their own they're probably never going to learn it these people will probably never be able to innovate never be able to create never be able to think never be able to be original now i'm not saying you can't let other brands influence you i'm not saying you can't like say okay i like the way those guys do that one thing we can get better at that one thing in this way and then getting better in your own way does that make sense or using the negatives like hey this company did that that fucked them up correct correct correct it works on the plus and the minus all right but here's the thing this copying shit like it's not going to work okay this is why like you see you see this on fucking it i just use Alex was we just talked about him you see all these people trying to copy Alex's content the same text the same content flow mother fucker there's only one Alex the tank top okay and this dude has went out and built real shit okay and i can tell you because i know he's working on shit that you don't even know about yet so everything you're copying is the old shit so if you're copying the old shit and he's coming out with new shit where is that place you it places you below and every single person that sees your shit says that guy's just trying to rip off Alex and then what happens nobody respects you and your content never goes and if you apply this concept that we're talking about with content to actual business it's parallel it's the same thing okay so cut that dude off stop giving him any information it's it's totally okay to share information with their friends if they they're understanding if they understand brand enough to know like okay this technique works over here for me in this other way it's the same thing but i'm doing it in our brand's way right it has to be aligned with the brand so you know too many of you guys you don't give credit enough to the person who's actually doing it as a smart intelligent person and let me let me think how like let's be real how fucking stupid do you feel now for copying people after i just described all that you should feel really fucking dumb yeah okay because it's going to kill you and the reason your shit isn't working the reason nobody's resonating with your content and the reason that you know your product's not going is because everybody recognizes exactly what you're doing you're not fooling anybody okay so what's that what so okay we all got all that so what's the solution of that the solution of that is be original be authentic okay authenticity is the most powerful thing that you could have as a personal brand and a company be who you are take some time and decide who am i who do i want to be okay like when first forms first started getting out the gate like back in 2012 like we started in 2009 but like it started like picking up steam in 12 we had to make like conscious decisions about what our brand was and at the time bro all the big brands were like either in south florida or out in california right and everybody down in south florida look like they were from jersey shore okay they all had like slick back hair and it wore tank tops and they were all jacked right and everybody in california looked the same way but you know liberal okay like let's be real so so we're like we're like country dudes from Missouri right and we're like what are we supposed to do like walk or slick our hair back and walk around tank tops like no we're going to be who the fuck we are we're regular people trying to do some regular shit trying to help people and guess what that made our brand authentic over the course of the last fucking 14 years okay and that's still who we are we're just regular people out here working hard trying to help people get results so like dude just because you're not what someone else is doesn't mean what you're doing won't work and all likelihood it means it will work even better if you just lean into that does that make sense so most you guys got to put some thought and some development into who the fuck you are and what you stand for and where you come from and let those things resonate into your brand not just your personal brand but your actual business so how much energy would you say you should divert or invest I guess in this area like as far as like you know going to these people who are doing the copycat right because like if it's gonna fell on their own oh I wouldn't say shit yeah I would just not stop answering their texts like I would stop answering the question like look dude we're not available look dude like I said in the first question you only have so much energy so any energy you spend confronting this person about them stealing your information is energy you're taking off the thing okay so don't spend any energy just stop answering their question doesn't mean you have to burn them down doesn't mean you have to go on the internet and talk some shit like bro just stop the connection let them go figure it out they'll find someone else to copy and they'll continue to make the mistakes that I just laid out for you forever and you want to worry about them yeah all right that's how it works so stop answering their fucking texts you could still be you could still be friendly with them but you have to remember anybody who's taking from you in that way they're not your friend they're not your friend you're doing a good will to actually help this person and instead of that person actually doing the work and saying fuck how does this actually work for my brand how do I take this and do that okay instead of just taking your shit and making it their shit that's a big difference that's somebody taking from you your friends will not take from you your friends will only give to you they will only help you win so so you could still be friendly you could be nice you could say hi when you see him you could even send him memes and joke around and and be all that but when it comes to the actual helping of their business stop because they have displayed very clearly that they do not respect your shit they don't they want to take from you and the whole reason they're probably friendly with you in the first place is so that they can get close for that information you know how many people try to get close to me so they think that I'm gonna give them some secrets motherfucker you can't do what I do I can give you the whole playbook and by the way I've been doing it for eight years and not a single one of your motherfuckers has come and got me because you can't because I'm authentic and I'm me and you ain't me and you ain't never gonna be me this is why so many people pointed me every single fucking day on the internet to these people they're like look that dude's trying to be like for selling no shit but I don't care about it I'm not gonna call him out about it because I understand that by them trying to be like me they're gonna stay right where they are and I'm gonna keep going I love that man alright fucking love it man guys Andy that's three all right go pay the fee
