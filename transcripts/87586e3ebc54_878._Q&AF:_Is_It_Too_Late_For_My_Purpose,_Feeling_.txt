it is Monday ladies and gentlemen let's make some people better let's do it we got we got some good ones for you all right this first question let's get to it it's first question Andy I'm I'm 36 married two kids mortgage steady job from the outside life looks normal even good but sometimes in the quiet moments I ask myself is this really it I'm not miserable but I'm not fulfilled either it's like I built a life around expectations instead of passion is it too late to rediscover purpose or does this feeling mean I never truly had it to begin with no that's deep now it is dude but you have to be real man you got to be like older than that to really understand that question because I think this happens all of my friends that are my age Joe and I have talked about this before you know you get to a point in life where you start to really audit what you've done and where you've come from and what you've built and even when it's amazing even when you're happy you look at it and you say man what could I have done or how could this have went or am I doing enough and those are natural feelings you know we've all heard of the midlife crisis that what this is right it's it's it's sort of that yeah I think it's just a natural time where we're going through into a different season of life and you know we're no longer in the in the spring of life now we're sort of in the mid summer you know what I'm saying and winters coming yeah yeah the fall is coming man and you know we start to really audit what we've created out of ourselves and if you're an ambitious person especially that could be incredibly difficult because what you know now is not what you knew when you were 20 not when you it's not what you knew when you were 30 so your mind kind of plays tricks on you man you you know all this new shit that you didn't know when you were younger and you're at a certain age and so you kind of like think well I could do all this and this but dude you really couldn't have done that because you didn't know that shit then it only came through the experience so we ended up getting this really this kind of like mind fuck space and everybody I know that is around that age you know I would say 30 after 35 to 45 has gone through this and sometimes it last a couple years I went through it real talk I mean dude and I've I've I've really built what most people would consider like the ultimate dream life if you know they're an ambitious person a business person I realized not everybody wants the same thing but you know I've created what most people consider the American dream from an entrepreneur standpoint and even with all that dude I have I've had to go through times where I was like is this really my life like is this all it is is I'm going to wake up every day I'm going to go here and I'm going to do this and that's what it's going to be and I'll tell you what man you sort of hit on it in your question you said purpose is it too late for a different purpose and I don't know that you have to think of it as a first of all it's not too late for a different purpose it's not all right you're still very young but for me it wasn't about finding a different purpose it was about expanding my purpose okay and growing a bigger purpose a bigger mission a bigger project to work on and We get in these times where we're sort of stale and we keep you know like he's saying oh we did really good is this what it is well the reason that you're feeling the way you feel man is because you're no longer building you no longer creating are no longer becoming the way that you should be or the way that you did in the past And you can have all the prizes. You can have a nice bank account. You can have a great house and a great family and a great life. But the minute you stop building, you start to feel depressed. You start to question it. You start to lose interest in life because it becomes repetitive, monotonous, and not very much fun. And a lot of people, that's a pivot point in their life, right? Some people, they go down the road of heavy drugs, heavy alcohol, destroying their life because they think it's not what they wanted. And other people, they say, okay, I did good so far, but let me do better. Let me do bigger. Let me use the tools and the knowledge and the resources that I have now to create something even bigger. And when they create that bigger mission and that bigger purpose, the juice comes back, dude. It's like the mojo. Yeah, dude. You need your finger in the electrical socket of the mystery force. Don't try that at home. Yeah, don't do that. Sorry. But, you know, and it's just, it just rejuvenates you. And I think we have to remember that we are always fighting against a cultural norm. And the cultural norm is celebrating the weekend, celebrating the vacation. You're not normal if you work all the time. Well, motherfuckers, some people ain't wired like that. And to be real, like, if I lived, like those people live, I would kill myself. That is the honest guy's truth. And I'm not, I'm not paraphrasing. I'm not exaggerating. I would literally commit suicide because I would be so depressed and so sad and so unfulfilled. And then society makes you think you're weird for being wired as a builder. Anything outside of it. Right. And I just made a post about this today. We're recording this on Friday. You know, you can't explain this, this, this fire, this intensity, this drive that you have to build, create and become to someone who didn't get that gift. They're never going to understand it. They're never going to make sense of it. And they are typically heavily bought into the regular culture. And the regular culture at the bottom level is do the least amount of shit that you can do. All right. Watch as much TV as you can watch, relax as much as you can. And dude, that's just not a fulfilling life for someone who got the gift. Okay. I got the gift. This person here, they got the gift. And if you have the gift, you should embrace that. And you should say, hey, I'm not like those people and the truth is they're never going to understand. So fuck what they think and do what's going to make you feel fulfilled and happy and energized. For me and for most ambitious people and not most, every single one that I've ever met my life, they have to constantly be building. And we constantly see this examples of this in life. How many athletes get done playing sports and are super depressed? Okay. How many people sell their businesses and are completely miserable? You know, like it's not like and the regular person will say, well, see, all the money doesn't make it happy. They're actually right. It's not the money, bro. It's the process of creating. It's the artistic process of building and becoming and doing things that are happening. It's hard. And that gives us respect and gives us fulfillment in ourselves. It's one of the biggest reasons why 75 hard is so transformative. It teaches people that the value that you have in yourself is directly linked to how hard you work. Okay. So that's the long answer. The short answer, I can talk about this forever. The short answer is this. No, it's not too late. No, it's not too late to change your entire purpose if you want. But don't think that you have to change your entire purpose. You don't have to burn your house down. You don't have to burn your life down. You can just expand it. You can say, hey, okay, I'm going to take this to the next level. I'm going to do this. And you have to do that. You have to remove the guide rails of your own thought process to think bigger than you thought. And you know, and realize that the dream that you're living now was the dream of your younger self. And you are no longer that younger self. Now you have new skills and you're able to think bigger and accomplish more. And then there's something to that too. And you know you have more skills and you know you can accomplish more, but you're still living in the same dream that the 20 year old of you created. It's not going to be fulfilling, bro. And so, you know, all of these things play into this mental game that we get caught up into. And if we don't understand how to break out of it, the feeling that he's feeling is very natural. So come up with a bigger purpose, bro. That's the answer. Get a bigger mission. Get a bigger purpose. And take a weekend and dream as big as you fucking can and then go do that. And you're going to all that magic and all that feeling and all those things that's going to come back. That's such a weird thing to get sucked into, man. And I get this more to the younger guys because we got a lot of young, young, ambitious people that are sure. 36 is young, bro. 36 is young. But I mean, I'm talking like the young young bucks, like the 20s, the 19s, right? And it's like, you know, we go all our life and we feel like there's this like, you know, path that we're supposed to be on, right? You're supposed to go to school. You're supposed to go to a nine to five, have a good career, make the family, be get the house. And it's like, it's like hindsight, bro. Like it's such small minded thinking. You know what I'm saying? And like, I remember that one of the first lessons you really told me, bro, you got think bigger. Yeah, whatever you go to our scratch, I'm gonna make big ones. Yeah, because like that's the only way you get out of that. Yeah. So the only way to get out of it. I love that, man. We got calling. Let's do a call. All right. Let's go to Cameron. Let's give Cameron a ring. Hello. Cameron. Cameron, what's up, dude? Hey, DJ. Hey, Andy. Cameron, what's up, bro? How are you? For picking me. Yeah, man, of course. Do well. Thank you. What you doing right now? In the office. I'm in San Diego. Oh, sweet. All right. All right. A little San Diego action. That's what's up, man. All right. Well, what we got my question is, how do you leverage dark energy from mistakes you've made yourself? I've heard you share leveraging it from others. But curious if you do and how you do. Turn that negative into a person. I'm going to have to say, you know, I'm going to have to say, you know, I'm going to turn that negative into a positive really free career. Can you give me an example where you're talking about? Be having to get the last word in. And damaging relationship. Or. And just the coming to. the coming to things to both types of shortcoming personally that can negatively impact relationship. Let me ask you this. Let me ask you this brother. If you and I were best friends, okay, and we're friends, right? You listening to me, we're friends. Yeah. All right. Yeah. If I said to you, hey, can bro, I'm really struggling with with this man, you know, I'm kind of, I got a big mouth. I got a kind of a bad temper. I, I have to always get the last word in and, you know, it's, it's ruined some friendships, a few relationships. And I can't get over it, man, like fuck. And I can't stop thinking about it. What would you say to me? As a friend. That you really need to work on yourself so that you're not. And those confidence themselves have seen so that you're not, you don't feel the need to do that. And you're more compassionate in the situation and don't even think about having to get the last word in instead just handle it with grace. Well, I mean, dude, I can't stop thinking about it, man. I feel super guilty. It's where it's eating me alive on the inside, man. Like, I just can't get over it. What would you say? Stop. Stop what? Stop having stopped getting the last word in. Okay. Here's what I'm getting at, brother. You need to talk to yourself like you're your own friend. Okay. Every single person in the history of the world has done shit that you're talking about right now that you feel bad about. And you got to forgive yourself, bro. You got to say, hey, I made those mistakes. I'm conscious of those mistakes. Now I'm aware of how they affect my life. And I'm going to work on it. But I can't dwell on it, man. And if you were my friend, Cam, which you are, you support the show. I'm going to say this to you, man. Give yourself a little grace. You're learning. You're growing. That's the point of life. And it's not about harnessing the dark side energy that we have in situations like this. It's about giving ourselves grace and saying, fuck, I'm a human being, bro. And if you were, if DJ was telling me the same shit that you're telling me, I'd say, hey, dude, what would I say? So what one stop being a pussy, get it together and just go fucking do it. That was you fucking years ago. What would I say if you were saying, if you, if you were dwelling on it, what I not say, what I just told you 100% say, bro, it's all good. It's all good. We all go through this. And you need to talk to yourself like that, man. You know, when you're an ambitious young man, especially, we could talk to ourselves really, really harshly. And dude, I'm guilty of that. I, I, I standards demand a harsh internal dialogue. And sometimes that becomes counterproductive because it destroys ourselves from the inside when we make mistakes. But we always have to remember, man. There's only been one person ever. It's lived in the history of the world that was perfect. And his name was Jesus. So it wasn't cam and it wasn't Andy. And it wasn't DJ. Okay. So we have to remember, man, to give ourselves grace, to be aware of our shortcomings and then to work on those things. And the next thing, the next time they come up, we're going to make a better decision. And we might not get it all the way right. But the next time it comes up again, we'll get a little more right. And then a little more and then a little more. And then eventually, you're not even that same person anymore. I could tell you this, dude, this is real shit. When I was, when I was coming up in business, like, and I was desperate, I was the harshest, most savage, mother fucker on the face of the planet to everybody around me. I did not take shit from any, and I still don't, but I did not tolerate any fucking excuses. So the point where I was mean sometimes, okay, I was excessive. And it's hard to argue that because it got us where we are. But I have guilt about it. Okay. Lost a lot of friends during that time. Yes, absolutely, bro. And so I've had to, I've had to develop the understanding that like, hey, man, I was doing what I knew best at that time. And then I've adjusted my behavior so much. So that most of the people that work for us now have no perception that I used to be that way. No clue. Yeah, like they don't understand that there's a literal fucking animal. One inch underneath the skin. You know what I'm saying? So it's, but dude, I've had to work on that. And, and the first thing that allowed me to work on that was becoming aware of it. And you're already to that point, brother. The next thing I had to do was give myself some grace and say, okay, you did what you, what you knew to do at the time. And the third thing I did was I had to start working on change the behavior. And when I started to move out of that phase. I still had those situations happen, but they happen less and less frequently. And then eventually they got to the point where they rarely happen. And, and, you know, it's not who I am anymore. It's just not who I am. So it's there. I can use it when I want to. It's kind of like what Peterson says, what Jordan Peterson said, you got to be a fucking savage monster and then learn how to control it. But, yeah, man, it's part of life, brother. And I'm going to tell you this right now. I can hear it in your voice that you're struggling with this and you feel guilty about it. And I'm just going to tell you, dude, that's life, man. And give yourself some grace, work on the behavior. And after time passes, you won't even be that person anymore, bro. Does that make sense? Yeah, definitely. All right, brother. How old are you? How old are you? 34. Oh, fuck, dude. You're, you got plenty of time to learn. Trust me at 34. I was written motherfucker's throw it's out. So, so you're good, dude. Just, you know, give yourself a little grace, acknowledge the behavior, work on the behavior and it, it'll be a memory before you know it. All right, brother. Absolutely. Thank you so much for this. And all you guys do. Thanks, Cam. Appreciate you, bro. Yeah. All right. See you. Thanks, Andy. Thanks to you, Jeff. See you, right. I think that's a, I think I want to ask you this, right? Cause I feel like, you know, we all heard that saying like, you are your biggest critic. Should you be. Should you get your biggest critic? Of course. Of course you should. Bro, no one's going to hold you to the standard that you should hold yourself to. You should always be holding yourself to a high. This is what high performers do. Our high performers hold themselves to a higher standard than the external standards that they have to live in. Okay, so this is what this is a big deal to understand this. Kobe Bryant worked harder than what he was demanded of by the Lakers. Okay. Every successful person, Tom Brady worked harder than what he was demanded of by the Patriots. So your standards, if you want to be a high level performer, have to be higher than any of the external standards that you live in. That's just the math of doing it. Which can be very difficult, right? And when you work in a high standard environment, and then you got to have higher standards than that, sometimes we get pretty harsh on ourselves to where we forget like, there's still going to be mistakes sometimes. You know what I'm saying? So, but you got to, you're saying you got to have a really short, almost short memory with those, when those downfalls come. Yeah, you're right back to it. Yeah, that's it, man. Yeah. I love it, man. I love it. Well, guys, to get our next question, my next question is Andy, thank you so much for all you guys do huge fan. I'm sure to share the show. So I, uh-oh, to tell the truth, I feel like a desperate bitch for emailing in today, but I need some help. I'm 23 years old, and I've been in sales for the past five years or so while I was in college and after graduation, I'm constantly improving my professional skills, and I've done all right in my sales career. It seems like I can never get ahead of bills and being financially successful sounds very far in the future. I know I'm young, but I feel aimless. I've always wanted to start my own business and grind at something I'm actually passionate about. At any time I think of going off of my own, always running to the same problem, where the hell do I start? What the hell can I start a business off of? I know this is the problem I must solve on my own, but I'm curious as to how you decided on your business idea, and how you knew that that is the solution that you're going to pursue. Anything helps? Thanks guys. Yeah, I'll give you the exact truth. I wanted to be rich as thought. Okay, this is reality. All right. We were going to open a, I had a guy that I knew I had two entrepreneurs that I had seen in real life and actually met. All right. One of them was making a ton of money in a tanning business. Okay. The other one was making what I thought was a ton of money and retail supplement stores. So the guy who had the tanning business is making, making way more money. And so I wanted to start a tanning salon. All right. That's where the guy. This is how it happened. Yeah. Okay. I couldn't afford a Christian. I said, fuck it. We're going to start a business. We're going to open a tanning salon. Couldn't afford a tanning bed because we only had 12 grand. All right. So then we said, well, can we start selling supplements? And we could. So what we did was we took the nobody would rent to us because we didn't have any credit. We found a guy, his name was Mark Tharp in Springfield, Missouri, who rented to us, but with the agreement that we will pay a year up front rent. And rent was a thousand bucks a month. And that was all the money we had. So then we went and we got resourceful. We went to campus. And back then they used to have these little tables that you could fill out an application and get a credit card. We were like 500 bucks. So we went to campus and we filled out every motherfucker credit card we were get. And then we used those to build out the store, which we went to Home Depot and literally bought the material to build the store out. We built it with plywood and roofing tin. And if you go to the Springfield S2 on the north side 1709 South Campbell, you'll see the counter that we built. Still there. Yes. Yeah. We built it right. We built it with my buddy Mark Pottest. And we painted the store. I mean, dude, like when I say we started at nothing, I don't think people understand that what that means. Like we fucking finance the motherfucking build out on a credit card. And then our first order of supplements was $10,000. Okay. And I promise you that's very little inventory. So that's how we started. We didn't start. Yes, we worked out. Yes, we took supplements, but we were not knowledgeable about supplements. And we were kind of casual about working out. We were just we were just athletes. We wanted to make money. And this really kind of that mentality was a very not knowing it at the time, but it really cost us a lot of time because our goal was to make money. Alright. So the first day we sold $7 to a buddy of mine. His name was Nick Vespa. The next day we didn't sell any. The day after that, we sold $23 took us six months or eight months to have a day over 200 bucks. I think it was eight months. And then it took us five and a half years to open our second store. So first three years, we didn't make any money. And we lived in the back of the store on and off. And the next seven years, we made $695 a month for a grand total of $58,380 for the entire first 10 years that we were in business, not per year. Could have made more money working at McDonald's. And the reason that things changed was because over that course of time, we had situations where people would come in. And they would lose a lot of weight or they would get themselves together and it would change their lives. And it was awesome. Okay. But we were too young and too motivated by money to really understand that that's how we should be operating the business. We just didn't get it. And what I mean by that is our intent was on ourselves and it was not on the customer. And the minute that we figured that out, and there's a whole long story about how we figure that out, things change, everything changed. Our intent went, how do we deliver the best results for these people? How do we make sure that we can replicate the result on our end, which is to get them where they want to go as much as possible. And when we flip that switch over, we grew 100% for five years in the row. And this is post 2008 economy, which was one of the worst ever. And it was a simple mindset mindset flip of putting the intent on what we're trying to deliver now, how much money we're going to make. And when you do that, then the money comes. And this is a problem I see in a lot of people. A lot of people are able to make a little bit of money, running a business, but it never really takes off because the intent is on how much can I take from other people and said, how much can I give and how much value can I bring. And they hear these buzzwords on the internet of people saying, oh, deliver value, you get paid or you get paid in terms of the value provide. And they're like, oh, it's fucking, they think it's buzzword bullshit. It's not, it's real shit. And so that's how we started. Okay. We, we just thought we could make money. And so we went and we did make money, but it took us a long time how to make money, which was to put the intent on the result of the customer was after, which I know, I know for a fact, we do that better than anybody now. There's not another company that does what we do that cares more about the fucking customers say whatever the fuck you want is just not true. That's the truth. And I can say that very confidently. And I don't think there's another company on the planet that's changed more lives than ours. And I say that very confidently when you throw in the transformations that we do 75 hard and how we take care of people. It's just facts. No one could fucking no one could even I don't even think it's even close. That's the truth. I don't say I have to brag. I say that because I'm proud of it. And put that intent and stuck with it. Correct. Yeah. And it's, it's created a very successful existence for myself, the people around me. It's created tons of better higher quality people in the world who are happier and healthier and setting a better example. And it's allowed me to create income and careers for thousands of people all off of that one intent switch. So if I were a young person and I didn't know what I was going to do, I would ask myself, what do I care about? What do I care about serving other how can I serve other people in a way that makes me proud of what I just did. I would answer that question first. Then I would answer a second question, which is, what do I know how to do? Okay. And if you don't know how to do what you thought of first, then you can learn it. That's, that's okay. But if they align, it's really good. All right. And then the third thing that has to happen is, can I make money doing this? Can I do this at scale? What are my dreams? And how can I get there? Because there are things that we care about and we do well that can't scale. Yeah. All right. Most things can scale because there's niche markets that you can do very well on. But depending on how far you want to go, like if you want to make 200 grand a year, that's a different conversation because you have more flexibility to do the thing that you love because that's a lower income. If you want to make 20 million a year or 30 million a year, motherfucker has to be able to scale. Okay. So there's nuance in this formula. It's, it's what do I love? How can I serve what value could I provide? Well, do I have the skills to do it? And can it scale? And you need to find the right mix of those things that's going to get you where you want to go. Does that make sense? 100% 100%. I think what don't they call it like I've heard it like passion projects things like that. I mean, dude, people call shit all kinds of different things. I mean passion projects in my understanding or more just like people do things because they love to do them, not because they want to make money at all. Right. They don't care. That would be like what we do for Haiti or what we do for North St. Louis and things like that. You know what I'm saying? But yeah, bro. I mean, if you want to turn not every passion can be turned into a 100 million dollar business or even a 10 million dollar business. But if your goals aren't that big, which is okay. Like bro, I gotta say this too. You don't have to be. A fucking 100 million dollar company. Okay, you need to figure out what the fuck how you want to live your life and then design it around that. All right. So not everybody has to go out and try to build Nike. Right. That's just what I want to do. And I want to do more than that. I don't even like I've got bigger goals than that. Believe it or not. You just don't know about me yet. So yeah, man, that's it's an equation. It's a thought out plan. You know, and the more money you want to make and the bigger your life is the less flexible you can be with what you care about. And it has to line up with where you want to go. But you still have to care about enough to love serving it. Does that make sense? Absolutely, bro. So it's it's it's just a thought process. Okay. What do I love? What are my skills? What do I want to make? And then it's turning the dials to figure out what's going to work. What do you also say to because I feel like this is also another young about problem where like because the internet can be so inundated with people. I made you know, $3 million in fucking two hours. Yeah, right. Well, first of all, remember, they're full of shit. Right. 100% right. But it's like, you know, people people don't know people don't understand well scale. Okay. Someone who doesn't know who's 20 years old or 30 years old and they've never had anything nice in their life. They see someone with a fucking Lamborghini and they think, oh my God, they're so rich. No, dude, that's not true. Okay. You can you can do all kinds of things. You can rent those. You can. Bro, there's private jet sets that influencers go and take fake private photos private jet. You cannot believe any of the shit. This is why I tell you guys, you have to look at what they've actually done. You can't look at what they present online. It's not 90% of the time. It's not true. And really, dude, I'm sort of an anomaly in the fact that like I'm one of the dudes who's actually built a bunch of real shit that shows their life. Most of these motherfuckers who built real shit don't show their life. Because they think that if they do, it's going to demoralize their employees or their customers when reality dude, it would inspire them. And that was something that I had to learn as well. But the truth of the matter is, dude, like, these fuckers are so full of shit. Not really done anything. They're good at marketing a fake lifestyle. And because you don't know what real wealth looks like, you think it's, you think it's real. And people that are on the other end of that mountain, like I can look at that or someone's like it and be like fuck out of here, dude. You know what I'm saying? Like it's, it's, it's, we have a lot of dudes taking advantage of people. And it makes people, it makes people demoralized because they think they're doing it wrong. Well, I think my point too was getting to that. It's like, you know, you're at 23. Bro, you couldn't like, are you even able? Would you even be able to manage millions of dollars in your bank account? Right? You know what I'm saying? I guess what what's the wealth timeline? Like are there not. Well, I mean, there's 23 year olds that have made billions of dollars. So look, we got to be careful about, you know, that. But to answer your question, if you don't have experienced managing money, no, you're not going to know how to manage it. This is why we see all the athletes lose all their money. This is why we see, you know, the lottery winners lose all their money because they don't know anything about money. Right? They don't know how to make it work for them. They don't know where to invest it. They don't know how to run a business. You know, they think it's just going to be there forever because they don't have the perspective. You know, and you can't blame them because no one ever taught them. You know, but no, I mean, managing money is a fucking skill in itself. And it's going to take for most people it takes making money, losing money, making money, losing money. And then finally you make it again, you're like, fuck, I'm not losing that. Yeah, I need to look, that's the reality. So, yeah, no, it's a real thing. You know, you, the process of building will teach you responsibility, right? Because you'll manage cash flow and profitability and, you know, you'll start to realize what you can't afford, what you can't afford. But getting it overnight is, you wouldn't even want that, bro. And I'm going to tell you this too. Because the, the, the hungry days, the lean days, the hard days, the days of pain and struggle and hopelessness and frustration. When you look back on those days, those are the days you're going to value the most because those are the days that tell you everything you actually need, the grit, the endurance, the mental toughness. All the skills, how to be resourceful. And if you take someone and allow them to skip that process. And then that person who had to learn all the shit the hard way has to compete with that person at some point in time, the person who had to struggle is going to kick the fuck out of the person that got it quick. That's the reality because for like, bro, I don't care who I go up against. I could go up against CEOs of the biggest companies in the world. I'm going to fucking beat their ass because I fucking started with nothing. And I know all the skills all the way up to the top. No one ever invested, no one ever gave us a big check. I didn't graduate from fucking brown and get a role of CEO. My skill set is much more in depth than any of those people could possibly have. It doesn't matter how many hours they spent in a boardroom or a classroom. It's a different skill set. So I actually have way more respect and admiration for the people who literally started at nothing. I think they're the best entrepreneurs on the world because dude, how do you fucking create something out of nothing? That's hard. Okay. So if you're running a business that you created from nothing, even if it's doing, you know, not doing as good as you wanted to just remember, you're learning skills that these big time dudes are never going to have. You know what I'm saying? And eventually you're going to compete against people who were who had investors or got placed in these and dude, you're going to beat them because you know more. So that's real. We got one more question. Let's get one more call in here. Final, final question for the day. Let's get Mandel on the line. Here we go. Hello, Mandel. This is Mandel. Yeah. What's up? Yeah, this DJ. How'd you get? Mandel was so, bro. What's going on? Andy, how you doing? I'm doing good. How are you? I'm doing great. Um, yeah. No, man. This is no doubt one of the best days of my life. I mean, well, we're going to make it better. But where are you calling in from? Yeah, um, Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I weird. Sioux Falls. Sioux Falls. That's beautiful country. Yeah, it is. It's nice of you, though. It's a good state. So, all right. All right, brother. Well, hey, what can we help you with today, man? Yeah. Um, so I want to be as objective about this as possible without putting the motions into it. Um, but my question is, is it a moral and ethical thing to cut your siblings out of your life when you believe they are the reasons for holding you back? They come with good intentions, but do not believe in the path of being what Tim Grover calls a cleaner in life. Um, for, you know, me, you, I'm sure DJ and the rest of the really have team that have read the book, uh, relentless by Tim Grover. All right, man. Well, that's a real question, dude. And a lot of people struggle with this a lot. I mean, this is one of the most, uh, ask questions that I've gotten in my 15 years of doing personal development work. Um, it depends. Okay. It just depends. Here's the reality of it, man. And I'm going to speak objectively as well. Uh, you only have so much energy, dude. Okay. You only have so much energy and to compete if you're ambitious, it's going to take all of it. If you are spending 40% of your time arguing with anyone, okay, whether it be a friend, somebody you don't know that well, your mom, your dad, your siblings, your ability to succeed is going to be less because you are going to be competing against someone who has a lot of things. And then you have to decide how much energy you want to free up while maintaining relationships that you have. My recommendation for you would be to audit how important it is to get where you want to go and then make a decision about where the boundary needs to be for you to have the most available energy to move forward. It doesn't necessarily mean that you have to cut them all the way out. It can mean you just have to sort of keep an arm's length. All right. It can also mean you just have to learn how to have selective hearing. You know, when I was building my company, dude, this is just the truth. I would show up at places where I had friends and family. And I get made fun of, dude, and I would get joked about, you know, I'd have people that would say, hey, that's cool as well. So I don't want to make it sound like it was all bad. But I definitely had people in my family tell me like the like that little saying that I say all the time, like, are you still on that little vitamin shop that came from people I'm related to. So, you know, I just had to decide and you know what I did. I stopped. I sort of stopped showing up. I kept it at length. I kept it real far away. And I was able to do what I wanted to do. And I don't have regrets about that because now when I look at my life, I see all these people around me who are young and hungry and supporting their families and building their communities and doing all of these good things. And that's I feel good about that. So for me, that was worth it. But for you, it may not be worth it. So you have to decide what it is that you want. But I can tell you this, if your goal is to be a cleaner, you're probably going to have to create some very, very strong boundaries and learn selective hearing. Okay. And when you do hear what they say, you're going to have to have a chip on your shoulder and say, hey, fuck that. I'm going to shove it down these motherfuckers throughout. And all of those things I've developed. That's the truth. The worst thing that someone could say to me, if they want me to lose is to tell me that I can't do something because I will fucking burn my own life down to win. And people say that's not healthy. Well, it's probably not. But it's the truth. So yeah, I mean, just be real. So like, that's the decision, man. It's it's auditing what how important it is to you and, you know, how you want to handle it. And there's always nuance and there's dials that you can turn to get where you need to go. But the bigger the goal, the less the less energy you're going to have available for people that aren't going to push you forward. And when it comes to friends and when it comes to the people you surround yourself with. It's not enough just to have them be neutral. You have to find people that are going to push with you and fight with you and build with you. And so you have to take those drags are anchors as I call them and replace them with propellers so that you can go fast enough to compete. So, does that first of all does that make sense? 100% OK, no, literally that was straight backs. Like, it's just nice to hear from somebody for the first time my life that gets what the show is real AF. And yeah, you know, it's something where like I'm truly trying to do something incredible with my life. I know people laugh at me when I say I know they're like, oh, you're trying to do something like Steve jobs. No, I am. I really am and I say it with humility. And you get laughed at you know, and it's like you get to a point like you said, it's like you love them and you're proud of your siblings, your blood siblings, you know, you grew up with them. So, what you realize that they are anchors, and it's like, you know, just from these short couple of months of posing these relationships with them because I have, I've achieved like literally a year of progress because of the focus that I've been able to put on all this energy towards my goals. So it's just it just sucks. It's a sucky situation because like you said, you know, it's easy to do with friends because they're friends, you know, but you talk about your blood siblings, you know, south for you and your brother, you know, you grew up with these guys, you know, you love them, you know, but you realize that they just they call you high TV and all this and it's just not the right energy. Like you said, you need people there that are going to fight with you not to be neutral with you when you're having these conversations. Bro, it's it's just the way it is, man, like, you know, I wish it was different. I wish you could have relationships with everybody. And you know, even if they didn't want you, you could still be cool. And dude, if they were mature, they would just keep the fucking mouth shut. Yeah. And if they were really mature, they'd support the fuck out of you. But the problem is human nature is just the way it is. And people that come from the same household or the same neighborhood or the same school that you came from when you're trying to create greatness, you are a constant reminder of what they could have done. And that doesn't feel good to them. So, you know, I always tell young entrepreneurs one of the greatest things that you can do to be successful and maintain your family relationships is to move the fuck to a new city and do it there. Because then the distance sort of creates the buffer and you're able to do your shit without the distraction. I don't know if that's an option for for you, but that's a way to do it. But here's the good news, brother. All that same shit happened to me, all of it. When I when I first started writing because that's kind of where, you know, my personal development career started. I was writing literal posts on Facebook. I would have people in my family fucking comment. What do you think your Tony Robbins? And, you know, like, that's the shit they would say. And it's like here I am. You know, so in Tony's to go. I'm just gonna say that. I don't say I'm better than him. But, you know, like, I'm doing my own thing. And so, yeah, dude. And eventually those people that doubted you and they grow the fuck up. And they come back around, dude. And so it's not ever a good buy. It's more like a see in a few years. You know what I mean? And. Right. Right. Yeah. So, so dude, you know, I would start with the conversation, a real conversation like with them. Like I'd sit in the fuck down and I'd say, hey, man, look. Here's the deal. I love you. I respect you. You're my fucking blood. If you were my real blood, you would support me in this. And if you can't support me, at least be quiet. And if you can't be quiet, I can't associate with you because I'm doing this no matter what the fuck you have to say about it. And sort of set that boundary. And then let them decide what they want to do. And then you, you react appropriately. But this is. But this is go ahead. I want to ask this why you got my Mandel while you're on the phone too, because I feel like there is a flip side of this. I just want to get your takes on it. Is it is it almost coming from like a selfish thing like why don't you believe in me? Like if there's nothing there yet though. Oh, yeah. That's also a good point. Yeah. Sometimes we look, I don't think that's what he's saying. I think what he's saying is they're discouraging. For sure. But there is another side to that, to that talk, which is people who are just starting the man's support. And when they don't get, you know, the out of this world support. They say, oh, everybody fucking nobody believes in me. Well, mother fucker, you didn't give me anything to believe in. What the fuck have you done? You said you're going to lose weight 700 times. You didn't lose weight. You said you were going to do this. It didn't work. You said you were going to do that. It didn't work. People have a right to not believe you if you have displayed that you are not worthy of belief. Like that's reality. So, so you know, that is a trap that people fall into. We have to accept reality. Nobody's going to believe until you've done it. Okay. And if they could support you. Great. If they can't, they should be quiet. And at the very least not be a drag. But we got to be, you know, I don't think that's what he's saying, but that's a good point to bring up because there is, I see that a lot. Because we said it from fan. Yeah, but bro, like they're people too. Yeah. Like if they've seen you like say, oh, I'm going to lose weight 700 times and you say it the next time. Why the fuck would they believe you? Right. You know, so you can't, they're, they're people. They're not going to just because they have the same blood. And they love you. You might get a little extra grace. But I mean, eventually you're showing them that you're not going to follow through and they're not going to believe in you. So that's when you have to make them believers through the results that you produce. Nobody owes a shit. Okay. We have to understand that. Nobody owes us fucking anything. Okay. They don't owe us help. They don't owe us belief. They don't owe us support. And the reason that most of these people don't support us is because we've never shown them anything to support or believe in. Once you show them and you build something and they look at it and they say, oh, he's actually doing it. I'm always believing in you, man. Damn. The belief starts to come. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. So yeah, man. But brother, you know, look, dude, how old are you? 25. All right. You got to fucking take care of your own life, bro. That's the reality. And this is a hard transition for young men and young people in general when they're 25 because you're on the path of your own life. You've gone through this shit. You're on the, yeah, you're on the path of your own life now. And you're holding the rest of the life that you've known up until this point has been with your brothers and your sisters and your family. But now you're out on your own, man. And there's this weird transition that happens where we have to like realize, hey, nobody's coming to fucking make this for me. So then I think you're there. And I think you're thinking about the right way, bro. And it sounds like you have super high ambition and drive and you want to do big things. And just realize to do those big things right or wrong, no matter what anybody thinks of it, you're going to have to dedicate most of your energy to it. There's going to be people that don't approve. There's going to be people to say that's wrong. They're going to be people that guilt you for it. But I would tell you this. All of that shit is not worth not getting where you want to go. It's just the truth. So that's what I would do, bro. Just audit it out, build it out, think about it and you know, have that conversation. And you're going to be good, bro. I promise you everybody goes through the shit. Yeah, man. I appreciate it. Yeah. No, yeah. No, it's to the point where like you said during 25, you know, going into that, you know, transitionary phase. You know, I want to win so bad that like it's coming at all costs now, like to wear like it's I'm having this question with you guys today. Bro, let me tell you something dude. It fucking takes everything. Anybody who tells you it doesn't take everything is fucking lying. They've never done it or they had some sort of benefit. They had some sort of benefit that you don't have like somebody to give money or an investment or a loan or they had anybody who's come from fucking base level and built anything relevant. This is just reality. I don't really give a fuck when anybody has to say about it because none of them done it. I've done it. It takes fucking everything, fucking everything. And here's the problem that you're going to have later in life because I'm just going to tell you I'm 20 years older than you. You're going to build the habit of giving everything for so long that you find it really hard later to give it your energy to anything else. So it's a different life. It's just a different fucking life that most people will never understand. So get comfortable with that. Get used to it. Understand it's going to come with this unique challenges. But from someone who has been in your shoes, I wouldn't trade it. Period. Yeah. So now. All right, brother. No, man. I mean, I don't want to take any more of you guys at the time. I mean, this is really where you have some more growth days of my life. Yeah. No, I like seriously, the wisdom I just got is going to propel me. I can't wait to see what 20 years from now my life's going to look like. Well, I just want to thank you guys at the real life, really F team on first form and all of everybody and the entire teams that you know, put out the stuff you guys do. You guys are literally doing God's work. Like I mean, you guys are actually speaking God's word into the world. Like it's amazing. I've been listening for five years and I just can't thank you guys enough. It just showed truly means a lot to me. So. Well, listen, brother, I we appreciate that. And if you really want to repay us, go out and do what the fuck you're supposed to do. All right. And remember, you have an obligation to do this, bro, because your family, you can see it in your family. Your family doesn't believe it's possible. Think of the perspective switch that it's going to create in them for you to go out and do this. It's going to change their entire lives, even if they're resistant to it now. So your story matters. It's important that you go do this. And it's not just about you, even though it feels like it is right now. All right, bro. So keep that in mind whenever it gets hard. Yeah, man. No, not last thing I want to say is a, you know, my mom, she's eight months sober because she was so inspired at how hard I work every single day. There you go. And my goals and start everything. And it's just, you know, yes, little things like that that you just, you had to be grateful for bro. Yeah, no, I don't want to take anymore. You guys are time seriously. I know, you know, you guys got the episode laid out and everything I already appreciate this call like just so much. Brother, so you are the episode. Hey, don't be afraid to call us back in, man. I will check in from time to time. I want to hear what's going on. Yeah, yeah, no, definitely. Definitely got some, you know, other questions for the future. But yeah, I'll definitely keep sharing the show. You know, don't be a whole show. Yeah, and yeah, you know, I'm just going to keep falling like I've always done. You guys have always impacted my life and tremendous ways already. So, all right, brother. Well, listen, go do it. Go make it happen. And we'll see you at the fucking top. Yes, sir, I can't wait. All right, see your brother. All right. We'll see you DJ and Andy. Bye. Fucking awesome. That's it. It's fucking awesome. It's such a hard thing to deal with. It is, man. But fuck dude, I can hear it in his voice, bro. Dude, it's hard. He fucking gets it. He gets it. Yeah, it's ruins right around the time. It's like, I will. I mean, yeah, DJ got to go. It is what it is, man. Like, yeah, it is what it is, dude. And it's hard because you fucking care about people. But you know, you got when you start where, you know, when you start weighing out, okay, well, what if I don't become what it is I want to become what if I don't do this, how am I going to feel about it? It's it's really not worth anything else. And I know people are going to say, well, that's selfish. Well, sometimes you got to be selfish to be selfless. That's the truth. You have to be. Yeah, that's right. You have to. So, um, man, I really love that question. I can just hear in his voice that he's fucking all about it. That's refreshing, dude. That shit gives me hope. I really like these Collins, man. Like, this is way cooler for us than just reading someone's question. You know what I'm saying? It's cool. I'm not talking about it, man. So no doubt about it. Well, guys, Andy, that was four. Yeah. Uh, that the show. If you want some more. Yeah. Share the dirt show. Yeah, share the darn show. All right.
