a couple months went outside and I was like fuck this is cold and then I was like oh man I got to start going outside again gotta do it I yeah cuz I'm starting to get soft bro I feel it yeah dude it's different it's fucking different I got it I do I was like I was like I caught myself like running from the garage to my house and I'm like fuck doing the oh shit skirt you're turning into a bitch yeah so I gotta I gotta get back on that outdoor yeah yeah I'm gonna start you know I'm gonna start 75 hard on the first with everybody because I know there's always you know thousands and thousands and thousands of people that start in the first but I think I'm gonna get a good 30 day run going up so that way you know you're pretty momentum yeah I live that way anyway for the most part I just haven't done the outdoor cardio in a while yeah it's been a minute man well I mean shit the wind is definitely good time to get hard yeah no shit especially here man yeah but yeah it's Monday man got a good time to get what huh nothing I was trying to keep the show G rated oh got you got you yep that's it Monday let's let's let's get into these when I got three good ones for you guys any question number one this is actually great a great question going right off the combo hi Andy I was curious if you've ever gone through a final test phase prior to reaching big milestones in your life such as a giant windfall of money or nice car etc I personally call this the final test as you're not being only tested in a few areas of life like only money or health a personal life car issues this test is all in convincing everything going wrong in your life at at the same time money problems personal problems health problems people problems car problems life testing your patients to the absolute extreme while enduring the lack of money to pay bills and cars and repairs and all that good stuff I'm personally enduring this right now all at the same time and I'm aware that I can't give up in this phase I'm running with the zero options mentality you talk about all in or nothing I was genuinely curious if you gone through this type of all encompassing tests and what you did to personally overcome it I love the show you and DJ crush every day thanks for keeping it real as fuck out there so big big milestones with a massive test right before it well first of all it how do you know a big milestones coming you don't ever know so you don't know if the test is right before it but there is sayings that have been around for thousands of years one of them being it is always darkest before the dawn everybody knows that everybody's heard that and I think most people have experienced it so the chances of a big breakthrough or a big milestone are in the favor of when you are being tested most that you're going to come through now I don't know if that's because the universe lines it up that way or if it just feels that way because you're going through so much hard stuff that when something goes right it feels really good you know I'm saying so you know to answer your question dude yes everybody goes through this okay it is not just you these hard times these times where you're struggling these times when you're angry these times when you're frustrated these are not exclusive to you and people who think they're exclusive to them suffer from a massive arrogance problem they believe that they are the only person that suffers the only person that has hardship the only person that has to push through when in reality every single achiever that's ever existed every single thing that's ever been built has been built by somebody who's gone through this process of everything going wrong at some point and we can look through history at all the amazing people who have done the most amazing things and right before they did this amazing thing that you know them for they went through some really hard shit okay so the first thing we got to understand is that you are not the center of the universe you will go through these tests these tests will not just come at one point in your life they will come over and over and over and over and over again and after you've matured and been through them enough you don't panic anymore okay and what you can do is to train yourself to become someone who relishes being in the hard shit because you understand that everybody else quits when things get hard when things get hard it is simply this one foot and front of another in front of another in front of another okay that is the only way to keep moving forward it's the only way to continue to progress when things are hard and it's very simple but people don't like simple people like extreme and fun and exciting and these instant gratification you know situations and dude life is just not like that okay life is hard success is hard business is hard being married is hard having a family is hard doing anything that anybody would admire is hard okay and when things get the hardest that is the most important time where you have to continue to move forward putting one foot down in front of another this is why it's so important to make investments in your mental toughness and your grit and your fortitude and your ability to persevere and your ability to stay disciplined because conditions will never be perfect okay when we talk about it being freezing cold outside and I'm talking about how I know that I need to go get acclimated of that because I can feel myself getting soft that is me recognizing that my mental fortitude is getting rounded off when it needs to be very sharp okay so we have to become aware of where we are mentally and we have to make investments to harden ourselves mentally so that we can prepare for these hard times that come over and over and over and over again one phase that you are experiencing right now would normally crush a human being okay you're going through this process things get hard everything in your life seems fucked most people quit the first time that happens most people look themselves in the mirror and say oh well I guess that's not for me I'm gonna go just do whatever what else does and then the quit okay and what you have to realize is that if you could build yourself into someone who can work through these things as they come there's really nothing that can stop you and the longer you go through them and the more you go through them the less and less competition there is to the thing that you do so work on your mental focus on keeping your mentality and your mental toughness sharp recognize when it gets soft and recognize the importance and the reality of the path that you are on if you were on a mediocre path and you just wanted to be a regular human these tests are going to come anyway they're just going to come disguises other things okay they're gonna look different they're gonna feel different you're not gonna be able to pay your electric bill you're not gonna be able to eat at the places you want your ability to attract a mate is gonna be incredibly diminished okay you're gonna end up with someone you don't really want to be with you're gonna drive something you don't really want to drive you're gonna be embarrassed of what you did in your life those are fucking hard things to deal with okay but if you're gonna be an achiever you're gonna deal with different shit you're gonna deal with people laughing at you you're gonna deal with people not believing in you you're gonna deal with people trying to tear you down you're gonna deal with people who you know the situations that are just uncomfortable in different ways all right so we all go through this it looks different for everybody but the bottom line is if we prepare ourselves to go through these things and we expect these things to happen and we know what to do as they come you end up winning because everybody else can't make it through okay that's that's what this comes down to it's very simple I love it man let me actually this because I feel like this is something I've done personally where and I just want to get your opinion on it like is this a healthy way I guess to manage that stuff is that I've always just told myself you know what it could be worse it could be worse and maybe like I don't know like does that diminish the like all of the no the benefits that you can get from going through the hardship if you try to finish how hard it is no when things are very hard there is a very real truth to the fact that they could be way fucking harder okay and most of the people in our country the United States you know those people listen all over the world most of the people here have never really been through anything hard okay they've been through the normal life shit of hard right someone dies someone gets sick these kind of things lose a job but their day to day hard is fucking luxurious compared to someone who comes from you know some third world place so lacking the perspective of understanding what is truly hard actually makes your life feel much harder all right so when we could have the proper perspective about what's actually hard and we can remind ourselves that things could be way worse and the fact is most people have them way worse that can get us in a place of gratitude and when we get into a place of gratitude it makes it easier and we can think more clearly about what we need to move forward because most people when they get in that situation of being frustrated they're they're they panic and they get frazzled and they can't focus and they don't know what to do so they do nothing and that just makes the situation worse so I definitely think there's a lot of value to reminding yourself that no matter how dark shit is it could be a lot fucking darker 100% man love him and guys any question number two Andy I just got bent over with no Loub in business okay happens I like that he put the collar there's a comment that's very very important because I had a business relationship that I've been working on for the last year and a half I depend on this company as part of my supply chain for my business well they just cut themselves out without warning without consideration and I feel completely lost and out of control how have you handled being bent over with no Loub in the past versus how you handle that stuff now I feel like I might go to jail if I go with my first mind yeah you might I know what that feels like bro you know when someone really fucks with your livelihood that serious shit and you know I think people forget that I think people forget because of the internet when they fuck with people's livelihood with they're really doing to people where they're really putting them okay so I can understand that feeling because I've had a lot of people fuck with me along the way so I get that don't do that though the best way to win is to keep moving forward and smiling everybody's face and be like fuck you you know you ain't stopping me so back to the question how do we handle these situations when things happen that are out of our control well you have to understand that when you are a little fish in a big pond you're not going to get the respect from the bigger companies that other people get okay if that company that you're doing business with had seven other customers and they're all as big as you and they're all growing and then that company doesn't have the capacity to do more business for those people they're going to cut ties with the little ones so that they can expand their ability to service the ones that are bigger and that sounds like that's where you're at I can't imagine someone pulling their business from you are a vendor pulling their business from you unless they went out of business or B had to expand their ability to service someone bigger than you and that's normal when you're small you ask what is that what happens whenever you get bigger that doesn't happen when you get bigger because you become such a big part of these vendors business that they bet they bend over backwards okay so they don't have the ability to really fuck you you hold all the cards the bigger you get and your job is to go from where you are to where that place is right you want to go from the guy who's not getting the respect to the person that's getting all the respect in your businesses secured how do you do that well you got to get creative you're not facing anything that any that anybody else who's ever built anything hasn't had to face okay so how can you succeed without these people what are the alternatives who can I work with besides that is there an opportunity for me to bring that in house so this can never happen again how can I ensure that my business is never compromised by someone else's decisions ever again and this is why in the companies that I'm involved in we're constantly working towards vertical integration we are constantly working towards bringing everything within our control simply for that reason that you mentioned I don't want to have anybody else be in charge of the destiny or the outcome of our business okay but when you're a little guy and you don't have the capital that's just the reality so what you have to do is you've got to go out build relationships find companies that may be in the same position that you're in maybe they're a little smaller maybe they're a little hungrier maybe they'll do more for you because they are hungrier in fact I know they will because that's how it works and start working there okay but this this is normal this is reality when you're little you get no respect when you're big you hold all the cards and that that really never ends yeah I want to say this because I want to preface this question with this you know I've been been grateful enough to be around you for the last five years and I think what I what probably my most admirable piece of you Andy is that you're very you're an ethical businessman right and I've been able to see see that like very very clearly right and all your companies is very ethical and it's something that I've always like it's always been kind of puzzling to me because you know you have an entrepreneurship in business there's a saying well that's just business right and so it's like how how do you kind of like I guess differentiate something that that's just business versus somebody truly being unethical well I think we've I listen I think when we're younger and we're smaller it's easy for us to like if you were like if I was in that position which by the way I've been in that position I've been in a position before where I was working with a company who decided that they were going to work with someone else and then I was left holding the bag okay that's happened many times a lot of times in fact every time that it's happened I took it personally because it is personal to me you know this is my livelihood this is our people's livelihood okay but it's actually not a personal thing okay so you have to know and you have to be able to really truly separate what's personal and what's business okay business is business and that means it's not gonna always go the way you want you're not gonna always give what you want some people are gonna have different goals but to all of this I would say to your ethical question the reason that it's important to always do the right thing and have respect for people regardless of what happens is because this game is so fucking long you never know who you're gonna have to work with in the future if you burn a bridge now that same guy might come back in three years and fucking stop on your throat okay because that business is always evolving people are always moving their chest pieces and sometimes that guy who you got pissed off at maybe he's in a crunch and he cut you out because he was in a crunch and then maybe he gets his mood pieces moved in the right way and he calls you back and he says DJ I got a great opportunity bro I know it didn't work out here but like what about this okay so we can't burn bridges because the game is so long we don't know what bridge we're gonna have to cross and doing things ethically also important because when you do good things and you do them with the proper intent the universe and God rewards that back to you so if you're doing things with the wrong intent are you doing things with bad intent or you're being manipulative or you're lying or you're cheating or you stealing or you doing whatever you're gonna get that back a hundredfold eventually somewhere along the line so it's very important that you understand that what you put out is what you're gonna get this is why all you hate or mother fuckers never fucking win okay you cannot control your own ego to understand that there's plenty plenty of room for everybody to win and you see someone win you see them grow their business you see them drive a car bro I see this every day I post my life people are like look you don't want to see that well you know what there's lots of young kids that are inspired by my lifestyle that I've created for fucking 25 years that I have a duty to show them so that they can understand that there is a prize on the other end of that fucking struggle okay but you are so fucking stupid you can't understand that when you hate on that you're telling the universe I don't like winning I don't like winning because every time I see someone else win I don't like it okay what do you think the universe gives you it gives you exactly what you're asking for which is not winning all right so all you hate or dumbasses out there you need to understand this and because dude you're you're the one stomping on your own dick you know realize that so when you see someone win you should be happy if you're not happy you should figure out how to be happy you should stop yourself when you feel that little jealous tingle on the inside and be like I know that ain't right dude good if he did it I can do it and I can do it better right that's how the attitude should be yes yeah I was just thinking about the ethical you know is this just business part because like it just made me click like the the guy that left him maybe he's just looking out for his people right like his company has to grow like I feel like that's a love perspective people like I think that's highly likely you know I think that's highly likely I don't think it's a personal thing bro if you if it was personal you know you know you know when people don't like you personally right you know most of you guys you guys think you really got haters you don't fucking have any haters bro you don't you never had the internet come after you never been on fucking MSM or you know new stations across the country I've been on that shit plenty of times okay there's a big difference between hate and you imagining hate yeah right okay you know and what most people do is they set themselves up in this mind frame of if I do this then so and so is gonna think this and then somebody else is gonna think this and then somebody else is gonna think that and what we do is we imagine all these worst case scenarios but we can't put a name on who's going to think what and what does that mean it actually means that we are our own biggest haters so we're the ones hating on ourselves and keeping ourselves from taking action because of the things that we think may happen which likely never do happen so get out of your own fucking way I love it man I love it guys Andy our third and final question Andy how do you balance delayed gratification and enjoying life more now I am 26 years old I am working a full time job on the nights and weekends I am collaborating with a longtime friend with his growing small business I'm also working with my brother on his small business the point is I'm doing well I live in a small apartment and drive an 11-year-old compact car I could upgrade my lifestyle but I am too driven and want to spend that extra money on some business ideas how do you convince yourself to let go of the instant pleasures to achieve something far greater in the future my advice to anybody is to live below your means for as long as you possibly can until you can invest the proper amount of money to where the return that you're looking for long term is going to be reflective of the lifestyle that you're looking to build so you have to not be influenced by the culture and you have to look at yourself and say okay what am I trying to achieve here I am trying to achieve this lifestyle I am here currently I can afford a new BMW and I can afford a condo should I get the condo and the BMW or should I take the money and put it into the business well the answer is what do you want on the other end of it okay because the longer that you can maintain living small and invest your cash back into your business the bigger the back end reward is going to be now we talking here about my story a lot we talk about how the first 10 years I made 58,380 dollars for 10 years not a year that's cumulative for 10 years but what people don't realize is that by the year 2006 we were making money and we were investing it in our business and we were taking all the money even though we could have afford to pay ourselves for the next four or five years and pouring it directly into the business so that we could get the end result where we wanted it to be and once that engine was built by that investment and we had it running now we were able to you know take a little bit of here take a little bit there we're also along the way along the way we were able to figure out ways to make personal income that didn't affect the business okay so it all depends on where do you want to be in 20 years do you want to be the guy who is 26 years old driving a fucking an S class thinking you're the shit or an old fucking Bentley or a fucking old Lamborghini or do you want to be the guy when you're 40 that is flying on a jet and and going on a yacht and buying whatever fucking Bugatti he decides he wants to buy you know what I'm saying what do you want okay because I can tell you this that 26 year old guy by the time you're 40 that guy's gonna be broke and no one's gonna remember and what they are gonna remember is how douchebag he was trying to pretend like he was the shit when he wasn't the shit look at him now exactly in the last thing you want to do is embarrass yourself with with that kind of shit so let's be real about it yes you can reward yourself you sure can't but it is going to cost you what's that cost worth all right and that's how I would that's how I would how I would evaluate that now what I also think is that it's important to taste success sometimes I think it's important to reward yourself and show yourself that you're doing things along the right way but most people do that way too much and it ends up costing them you know what I mean so like you know it's it's there's nuance there yeah yeah for sure my dad told me one time I asked him I was gonna I was gonna get a 750 BMW this was back like when I thought huh that was sweet oh fuck yeah the big body beamers I always liked them yeah and this is back I don't know I didn't even know when this was I mean fucking 15 years ago at least and I said how do you he I asked him a similar question I said how do you know when when you and he his answer was you'll know you'll know you know what I don't know what the fuck that matter you know I feel like my answer is better you know now yeah you know I think I think I think it just comes down and then also you know like bro you know we only have limited time so we have to run that balance very carefully you know what I mean like like like Kobe situation for sure you know Kobe works as balls off for fucking 40 years decides he's gonna start spending time with his family and dies and it doesn't always work out the way we want so like when you pour yourself into an ambitious lifestyle into big dreams big goals you have to understand that it's very possible you could run out of time okay it's very possible it's a bet we make it's a gamble we make but it's it's the gamble required if you're gonna do anything relevant so there's no way around that that's a bet you're gonna have to make fuck dude you could get run over walking across street today who knows but if you want to be successful and you want to build big shit and you want to do something that's gonna take care of you financially and take care of your family financially and give you ultimate freedom to do whatever you want at any time you need to delay gratification for as long as possible that's the truth the richest mother fucker in the world well not the richest but one of the richest dude Elon Musk doesn't fucking own a whole bunch of shit no he flies around in a plane stays a hotel's in shit okay who else is known for that oh Warren Buffett he lives in the same house he's lived in for fucking 60 years dude you see what I'm saying like worth billions yes bro these people just it becomes it doesn't become a game of accumulation of shit it becomes winning who's the winner and that's what's gonna come for you too so like you know you may have a passion dude maybe your passion you know is watches or cars or whatever I like watches and I like cars those two things I like you know I I like winning better than that though you know what I'm saying like I've gone through those phases young doll has a lyric in one of his songs he goes I got tired of watches I started by cars I got tired of cars I started by a property all right so what he's talking about there is the natural progression of a entrepreneur and these little fucking trinkets and collection and toys eventually they lose their coolness now I am deeply passionate about cars but I haven't bought a watch and fucking five six years I'm give a fuck in fact I I really don't ever wear one anymore I don't even wear one unless I wear a suit so and I got a nice watch collection okay and worth millions of dollars but like I don't care you know I'm saying it's not cool to me anymore and the cars I mean fuck dude I had I got some cars coming but I haven't bought a new car in a couple years you know I drive the cool shit I got you know what fucking you know what I like I like winning I like reinvesting my money I like knowing that I come in here every day and I don't even take a paycheck and I help these motherfuckers grow this shit so we can win I fucking love that it makes me happy so but I'm in a different position I've been doing this 25 years I've been doing it since I was a young kid so every single person that I have ever heard of ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever that has built something amazing delay gratification for as long as possible and also was very fucking tired okay we have people talking about how tired they are I told I'm tired I'm tired I'm tired I'm tired no shit that's a prerequisite success every single thing that has ever been built every single accomplishment that's ever been accomplished every single thing that is worth mentioning in the history of fucking earth was built by people who retired every single thing okay so you getting on the internet and crying about how fucking tired you are or saying I'm tired good you're supposed to be tired can you execute when you're tired that's the question that you need to be answering so you know the late gratification discipline over motivation 100% of the time those two things will get you very far falling into the trap of instant gratification because you watch all these dorks on the internet who don't have shit talk about how much money they have when they're all clearly lying that's gonna get you right where where everybody else is which is here today gone tomorrow you want to build something great take all the money you make pour it back in do that over and over and over again until you got the engine built when the engine starts building if you want to continue to pour money in you can but you don't have to I love it man I love it guys it's a hell of a way to start a Monday man let's get to it all right guys we'll see you for CTI tomorrow
