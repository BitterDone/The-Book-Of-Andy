Yeah, ever Yeah, 28 years and you Well, so but uh, yeah speaking of bees though. I got something up here. I don't know if you've seen this yet speaking of bees You see this vegan raw food died influencer dies of starvation What fucking publications is this new yore post yeah, well, this could be total bullshit Okay, this person could have died just of anything and they could be saying it starvation Like they have no listen real talk. I mean she does look pretty thin She she looks pretty thin, but like I'm being real like I don't can't trust it No, and you don't know that the vegan diet killed her like bro look Real talk. Yeah, they just tried to fucking hammer me For telling people to drink fucking water. Yeah, right Okay, so like we have to be real like did she die of the vegan diet or did she die because she had an eating disorder because She looks like she probably has anorexia. Yeah, you know, which bro that shit is no joke real thing. Yeah, yeah It's real thing. I don't know man. I just saw this. I thought it was crazy. Yeah, this uh vegan influencer Zana samsonova as recently died of starvation after subsisting exclusively off a diet of exotic fruit in Malaysia According to our friends and family. She was 39 years of age Now the Russian national who frequently promoted raw foods on social media where she was known to her millions of viewers on tiktok Facebook and Instagram as Zana darts reportedly died July 21st after finally seeking medical treatment during a tour in southeast asia according to local media outlets quote a few months ago in Sri Lanka she already looked exhausted with swollen legs Uh, oozing lymph One unidentified friend told news flash quote. They sent her home to seek treatment. However, she ran away again when I saw her and Pocate I was horrified. Yeah, dude. This is a this is a mental. This is a real mental eating disorder like it's a People don't understand how destructive eating disorders actually are well people always think like problems are like with people who are overweight and not understanding that there's there There's some legitimate issues on the other end of that structure. No a lot. Yeah, there's a lot and people people people people Just as much from being Starving themselves in anorexia as you do from like just being a fucking four seven hundred pound person. Yeah, you know, I'm saying like It's sad and I I know some people who have struggled with this in real life One of my friends from college went through this and she was in a hospital for over a year Because she was bulimic and she got to the point where she would throw up and It was no like you you and I think make yourself throw up like gag yourself stick your fingers in your throat and shit But like these people what happens is And what well, well, I don't know if it's I'm not an expert in this But what happened to her was she got to a point where she couldn't keep any food now And every time she would eat she would throw up and so like dude it made her super fucking sick She got real skinny and people usually think when they think bulimia they think like Chubby people that struggle with overeating and binging But when they get to a certain point and progress to a certain point they end up losing a bunch of weight because their body can't take in any food Yeah, I'm very dangerous like the esophagus with the stomach acids. I mean there's a lot of issues that come with that and look dude We can split hairs on on I mean go back to the headline here. This is sad. This is this bothers me because You know, this is another example of these fucking assholes in the media Pointing at something that really isn't the point. Mm-hmm. The point here is this woman sick. She's got it eating disorder I can you could tell from looking at her. I mean maybe maybe she didn't but it fucking is pretty clear that she did yeah Um And they're blaming a vegan diet. There's lots of people who are vegans and dude you could split hairs You can say you know the vegan diets Not as healthy. I personally believe that I've seen enough evidence scientifically to show that There's still people who do it for ethical reasons like they don't want to fucking kill animals I can respect that. Mm-hmm It may not be the ideal program and it may not be the healthiest program And if you guys remember if you listen to me long enough I used when this thing all came on back in like 14 15 16 17. I was very critical of the vegan Movement because it's not as healthy. They were trying to sell it as health right and it's not health But there is a there is a cause for it For ethical reasons and I can respect that yeah, and um So like all you diets sell it's out there, you know, you can say oh the vegan diets unhealthy I agree with you. I think it is But there's people that have beliefs and they stand by those beliefs. I can actually respect that sort of effort There's lots of people who live on a vegan diet. They don't fucking die most of them don't most more pretty healthy They might be deficient certain things, but they're not like I'm a supplement those other areas Yes, they're not like this woman And so like this headline is just another example of fear-mongering shit Like bro these people literally Like I want you to really think about what's happened here like on this show For years and years and years I've been telling you how the media lies in the media targets people that start to get a voice They attacked me in real time as I'm showing you this For telling you all to drink water Like you guys should really think about that. No, you should the main point and by the way They're guilty of defamation because there's facts that were unknown about that situation with 75 hard from last cti but the point of this is that They lie like this in every article that you read about every single fucking thing left or right Yes, and this is why you cannot listen to the shit that they tell you to get upset about This is why you cannot let yourself be outraged when they tell you to be outraged You don't know what the truth is they're willing to completely lie about it and make shit up And that's what we're dealing with, no, and this is another example this woman here And I you know, I don't know what the article says, but she didn't die from vegan diet She died because she's anorexic and has a mental mental disorder that's causing her to be anorexic and it's fucking sad No like that and this is just another like clickbait agenda thing for them to get hot on Mm-hmm. It's whatever do you know, it's real shit man It's real shit. I just thought that was interesting to come up man um And uh, yeah this cti. Yeah, I got some good shit for you guys remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links Videos go to antificecela.com you can find them there or you can also If you're on youtube check down in the description below and you find them linked there as well Dude the main point I want to make on this is like bro consider what they're telling you and this is this goes for any media source This go any all but there's bra I was on the phone with Eric Schmidt today, okay, the United States senator By the way, he'll be on the show on Thursday for Fridays release. I saw that okay, so We're gonna talk about free speech We were talking about the media today because I was asking him about Some business that I'm going to handle with these media outlets You understand, mm-hmm, okay, and I was wondering okay Well, how should I build this certain business to get what I'm going to get from them, which is a lot of fucking money um And we got on this topic of how they lie manipulate and and just Fucking make shit up and dude this was not like people who like you guys who are listening who are like 17 18 19 20 21 you guys don't remember it being any other way But it used to not be this way like it these people did not just make up stories There used to be independent journalists inside these organizations that did stories that were like, you know Things that they thought were important now they've corralled all these young journalists They're not journalists anymore and just like Gina said on the last show They're dictating to them what they can and can't write so the media that we have is not even free and fair media at all anymore No matter where you're listening. Yeah, it's a bunch of people that are corralled and then forced to write things Along the agenda that's acceptable in that organization and that is not news. That's manipulation Yeah, see I challenge it. I don't I don't think like now know what we know now I don't I don't think there's ever been a time in media or journalism where it's been Like come like truly free and accurate I think the differences now is because we are in this digital age and we have You know, there shows like really F where you can counter the narrative the spread of information like it's more instant now Whereas like back then remember like There was no way to really counter any of that narrative. That's how I'm saying I know because I was an adult. I wasn't I was 20 years old in 2001. Yeah, okay I was 21 actually the I remember watching the news there was reporters like Chris Hanson mm-hmm Who would do these investigative Actual real stories by the way that one was on pedophilia. Where the fuck did that ago? Yeah, where's that story now? Okay, but but my point is there are reporters There were reporters in the media that reported actual news You're saying what you're saying I think is that there was always a narrative that be pushed correct That they pushed that I agree with that correct. Yeah, but within the media They have eliminated the independent German journalism and created just one big propaganda now. It's machine. Yes So I'm not arguing that it wasn't always uh Uh an agenda You know what I'm saying? I mean, let's be real dude like this idea that we go around the country to fucking fight in the name of freedom It's total or around the world and fight bullshit. Yeah, we go around the world We send our fucking troops. We fight for globalist agendas. That's why the rest of the country's fucking hate our military We are the iron fist In a white glove that's red white and blue That that goes around they get us all riled up about this patriotic stuff and they go around and then we and we do the dirty work For NATO and the globalist agenda across the globe and this is why You're seeing a lot of anti-American movement in all these other countries they understand that we're fragile right now So they're unifying they bro listen they hope we become a third world country. Yeah, like real talk and our administration is a Helping them do that and I mean do those an argument to say that that's the reason why we've been doing that is to get to this exact point correct But the agenda has always been that like they're They have used people and the belief And what America should stand for to get them to go fight In places that we should never be for causes that should never be a cause for us to fight about That only helps them and it kills our best and brightest people And they do that for a number of reasons one It helps their finances But two it helps eliminate The strongest most capable people from society which keeps them in power. Yeah, you understand So whenever whenever this this idea of patriotism comes from those people in Washington, DC You could bet your ass they got a reason to stir that up because they don't want that shit high Unless they're going to start a war and they need you to go fight it for All right, when patriotism comes from people like us from within And we say this is our country. This is not their country. This is our shit. This is not their shit That's real patriotism That's that's the real America that I believe in that that we do this show to help Hopefully curve culture into a place of that. Yeah, you know and So I agree with you in my point like the the fucking media has been super guilty of of getting us To become the useful idiots for these communists at the global level And they do it in the name of freedom and you know that's going to piss some people off But it's reality. Yeah, like my my grandfather who was killed in fucking France right after d day who was on the beach in d day You know they they they don't tell those people all the all the shit They just say hey go over fight this fucking war because these people are this and this and this and this and this and this and this And that goes for every fucking war that we've ever fought Fight abroad so we don't have to fight at home. That's right You know and like bro the days of lying to our American men to go fucking fight these wars should be over This is bullshit Like we can't say oh we're going to fucking you know Remove power from Saddam Hussein because he's got weapons of master structure. We never fucking had him And then there's no kind of how many how many people how many Iraqi citizens that were innocent died in that You see what I'm saying Like bro if you just like we'll be able to like pull yourself out of like your position as an American and look at it from their perspective You would see us quite different. Yeah You know and and dude we we the people have to Figure out how to Be the real America not not this fake America that they're making us to be you know what I mean Yeah, true shit man True shit guys tell us what you think of their conversation But uh, what that means said let's get into our first headline headline number one Uh, this is a good one right next door to us brother headline number one reads Illinois governor JB Pritzker signs law allowing DACA illegal aliens to police Americans Then right across the bridge man, so interesting topic here. So uh, this is a bright bar article reading Illinois governor JB Pritzker has signed into law a plan that allows foreign nationals with work permits Some of whom are illegal aliens to become police officers in the sanctuary state Democrat legislators uh, with a super majority in the Illinois House and Senate past legislation in June That opens law enforcement jobs to thousands of illegal aliens enrolled in the deferred action for childhood arrivals or DACA program As well as thousands of other foreign nationals with work permits from the federal government quote an individual Against whom immigration action has been deferred by the United States citizenship and immigration service under the federal DACA process Is allowed to apply for the position of police officer deputy sheriff or special policemen subject to specified requirements a summary of the legislation states Late last week Pritzker signed the legislation into law which takes effect immediately In the sanctuary state of California governor Gavin Newsom has made it possible for illegal aliens to become police officers on the local county and state levels All right now for those of you don't know Um, this is from the United States citizen and immigration service. This is their definition of DACA for those of you that don't know right so DACA Says on June 15th 2012 the secretary of Homeland Security announced that certain people who came to the United States as children And meet several guidelines may request consideration for deferred action for a period of two years subject to renewal They are also eligible to request work authorization The third action is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against an individual for a certain period of time The third action does not provide lawful status Now to be eligible they have to be under the age of 31 As of June 15th 2012 Came to the United States before reaching their 16th birthday Um have resided in the US since 2007 like there's a list right and I was running like man I wonder how many people are actually eligible under the DACA right and so far according to their numbers There's about a half a million people okay Um What are your what are your thoughts on this? I have a lot of thoughts. What are your thoughts Do you know I pull you over full? I mean like what are we like I don't I don't know like to me to have a person Here's the thing here. Let's talk fundamentals right as a police officer This is what a lot of people don't don't get right as a police officer You have the power to literally remove an American citizen's rights and freedom and freedom Like remove your discretion on your word and your word alone And I think as an American citizen that's something that we hold pretty highly right we hold our rights our freedoms Right we hold that stuff in pretty hybrid gardens was a police officer To have the power on their word and their word alone to be able to to strip you of those rights Right To pass that power to someone who does not have those rights Is mind blowing to me right and I mean there's there's cows of things to go into this there I mean the I mean okay, they go through the same laws and academies right But it's like how are how is somebody who does not have the the rights that I have have the right to take the rights that I have Like that's a fundamental question. It doesn't make sense Yeah, and I think the the question that really should be thought about is why would they want that Hmm Why would why would the government want that why would the democrats want that Think yeah, what no really why would they want? Yeah Is it possible that they want it because they realize that people are beginning to lose Favour for their thoughts ideas and positions and they need those people To force them because they're a statistical minority In this country meaning the democrats the ones in power. Mm-hmm because that's what they are And it's not by a little it's by a lot. It's by a fuck time. It's by a lot Dude when I have when I have people in my family who are mega far left I'm talking like mega far left like don't talk to me for 20 years right me message on instagram saying now this is this is wrong We need to all come together. They're done So these people have been losing power and losing power and losing power And they don't have anybody to enforce their bullshit. So how do you get someone to enforce their bullshit? Well you You take the class of people that you've allowed to come here and by the way you've allowed them to come here You've allowed them to have preference over your own citizens such as what's happening in the city of Chicago right now um and Not only do you let them have it you tell the people of Chicago who are tax paying citizens that we have an obligation and a duty to serve these people All right, these people do not pay taxes here They're allowed to get jobs and then when they don't pay their tax nothing happens to them What happens when American citizens doesn't pay their tax? Oh, they go to fucking jail Right, so it's sure that I seem like Maybe this whole idea that the American citizen is being actually replaced Because they don't want to go along with communism is a real thing that's happening No, and I think you would have to have very low IQ and low common sense and high indoctrination To actually be able to observe the data and see that that's not happening that is what's happening and You ask what I thought here's what I think this is the first step To them handing the the country over to a third world population that has come here from all these other places And removing the quality American citizen the people who built this fucking country that's us Okay, that's me you all the other people that we've known our whole lives and given preference to this new voter base that will continue to support their mission and Now they're arming them This Honestly, this should scare the fuck out of every single person listening I wonder how the black communities of Chicago are going to feel about the people Hold on hold on the people that they are already fed up with Who are harassing them who are raping them who are causing crime in their communities on top of the crime that's already happening in their communities Who aren't abiding by any American cultural norms whatsoever you could say whatever you want about black people and why people We're pretty much the fucking same and how we do everything and these motherfuckers coming from all these other places ain't Okay, and they're fucking with these people's little kids and they're doing all kinds of fucked up shit This is happening if you're paying attention to what they're saying in Chicago They just had a meeting on this this past week where like there was one gentleman who stood up and said dude We're gonna handle this our own way if you don't handle it. Yeah, and I I was fucking amazing. I think he was serious Um, and I hope they do because it needs to be handled but What do they think what do those people think about One of they already hate the police anyway, so now you're gonna have some un-American police That don't give a fuck that you're a citizen of this country Who don't even care That's insane now I do fucking bro. It's insane. It's insane. Now I'm doing I'm JB Pritzker Like you they have a super majority You have a super majority Okay That black people are the reason that Eleanor has that super majority And now the super majority is making rules for the new protected class Not the black communities the illegal immigrants who shouldn't even be here. They should not even fucking be here To actually impose their will as a police officer on those communities This ain't gonna be good dude. No Maybe you guys should stop voting for these fucks and And wake the fuck up and realize that you've been used and played and now they're done with you And they're throwing you to the side and they're replacing you with these new people That's what the fuck is happening to black America right? It is it's a great replacement Now I mean now listen. I'm sure there's some bleeding hearts out there right? They're like, oh no, this is a great thing You know, okay, I don't like dude. I try to be very like I always try to see okay. Well, what is the counter what like What logical reason is there listen? There's none there's none right now now to be fair on the show right like Naturalization for an American city for a for a citizen for a person that wants to become an American citizen It's a process right and there are a few shortcuts that you can use right like one of those things are Um is naturalization through military service right where you know citizens who are non-US citizens They can serve in the United States military and they have to serve for at least a year they can be granted citizenship I'm okay with that. I don't really have a problem with that right like that somebody's coming to this country that believes in this country Right, they start to go through all the naturalization But they decide to serve our country come to citizen. I don't really have an issue with that. I do But the difference is Well, I think the difference is here though. It's like you know our military does not like they don't police our citizens right the military is separate from citizens We're talking what what what this is talking about. Yeah, we're not yet, but what we're talking about here You're stepping on the land mine that that is out there inadvertently Not yet What happens when they do start allowing these people to all just join the military because there's no What would solve the recruitment issue in the military right now? Yeah This is true and do you think we do have a lot of military age males going over? Yeah, and do you think that those people Would give two fucks about turning on the American public? Hmm See you're you're starting to understand what I'm trying to say yeah Okay, and I have a major issue with them serving in our military for that reason no listen We have rules for a reason Okay, you guys can say big it you could say racist you could say whatever fuck you. I don't care I don't care what the fuck you call me and by the way Nobody cares what you call people anymore. I don't fucking care Okay, if we say this is that And it's a factual statement and it can be proven by fact and you call me this or that or this I don't fucking care. It doesn't work anymore. It doesn't work on me It doesn't work on the people listening to show it doesn't work on anybody nobody gives a fuck because you all exhausted all the names So now we're gonna talk in facts and we're going to point out facts We're going to say who's in charge of what who's making these decisions? Who's doing this and the people that are doing it are doing it and unless you could argue that with a factual argument On the other side Your argument is invalid. Yeah, not just a name call your name once you start calling names you've lost mother fucker Okay, I'm done with this crybaby fucking bullshit these people pull fuck you Yeah, I'm whatever you say I am bro. Whatever to fuck you. I'm also right. That's right I want to hear your fucking facts. Yeah, this is not good. Yeah, and bro We have rules for a fucking reason Rules the rules that we have here say that if you're gonna come here as a citizen or certain things you gotta do You gotta go through the immigration process You gotta learn some things about American culture and then pledge to fucking live that way and then You know take the test and you gotta become a citizen. Is that pretty accurate? Yeah, so Modat's been through the process Am I missing anything or is that it? Not you got it already. Okay, so Are you proud to be an American? Absolutely because you fucking earned it you went through all that process Now we're allowed in all these people who never go through that process to come over here and they don't give two fucks about being American All right, none of these people should be here and I don't care what you call me call me whatever to fuck you on Every immigrant should be welcome to come here if they go through the immigration process the way that it's set up And has been set up since my family came here in the early 1900s That's the truth. No, and this idea of letting these people flow across the border and come over here for any reason at all Is unacceptable to me those people should all be sent to where they come from 100% that's my position and I don't give I don't have I don't have a heart on this like you guys are bleeding hearts. Oh, you're so cruel.

It's a culture And you know what the culture is we're tired of the shit. That's the culture that he's created we're tired of the shit So you could get a video of Donald Trump taking a shit and a lady's fucking face and nobody will give two fucks That's real shit Nobody would care. Yeah, well because we know the other option is a thousand times worse And that's why I'm just saying bro like this the cult you guys continue with this cancel shit and ain't gonna fucking work And ain't gonna work. They got the numbers man if you don't have the facts to back up what you're saying and people are asking real questions And you can't answer them Then you lost that that's where I take it. Yeah real shit man Guys keep this cruise going. We got headline number two headline number two reads Devon Archer hunter Biden's former business partner ignores questions while entering house hearing they finally got him in This is good today. Yeah, today. This is good. Yeah, I think they try to arrest him or something yesterday. They did yeah So so well there's a little new one. There's a little something that came from the media allegedly. Yeah, right. I don't know Yeah, so this is a Fox News article guys reading Devon Archer hunter Biden's longtime friend and fellow barisma board member ignored questions from reporters while entering Monday's congressional hearing Where is he where he is expected to testify against the Biden family? Archer smiled as he was peppered with several questions upon entering the O'Neil House office building where he is expected to give close door testimony To the House over site committee on president Biden's involvement with hunter Biden's business dealings including that he set in on over two dozen business calls with his son as vice president The Republican led House over site committee invited Archer to testify as he was sentenced last year to one year in prison for his role in a $60 million bond fraud involving various clients Now what you alluded to Apparently they sent out his arrest date or tried to send out his arrest date, right? So let's let's dive into that part So this daily wire headline reads Comer hit DOJ over odd timing of letter requesting hunter Biden's business partner report to prison So he got a you know arrested and quotes on paper, but they didn't actually have the the start date of that sentence, right? Um But they sent it out doing a very weird time, and so this is uh, this is a video of James comb are talking about that on Fox news Check this out first. Let me get to this breaking news I have in my hand a letter from the Department of Justice that was sent to the southern district of New York on Saturday Uh, by the way Devin Archer is testifying on Monday. Do you ever see you usually see the DOJ send letters like this out on a Saturday? Never Never this is the first time I've ever heard of the Department of Justice doing anything on a Saturday So what is this letter? Can you walk us through it? Uh, the government is a prize in the court of the status of Devin Archer's appeal of his judgment of conviction and They were asked how how the fuck you gonna run a media company and put this woman on there to reach it? I can barely fucking listen to this No thanks to her she might be the smartest woman. I'm sure she's much smarter than me Holy shit, that's gonna be a purgatory, bro. You'll do You know This ain't no different than listen to racial matter, bro. It's it's bad like It's bad. It's naively. I think that's what's getting off Well, I'll try to make it through continue. We only got a little bit left All right That the court set a surrender date for the defendant to report to a facility Uh, please walk us through what this letter says Yeah, the letter from the Department of Justice is trying to nudge the judge to go ahead and Senate's Devin Archer For something unrelated to what we're gonna be talking to him about tomorrow It's odd that it was issued on a Saturday and it's odd that it's right before he scheduled to come in to have an opportunity Opportunity to speak in front of the House Oversack Committee and tell the American people the truth about what really went on With Burisma So, you know, I don't know if this is a coincidence Maria or this is another example of the weaponization of the Department of Justice But I can't tell you this the links to which the Biden legal team is gone to try to intimidate our witnesses To coordinate with the Department of Justice and to certainly coordinate with the Democrats on the House Oversack Committee To encourage people not to cooperate With our investigation to encourage banks not to turn over Bank records to encourage treasury not to let us have access to those suspicious active reports It's very troubling and I believe that uh, you know, this is another violation of the law. This is obstruction of justice But nevertheless, we're gonna continue to move forward and try to present the American people with the facts and the truth about This president and his family. Yeah, so and then and then after that the DOJ they come back. They respond. It's in another letter um And that letter they said it's uh the government rights to follow up on its July 29th 2023 letter Apprising the Court of Second Circuits mandate affirming the judgment of conviction into this matter The government understands that the defendant is scheduled to provide testimony tomorrow to be clear The government does not request and has never requested that the defendant surrender Oh, oh, oh Bullshit right this is cover your ass. This is CYA And to me, this is just sloppy right which which eludes to your point. They're falling apart bro They're desperate dude. They're starting to get super fucking sloppy with their moves man and To me it's it's it's a it's a good sign They're a car they're caught. Yeah, they're caught like this like this is this is Bill Clinton times on it. It's just it. Oh, dude It's not comparable. You'll kill you'll click on a fucking blowjob. Right. Okay. This is we're not fucking talking about getting your fucking dick suck We're talking about motherfucker taking money so much reason and making decisions in the interests of that money over the interests of us The people who elected these people allegedly into power. Yeah Like this is not this is not getting a blowjob Like this is not that it's not comparable. No And most people don't know that like people keep like I've seen I've talked to a few people about this issue And they don't understand because like when you say the word when you say the sentence like You know, he took money for policy decision They don't understand what that means how exactly that work. Yeah, they don't like well and he was vice president of the time Yeah, he was which furthermore sell out you immunity to the laws of this country when I only that bro like okay I'm VP right now if I know that the plan because all of the global elites are all tied in if I know the plan is I'm going to be president one day you give me money now when I get there. I got you And what are we doing right now? Who did you take money from? You took money from Ukraine? What are we doing with Ukraine right now? Well, who else he take money? He also took money from China. What are we doing with China right now? They're allowed to do whatever they want What are we doing with China right now? Oh We're serving America up on a platter We have open borders where thousands upon thousands upon thousands of military age males a Large percentage of them Chinese military age may age males alone with no families no wives we depleted the the oil reserves to the all-time low We've sent our military equipment to Ukraine We we have Overprinted currency to devalue people's buying power We have firms like black rock buying up all the excess inventory so there's a manufactured Supply issue where it's driving the price up while people's buying power goes down Okay, the average American citizen is paying $9,000 more per year today than they were in 2019 all right We have crime in the in the cities going insane We have racial division at an all-time perceived high. I don't think it's at all time high they wanted that high But I don't think it's there. I think people have woken up a little bit We have all of these things so so So you say oh well, you know What are they doing? You know, that's normal for being this or politics bro Is it normal for the leader of of America? To put us intentionally in a vulnerable position to where we could literally Be conquered Is that is that is that acceptable as a president of the United States? Because I feel like some people are just like they don't understand what's happening. No Like dude, we can't just manufacture military equipment and the fuck it snap our fingers. We don't have it It's over there You understand that? Oh Intruder breaks in your house and you need a gun and your gun is at work and you forgot to bring it home. Guess what You're fucked and we're fucked right now people don't even understand it. That's real shit Yeah, right now. We're just waiting on that rubber band to pop. Yeah, and stretched all the way back The only thing keeping this country from being conquered is the fucking 2a It's no no no no no no no no So, you know, why is this such a big deal? I don't know It's this little thing called treason that back in the day. These to hang people for hmm, you know I don't know what the fuck people think dude like I'm I'm in disbelief that we're even here Like I'm in disbelief that our country's being dismantled and we're like sitting here watching it Like it's it's it's surreal to me All people have to do is not compile anything to say all you have to do is not get angry not get outraged Not when they say jump don't jump when they say where a fucking mask you say fuck you actually when they say jump you fucking duck Yeah, like it is complete obviously Look at Jim Kramer. They got Jim Kramer on TV calling all these stack plays and fucking the joke on the internet is you do A opposite of what he says why would they put someone on TV To and they ever like do you really think that he has that bad luck bro is day after day. Okay, so so he's up there Oh, that fucking needs to go to jail. Okay, listen. They all need to go like for real So I just think about I'm sorry. I just think about like you know the fucking 60 year old man It's like looking for stock advice and he fucking turns on Kramer. Oh Cell just get into the buy this stock right now and fuck goes up people loses all of their fucking shit That's right. That's fucked up shit. That's right. They're trying to avoid financial security for American citizens And it's not like you take out this bad luck. It's not just one off like this shit's happening every Fucking couple of days well for it to become the joke of the internet. It's probably consistently happening I don't know his actual trade history or his results or his track record, but I'm according to Most of the people that I fucking know that invests. It's not very good. Listen if it's on the meme. It's pretty fucking true Yeah, well, we all know that There has to be some truth to humor people wouldn't laugh. That's real man. That's real shit Well, shit, but guys, tell us what you do. I just think jumping on this conversation. Let us know in the comments hashtag snitches. Bro, I I really hope we get someone that's willing to do what needs to be done. Yeah That is also like Normal enough to not turn into like a fucking who knows a line. That's right I mean like I can listen like we're seeing you right up to it We're seeing a swing We're seeing a swing to the right Which is already getting in my opinion Ridiculous like we're seeing a lot of like and dude we've always seen on the left left can call you whatever they want They could say whatever they want they can call you this or that or this they can be racist towards you And it doesn't count. It's always been that way And now I see it on the right and I see a lot of people on the right Generalizing and saying racist shit Thinking that they're doing something good or that because the the momentum's over there and they get away with it They're saying it like that's not good either But I'm regulated dude listen If we want a healthy country and we want an America that actually like Represents what America's supposed to represent We can't fall for the pendulum swing the other way either like it has to be Common sense and we have to have strong accountability for the people who keep allowing it to go back and forth Which is intentional by the way because both that both those people at those polar opposites are playing the same game together You just don't know it Guys are third and final headline headline number three headline number three reads Rand Paul announces official criminal referral says email shows faulty covid testimony absolutely a lie shocking Tracking this is crazy. So so Senator Rand Paul out of Kentucky Has announced an official criminal referral to the Department of Justice With regard to dr. Anthony Fauci Paul pointed to an email from February 2020 in which Fauci detailed a call with British medical researcher Jeremy Far Who was director of the welcome uh trust at the time According to Fauci Those on the task force call including Francis Collins former director of the National Human Genome Research Institute and other quote-unquote highly credible Scientists with expertise and evolutionary biology expressed concern about the fact upon viewing the sequences of several isolates of the N covid There were mutations in the virus that would be most unusual to have evolved naturally in the bats And that there was a suspicion that this mutation was intentionally inserted Here's the video of Rand Paul talking about uh the situation on Fox six This was never about science. This was about the business of science It was about the money follow the money trail and you see millions of dollars exchanging hands in the first few months of 2020 to the people who came out and said nothing to see here couldn't have happened in the lab But there's probably never been a cover-up in the history of all politics That was so completely documented that they were lying to us Every one of their private emails says oh my goodness looks like it might have come from the lab Oh my goodness looks like it was manipulated and this goes on and on and on Even so much as to say the one lead virologist who's saying it's all kooky and conspiracies theory to say it came to the lab He's saying it private. This is no conspiracy theory This is not a fringe theory in all likelihood it could have come from the lab But then public they print an article that Anthony Fauci commissions them He basically says you need to get this written up as soon as possible He works on them to edit this and when it is published It says explicitly this virus is not a laboratory construct They none of them believe that they knew with certainty it wasn't but they thought it would harm the business of science It would harm our relations with China. Yeah, so you so you got that so this is good right? Okay, Fauci's being criminally referred cool But dude did you see this shit in California? Unassuming warehouse in California turned out to be a legal Chinese run virus laboratory That was genetically engineering mice and experiments with HIV herpes and malaria did you see that shit? right Now for those of you guys who don't know just quickly a central California city is reeling after a non-distrib warehouse turned out to be an elicit lab Replete with stored bio hazards including coronavirus HIV and malaria If it were not for an errant host sticking out of the back of the warehouse last spring city officials would not have known That a shady biotech company with links to China at set up shop there filling it with industrial freezers hundreds of vials of pathogens and about 1000 dead and dying lab mice Um now this took place. I believe it was the city of red reading Let me see you get the actual name really and really California um And then so all the just where it's like it's weird. There's always burst of like things coming out at the same time about all of this thing There's somehow all connected But I wanted to talk about the study that also just came out Um, that has been published on med uh Rex 4 Which is sponsored by the BMJ sponsored by Yale coach bring harbor laboratory um And the the the title of the study is evidence for ever saw transfer Of SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral immunity And basically it's outlining things that we've talked about on the show um Aljones have talked about it That vaccine shedding is real And not only is it real that they know about it And they continue to lie to the American people Um, and they concluded in this study Okay, they're given these options uh Observation's we hypothesize that droplet and erasized antibody transfer might occur between individuals much like a droplet erasized virus particles can be exchanged by the same route They basically found that vaccinated people They can pass the antibodies that are coming from these vaccines through skin to skin contact Inair particles through respiration Whether you're wearing a mask or not And of course lies on either this they knew this back in april of 2020 This is their own document Where they literally talk about exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding and they they they had it listed out in the studies That it could happen even a male participant who's receiving the vaccine or has discontinued the vaccine Exposes a female partner prior to or around the time of cons uh of conception They knew about this shit Who are they tell us There was no evidence the COVID-19 vaccines this cause of shedding But i've also thought this was interesting too on the cdc's website the most common myth that they have to address Is vaccine shedding That's off the cdc website. This is off the cdc website. This is the number one most common myth And uh vaccine shedding is the release of discharge or any of the vaccine components inter outside the body can only occur when a vaccine contains a live Week in version of a virus Not all virus not all vaccine Anyone who got on this I mean fouches one of those people that should be held accountable But i mean you know I All of these people should be held accountable for what they did it was crimes against humanity And i said that all through covid. I've said that up until now I'm going to continue to say that until everybody understands what just happened and It's It's fucked up because Here's another thing Those people who You know How do you feel how how do you feel when you were standing up and saying i'm not getting the vaccine during that time During that time i mean how were those people treated? Oh bro by public bro right we were for a photo you're treated like shit. Yeah We're treating like less than human There's tons and tons of clips of people saying ridiculously awful things Like jimmy kimmel saying oh want to intensive care bed, you know Well vaccine come right in now a vaccine sorry rest in peace weezy All right, we had how we're stern You know saying fuck these people we had all these all these big names and every fucking Hollywood talking head every media outlet Made the unvaccinated feel like Like they were the total fun they were totally outcast from society We had people on tv saying We should outcast these people from society. They should not be able to go to the store They should not be able to go to restaurants and there were restaurants and stores that you could not go to that did it Yeah, okay, and now it's turned out that not only were the people against the vaccine correct that it was potentially dangerous and didn't work but We were also correct when we said that shit will shed on to people around these people And so now we're in the reverse situation we're unvaccinated people Literally have a scientific Reason to stay the fuck away from vaccinated people legitimately. No We're gonna see how it plays out. What do you do if we go right? How do you how do you reconcile that as a human being real talk like I was I got destroyed every single day during that time as did you in public Now we're being asked to have mercy for the people who could actually potentially give us that shit that we that we now know is harmful That we now know wasn't effective who also fucking attacked the shit out of us And now we're we're gonna we have to accept them It's a very it's a very weird situation and I don't think the answer is to do what they did to us to them Yeah, that's not what I'm saying But what I'm saying is like y'all that did that shit y'all should be ashamed of yourselves You were all wrong. You all got lied to you all played you were all played against each against us And we were just trying to help you we're just trying to help you not be in this situation that you're in now You know what the what's eerie to me about this vaccine shedding shit. They'll do it is like guys if you guys remember it like I think back Brother trying to kill everybody the interviews the interviews with Fauci um The one lady who was the director of the CDC Do you remember how confident they were saying that we will reach herd immunity You know how like bro they were so confident They were putting people in fucking jail in certain parts of the world for not taking the vaccine And so now it makes me think man like like I'm I'm honestly bro Like I kind of want to go get my blood check to see if the fucking antibodies are in there like Well, I mean we ain't around anybody ever has it. How would you know I mean you know, I'm saying like how do we know I didn't get it Who fuck you been around Well, I'm just saying now so here are the conversations that are gonna start happening. Yeah, are you fucking vaccinated? Yeah, get the fuck away from me. Yeah, right and like now that opens up a whole new fucking layer of I know I know I know that's that's a problem. That's what I'm trying to point out I'm not trying to point out that They should be exiled like they did to us. I'm trying to point out This puts us in a really weird position And you mother fuckers who actually got this shit ashamed everybody you better have some fucking grace and you should apologize What the fuck you did because you were wrong and we were fucking right That's real shit. This dude belongs in public accountability like I was talking about. Yeah, okay And if you want like look do you want to really talk about it or really talk let's really talk about it They're trying to kill us. Okay, they're not trying to kill a certain segment of society. They're trying to kill everybody They ain't them all right the first first of all they tricked you This is my opinion in the speculation They tricked you into getting this vaccine They tricked you into shutting down your business so they could take your money They tricked you into begging for a stimulus even knowing that it would fuck you later that all this shit's intentional All right They knew that the shedding was happening so they knew that they were gonna reach to people that didn't even want the vaccine anyway They knew this All right Now the question that we should all be asking is why and here's why I think why These people have been talking about the population being a problem for two decades There's plenty of video of all of these people Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum, Kamala The heads of the heads of all of these financial places all of them talking about depopulation Okay Now when they talk about depopulation everybody assumes that they're talking about someone else But if they would assume that they're talking about them they would feel differently about the discussion of depopulation And so people didn't really raise an eyebrow But now you know, let's look at what's happened You were tricked into giving up your money You were tricked into taking a medication that was actually harmful that didn't do what they told you was going to do You were also then tricked into taking something that would spread to the people who didn't take it All right You have the emergence of AI Right Not even a year ago As a commercial product And it's getting better and better and better exponentially All right And what happens when they merge AI with robotics What happens when Because people like to say can't do blue collar jobs The answer is they can't do blue collar jobs yet And So now you have the situation where this is starting and it's already moving into agriculture There's already self-driving tractors and all of these things people don't understand this And They're going to come to a place in time Where AI and robotics combine To be able to produce Whatever they need produced And also to police whoever they need to police And military whoever they need to military All right And When that time comes Do you think that they need These people on the internet Who have pink hair And are 200 pounds overweight And who's screaming about pronouns Do you think they want The American patriot Who believes in humanity and citizenship And The neighbors to the left and the right of them Do you think they want those people They don't want those people Those people represent the resistance That's their That's their contention point to getting what they want Because what they want is the entire world of themselves They want exactly what they're telling us they want Yeah, they want the people who have been staying silent for the last three years That's what they want they want all of it To themselves They want all of us to go and they want all of it to themselves And everybody here is that and they think not me No you too And your kids And your sister And your parents And everybody's ever fucking known Okay That's it And that's what we're dealing with We're dealing with in a real agenda That they talk about openly That people are denial about Called the depopulation agenda And when I look at what they did with COVID I see this as just the acceleration I think And my if I had to guess That we are not even seeing the tip of the iceberg of the vaccine issues We're not even seeing the beginning of What could potentially be it's only been a year and a half What happens in five years What happens in ten years What happens when all those people who took the vaccine can't reproduce What happens when all those people who know people that took the vaccine can't reproduce Doesn't Isn't one of the biggest problems Didn't it say in the article here that The vaccine particles find themselves in the ovaries And high concentrations So If they're using this to sterilize people And then it jumps from people to people to sterilize them And then they're combining AI with robotics To solve the problems that they need What do they need us for And we're over here fighting about melanin in our skin Or whether or not someone's an anti-Semitic person Because they question the people doing these things Right Right like What are we talking about Like the human being the human species Is in danger in my opinion And it may not be in danger like from what you can see today But in a very short time we could easily be there And maybe I'm wrong and maybe I am paranoid And maybe I am being an alarmist But I don't think I am This is what I can observe And we have to get to a point where we can have hard conversations about what's really going on In order to fix what's going on Because if we continue to fight And call each other these names And tear each other down And fuck each other up on social media Because we want likes, clicks, shares And all this shit We're gonna end up with nothing That's real talk man You know There's ethical duties To think about these things There's an ethical duty to talk about these things with your friends There's an ethical duty to not support the companies That are promoting this shit Like AI in my opinion Should be completely rejected dude Like completely Completely And they're doing exactly what I told you they would do They would bring it in And they would push it in through the business class And entrepreneurs first Because people are so greedy They cannot fucking help it There needs to I don't know what the solution is either It needs to be some sort of Pact amongst all human beings Kind of like how they handle nuclear weapons To regulate it Like dude, I don't think they're gonna And I I don't think people are I don't think people are understanding What the fuck is actually happening I think people are just too busy Too distracted Dude Even the people that care They're too busy getting attention To like actually think about what they're doing And understand what the solution is The solution is not the tearing down of All these other people It's not calling each other names It's not attacking each other because we're different It's all the good people No matter what The whites, the blacks, the Jews Fucking whatever else The Native Americans You know Wherever else Fucking Russians, Chinese All the citizens of the human race Should be on this right now In my opinion And they should be looking past petty differences Because we have a problem in the world Where Globally There's about A few thousand people Really fucking it up for everybody else And that's real shit And so when I look at what's happening with this vaccine I don't look at it as an oops I don't look at it as a I think I think I think you guys who think it was an accident Because that's what the next thing is gonna be The next thing is gonna be it was an accident It was an actual ably It was research we were doing But it was an accident It wasn't an accident If you listen to me I want you all to listen to me If you were at The point Where you had to maintain Your position of power And you knew that if you didn't That you were gonna legitimately get your head cut off Legitimately What would you be willing to do to maintain your position of power And you know that if you didn't You would be willing to do to maintain your position of power I love it And that's where we're at And that's where people fail to realize And that's the problem we have There's zero chance In my opinion That Quote-unquote Republicans Can win the 2024 election They will not fucking allow it It will not happen I don't know how they'll do it I think they're gonna I personally if I'm guessing I believe they're going to unleash another virus Because they ran the same play with COVID They ran the event 201 And then they just ran this This other one back in the wintertime It was December It was November, December, January For how it was called But the same people ran another pandemic exercise For a virus That targeted children That killed people's children Now If they were to unleak now The evidence is showing That This virus of COVID was manmade And was quote-unquote accidentally released That's what is showing Some of the media is reporting But that's what the evidence is showing so far Now If they were So that means they have the capability to release it So if they were to release a new virus That actually killed children Who would be caught up in the outrage Who would be the Who would be the reason that that's happening Who would be it It would be people like me and you And all the people who stood up the first time Against the bullshit And then they would say See this is the danger of this kind of rhetoric We have to do something with these people And then they will begin to fucking Remove those people from society That's what I think they're going to do That's my opinion Maybe I'm wrong I hope I'm wrong I hope we I hope we have enough brave people in our military And in Washington To handle this problem Before it becomes this problem But that's what I see coming down the pipe And I think they're going to throw a serving a war on top of it And as much racial division as possible And uh And I think they're going to do anything possible, bro Anything they can do And I don't think I don't think people understand that That's right The total war is today Is estimated at 100,000 With over 1300 deaths Many of the dead are children Our goal today is to highlight Some of the specific challenges That we as a global community Can face in a future pandemic catastrophic contagion is a policy focus tabletop And we have to do something And we have to do something And we have to do something Policy focus tabletop Aimed at national leaders The scenario is meant to represent The types of challenges that we may face And not be a prediction of any specific event So our scenario Which is set in 2025 Not be a prediction of any specific event Okay Like we just just fucking do this Listen these people are telling This is what they're going to do I'm going to play the whole video in here This is what I call I don't care We can link it to the website I think we'll find it through I mean play it Supposed that an international network Called the pandemic war Has been established in collaboration with WHO And with participation by many countries And with that the exercise begins I want to thank you all for coming on short notice World Health Organization is receiving urgent requests For guidance regarding the new Entrivirus outbreak In Latin America Early projections suggest the severe pandemic is possible The epidemic is not quickly contained A newly developed PCR-based diagnostic Is already in use at national public health laboratories In both countries Under emergency authorization Stop it The virus has been shown to be highly inaccurate And actually it's been shown In a couple different Bits of data that we've covered on the show That they were overestimating Not only just the cases But the actual deaths from COVID Okay Same fucking thing I just want to point that out That's how they got the ticker to go Yeah The number that kept playing to you guys Seeing in every fucking day That's it So the question for our first discussion here in this group Is should WHO Recommend countries implement robust travel restrictions For Nueva Esperanza and San Rafael And should WHO recommend closing schools And the affected areas of those countries Recommended measures To be able to do so And it's not just a matter of time To be able to do so In these countries Recommended measures Should be driven by scientific evidence So whatever it needs to be done is to be done In a way they can go done quickly but sustained G&N will continue to follow the emerging health crisis Sears 25 is now confirmed in 14 countries With more than 8,700 confirmed cases And 155 deaths reported worldwide The pandemic or believes that there may still be a window of opportunity before Sears 25 becomes a pandemic Should WHO recommend countries That they voluntarily send public health specialists and responders to those countries most of you And actually needs to be taken at country level And that needs to be enabled through a concert Global response that needs a massively scale up That should be additional responders But that should be combined With training of local people on the streets With training of local people on scale The plausibility of containment is very low This is unfolding, it's evolving So while it's Latin America focused heavily We shouldn't forget the wider ethics checks I think it's important for people to understand what they're watching You're watching people act out They're acting out A fictional Exercise They're acting it out For you to see So that they can practice what happens So that they can practice what how they're going to handle this It's no different than like you know where new actors going to fucking a script reading fucking meeting These people are like if you can't see this shit on your list on audio These people are wearing masks They're like This is insane This is insane shit Yeah and this one's supposed to be targeting kids Yeah You know and it's crazy because if you go back and look at event 201 And you watch the same video was the same as that thing like I mean they had all Like that same graphic of COVID that everybody sees that God was in the event 201 It's exactly what they fucking used Yeah let's keep watching It's crazy shit man There is no substitute for national leadership A rapid assessment that determines what kind of workers the country needs, help workers the country needs It's very important It is likely that especially center of fire the health system is overloaded With other diseases as well And so the importance of health workers is to help the country deal with existing The healthcare system is overloaded Remember that? Okay keep going Problems as well I think there's still a chance to try to contain it at source All right stop So do you think this time around that the nurses are going to do tiktoks When they're overwhelmed Right Are we going to see a gazillion tiktok dances Do you think that'll happen again? They have breaks too Okay I was just curious like is that we're going to do we're going to is that is that can we expect that? Is that in the video? Yep Good afternoon everyone We have reconvened this committee in the setting of a substantially worsening pandemic The director general is seeking your input on what whos should recommend Regarding misinformation and disinformation And disinformation that is now resulting in the deaths of many around the world Many public health leaders are saying that misinformation about the potential vaccines on social media Is undercutting trust in authorities and complicating that efforts to respond to the disease What are we going to do with those people Man misinformation disinformation What are we going to do with those people Keep going Well let's see what they say And let's go leaders in some Raphael have not denounced the rumor Should whos take a position on this issue Should whos recommend that countries implement any of these aggressive actions or others To try to stem the spread of either this or disinformation How far should governments be advised to go to try to handle this problem The whos should be the repository of information But not the executor of decisions about what should happen at a local level Government should take responsibility The government need to say the truth to the population first What I would recommend whos as other say is to counteract with facts Providing the facts based on the evidence, the anthropology, the epidemiology of the disease We deal with it is important to say We don't know, it's like we think So stop Okay so those people basically just said in not as many words that it's the same people's fault Who stood up against the vaccine the first go around that all these people are dying Which is exactly what I said 10 minutes ago I haven't seen this video before Yeah it's crazy And by the way the woman says The whos shouldn't tell governments what to do the government should do what they think they need to do What do you think that means? The aggressive actions That's what they said Two months since the last meeting The year's 25 pandemic has been ongoing for more than six months now This is the fourth meeting of the emergency advisory board G&N's Hassan Kamara gets us up to speed with the latest news Experts tell us many countries with scarce healthcare and public health resources are facing tremendous challenges Just providing basic healthcare and public health functions Today we will focus on the end He looked, hey I do you No but he definitely was selling something That's how you talk when you sell shit That's not how you talk when you're reporting on a tragic situation There was a word for good acting on TV That motherfucker wouldn't get it Are you gonna get it? Experts tell us many countries with scarce healthcare and public health resources are facing tremendous challenges Just providing basic healthcare and public health And DJ Do you understand what I'm saying? The reports are significant People are going to die if you don't stay home Take on medicine Functions We would allocate resources to countries with the necessary infrastructure already in place in order to make immediate use of the drug Dited by a logical situation in different countries rather than the capacity to purchase Globally I think it also needs to spend energy on convening the partners and international partners to ensure that option two countries are option one countries Right so I think it's absolutely paramount that the countries we have the greatest need also have the infrastructure to administer it We need a strong international health organization It's power, more power of coordination It's been a year since the Sears 25 pandemic started As of today there have been an estimated 1 billion cases worldwide With more than 20 million deaths including nearly 15 million children Countless millions are alive but left with paralysis or brain damage Victims and their families are facing extremely uncertain futures After SARS, MERS, Zika, Ebola and COVID governments were not better prepared As EnteroVirus E5 sweeps the globe some countries have done better than others in controlling its spread The most successful countries are those which invested in preparedness and trained for this moment years in advance This included having full-time pandemic preparedness and response teams which conducted detailed operational planning And routinely tested those plans through exercises and drills Leaders of these national level professional teams were networked with each other in the global pandemic core This pandemic core network public health leaders were able to collaborate in advance, share and come to consensus around the best available scientific research and policy guidance And therefore respond in more uniform ways in their respective countries This is what's going to happen if they're not held accountable They're telling you what they're going to do And if you think they aren't willing to release something that actually kills people and kills your kids Which is apparently what they have planned If you go back and deduce from history and the way it's played out If you think that they're not capable and won't do that, you don't understand how they see you They don't see you as one of them And we're going to need I don't know what we're going to need to stop this from happening Because like bro, they're already in the position to do it They could do it today, they could do it tomorrow, they could do it next week They could have already done it They could do it after they won Because this Biolab shit has been allowed to fucking go on Excuse me, guys, tell us what you guys think That's going to be a comment I can promise you this They're going to blame everybody It doesn't matter if it's 90% of the population That's what you don't understand All the people right now who know that COVID is bullshit Like the people who took the shit And the people who didn't Both of them Anybody who stands against that this time They're going to consider the threat level And they're going to handle it because people will actually be dying That means camps It means everything That all the quote-unquote conspiracy theory people have been talking about We're going to be walked right into it Guys, it's time for our final segment of the show As always, thumbs up or a dumbest fuck That's where we bring a headline up We talk about it, go through it It'll get one of those two options And so with that being said, our thumbs up or a dumbest fuck headline reads Man who spent $14,000 to be a collie-dog bites back at online sex trolls I saw a picture of this, it actually did look like a dog Like I was trying to figure out how he was in that suit Like what the fuck is like a housey in there Yeah, well it was weird So, uh, article reads he wasn't going to roll over for trolls The Japanese man who spent a fortune transforming himself into a dog Is hitting back at haters who claim he should go to therapy After he took his first ever walk in public last week The canine cosplayer named Tokosan First made headlines several years ago after dropping more than $14,000 He was a hyper-realistic collie suit So he could realize his lifelong dream of becoming man's best friend Since then, the human pooch has become a sensation on YouTube Where he posed under I want to be an animal After uploading videos of himself masquerading as lassie The aspiring hurting dog could be seen parading around busy streets performing tricks And even interacting with other dogs As astonished onlookers, ooh and odd Despite seemingly more comfortable in a sheep's dog clothing Tokosan Said he was quote, nervous and scared of venturing out in public Needless to say, many online galkers didn't take too kindly to his canine coming out party With many taking to the Japanese social media platform X to shame him Here is a video of a little lass Is that Twitter? Yes, okay I mean, are we? I don't know So when you say X that means Twitter, I mean Twitter Yeah, I got it. Right branding Yeah, I got a fucking ask about it Bro, come on So all fun of games that a pit bull comes around and wants that booty Bro What? Bro, I'm just, I'm sick I can't do it Bro This is why they're going to kill us all It's real truth Bro, it's a mental illness It's fucking mental illness Yeah, well some people said this person says quote, men will literally spend $20,000 to transform into a border collie instead of going to therapy Yeah, well they say that about starting podcast too Probably right Let's see Somebody another person said a Japanese man spent over $20,000 for this border collie costume You cannot convince me this isn't some weird sex thing Yeah, he responded back saying that this is my hobby So I will carry on it makes me happy and other people happy too Yeah, I do I mean, if we're being real like okay, I got two perspectives here We just talked about how these fucking assholes are going to kill us They're right, okay, so I'm really like more worried about that than this So that's probably affecting my response to this Okay, um, no, but it doesn't seem like he's hurting anybody But like real talk and like I don't really give a fuck if you're not hurting anybody I really don't Um, I'm not gonna hate on the dude, but this is weird and it's my opinion that I think it's weird And you know I would love to just like keep it light but you know we have a real shit happening in the world and like Seeing the down like we're witnessing the downfall of humanity Like we're witnessing it it's happening in front of our face You know when When Tiktok's biggest trend is that it's people like doing that NPC shit for money And Child pornography is like a massive fucking issue and child trafficking is a massive issue inside the United States And globally for that matter And we see the amount of hate division and just crazy shit Like dude It's it's it's not normal to cut off your fucking dick It's not normal to to change From one Gender to another that's not and and and you get attacked for saying that This is the truth Yeah, it's not fucking normal. It's not normal and it's not like if it was normal We wouldn't have to know it's not normal that grown men Shake their fucking balls dressed up as women in front of kids and shit Like this is we're witnessing the downfall of fucking humanity like right in front of our faces And I think it's so bad that people are just like What the fuck am I gonna do fuck it? Yeah, and It you know This shit has to be called out for what it is We have to start having real conversations We have to start pointing at the people who are actually doing this weird shit And and and making us force feeding it to us and I do I don't know like real talk like where I'm at like right this second, you know, I don't feel hopeful You know, I'm saying that's just being honest. No, I've come on here every day for the last number of years Trying to get people to wake up and get people to understand what's going on and ask you guys to share the messages and share the shows And have the hard conversations and not enough people have done that They just haven't because the messaging out and people ain't awake They might be a little bit awake, but they're not where it need to be to stop what's gonna happen And that should terrify everybody because these people like I said If you were facing Ultimate accountability for things that you have done to society What would you not be willing to do to maintain your power? And I think the answer is you'd be willing to do fucking anything And we've given these people power because we allow ourselves to be divided over stupid issues like race And arguing over things that are just common sense bro like like I'm not some extremist I'm a normal dude from like fucking 2000 and fucking four You know what I'm saying like It's disappointing man and You know, I've tried and tried and tried and tried and tried and tried and tried and fucking Sacrifice a lot personally To even try to get the message out and nobody know like yeah people Yeah, the shows growing yeah people are taking it but like They ain't been enough You know I'm saying, huh? It's very it's very just it's very disheartening It's just you know like what the fuck are we doing as human beings? What are we doing? You allow all your leaders to be picked apart by cancel culture and and you don't stand up for them You know what I'm saying they come after they come after people for speaking the truth they're asking questions And you guys roll over And you just you fucking you get quiet you know say shit You let these teachers do this weird shit to your kids at school by reading them sex books when they're Fucking three and four and five and six years old when that that's not normal You know say anything you don't go to the meetings. You don't do anything like bro real talk like we deserve what's coming That's real shit Maybe not you maybe not me maybe not some of these people listening But we collectively we didn't act when there was fucking time to act we didn't do the right thing when it was time to do the right thing And now we're gonna suffer the consequences unfortunately And that fucking scares the shit out of me And it may not scare you you may think oh, he's alarmist. He's fucking doing this for clicks bro I want to tell you right now. I'd much rather not be fucking known I'd much rather be a private human being. I would much rather not do this show. I would much rather just live my life I got a pretty nice life that I fucking paid a lot for It took me a long time to build and I would rather just do that than this And I just don't I just feel demoralized because I feel like people Have I know because I see the data of the numbers. I know that there's fucking millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of downloads of the show a month Over the course of audio platforms and now with YouTube but adding right and And Where's where where is everybody? Where is everybody? This is this comes down to individual responsibility in your community and And dude, I just I don't know man. I Love to sit here and pretend like I feel optimistic, but I don't And I don't feel like I feel like we could win. I feel like we could get this country back But I feel like what it's going to take needs to happen so fucking fast and be so fucking big and powerful That it stops this shit and like you know, bro. There's a ton of world leaders that understand what's going on. They're not doing anything either You know why? Because they made the cut bro They made the cut you mean everybody else we didn't make the cut. We just don't know it yet Well no
