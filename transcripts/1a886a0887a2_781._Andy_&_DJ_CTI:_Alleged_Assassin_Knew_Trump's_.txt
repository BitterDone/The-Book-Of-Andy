Not an easy case to unravel I don't know. It's pretty easy. I mean it's it's pretty easy to me. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. Let's dive into this So the second assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump will not be an easy case to unravel Martin County Sheriff William D. Snyder Said during an appearance on Newsmax openly Wondering how the suspect knew Trump's schedule Snyder was on the scene Sunday when the suspect Ryan Wesley Ralph was taken into custody quote He had the demeanor of somebody coming home after a Sunday picnic. He said of Ralph describing the arrest quote His facial effect was he was unperturbed Quote did not seem particularly rattled the interstate was shut down helicopters overhead and you can picture it guns Everything out he was fine and did not say a word Snyder said explaining that the would be shooter quote Absolutely went with the flow that aside. He said uncovering the motive will be key Quote from a law enforcement standpoint from an investigative standpoint his motive will be the key They want to know what was going through his head is this a conspiracy was this alone wolf is he a frontman from an organization They have their hands full this will not be an easy case to unravel. He said the host Noted that Trump's golf game Sunday was added to his schedule at the last minute that being said he asked how the suspect knew Trump would be there Quote that's a $64 question Snyder said describing it was very perplexing quote because my understanding is that he drove a long way He's not from here. He said explaining that it is not as though he lived nearby and was patrolling the area to see Trump's whereabouts Monitoring in case he showed up and announced quote. I would ask that question That would be the first thing I'd want to know if I was the federal government What the heck was going on that put this guy on Trump at the golf course without any advance notice to the public that he would be out there He said to val a question is one that needs to be definitely answered And again, this is the second attempt. There was some weird stuff. He had a Town hall that he was doing up in New York. There were some weird things happening with that Couldn't really get the specific details But to my knowledge at the time of recording everything was fine up in New York But there's more information coming out about the first attempted assassination on Trump Where this headline reads secret service told locals they would quote take care of building used by Thomas Crook's to shoot Trump All right, now this is all coming out now, okay? And this is a Fox News exclusive secret service agents assured Butler County Pennsylvania law enforcement that they would secure the building That would be assassin Thomas Crook shot former president Trump and others From on July 13th during an outdoor rally per investigation by Senator Chuck Grassley Quote, Butler County law enforcement officials stated that at separate times during the walkthrough When they reiterated their concerns to the agents and countersniper about securing the AGR buildings the agents responded quote We will take care of it Grassley's office revealed in a Tuesday letter to acting secret service director Ronald Rowe the Iowa Senator question row whether the Butler County law enforcement officials claim is true And if so what the secret service did to secure the area with the AGR complex buildings Grassley noted that in the weeks following the first assassination attempt Roe told senators during a hearing quote what was communicated is that the locals had a plan and that they had been there before and regard to the roof of the AGR building where Crook's took his shots From now Well hold on so he's saying Roe is telling the senators that the locals told the secret service that they had it covered Are my confused? Yeah, yeah, okay The senator doing his investigation grassley grassley, okay Discovered that the the local level police officers in Butler County when there was the walkthrough going through the event before The secret service told them they had it right got it right So the local law enforcement was like hey this I mean we need to make it no no no no we got it already we'll take care of it got it Oh, yeah, that sounds not suspicious. I don't think they took care of it. Yeah, you know It's definitely interesting now going back We call it is interesting because isn't the local police officers the guys who went up the ladder and got shot at and shit Mm-hmm. I do the secret service is what that come on dude. We listen All right, keep going we all we can connect the dots here Listen we I know some great guys in the United States Secret Service some bro off. No, I we both do amazing Yeah, but it only takes one or two you just need a couple bad out. Yeah a couple bad apple You know we like we covered on the show a lot of these secret service guys on On detail that they were not secret service remember that they were homeland security they were adjunct officers That's right. Yeah, and so I mean and even that alone is dangerous to do is dangerous I wonder if any of these guys at the on the secret service detail in Marlago where he got shot at or whatever was that Marlago Trump international I wonder how many of those guys were homeland security Or if any you know, yeah, yeah, I don't know what the roster looked like. Yeah, that's interesting Maybe it'd be interesting to see that Because the guys that we know told me Which has now been published in the press right that The biggest problem they got right now is that they're inserting these guys who were not secret service as Homeland security and they are marking them as secret service, right? So why would you do that? Well, the the their answer is that it's due to manpower right and like you know because he's not a sitting president He does not get the same amount of resources as the acting president would get okay got it But he still deserves a standard of protection and that's not happening It's very very obvious. It didn't happen in Butler didn't happen in fucking quarter and The standard has to be there. Yeah sitting or not this guy is running. Yeah, the official nominee for the party He deserves protection. Yeah, right? It deserves a standard And it's weird and and what's even crazier about all of this you are we and we covered, you know how Kim Jeffries talking shit Hillary Clinton we covered their comments. I want you guys to listen to what just came out of Joy Reads mouth From MSNBC. She says both would be Trump assassins or white American Trump supporting men That's not true, which is not true at all Which they knew was not who who surprised the joy reads spews this bullshit bro. She's she's super racist, bro Not only she races. She's straight up liar Like it's like she's not even trying to like not like I don't know if she's with it I don't know where where her little play is and I don't know if she actually broke. No, bro. She's told no bro listen At that level of media that's talking about the local level Talk about national level like we talked yesterday about how the news used to be the news and now it's become 24-hour state propaganda pumped out in people's face We don't cover stories of what's happening in New Mexico or what's happening in North Carolina or this happening there that now It's just straight up politics from morning to morning, right? It's just 24 hours a day and And divisive shit dude. That's that's the point That's the point they they know that half the people are watching MSNBC CNN ABC all the left people and then they know the rest are watching Fox And dude real talk Fox any better man Fox is cringy to watch man. There's a couple good people on there once in a while But like as a as a whole um, you know, it'd be the only source for the right. Yeah, that's all I'm saying. I mean dude look I don't want to say that You know, I don't know. I think We're our society has changed so much in that regard and I don't think read is speaking on her I mean, do you think she's or do you it's hard for me to tell do like I don't know if she's just reading the teleprompter And she's just playing that you she's the cog in the wheel But like well, you know, they put CIS assets in the media dude. She just says this shit was so much conviction Yeah, and nothing ever happens to her nothing she doesn't get canceled no one backlash nothing ever happened It's weird dude. Listen to this fucking clip man We're learning more about what the FBI is calling an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump yesterday Is the second attempt in nine weeks and in both cases the individuals were not minorities undocumented immigrants or someone from Haiti or Venezuela Nope, they were white guys with guns. They were both registered Republicans in fact the suspect from this weekend's incident Who has been identified as 58 year old Ryan Wesley Ruth voted for Trump in 2016 before apparently becoming disillusioned with him Ruth made his first appearance in a Florida courtroom this morning charged with illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a weapon within obliterated serial number He has an extensive criminal record in North Carolina that includes a 2002 conviction for possessing a weapon of mass destruction a machine gun Strange enough Ruth was actually interviewed by the New York Times last year about his vocal support for Ukraine in its war against Russia A war he attempted to fight in but he says he was rejected by Ukraine's military Because he was too old and had no battlefield experience At a press conference is afternoon the acting secret service director Ronald Rowe stated that Ruth never had a line of sight to Trump Nordety ever fire or get off any shots at the secret service Ruth's motive is still unclear Which is so interesting. There's a couple interesting points. I want to show you real quick That I find very very interesting. You know she says that you know none of them were minorities or You know the people perperatured now all of this violence is not It's it's weird Because you know, let's just take Texas for example Texas is a massive border state I mean go to Texas and you search for their top 10 most wanted criminal illegal immigrants These are people who have been killing and raping people all over the state of Texas Killing women raping women all over the state and they're just acting like Is it happening not happening. Let's just go to the FBI. Let's look let's look at the FBI's top 10 most wanted fugitives And out of these 1080 only one of these gentlemen a white Which one oh that guy in the body right Eugene field to the second. Yeah, he's definitely white Yeah That guy looks like he smells like cigarettes all the time marble marble. Yeah, for sure But he was the only one on there and again like this is not like to like look at the guy at the top left What do you think he did? I don't know. I don't know he too many drugs He doesn't bad shit. I can't listen to code act You know, but my point of showing this though is like That's not the truth It's not it's not only is it not the truth. It's it's just blatant lies We've already like the shit has already been debunk. Yeah, you know and and and a guy registering as a Republican And allegedly voting for Trump eight years ago. Well, I mean she didn't mention the 50 act blue donations that he's made which is a far left organization fundraising organization I mean dude like of course they're lying. It's crazy So there's something interesting that that always happens or comes out With all of these national events whether it be school shootings whether it be assassination attempts There's always a very common denominator Let me guess about this what we want let me guess They were on the radar of the FBI ahead of time It never fucking fails It never fails and in this situation it wasn't even just the FBI in a poll and CB CBP they all knew about them Hitler reads FBI in a poll CBP were warned about Trump assassination suspect Ryan Roth They all knew about them. They were warned about former president Donald Trump's second alleged assassin months before Sunday When the secret service spotted Routh with a rifle about 400 yards away from former president the lack A preventative measures against Roth calls some political pundits to speculate that the federal government Engage and willful negligence while protecting the president willful negligence That means they allowed it intentionally to happen Okay, keep going well they say willful negligence because you can't call that criminal This is where you can't call it treason or it says oops Let's be very very fucking clear with like in this in my opinion Okay, I have experience in in the executive protection and security This isn't just negligence. No, this is an inside deal with some leak or or Rat or whatever you want to call it a mole like dude. There's somebody giving the fact that he look it comes down to this Nobody knew he was supposed to play golf Nobody knew so how did that guy know right that that's where he was gonna be that's what it comes down to Okay, now take that put it over here and let's go back to the first shooting mm-hmm the same group of guys The secret service which I'm not speaking of all secret service. I'm just saying the secret service Said they had a building they told the local police they had a building which they clearly did not have all right, so How different are those two situations? They're not very different So we have to figure out and I believe that most of the secret service probably 99% of it Are fucking amazing dudes they do their job. They don't even have to agree with Trump's politics to do their job They do the job and they do it well because they believe in the country and now we have a situation where there's somebody there who You know by the drawing of not so hard conclusions to put together Somebody is putting out information that is endangering Trump and more importantly these this has to be Yeah, I don't believe it's just one person. I think it might be five well. It could be two It could be it doesn't you know for sure, but the thing is like and it has to be people that are in very very key positions That that have the authority to make certain calls yeah like pulling people off of post not everybody in the detail can do that You know i'm saying it's like it's it's there is something here and it has to be fucking addressed man And like yeah dude here's what here's what really needs to happen dude what needs to happen is The guys on secret service who I mean look dude Those guys are all figuring this out way ahead of us You guys gotta come out and say some shit you gotta blow the whistle and what's actually happening You have to you know and like until this point of the FBI shit I know we covered with uh governor de san just like he's gonna be doing an investigation on this right and that's great Because the same Agency that is trying to get this man locked up should not be the same agency that is investigating a Attemptive assassinations right yeah, but the fact that these people knew about this the FBI Interpol CBP they knew about this guy they knew about Uh Colt Gray they knew about What was the guy in butler Bro they knew about they knew about a while they shoot you they knew about the subway shooter They knew about the supermarket shooter in New Jersey and they knew they knew about the the the trans shooter natural They knew about the trans shooter in in a Colorado. They knew about all these people had a time They knew about it and not only that like and like to know so like my thing is What the fuck are we paying our taxes to these agencies if they are showing us time after time after time again That they're not doing what they're supposed to be fucking doing but you know what their annual budget is for the FBI I'm sure it's big. It's big. They're asking just for like they just released back in April What they're asking for for the next fiscal year for 2024 Um before this year it's 11.4 billion fucking dollars holy shit 11.4 billion dollars and they can't do anything when they get information What's the budget what's the budget what's a national budget for police For I mean for police department. I mean no, I mean nationally 50 billion 135 billion 135 billion yeah, but I mean we're talking about a million fucking cops Yeah, I know that right FBI I'm just thinking of all the money that we're gonna add up when I get to office that We're gonna take away from everybody and give to the yeah, yeah, I mean, but like you know But like my thing is like you guys aren't even having to work for this like they're giving you this information telling you guys Hey, this dude is fucking off his chain might want to watch him might want to do something. Yeah, but no Who do they want to go after they want to go after people like Elon Musk right because he made a post he deleted a tweet On his on Twitter When he was uh and in response to somebody else's tweet somebody tweeted out um Why they want to kill Donald Trump and then Elon Musk replied to that saying quote no one is even trying to assassinate president Joe Biden or vice president Kamala Harris right and he deleted the post Um, but yeah, no secret service FBI. They're now investigating Musk You know, so what I mean, you guys gonna stop him from now. I mean is that really the concern bro? How many people how many Leftist whether they are in the media or whether they are political figures or whether they are just people Are calling for the assassination of Trump. How many of those people Were you know like remember the first time and they were all like oh too bad. He missed. Did you interview all those people? Right did you go to all their houses right This is quit. We clearly live in a super bias Uh corrupt. Oh for sure. Yeah, bro And then when you call them out on it or you ask him you know like the White House they uh they criticize must they said quote Violence should only be condemned never encouraged or joke about this rhetoric is irresponsible Well, they don't really think that but they call Trump a fucking threat to our country every day They don't think that they don't think that at all. That's not what they're gonna say it And when people actually act on their words Or you know, no, no, he was actually a Trump supporter. Okay, when they do it. It's cool when they do it It's problem when I do it just saying it's wild Um last little piece on this who that I thought was interesting with all of it is coming out just showing like just There's an obvious political motivation. There's political persecution going on Whether it's with the DOJ Whether it's with secret there there's weird things that are happening and I thought this this piece was also interesting Within the last month there were two people That have basically publicly made their announcement saying that they are now in supportive Donald Trump right to very very big names Toasty Gabbard mm-hmm being one RFK and RFK Jr. Well guess what's just happened with RFK RFK They're investigating him for something. Yeah Listen to this Noah confirms investigation into RFK Jr over dead whale carcass They got to bring these people down somehow This is let's hear about this is a legit fucking headline. This is real The national oceanic and atmospheric administration confirmed on Monday It is investigating robbery F. Kennedy Jr. for allegedly decapitating a dead whale carcass and transporting it Uh, home two decades ago. Isn't there a statute of limitation on decapitating whale carcass? How the fuck do you even decapitate a fucking whale like you I'm sorry, man or something How did he do it? Did he do it? I don't know why did he do it? Why would you do that? On Saturday, Kennedy said at a campaign event in Arizona He received a letter from the national marine fishery services and organization that falls underneath NOAA informing him that he was under investigation for an incident He said occurred 20 years ago In which he collected a dead whale specimen the spokesperson for Noah confirmed to see an end on Monday that Kennedy is under investigation for the incident quote It is longstanding Noah practice not to comment on open investigations the spokesperson said the story Resurf is shortly after he was he suspended his presidential campaign last month after a 2012 interview with Kennedy's daughter Kathleen kick Kennedy who published in town of country magazine was On social media and the interview Kennedy's daughter Recalls her father using a chain saw to cut off the head of a dead whale carcass On the beach near that Cape Cod family home and driving the whales head back to New York I'm so following the story gaining attention on social media the center for biological diversity action fund Called for Noah to investigate investigate Kennedy over the incident Arguing his actions could have jeopardized scientific research Sounds like he's doing his own research I mean, I mean what the fuck are they like They gotta be the size of the fucking table just to hit alone. Oh bro. They're way better than that That's what I'm saying like so they're they are huge so this dude picked like use the chainsaw cut ahead off and put it in the You guys have seen whales me when next next co no bro. They are massive. Oh yeah, no, I mean like How how the fuck is that even like bro? Looked possibly no, it's just another I it's another example of Complete bullshit and misuse funds and target investigations and nonsense Instead of addressing the real problems in society. Okay, if we want to look at society and why it's all fucked up Look at what people get upset about look at what they get angry about they don't get angry about the tyrants Stealing all your money and sending it overseas and stealing the rest of it I don't care about that. They don't care about our country may be going to world war They don't care about people exaggerating a pandemic to steal trillions of dollars from the middle class and put it to up But they don't care about that shit. They care about rfk cutting off a fucking whalehead. It was already dead 30 years ago Yeah, he was already dead. They care about they care about you know Uh What somebody said or what somebody did you know, oh no bro. It's all distraction nonsense All of it What are we looking at here? I was just oh yeah, that very city agent recruitment for the FBI Oh Joining Hey I'm just saying dude. It real talk. The the the onus is on us as the citizens It really is because what are we getting upset about on day-to-day basis? Are we getting upset about the things that really affect our lives or are we getting upset about bullshit Right and the reason that we can't get anything done is because nobody actually gets upset about the things we're supposed to get upset about And the reason nobody gets upset about the things we're supposed to get upset about is because the media just wipes right over it All right, Trump's assassination was gone in two days His assassination this last weekend is already just being buried So What are we doing here have had we had a A president or a former president outside of Trump having an assassination attempt on his life It would be a historic event People would talk about it forever just like they talk about what happened to Reagan like it's a huge part of American history. Do you think Trump's assassination attempt That the people the powers that be Intending on that being a part of American history. Yeah, what about this one that just happened three days ago that now nobody's talking about It's it's buried halfway down the paper Why is that you see what I'm saying Like and then all of us as citizens we get all riled up about bullshit Instead of actually attacking the problems that affect us all the problems that divide us all and the problems that create all this chaos in this country You know, we are continuously being bombarded with distractions and nonsense and bullshit intentionally So that we don't pay attention what's actually going on That's real shit, man guys. I want you guys to jump in on this conversation Let us know what you guys think down in the comments. I mean look dude. What do you think before we get to them? What do you think? Yeah, I mean It's pretty clear that there's some sort of Mueller no doubt. Yeah, no doubt and then like even to your point too like I mean the amount of of energy people spend on shit that has zero relevance Come on zero effect on their bank account their bills. Yeah, the grocery bills the fucking gas bills. Yeah, but but that's all intentional And until we get smarter and get to a point where we start focusing on our energy and our attention on shit that actually fucking affects us That's where the accountability comes from which is why these people keep getting off Yeah, that's exactly right because they throw us a bone or a new Kardashians quote or new drama of the day every time some shit happens So yeah, man guys, let us know what you guys think down in the comments. Let us know Oh, that being said, let's go cruise some of these we got some crazy ones today people off the shit Yeah, let's cruise the comments now this first comment comes from at Ryan Ramos MZ X MZ 8 X R He says follow up on the Russian cat crumbs read the cat since going viral has now decided to join the infamous 75 hard program Since starting here's major mintous life changes, but still struggles to take the one photo a day Due to bad lighting and all litter box areas of the hospital So passing the struggles he continues to win each day at a time on his journey to his new life and he saves the day again Hey, man I want to follow up with crumbs.

What was it called again the freak fast coughs freak off freak off Well, well, well, well, well, well, just one comment on that Somebody also commented saying that DJ definitely goes to those parties. No, he didn't select that comment. I did send that allegations You go to the freak off sale not man. Alligators are you sure positive? I see this shit you wear when you go out sometimes What does that even mean? What do I wear say you wear all that leather shit like all the braze the shit? Yeah, I got pictures bro. Oh, you do. Oh, I got him. I got something too. Yeah, you got that buttlight picture I got the buttlight. All right bro. I drink by light. Don't worry about me I don't fucking believe in cancel culture. I drink that buttlight. I'm proud to drink is from St. Louis Guys, they need him on them too Diddy makes bizarre promise as he begs judge to be let out of jail This is interesting. So again, you guys know P. Diddy got locked up This article from Daily Mail reads Sean diddy combs made a bizarre promise to the judge in his sex trafficking case saying He will have no female visitors if he is released on bail following his arrest Combs 54 was arrested on Monday in New York and hit with an indictment accusing him of years of coercion and abuse While using blackmail and violence to control his victims. It also accuses The hip-hop mogul I'm inducing female victims and male sex workers into drugged up sometimes days long sexual performances Referred to as freak offs Com who is pleaded not guilty on Tuesday has now made a promise to have minimal female visitors to his home And Miami Beach should he be granted release on bail Why would you make a promise if you were innocent? No, I'm serious. I mean Doesn't sound innocent now I only have Just too. I'll only do a little crack So you've been trying to smoke crack Lizzie let me out. I will have minimal crack. All right. Just once a day But what another weird thing too like he also offered his bell amount The star's legal team acts for combs to be released on they offered $50 million for his bond Like combs. Yeah, offered the court that they would pay $50 million fucking dollars Well, you combine that with the statement of having minimal female guests. It doesn't sound like there's too much innocent there. Shit, man Many also agreed to be electronically monitored With his Miami mansion as collateral after US magistrate judge and man had an order He be held without bail on Tuesday under the bail request visits would be limited to family or mothers of his children property caretakers and friends Who are not co-conspirators in the federal indictment teams he reported logs of all visitors who is home would be handed over to the government nightly Damn the restrictions are believed to be an attempt to address court concerns that he may contact or intimidate witnesses As they also stipulate that he would have no contact with known grand jury witnesses or undergo weekly and undergo weekly drug testing the indictment that accuses combs of Using power and prestige to lure and intimidate women under pretense of a romantic relationship Um, and again the judge denied his bail request and so he's being still held with no bond now It's weird because I thought New York had like that cashless bond system. Oh, they do unless you're famous got it, but you know, I mean Look We know what's going on here. I think right. I mean like it sure does seem a lot like the Epstein shit. No No, okay, so if it is they're probably did they let him out? No, yeah, they're probably not gonna we're probably gonna be like Seeing did he on the front of like white t-shirts and airbrush soon, you know what I'm saying listen It's weird all right now he's being held let's talk about where he's being held at He's inside the barbaric Brooklyn jail where Sean did he comes is locked up in sex trafficking case So he spent the night locked up and then notorious Brooklyn federal jail that is long been played by tales of barbaric and Reprehensible conditions for inmates who have included notorious sex abusers Arkelly and Galeen Maxwell was also held there Combs 54 was hauled away to the infamous Metropolitan detention center in sunset Park late Tuesday after he was ordered held without bail on sex trafficking and racketeering charges The imbattled hip hop mogul will be held there ahead of a scheduled Manhattan federal court hearing Wednesday afternoon Where he is expected to appeal the decision to keep him behind bars combs didn't have a cellmate for the first night a jail guard who didn't want to be Identified told the post outside the prison on Wednesday quote. I saw him yesterday. He looked good the guard said Asked if the fallen rapper was happy inside the employee shot back No one is happy to be in there The jail itself is facing 10 scrutiny in recent years amid a spat of vicious inmate attacks and complaints about dismal living conditions including worm and maggot infested food Damn filthy sales and power outages a lot different than a Miami mansion. No shit A woman paying one of her inmate relatives a visit on Wednesday told the post that her loved one Often finds worms crawling around in the food quote some foods they have worms in them It happens all the time the woman who did not want to be named said it's all junk the apparent conditions We're also brought to light during the sex trafficking trial of Maxwell The notorious madam for late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein when her attorney ripped the facility in court Fowlings as reprehensible and utterly inappropriate now. This is the building For those listening audio go to YouTube you follow along. These are some pictures of the inside of what it looks like It's very rarely seen on the inside, but that's where he's at now There's an interesting thing happening right now or that is coming to light Because and it's weird that they just mentioned you know Galei Maxwell also being there who was the madame for Jeffrey Epstein what interestingly enough now being reported P. Diddy also had a madame Manipulator in chief who was once compared Galeen Maxwell Sean did he comes once called his com's enterprises chief of staff Christina Corum his right hand But a source close to the federal sex trafficking investigation into him believes she is more his manipulator in chief Quote if anybody is gatekeeper Christina wouldn't know everything the source told the post Quote high ranking supervisors We're flagged in the three count federal indictment charging com's with sex trafficking racketeering and Transportation to engage in prostitution on Tuesday a day after the 54 year old hip hop mogul was arrested by Homeland Security agent At a New York City hotel now com's has pleaded not guilty to the charges, but remains in custody We just talked about that Ram has not been arrested or charged with any crime According to the indictment com's is alleged to have used certain employees including the quote high ranking supervisors to carry out Facilitate and cover up his abuse and commercial sex ring Although none of his employees were named in the papers now. This is a picture of Christina Corum Here she is with P. Dady again. He was she was his chief of staff for his Enterprise this is them again and It's interesting, but the superman bro. She's a fucking handler That's what the fuck she is. She's a looking girl. Yes bring people in for sure. She's a handler for him 1,000 percent 1,000 in charge. He ain't in charge. Well, and it's interesting to because she's not been charged with anything It's a very similar thing to how Maxwell was yeah, where like I mean it was years and then even after Epstein Allegedly killed himself. It was years after that before Galein Maxwell was even brought in. Yeah Very similar situation here. I assume we're gonna see some more similarities happen soon Because they're not gonna want this dude saying anything about anything if there's any connection which you know, we all know there is Now the supervisors facilitated sexual performances dubbed freak off according to the indictment which included sex workers and Quote stocking the hotel rooms and advance with the required freak off supplies including controlled substances baby oil Lupricant extra linens lighting During raids that did he mentioned earlier this year narcotics and more than a thousand bottles of baby oil and lubricant Received by federal agents Quote the feds have gotten evidence from a lot of sources recordings text messages names text from Christina Choram so why is she not in custody if she's implicated in all of this per the text message. Why do you think? She's either an undercover agent Right working for the law enforcement entities FBI Homeland Security Or she's protected because she's a CIA I asked that that's helping running this blackmail program Doesn't have to always be CIA either. No, it could be you know, I think Epstein could be miss odd. Yeah, you know, so so Yeah, man, this is this is very similar dude So when they call her the manipulator in chief. I guess they're saying like she went out and got girls Mm-hmm and shit is that what she organized all okay Now she did not return the post requests for comment Tuesday But in 2021 did he have posted about her on Facebook saying quote she's been my right hand for the last eight years and has consistently proven to Execute and get shit done don't know how I'd function without her So that's interesting now in a separate lawsuit from the federal investigation filed by rapper Lilrod in February Choram 37 was described as the quote Galein Maxwell to shine combs is Jeffrey Epstein That's literally this out in the lawsuit Filed by rapper Lilrod a reference to the notorious sex offender and how His now imprisoned right-hand woman and accused of having ordered sex workers and prostitutes for him So you have that man. Anybody got on I Mean dude, I got I think the same thing. I think everybody's thinking you know, it seems very similar It sounds very similar and when we think about how they actually control society like we talked about yesterday They blackmail and they manipulate and they I Believe is my opinion that there are lots of these people I don't think it's just Jeff Reapstein and I don't think it's just diddy I think there's lots of people in different areas of culture life and business where They use these things to get things on people so that they can craft the reality narrative that they need to push and when we look at What happens every single time there's a major push in society? We see all these celebrities. We see all these famous people all these musicians everybody saying Not sort of similar things the exact same thing how many times have you heard the exact same phrases come out of these people's mouths during these Controversial times how many times have you heard them and I want you to really think about this How many times have you seen a Hollywood celebrity or a music mogul or a music musician who is part of the let's say leftist agenda Which is the communist agenda how many times have you seen these people actually state a unique opinion to the press? I want you to think about it What everybody else is doing what everybody else is saying Where's the one or two people that voice an opinion? And if they do a voice an opinion what happens to them? They get fucking shafted they get canceled they get removed from the cool kids club and their career and you have a number of actors and actresses Musicians to say this and there's proof to this in terms of when people speak up their career goes away and so That makes you kind of wonder you know what is actually going on and when you think about it on a big picture What's actually likely going on is that? Certain powers that be want certain beliefs and certain Social standards to be accepted in society they want everybody in society to have a certain position on things when things come out And the only way to do that and to control the narrative is to blackmail the biggest influencers in the world and say hey You better go say this or we got this film of this and I bet that's eventually going to come out If the investigations are handled properly and let's be real dude everybody knows this about Epstein It's become a fucking joke everybody knows But they think Epstein is the only one and I don't think that's the case I think this I think there are people there are people like this literally all over the country and likely all over the world so To me this sounds like an intelligence gathering situation a blackmail situation that he probably got plugged into because they had something on him That was big and they said hey, we're either gonna indict you on this and ruin your life or you're gonna do this work for us And that's how I see it did he's plays like what do you think he should do right? I think he should blow the whistle dude and tell the truth like Whatever he knows what if there's anything he knows about what I'm talking about that needs to come out immediately Dude he should be running his mouth telling everybody and yeah It's probably gonna get him killed but he's gonna get killed anyway if that's really what he was doing right? So you're dealing with people who don't they don't allow loose ends to exist and right now he's a loose end So you know he can either be quiet and believe them and I'm sure they're telling him hey man You're safe everything's cool. We're just gonna work this out blah blah blah and then they're gonna show up in milla-night and fucking Give them the Epstein treatment and alive them. That's that's my opinion Yeah, and and that handler I guarantee you dude you look into her family you look into her background You look into her history you're gonna find some shit. Yep some real shit not not you know like when you look at Glein and who her father was and who What her purse you know what I'm saying these are powerful people that come from powerful families and I bet she I would guess And I'm speculating because I don't know but I would assume that this woman is probably not much different Guys I want you guys to jump in on this conversation Let us know what you guys think down in the comments with that being said let's get to our third and final headline Number three Now we covered this as an intro topic yesterday But much more has come out and this is a wild wild story. Let's talk about it head on number three reads Hezbollah walkie talkies explode killing nine and leaving hundreds injured in second wave of Cornage in Lebanon a day after Pager's detonate on mass in Israeli operation Now thousands of walkie talkies used by Hezbollah fighters have detonated across Lebanon killing nine and Moonding hundreds of people including mourners at a funeral Witnesses and security sources have reported the second wave of Cornage comes a day after thousands of exploding Pagers Used by the group left almost 3,000 people injured in a dozen dead including civilians and children Wait, so this happened again Round two now, wait, wait, I Didn't see this so yesterday was Pagers and now it's more now it's walkie talkies Holy shit Bro now security sources have now confirmed that hand-held radios were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago at around the same time as the Compromised Pagers the latest explosions this afternoon have hit the country south and the capital Bay route Where dramatic time lapse video shows multiple plumes of smoke rising above the skyline in different locations almost simultaneously Multiple explosions occurred at the site of a funeral for three Hezbollah members and a child killed by exploding Pagers the day before According to reports the attacks amount to the biggest security breach in Hezbollah's history with the group and its backers Iran condemning Israel and labeling it mass murder Now berates Bay Roots hospitals are reportedly still at full capacity following yesterday's attack With aid being rapidly diverted to the already crippled country amid the catastrophe The repetition of the clandestine attacks which Israel has not taken responsibility for Will raise already spiking tensions in the region to fever pitch With Lebanon's foreign minister today warning that the blast are an omen of a widening war Now it's interesting because this article came out Okay, and then just after that Israel was behind the Lebanon page of attack targeting Hezbollah senior US officials say there's new blast reported Senior US official has confirmed to Fox News that Israel is in fact behind the explosions of Pagers used by members of Hezbollah in Lebanon as fresh blast or being reported in Bay Root So this is now coming out another daily email article talks about how is really spies stashed explosive In 5,000 European made Pagers at production level months ago before detonating Hezbollah devices As coated text messages that triggered Trigger blast is revealed So a pager bomb attack the left again roughly 2800 to 3000 people Either injured and 12 dead on Lebanon It was authored by Israel's massage spy agency and the IDF several security sources claim By the Lebanese group earlier this year ordered thousands of Pagers to conduct communications after leader Hassan Nasrallah declared smart phones would be more susceptible to cyber attacks by Israeli forces Um Israeli military and intelligence personnel managed to access 5,000 Pagers at the production level Um and insert a small amount of high explosives months before they were imported to Lebanon according to several security sources who spoke to roiders quote the Messiah injected a board inside of the device that has explosive material that receives a code It's very hard to detect it through any means Even with any device or scanner Lebanese security source set now here's like a detailed layout um they they Access the Pagers at production level um and then agents plant as little as two ounces of explosives next to the lithium ion battery as well as a remotely operated switch to trigger the blast At approximately 330 pm in Lebanon is Israel since a message that looked like it was coming from Hezbollah leadership And that's what actually triggered the explosive sparking a series of detonations around the country more information is still coming out that it wasn't even just the Pagers and walkie talkies uh Intelligence is now coming through saying that home solar systems were exploding in Beirut Um and Lebanon following the walkie talkie and Pager blast now you got solar panels on top of homes exploding Um Lebanon officials are now reporting that multiple home solar energy systems have reportedly exploded in various neighborhoods across Beirut This attack follows closely on the hills of Tuesday's Pager blast Uh, which claimed the lies were 12 and left nearly 4000 wounded and what is rapidly becoming an unparalleled Security nightmare for the terrorist organization. I'm here as a video clip that shows uh the top of these homes Check this out So they're coming from the top of buildings now So this is a solar panel stuff. Mm-hmm man. That's crazy. And what's even crazier dude May not just be Pagers walkie talkies and solar panels At the time of the recording of apparently as being reported that allegedly cell phones have exploded as well Reports of clocks radios fingerprint machines solar system panels and Pagers are also exploding All simultaneously all around the city of Lebanon damn Dude it makes that makes me man You wonder how long they've had that technology and just haven't used it and just haven't fucking used it Yeah, you wonder if it's in every phone or ever you know what i'm saying and they actually have to plan it at production level like Yeah, that's that's unsettling for sure, you know now the Israeli defense minister He declares the start of a new phase of war so he just commented on this situation Um these israel's defense minister has declared the start of a quote new phase of the war is Israel turns its focus forward Uh the nor nor in front against Esbola militants in Lebanon speaking to his rally troops on Wednesday You off galant made no mention of the mysterious explosions of electronic devices in Lebanon in recent days But he praised the work of israel's army and security agency saying quote the results are very impressive Uh, he said that after months of war against him osmolatins and gaza quote the sinner of gravity is shifting to the north by diverting resources and forces We are at the start of a new phase in the war and requires courage determination and perseverance, you said Hmm do the shit's wild Yeah, dude, it really makes me wonder like what kind because we have no idea dude We don't know what technology these guys actually have and not just these guys at mason but our CIA we have no idea We have no idea how far in the future they've been planning for this sort of thing, you know um It could have been decades they could we we could have had cell phones that have that in it for a long time Who knows dude this is This is weird dude. I remember a few years ago There was something with like the new samsung galaxy phones where they were questioning on fire. Yeah. Yeah, I remember that you know, I'm saying so it's like Yeah, I'm not I listen to I listen. I don't trust any of these people. I don't trust it dude I'm gonna go back to a little school in the key. Yeah, you know, I'm saying you still do that. Yeah Yeah, there's actually a company that makes a phone Um, I forget the name of it. It doesn't have uh internet. It's just like super basic. It's just a phone make fucking phone calls. That's it man How am I need to be getting one of those just saying to do text? I think you can still text on you Yeah, but like there's no like actual like I would enjoy that phone. Yeah Yeah, I'll do that would be nice because it's getting your life back Oh shit. Yeah, um, and I won't just you know simultaneously explode at the push of a Yeah, this is crazy dude and it really does make you wonder like how widespread is this technology How long have they been sitting on it? How long have they been planning these things? Does do we have that same technology being used here Could that happen here? Could we see Unsettling of you know the citizenship and all of a sudden their other cell phones explode like who you know I'm saying right Very very weird shit, right man. Yeah, man. It's weird. It makes me nervous even just like putting my phone to my ear now Yeah, you know, I know you always use headphones and shit, but I do it. It's like fuck man Yeah, man Hey, there's a scene in the uh, you know that movie uh law-abiding citizen There's a scene in that movie where that lady cell phone blows up and blows her head off. There's a fucking head off. Yeah, listen Obviously, I mean again like if this was like one or two. Okay. Yeah, but no, it's clearly a targeted attack thousand. Yeah Specific people. Yeah, that's crazy dude thousands You know, how long is Homeland Security Homeland Security when did they start that? Homeland Security start Was that after 9-11 or was that before? After 9-11 2002 is that what it says? November 25th 2002. Huh, there's one Homeland Security was it so isn't it weird that I was just still thinking about the ditty story Isn't it kind of weird that Homeland Security is the one that arrested ditty and then also Homeland Security is the one that filled in for uh, the secret service and Homeland Security was invented post 9-11 post the Patriot Act Isn't that that seems a little weird to me Definitely interesting. You know what I mean? Like it kind of tells you like all right Did they make this organization for the right reasons or did they make this organization so that they could operate with impunity And be undetected here in this country Well also that's already more tax dollars, right Because let me fuck I'm wondering what their budget is. Oh Whatever it's public. It's probably way more than that. Yeah, man. I don't know. This is weird man But guys jumping on this conversation. Let us know what you guys think about it down in the comments And so with that being said 64.8 billion dollars Homeland Security so Homeland Security's got a bigger Budget than the FBI right now almost six times but think about it that hold on hold on So they have a six-time bigger budget right than the FBI now. I will say this that does include secret service that includes CPB Um, no customs and border. So I mean Little bit bigger of a of a scope, but that's still a shit time of fucking money, dude Shits on the money and if they're using that to do nefarious shit Yeah, oh But with that being said guys, let's get to our final segment of the show as always We have thumbs up or dumbest fuck this word bring you guys a headline article. We talk about it And we give it one or two options and so with that being said our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads Wild moment crocodile battles sharks in front of stunned beach goer at north Queensland These are two parties.
