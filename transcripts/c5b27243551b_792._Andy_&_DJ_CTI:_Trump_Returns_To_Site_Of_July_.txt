those big you know oh this is my team you know however I do roll with the tide yeah and tide it was low tide this was low tide yeah but that was some cool stuff that happened Vanderbilt quarterback issues completely unnecessary apology after beating Alabama we apologize for well let's check it let's talk about it Diego Pavia issued a widely unnecessary apology after upsetting Alabama Pavia led Vanderbilt to a 40 35 upset win at home against the crimson tide and it's easily one of the biggest upsets in college football in a very long time and it's also easily the most important win for Vanderbilt in its program history and it happened due to Pavia's arm and legs he played out of his mind and was a little fired up after shocking the world and so he shouted on national television Vandy we're fucking turned as the moment washed over him let's check this clip out I said he'll try to a little interview with this guy he's a stud awesome awesome awesome player let's check this out literally from the jump got gave me a vision when I was a little kid and he don't let that any promises it's God's time like I'm super thankful super they were guys like Eli Sowers man that keeps incredible you look at this so I'm excited you know a little heat of the moment excited live TV on live TV oh man that's great and so right after that Pavia he issued an apology on Twitter he said I'm sorry for custom last night but God you are the truth and all the glory goes to you for y'all that don't know him get to know him he is magical to wish you had a pretty good response everybody was like trust me no one's mad at you you will never have to buy another beer in your life young man in Nashville in New Mexico and Joy College in mortality you earned it that was cool you know this is a good heart a little dude I thought it was cool yeah you know well we're gonna we're gonna stop people from celebrating I mean that'll be the next thing yeah right no shit yeah well I'm sorry I celebrated too hard when I won the game well speaking of celebrating too hard I saw this talk about that coach from Arkansas TDC no no the fucking goalposts oh dude did you see that coach from TDC get arrested or some shit he got his ass beaten Arkansas no we might have to cover that another day anyway no I was talking about the damn goalpost bro that these fucking kids carried three miles yeah holy shit yeah let's check this clip out man they tore down the goalposts carried it out the stadium three miles and then toss it in the fucking river police rescue or the machine it was cool hey man that's awesome oh well it was wild I love it that's wild there was a fucking goalpost tracker set up for this thing now they did toss it in the river and it was recovered by some of the local fireman there this is a clip of them pulling it out the river it's still celebrating bro I'm taking a piece of that home if I'm one of those guys well so here's the thing so the SEC has fined a Vanderbilt for that yeah a hundred thousand dollars no way a hundred thousand fucking dollars SEC finds Vanderbilt 100,000 dollars after fans rush field tear down goalposts following victory over Alabama so the plan is who's gonna take that goalpost they're gonna chop it up and I'll sell it there we have sell it to cover the fine yeah I like that win-win situation yeah I like that but yeah I mean do that's fucking crazy dude that's a big win for Vanderbilt man massive win man I mean you know and Alabama coming off that big that big win at Georgia right so it's you know this yeah they probably thought they're gonna come in I mean dude that's why you got to prepare for everything like it's brand new yeah you cannot take anything for granted yeah celebrate short man yeah yeah that's gonna be the trick to Vanderbilt though yeah like all right shit I games over now yeah next one next yeah next week they're probably gonna have problems yeah yeah well hopefully they get a goalpost by that time yeah that'd be cool well guys let us know what you guys think on that topic with that being said let's get into this cruise get to our headlines remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to Andy for seller.com you guys can find all of that good stuff link there with that being said headline number one uh trump returned to Butler he at what he returned to Butler oh yeah turn to Butler Pennsylvania I didn't see that because we were fall festive yeah this is a big story um that came out over the weekend uh trump returns to rally crowd and Butler Pennsylvania site of July assassination attempt so I was diving to this the July 13th assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump's life was a recurring theme at a Trump campaign rally in Butler Pennsylvania on Saturday uh trump returned to speak at the Butler farm showgrounds in the small Pennsylvania city the site where nearly three months ago a gunman's bullet grazed the republican presidential nominees ear as well as killed one rally attendee and injured two others uh quote exactly 12 weeks ago this evening on this very ground a cold blooded assassin aimed to silence me and to silence the greatest movement magga in the history of our country trump said in one of his many references to his near death experience quote but by the hand of providence and the grace of god that villain did not succeed in his goal did not come close he did not stop our movement he did not break our spirit did not shake our unyielding resolve to save America from evils of poverty hatred and destruction um now a couple of cool things that happened at that rally um he honored uh the man that was killed at that rally quarry comparatory um at the at the rally he actually had the family uh of that man meet him when he was getting off the plane oh really uh this is the clip of that and that's hard dude you know and then and then at the actual rally itself they actually saved a seat for him that that was in the stands there where they uh they put put his fireman's coat on surrounded by like flowers as like a little memorial for him so that was that was cool man and like I mean that's the the side that you know nobody really talks too much about trump or it doesn't show as much of course they don't but but why would they yeah that's right they want him to be seen as a monster right you know you got Joe Biden checking his watch while he's sitting there talking to the gold star families from Afghanistan which are 100% his fault in his responsibility and then you got trump you know given this family a hug you know when I don't know it's just dude everything's backwards it's very it's very aggravating you know so you have that there was a little excitement uh at the rally as well uh Elon Musk yeah Elon Musk makes his first appearance at a trump rally and cast the election in dire terms billionaire tech executive Elon Musk cast the upcoming presidential election in dire terms during an appearance with Donald Trump calling the republican presidential nominee the only candidate quote to preserve democracy in America the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla who also purchased Twitter mucks uh join Trump in Butler Pennsylvania on Saturday at the site where the former president survived the assassination attempt uh must said quote uh this will be the last election if Trump doesn't win wearing the cap uh wearing a cap with the make America great again slogan of Trump's campaign uh Musk appeared to acknowledge the for boating nature of his remarks this is him when he was getting on the stage I'm sure you guys have seen it um I thought it was fucking cool uh check this out bro he's excited you know I'm saying like that of course as haters people try to talk shit on the line they're like you know oh look at this guy he's jumping for sure what look dude's fucking excited I probably probably do that shit you know I'm saying well I don't think anybody's ever accused Elon Musk of being the most charismatic human being in the world right okay the guy is what he is and he's he's funny he's he's you know yeah I mean I think that's in line with who he is and I like you on musk and well I do I think more people should be happy because I mean here is you know a clip that that shows definitive proof uh the white man can jump they can they can he jumped he jumped that's what's in the white man can jump yeah uh Elon also changed his profile picture bro is that an edited photo no is that yeah no it's it's him from the rally they just changed the background um but that's the hat he wore and he yeah look at pretty pretty handsome serious there man that's not bad but just saying like that's a fucking that's an iconic picture right there uh he made it his profile picture he says I'm rich as fuck and fuck you bitch well he started off the speech saying that he's a dark mega so yeah um that of course the the world took that by storm but um dude all these these people hate everything anybody does let's be real man the media is a joke the people in the media are fucking joke they pick on everybody they take one crap they try to ruin everybody's shit nope and that's why nobody believes anything they say nothing so it's whatever dude the media is completely crumbled and they've opened the door for alternative media sources like this show and other shows to be the media like we are the fucking media now no not them you know you know and that's why they continue to like attack people like me and other guys like that Rogan fucking PBD fucking you know all these dudes out here doing this shit they hate them because they're taking their clout and they're take because dude we're not sitting here just favoring one side or the other side I mean we call it we call it is we call it now it is well and they they hate the whole I do favor one side but I favor one side based in factual opinion because the other side is so full of shit that I can't stand it so let's be real we are kind of biased yeah I'm not biased I'm just like the other side so bad that you can't like it's common sense yeah it's common sense at this point um but yeah the rally was fucking awesome though um over a hundred thousand people really a hundred thousand people check this clip out a hundred thousand fucking people it's pretty awesome there's wild that's wild and um there's a wardrobe speedon there what I think that's just the speakers some extra base there yeah air trump it was there you know Elon Musk again he was there one of the top quotes that he said one of the statements he made during that uh they're nila on speech he says quote the true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire uh we have one president who couldn't climb a fly to stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot um just some cool talking I mean talking points I guess um trump he focused on his usual talking points um including ending a legal immigration um fossil fuels I mean he said quote we're going to drill baby drill says it quite often um and he also talked about its plan to turn the country into a manufacturing superpower again um now of course with all of this security was obviously a big talking point as well um with this rally um secret service they they finally I you know got it together I guess and there was a bunch of uh very escalated security precautions that they took from metal detecting um to counter assault teams counter drone teams um I mean it was kind of stacked to the bridges you mean like how it should be all the time I would how it's supposed to be yeah you know um here's a video and you can actually hear one of the guys uh one of the attendees you know talking about it well it looks like they solved the uh slope problem there yeah no problem at all yeah right looks like they solved that no slope you know they didn't fix the slope but they figured it out and proud of them no they they rebuilt they tore down the building made less of a slope with less of a slope okay yep so there's still a slope there but it's it's manageable right I got it right and uh we pay for it yeah you can't tell me that first attempt wasn't a fucking inside job now I'm sorry you can't the excuses they made the the lack security the the manpower that was there the miscommunication which was intentional the cover-up of you know saying oh well the roof was you know too sloped and we couldn't do this the talking about you know who had control of the building bro it was intentional yeah yeah and I don't think anybody disagrees with that I think everybody knows who fucking was behind that and every and I think even the people who were gonna vote for Kamala know that who was behind that they don't care like that's what we're dealing with oh yeah the they're like you know I've been seeing more stuff here recently too man it's like you know these people on the left the far left crazy communist man like they are getting much more comfortable with their shit now I don't think it's that I think they're I say I know like like no I don't think that's yeah I do I get what you're saying but I'm not reading it as comfortable what do you read I'm reading it as desperation I think they realize that they're in deep shit and they don't know what to do did you see the Hillary Clinton interview that she made the comment about how social if social media isn't censored that we're gonna lose total control yeah that's the point lady you don't deserve to control it you're not in control you're not the master of truth you're not the decider of truth you're not a fucking royalty while we're all peasants I don't know where you ever got that idea Darth Vader but you know it was the pants yeah I don't you know you're not royalty you're you're an American citizen just like us okay so you got to be weary of people who are trying to control the truth because the only reason you would try to control the truth is to turn it into a lie all right and that's what these people have done over and over and over and over again and now they're panicking now they're showing their cards and you could see it on their faces look how stressed an age Hillary looks right now look how stressed an age Kamala looks they understand that they're going to lose they understand that the the only way that they're going to win is by a massive cheating scandal and I think they understand that if they pull this massive cheating scandal that there is probably gonna be repercussions okay and that leads into other theories that I may have which one of them is you know well we'll talk about it when we talk about the Asheville thing because I think it all ties together my brain yeah it does but the point is is that these people are showing their cards but I don't think it's confidence I think it's desperation yeah we guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments man if you were in total control bro you wouldn't sit on stage in a in a interview and say in that panicked tone of voice if we don't censor and hold these social media companies accountable then we're gonna lose total control you wouldn't say that if you were in control you wouldn't say that if things were good you wouldn't say that you wouldn't want to show that card okay and where the fuck were these people wanting to censor social media and hold social media accountable in 2020 during the pandemic where were they whenever after the election trying to hold the social media accountable for banning people talking about hunter Biden's laptop right where were they when we were talking about either mectin and all these therapeutics that actually help people through covid where were they when we were talking about actual voter fraud which did exist where oh they were banning us then so it was okay they were doing their job they were censoring but now that everybody's woken up and by the way you guys are welcome okay because it's people like us who have dedicated the I could be doing a lot more things than this all right and it's people like us and a number of other internet shows and people who are speaking out and I'm not talking about the political punish I'm talking about the people who are willing to stand up and say this isn't fucking right and there's a few of those people out there those are the reason that people are woken up and they can't control it and they're freaking the fuck out okay so what you're gonna see if they maintain control their next step will be to take people like rogan take people like pbd take people like myself take people who are talking about these issues they're already doing it with Alex Jones okay thinking that that was gonna make an example they were thinking that if they did that to Alex Jones everybody else would shut up but we're not shutting up motherfuckers just so you know we're not going anywhere so if you cheat this time you better be ready for the repercussions because it's gonna be fucking bad because everybody knows everybody knows everybody everybody knows do how many people have you heard that voted for Biden that said I'm not voting for fucking Kamala bro I'm gonna vote for Trump this is crazy people were seeing it all right but but the point is is that these people had no problem with the censorship when it was in their favor now they're calling for censorship because it's not happening anymore and they're losing so I see it as panic dude I don't see it as confidence yeah but yeah yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know down the comments man what do you guys see it out there let us know that being said let's go cruise some of these comments this first comment comes from at Joey underscore 847 he says Andy's laugh increases testosterone that's right might be some data to back that up probably just looking at me increases testosterone we need a little boost when I look in the mirror I increased testosterone you are test I am testosterone you know what's funny bro when I was fat everybody was like oh you fucking fat fuck blah blah blah and call me all these names and now it's like oh take some more testosterone I will take some more you can have some too you feel better you'll look better feel better and you won't be such a pussy would that be your superhero name testosterone man no I'm not bad I mean it's not even that loaded bro it's good yeah yeah I don't know what my superhero name would be but I could tell you this everybody should get on testosterone anybody is over 30 years old with the amount of chemicals they put in our food and water to bring the testosterone down I'm not talking out of my ass okay this is now this is my opinion and there's obviously more educated opinions but when we consider that the average testosterone of a 20 year old man now is equal to a 60 year old man in 2000 okay there's a problem it's missing and a lot of you guys are consuming all this shit and you can't figure out why you want to put lipstick on and wear your wife's underwear and like it's because you need to test asterone bro and no shit no shit weirdos speaking of somebody that needs testosterone let's check out the sticks comment this comment comes from ettonie a hogwin eight three two he says fake outrage they're not just giving people $750 that

make sure you guys are subscribed hit that bell notification to stay up to date with the latest episodes from real AF that being said that line number two let's talk about let's go let's bring it back home got some interest in update too obviously Hurricane down in our Southern United States there's still a lot of issues going on so let's talk about what's happening something there's a lot there's a lot of things going on and there's a lot of lies being told a lot of stuff not being talked about yeah well and also there's a lot of people who are exaggerating some of the shit oh for sure yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of bullshit let's talk about the one real quick there was one you know they were pushing out this sheriff down in North Carolina and apparently like he was at some board meeting and they were trying to say like you know because he was like standing up to the board like I'm not pushing on constitutional shit off counties but they were trying to make this ra ra yeah you know narrative that there's like you know a revolt a revolt happening but that video I confirm myself was actually from 2020 where we're talking about taking guns and putting in some new gun administrations in the low counties it's shit like that but yeah how to be careful of me yeah and like you know just for your guys information we spend hours putting together these outlines verifying these sources um and all this information which will also feel like I feel like it's being doom and gloomed not listen I'm not bad you know it's terrible it's one of the worst things ever happened but I feel like there's a lot of untruths being spread and I think the reason a lot of these untruths being spread or being spread is because they want to take away the focus from the good that's actually happening there were Americans of all different backgrounds and all different you know uh races or voter you know whatever you want to say all different kinds of people are working together to solve the problem that it's not that you know it's a way from no showing the good that's being done it's who's doing the good yeah right and it's people from everywhere and it's not that's not the government yeah you know I'm saying on federal or state um so let's talk about it man um this first headline from headline number two Harris Touts 157 million dollars for civilians in Lebanon while many Elaine victims wait for relief uh democrat presidential nominee vice president conala come queen Harris on Saturday tout that her and president joe bide's administration was sending 157 million dollars in humanitarian aid to civilians in Lebanon after announcing just 750 for the immediate needs of individual hurricane Elaine victims um which is much more if you take the seven hundred and fifty dollars multiple of that by the 150 thousand people impacted um that comes out to less than a hundred and fifty seven million dollars the more is going to Lebanon one single country than is going to uh our resistance here that's just a tip of the iceberg so tip yeah so tip um she even added that the hundred and fifty seven million dollar infusion would bring the total US support to Lebanon in one year to over three hundred and eighty five million dollars they're gloating about it check out her tweet the people of Lebanon are facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation i am concerned about the security of and well being of civilian suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there to that end united states will provide nearly a hundred and fifty seven million dollars in additional assistance to the people of Lebanon for essential needs such as food shelter water protection and sanitation to help those who have been displaced by the recent conflict this additional support brings total US assistance to Lebanon over the last year to over three hundred and eighty five million dollars she is touting it yeah like that's that's what I give from that well yeah why would they do that because they don't give a shit not only do they not give a shit they want you to know they don't give a shit i i i don't care if you know that second part yeah because i believe that what's happening here is a continuation of the demoralization of the american citizen in preparation for them to steal an election and basically say we don't give a fuck about you we're gonna do whatever we want and that's what they're setting the platform to be remember when we've talked about year after year after year about the mask of communism coming off it's off that well it's coming off okay and so what i believe they're doing is setting a precedent for when these people get in office to literally do anything they want right in the american's faces without them doing shit in return there's no other reason i could see why they would do this that blatantly right in people's faces no and like i mean think about this guys like this is the the current vice president of the united states yeah her twitter handle reaching the millions of americans in this country and she is directly telling us that she is taking our money while we have a dire humanitarian crisis going on where people also need food shelter water protection and sanitation and directly telling us hey guess what i'm taking your money and we're sending it overseas to these other people that you know could give a fuck about what's going on here that's right and not only are we you know taking and giving more than what we gave you guys here you know that are helping that was alone by the way um we've actually given them closer to almost half a billion dollars yeah yeah it's it's fucking disgusting now the other part of this too that what's frustrating dude it's frustrating for me personally to have come on here for the last four and a half five years and told everybody what's going on with very little inaccuracy and very little missing on the details and then to have people be surprised by this like right now everybody's waking up and they're seeing what's happening you should see my inbox bro yeah can you believe this yeah motherfucker why do you think i've been doing this i could be doing anything i want i don't make money doing this why do you think i do this i do this because i care and i care about this country and i care about the future of this country and i care about the people of this country and most of all i care about the people who are coming after us because we're the men in society that need to be fucking changing what's going on so that your kids and your grandkids have the opportunity that you had but you're too busy watching fucking bullshit on tv watching the football games jacking off to porn doing all this shit for the last five years while people who have been in here trying to warn you and now you're seeing it happen and you're surprised you can't be surprised because this is what lots and lots and lots of people been trying to warn you about and it's way worse than you think yeah that's the that's yeah it's not just Kamala Harris doing rogue actions in the in the white house like this is an actual communist insurgency subversion of the United States America that's been going on for a long time all right why do you think they started creating participation culture participation trophy culture why do you think that i'll tell you why because they want the kids not be competitive on purpose why do you think they're teaching school gender studies instead of how to be great at architecture or all these other professions that we actually need no these people are coming out of high school completely unprepared for the real world they don't understand competition because they removed competition from their upbringing they past these kids along great through great through great through great they removed gifted programs because not all the kids are gifted then they introduce things like cancel culture so that like if you speak out against the narrative you lose your business or you get and by the way you guys that participate in that shit you're part of the problem you don't even know it on any side yes you don't even know it you're preventing the best and brightest in the world from actually helping you guys on one hand say why is anybody saying anything and then the first time someone says something you don't like you try to ruin their lives because they created this culture for you to follow and you fell for it then they have silent majority oh it's noble to keep your opinions to yourself what were we talking growing up oh we were taught don't talk about politics don't talk about money why do you think that is they don't want you to talk about how little money you have and how they're fucking us over they don't want you to talk about how tyrannical these people are and what they're doing to society they want it to be under the cover why do you think they they created political correctness okay you got to say this thing do not offend that because they want to eliminate factual truth they call everything racist everything massaculous everything uh you know has an isd or an ism and that prevents us from having the truth be an option for our civilization and this is all been going on for decades so this is not new this is not Kamala and Biden are crazy they are this is an organized subversion that's been going on for decades and people cannot wrap their mind around it if you are going to have a strong civilization what would you teach your kids would you teach your kids uh gender studies or would you teach your kids all the useful skills they need and personal finance skills and how to win and how to defend themselves and how to be fit when you teach them that if we were trying to build the greatest country ever if we were trying to come up with the best ideas in this country ever were we shame people for having an opinion no when we welcome opinions is say hey that's his opinion i get it you know it is what it is i don't agree with it let's have a discussion that's what would happen in a healthy civilization but like Hillary Clinton said they control everything and they are losing control because of the internet all right so if you guys are upset and you're pissed off and you're angry the first thing you have to realize is this is not one or two or ten people this is a group of people worldwide that starts with the world economic forum that is intentionally conditioning the world to be a one-world government that is a communist style government and the destruction of the demoralization that's happening here in America it's positioning America to fit right in like a good little country third world like everybody else and us take what we get the America dream is fucking over if Kamala Harris stays in power that's it you will not just be poor a lot of you people will be killed a lot of you people will starve to death that is what happens in communism if you think i'm being an alarmist go study it it's killed more motherfucking people than any war than any plague than fucking anything okay and this is what happens over and over and over again they inch and they inch and they inch and they inch and then eventually the mask comes off and we see what's going on and i'm telling you right now the mask is about to come off and we're going to have a decision to make as Americans are we going to continue to be America are we going to be a world a globalist country that's based on communism where everybody's poor everybody's sick everybody starving everybody's dependent on the government what are we going to choose because being quiet and keeping your opinions to yourself and not taking any action whatsoever to improve yourself or improve your community or tell the truth is a surefire way for you to fuck yourself out of your the entire rest of your life yeah dude i think to me that's the most like that's that might be the hardest thing for people to comprehend and the only way i've like i've been able to explain and talk about it with friends of mine when we talk about this shit man it's like they've played the long game the other time yes and it reminds me of you know the story with you know the two guys that are you know tasked with cutting down the tree right you have five hours cut the tree one guy just start swinging the other guy you know spend the first four hours dropping it's fucking acts yeah and these people have been sharpening the axe for the last 20 30 fucking years yeah it's a hundred years and now it's started it's started it happened over a it happened in nineteen thirteen it happened in nineteen thirteen with the formation of the federal reserve that's when it all started yeah but they they've been spending that the those last hundred years sharpening their acts and everybody who's resisted that world government ideology the globalist ideology the communist ideology little by little by little has been made to be the most awful human on the fucking planet when they've decided to create their own currency and look after their own country okay including our own fucking president John F Kennedy why do you think he was assassinated he wasn't assassinated because they just didn't like him he was against all of the shit they've been trying to do for the last fucking hundred years no no no so I mean no he spent that much time shopping on that axe that axe is very very sharp and they're gonna make sure that when they start swinging it fucking lands yeah and that that's what the hell parent for man the difference is the the difference is we have guns that's the difference none of these other places that were ever genocide or had mass casually you know operations they had no way of protecting no they they they got the guns confiscated from them first and that is why these people are so hot on taking the guns especially the assault weapons okay that's that's what the fucking place we don't have a salt weapon it has nothing to do with hunting it has nothing to do with anything the second amendment is so that we can defend ourselves against a tyrannical government which is exactly what we have right now yeah now on the same subject you know obviously we've covered some of this stuff last week as well you know but one of the big things was you know money are to taxpayer dollars there when it's a FEMA you know being reallocated to help these migrants big conversation we covered a lot of that we showed the proof we connected those dots and of course what does what what does this administration do when you know presents it with though those facts that you know of the things that they've done they lie about it they complete a lie about it let's check out let's go to the White House they let her they let this lady lie for them she's she is the chief liar she is the liar and chief bro for their system they're like hey we got to tell I let's tell black one out something the gay black one out the first lesbian black woman press secretary right let's send her out and tell the lies yeah like dude she listen she has no soul but I don't know how the fuck can you lie like that to everybody when you know exactly what's going on she is a full blown communist and she is okay with looking you in the eye and say and we are not doing that we're acting in your best interests knowing that the plan later is to actually remove all the useless useless people that vote for them she goes very see people don't understand that about communism dude they keep thinking like all these people rooting for Kamala and that they they know this is socialist going into communism like there's a lot of people to know that these people think they're so stupid they think that they're gonna vote for these people and those people are gonna take our shit and give it to them no they're gonna take our shit and keep it and kill you and they don't need a chief liar once the lies already out and everybody's with with the program you know so I was gonna work on my commune and work on you know I think I'm gonna be a vegetable gardener no you're gonna be breaking rocks you'll be a vegetable yeah yeah um you know but like the probably like even when there's direct contradictory evidence to these things um let's check this clip out this so the first clip here is from October of 2024 all right talking about um you know obviously again the the FEMA money going to migrants the second clip is a clip from September of 2022 let's just watch these two side by side it's just categorically for no Biden did not take a female relief uh money to use uh to use on migrants so female regional administrators have been meeting with city officials on site to coordinate to coordinate available federal support from FEMA and other uh federal agencies funding is also available through FEMA's emergency food and shelter program to eligible local governments and not from non-for-profit organizations upon request uh to support humanitarian relief for migrants categorically false right yeah that's what they're saying let's let's check out CNN uh talking about this so now the White House says that for those cities that they know are receiving an influx of migrants that includes New York City as you just said Chicago and here in Washington DC there is somebody from FEMA uh that federal emergency uh management agency ready and willing to really help those cities when it comes to management of these influx of migrants including reimbursing some of those cities that's a part of the kind of the response that the White House has now given the administration has been in regular touch with the cities and FEMA regional administrators have been meeting with city officials on site to coordinate available federal support from FEMA and other uh federal agencies funding is also available through FEMA's emergency food and shelter program to to eligible local governments and non-for-profit organizations upon request that was two weeks ago yeah it's right out in their mouths bro two weeks ago now uh one guy always loved to get this guy credit uh Peter Ducey he's fucking awesome he's fantastic he's a he's a bully in the press secretaries um these these conferences they do he just called out KGB um and uh let's check this out president Biden is fond of saying show me your budget and I will tell you what you value if he has got money for people in Lebanon right now without Congress having to come back what does it say about his values there's not enough money right now for his value his valina his that's not his information wait now real quick when I first saw this I thought this was like some edited fucking what the fuck is she wearing I don't know it looks like some sort of beetle juice out there doesn't that bro I thought I'm like bro who the fuck edit this fucking that's not edited bro that's her and that fucking they probably probably cost like five grand too oh guaranteed and we pay for what fuck man like why would you wear that bro all these people are just oh man they're just milking our money like you think she doesn't have a wardrobe allowance oh bro she has to no it's necessary because if she's gone a lot to the American people at least let her look fucking stupid yeah you know but that's why she's clip no that is your whole your whole premise of the question is misinformation sir what you don't yes yes it's misinformation did is there I just I just mentioned I just mentioned I just mentioned to you that we provided more than two hundred million dollars to folks who are impacted in the area and I just shared with you that people are deciding not to not what people are deciding not to not we are to congress if there's not enough money to help people we're talking about the SBA disaster loan that's money for people in the area and that's important and people in North Carolina need that congress this is nothing new Peter this is nothing new congress comes together they provide money millions of dollars for disaster relief we're asking them to do the job that they have been doing for some time we're doing some time the president's letter is not misinformation would you agree no the way you're asking me the question is misinformation there is money that we are allocating to the impacted areas and there's money there to help people who truly needed there are survivors who need the funding who need the funding and it's there you don't like misinformation I said that I actually said we have a piece of shit yeah yeah not only that dude do you do you do you remember this term misinformation before 2020 no it didn't exist or disinformation before 2020 but it didn't now now every time these people we caught in a lie it's misinformation that's misinformation and you could see it flow down to their little minions like that comment that we got today you guys are liars it's misinformation now bro it's you actually pay attention more than five minutes a day and your little echo chamber of fucking blue hair weirdos I could promise you you'd see that you're wrong it's disgusted me and you know while all of this is going on there was another video that resurfaced from FEMA FEMA actually a couple of years ago and I want you guys to check this out a resurface video shows a FEMA executive talking about prioritizing LGBTQ hurricane victims so a FEMA disaster preparedness meeting about focusing efforts on LG like there is a fucking hurricane did the hurricane just like target LGBT people a FEMA disaster preparedness meeting about focusing efforts on LGBTQIA plus victims has surface following the agency's response to hurricane Helene in a virtual meeting in March 2023 FEMA emergency management specialist Tyler Ackins alarmingly said that the agency was prioritizing LGBTQ people because they are already disadvantaged this guy Tyler Ackins yeah oh yeah that guy's fucking never seen boobs except his own so the here's the problem who's there who who first of all of course that's absurd of course that's absurd all right it doesn't matter if they're black or they're white or they're gay or they're straight doesn't fucking matter victim of a natural disaster is a victim of the natural disaster everybody suffers everybody's hurting everybody's in a bad situation and LGBT QIA people aren't in a worse situation because they decide they want to be different than everybody else in the world all right on top of that let's consider the fact of who's actually doing the help over here in Ashville in all these places is it is it do we see black lives matter out there no is LGBTQIA out there a lot of rainbows out there no drag queen oh oh oh it's it's fucking Christians and churches and quote unquote extreme right wingers who are there with their toxic masculinity saving the mother fucking world okay so where are we talking about that where are all these groups where are all these groups that care so much about humanitarian humanitarian causes where are all the people who were marching in black lives matter and all the people who march in every June and call us you know toxically masculine and all that shit oh that's right you fucking need us you need us because you won't do shit you'll post on the internet you'll paint your face you'll take out your dick and shake it at fucking school meetings and shit because you think you're entitled to do things like that but when shit really hits the fan who's doing the work it's the same people that you say need to be on a domestic terrorism list and that are complete that are threat to democracy and all this shit bro you better pray that you don't get the way you want because dude what's gonna happen is you're not gonna have these people to stick up for you and you're gonna be totally fucked yeah now other things I want to cover quickly too on this topic because like I said there's been a lot of stuff that's happening down there there has been reports of groups going around looting and stealing from from stores and stuff like that now it's not who you think it would be you know obviously Americans are hurting down there they're desperate people need supplies and need things like that but they're they're getting their resources whether it be you know from these privatized civilian groups going and providing aid but check this story out and it's funny because there's a fact check behind it where hurricane halane looters undocumented migrants okay stay with me okay Tennessee authorities confirmed to Newsweek Tuesday that a group of eight men had been arrested for suspected looting in a flood devastated area but claims that they were undocumented migrants were unfounded okay they're unfounded all eight are currently in custody at the Washington County detention center held on twenty thousand dollar bonds according to local law enforcement officials the arrest now this was made September 28th okay I get away this is just showing you how nobody's covering this shit and we're gonna see why in a second but the suspects appeared in court today actually now the men were charged with various burglary offenses with five of them facing more facing the more severe charge of aggravated burglary for breaking into occupied structures now here's a list of these men names Albin Nahn Hoon Vega Rapolo David Badon Rapolo Rapolo Kevin No Martinez Lopez Marvin Hernandez Martinez Daling Gabrielle Gullian Gullian and then there's other three more other ones that were charged with burglary Hasez Lodian Garcia Paninda Hosez burato orders Valdez and Ezra Lionel Ortiz Valdez but they have not certainly unfounded certainly unfounded unfounded they are illegal migrants totally unfounded I don't know why you don't Carolina you're a racist for even thinking that they're for drawing dude this is real shit well listen they want you to feel like a racist for even drawing that conclusion you can't even say anything about real shit otherwise you're a racist if you look at actual facts actual data and you say there's the data there's the reality there's the facts they call you a racist okay I get you to shut the fuck up which they have removed the meaning of racism from society now because now anybody that claims it is just gonna get laughed at I'll take a bad take it as a bad runner I'm just saying but yeah clearly yeah I'm sure those guys have been here their entire lives yeah the documents got swept away in the hurricane that's what it was yeah um you know and and and and all jokes aside man there is actually a florida's about to get hit as well a hurricane Milton reaches category five strength on approach to Florida where many people are saying that this is probably gonna be the worst hurricane in a hundred years to land in Florida and that's expected to to hit within the next 24 48 hours you know so I mean we're hurt right now as a country and I think it's important for people to remember that no matter who's in the White House right now we have to be strong as a nation we have to be together as a nation with unity continue to do the great things that we've been doing down in those communities and no matter what the fuck they lie about we're trying to get us to prioritize look um I had a thought about this which is definitely you know outside the norm of what would be considered you know uh it's a theory all right what is it it's interesting that all these people in the Carolinas who are primarily Trump supporters and then all these people in Florida who are primarily Trump supporters all the sudden are getting hammered by this weather and okay they're getting hammered by this weather could happen it's hurricane season mother nature right we could talk about that um but the response has been minimal and the response by the government has been delayed and it almost makes me wonder if this is some this response is somehow playing into them planning on stealing the election because like I said earlier everybody knows who's winning everybody knows who's ahead Kamala Harris had a 27 or 28% approval rating before Biden dropped out nobody likes or the people that do like her they don't like her because of anything productive they like her because she's not Trump all right and if they steal the election like I said earlier they're going to have severe civil unrest well wouldn't it make sense then if they knew that they were going to steal the election and have civil unrest to let parts of the country wallow and hardship and indistruction during that time period and not try to fix it wouldn't that make sense because wouldn't a lot of those people be the people who would be riled up and potentially take action in in the face of a stolen election and what I think is another stolen election doesn't does that make sense uh listen and then you throw on top of it their ability to manufacture in cloud seed okay and I'm not going to sit here and say these are manufactured but I'm not going to say they aren't all right so uh you know let's just say for benefit of discussion that these are just natural occurrences and this is a coincidence there's still an issue with the response you know they say you know two times is a coincidence three times is an intentional act so we'll see what happens from here I wouldn't be surprised if we have another one that happens again and these are people who are by and large very staunch Trump supporters and who's going to take action if they steal the election those people those people who are very close to Washington DC and I don't know man it seems like they're it just seems too much coincidence to me yeah if controlling the weather there's a little too too too too out of pocket for you to comprehend or believe that's fine oh they won't even do it in response itself is is enough to be like okay there's some funny shit going on yeah you know because they don't benefit by helping these fucking people that's it they don't benefit from they actually benefit from letting them fucking wallow in this destruction they benefit from it and you know it makes sense to me man guys jumping on this combo uh let us know down in the comments what you guys think with that being said let's get to our third and final headline go back to that guy who what did this guy say again you want to see the clip what do he do uh he was the one that was pushing he's a FEMA director executive this is a FEMA director executive this guy here yeah and he was talking about how they needed to prioritize funds so this guy is in charge of the disaster relief or partially in charge of the disaster yeah for sure huh yeah well that makes sense he's definitely voting for Trump that guy that listen dude you could tell from look at Adam what he's about I say check his hard drive bro no shit oh man walking around with cartoon shirts like that no shit bro no shit just saying just saying guys let's get to our third and final headline headline number three last little update for the day I'm going across the world again obviously today when we're recording the show it's October 7th so talking about the anniversary of the 10 7 attack in Israel this is a you know big story of the day talking about and again it's just very interesting just to see the priorities and how in your face and I don't give a fuck what you think but this is what we're doing mentality that this administration has been pushing because that's what we're getting um cello reads more than 130 projectiles fired in two Israel on anniversary of October 7th attack um with a bunch of different updates um there's interesting things that are happening all across the world all across the country at the time of this recording um Israel has also hit Lebanon and Gaza with airstrikes there's more sirens going off in Tel Aviv all the the normal proxy stuff is still moving about but there are some interesting things that are happening there's massive protest going around the kind of going around the world rallies in Yemen Italy is having some uprising of pro-Palestinian anti-Israeli protesters there's a clip of that in Italy and Italy and Italy and Italy and then just today the FBI decides to release this report that they actually wrote on it before and they wanted to put this warning out um FBI warns of high threat of terror attack in the United States today be aware of your surroundings and put this public service announcement um again they compiled this on October 4th didn't release it until today uh but it says the federal bureau of investigations and Department of Homeland Security are issuing this public service announcement to highlight potential threats in the United States from a variety of actors in response to the one year anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7th 2023 and consistent calls by foreign terrorist organizations to support uh for their supporters uh seeking to provoke violence in the west um again those are going all around the place now there's interesting stuff that's continue to happen i would like to bring some attention to uh between Biden and Kamala very to very different interesting opinions are having here um which is interesting let's check out this clip Kamala to interview um i believe it was with CBS or something like that for 60 minutes it was a 60 minutes interview um and uh let's just check this out but it seems like uh prime minister neton yahu is not listening well bill the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region what did she say i've never seen someone can say so much with saying nothing nothing no i'm serious dude i see some pretty good bullshitters but like and she's not a good bullshitter like at least bullshitters make a point somewhere in their bullshit right there she never makes a point she just talks yeah bro i'm i'm to the point like dude real talk the only reason anybody's voting for her is for for their perceived uh hate hatred of trump their misunderstanding of trump or their their full blown communist their communist or they misunderstand the abortion issue they have been told that trump wants to ban abortions which he has come out and said that he is in support of abortions when the mother's life is at stake when it's incest when it's rape um that that should be a woman's choice he's kicked the decision making back to the state uh i don't think that there's a state and i could be wrong on this but i'm not aware of a state that doesn't allow exceptions for that i could be wrong but i'm not sure what the point of the matter is abortion is not going anywhere yeah and people would rather vote their life away their economic status they're they'd rather be in more danger of crime um more danger from foreign adversaries uh less opportunity for themselves and children than hop on an airplane or take a five hour drive to another state to handle whatever business that you feel you need to handle right and um i mean if it doesn't make sense go to the floor to get bbw's and shit or listen to the abortion abortion is the biggest lie in terms of political issue that's ever been created um over everything else so the democrat policy they don't need a policy other than that because they just point the finger at the right and say they're going to take away your rights no the people you're voting for are going to take away your rights they're going to take away your right to a free society they're going to take away your right to walk down the street safely they're going to take away your right to have uh opportunity in this country equal opportunity for all men all men create equal um they're going to take away a lot more of your rights than what you think the quote unquote you know uh extreme far right is going to take from you because that's a pro freedom party bro they're trying to make a free economy they're trying to make a free society they're trying to make your your street safe your neighborhood safe they're trying to make sure that people get the needs and the assistance that they need from the government um and so for someone to vote for that it just shows their their extreme either their extreme lack of understanding or it shows their extreme hatred for president Trump and the fact that they'd be willing to ruin the rest of their lives and make the rest of their lives extremely hard for that one topic and anybody who has common sense anybody who actually works for a living anybody who has to pay their own way through life abortion is a below the line issue it's all yeah right now yeah hold on it's only above the line for people that don't have to really pay their own way okay everybody who's has to pay their own way and is out there working and struggling and fighting and their money's not going as far and their their their wealth is going down because of inflation they're overtaxed they're overburdened uh all of these things they all understand that abortion is below the line but it's it's a it's above the line issue for everybody who's taken care of everybody who has helped everybody who has government assistance everybody who has a partner who is the breadwinner you see what I'm saying because they're not actually understanding how much harder it has been for anybody to give a head so I'm not saying that uh you know well I am saying this I am saying that people that make that they're they're only above the line issue uh are a drag on society in terms of how much they hurt society because they're not contributing and they're preventing the economy and the crime and everything from straightening itself out over one issue so you know I would consider and throw this back at people you know okay you believe that your rights are being taken away through abortion well are they really or has the decisions just made been made of the state and what's that worth to you is that worth everything else in your life is that worth your children never having an opportunity to win or succeed or become anything um because if it is I think you got your priorities out of line yeah yeah yeah it makes no sense man no it makes zero sense if okay let's think about it like this well hold on let hypothetically let's just say abortion didn't exist let's say it wasn't an issue let's say you couldn't have one didn't exist who would you vote for Trump no shit right everybody would because fucking bro it's it's how much it comes down to how much money is going into your pocket right and how hard is it to live when you're not getting that money that's what it comes down to it comes down to can I go out in my own neighborhood without getting card jacked or shot or have a migrant slap your fucking kid yeah like that video I said that's crazy do you know I'm saying like there's far more issues man that we got to deal with an address and here's the other truth too it's like yes it was sent back to the state and so most states in this current election cycle are putting on they're able to put those ballots on go vote for your state then yeah you know I'm saying like if you really wanted that bad your state will not you know I'm saying the federal government is not going to dictate what your state's going to do you dictate it yeah that's how it's supposed to be that's just country was supposed to be like yeah you know this shouldn't be the government federal people understand that they they hear one or two sound bites and then they listen to all their friends and their friends are willfully ignorant they don't want to admit that they picked the wrong side they don't want to admit that this time you know it's not a good idea to vote that way I mean do the democratic party of today is not the democratic party of 20 years ago and anybody who's been alive long enough to know that knows that you can very clearly see it that's why we see all these people who are above 35 years old who are democrats switching all right and we also see a lot of young people switching compared it four years ago right and it's very visible it's visible on social media it's visible on all platforms the censorship is worse than it's ever been and that's why you have Hillary Clinton saying all this shit but after they steal the election she's going to say it was the most secure election in American history right these people are straight up real life communists they will lie to your face directly and tell you things are that when it's completely the opposite George Orwell wrote about this in 1984 and the animal farming he wrote about it it's written in rules for radicals with Saloninski it's written in Karl Marx if these people would actually read those books which they don't because they don't read fucking books they listen to these dumb fucks on the internet if you would actually read those books you would understand that a big tactic of what they do is to tell you that the opposite to not believe your eyes and ears and that something else is true that's a that's a and then the other technique they use is to accuse you of the things that they are doing themselves so when they look at all these patriots and they say they're domestic terrorists no it's them that are the domestic terrors they're the ones deconstructing our civilization they're the ones demoralizing our citizenship they're the ones destabilizing our country they're the reason that your money's not going as far they're the reason you can't go down to your your downtown areas without getting fucking jacked or fucked with they're the reason okay they're the reason cops aren't allowed to do their jobs anymore they're the reason okay so you're gonna trade all of that for this below the line issue of abortion that you may need to uh have or discuss once or twice maybe in your entire life so you're gonna flush your whole life down the drain for something that is a maybe once in a lifetime situation that you say those are my rights don't you have a right to a safe society don't you have a right to opportunity don't you have a right to secure elections don't you have a right to a bunch of other things that are all being taken away from that party let's talk about the other rights you see what I'm saying they're taking away way more rights than they're relating you have they've just tricked you into thinking that they're taking women's rights when they when they're not yeah guys jumping on this conversation let us know what you guys think down in the comments let me set let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumbest fuck guys uh this is where we bring a headline in we talk about it to get one of those two options this is what that being said a thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads gardener mince you caught in disgusting act alive on TV after being benched in disastrous game now this is this is this is a nasty shit it's pretty it's I don't know who that is he's a quarterback for the Raiders he had a pretty pride why I don't know who it is well

day for the Las Vegas Raiders quarter back he was benched for a backup aiden o'Connell in the teams 34 to 18 loss to the divisional rival Denver Broncos mince was relegated to wearing a headset for the remainder of the game but late in the fourth quarter camus caught the quarterback at an opportune time he was seen sticking his thumb along the edge of his nose and then moving his hand no no no
