always a little truth to those arguments and narratives like just a little bit you know they just they don't they don't paint paint the picture correctly no they think because you're the one but we're all oppressed yes you people think because they belong to some sort of protected group that they're more oppressed than the other group right we're all oppressed equally and they got us arguing over like who's oppressed more who's oppressed more right that's what it shows about like we're we are far from the concept of true freedom that this country was founded upon yeah we're 246 years away from it yeah we could completely honest that's right it's like fuck the fascists yes yes yes yes yeah yeah I agree dude I saw a fucking meme this morning that said it was like Antifa and then it had like

civil unrest happens I'm going for a drive all right I'm just gonna be real yeah like I can't fucking wait I'm gonna paint like sharks mouth man that's gonna be awesome dude it reminds me of like that zombie movie what's that zombie movie uh what was he I don't think it's zombie land I've seen it yeah that's a go I like zombie you have you seen zombie land yeah it no I was saying like for you you know you guys always fuck with me about the movies yeah but zombie land is not brave heart or gladiator this is for the patriot zombie lands like a movie it's good though okay but I mean I'm just saying you could probably learn some like tactics from that movie okay you know I'm saying all right I think it's like more like a documentary yeah for sure all right I got it I got it guys let's get into this man I got some good ones for you uh Andy question number one hey Andy uh I'm gonna listen there and I love your take on the societal and political issues happening in our country I think we're being manipulated for other personals uh for others personal gain most recently we've been sending billions of dollars to Ukraine and over the years we've sent billions to other nations crime and uh crime in our cities is up the roads are shitty and our education system isn't the best I don't have an issue helping other countries but I feel like we should help our country first what are your thoughts and what role do you think the United States should play in helping other nations can't pour out of an empty cup right now our cup is pretty empty our strategic oil reserves are at the lowest rate they've ever been at our economy is in the worst shape that's been at in the last almost 40 years we have more crime than we've had in the last 40 years we have a massive migration problem we have a divided populace we have all kinds of degeneracy happening at the highest level uh men dressing as women shaking their you know balls and little kids faces claiming that it's like inclusivity um I think we're a long way away from spending any money towards any aid towards any country that isn't the United States of America and for people to really understand this you should think about how many countries right now are sending money to us to fix our problem with our homeless situation or our crime situation or our uh border situation or any of these situations where are all the other countries sending us money to fix those issues because in my lifetime we've never received any money from foreign countries to do these things we've always the American people we not that our government we have paid half of our money if not more than half more than half for most Americans because when you count up all the tax that we pay uh it's not just income tax it's property tax it's personal property tax it's sales tax it's withholding tax it's fucking gas tax I mean we could go on and on and on your tax dollars that you pay back to the government are more than you get to keep and we the American people are spending more than half of our income and sending it to people legitimately across the world that actually fucking hate Americans and that's absurd and that's where we're at and so my personal opinion is zero dollars should go to any foreign aid for a long time until our country is in a place where it should be and where it needs to be and when we're in a place of strength and prosperity and our people aren't living on the streets and we don't look like a third world country then we could talk about maybe maybe helping some of these other people out but until then which I think we're 20 years away from that that conversation should be shelved that's my opinion you know like have we looked at the pictures of what Ukraine looks like right now oh they're partying it up and what the United States inner cities look like right now I mean we're under attack people don't understand that like we're under a chemical warfare attack with the opioid problem the fentanyl problem you know our cities have turned in some of these cities the guess which color they voted okay blue are complete fucking wastelands because these idealists and it's mostly upper middle class white women who have their heads in their own fucking asses who don't know shit about what's going on in the world who haven't experienced any hardship in their life who have honestly gotten through their life most of the way on their fucking looks and they've dated up and they go to brunch every Sunday with their pinkies up and these women have out tried to outliberal each other and tried to you know outvirtue signal each other and they voted these policies in place and look at what's happened to our country like look at it look at what's happened we live we we aren't moving to a third world country we are a third world country currently Europe there's tons of places in Europe that are much better than us there's tons of places in Middle East that are much better than us there's tons of places in Asia that are much better than us those are facts okay the people are happier the people are more prosperous society safer these are facts it's not arguable and people are still hanging on to the idea that America is the greatest country in the world America is not the greatest country in the world America could be the greatest country in the world I believe America has the greatest people in the world I believe that the American spirit is the greatest spirit in the world but right now that's heavily demoralized and suppressed and we have to look at it from a from a lens of reality I just had a good friend of mine who's really smart who built a multi-billion dollar company that you all have heard of who was in Switzerland and he came back and he said bro we're the third world country we're third world right and we're spending all we're we're getting our money stolen from us which makes it hard for us to live puts pressure on us to send it away to people that aren't even citizens of our country that makes zero sense we should be spending zero dollars in any other country for any other any other reason at all none zero see to me that's the most frustrating part it's like when you look at when you look at the reports of like you know where the money's going to and so it's going to India for gender studies how do you know or I mean I mean to that's the that's my point right and it's like but even the labels that they throw on who who's running the initiatives over and let's just say Pakistan right for this gender study issue oh those are Americans so American tax dollars are paying American programs in countries that aren't America for American citizens who are tied to the government to profit from these programs like they're stealing the money from you guys right they're stealing our income and they're parading it around on virtue because we have a large percentage of your population that has never touched reality in their whole mother fucking life and they continue to vote for this shit they continue to champion for this shit they continue to think they're the good guys and that they're doing a great thing by standing for all this backwards shit not realizing that they're being manipulated into the literal destruction of our country they're the useful idiots that the communist right about okay and that's your that's your aunt and your fucking cousin and these people who don't know shit about shit who've never built anything they've never employed people they've never actually been a successful person in any way shape or form somehow they've figured out how to survive and they made their way into like this upper middle class society where they don't touch any pain points they don't pay any bills they don't do anything on their own and somehow these people have controlled the social narrative in our country and we have to take it back to reality now that's going to offend some people and guess what I don't fucking care look around you we've let these people make decisions without resisting at all and look what it's created it's created a fucking shithole we have to be realistic about what the fuck it's going to take to fix this and the first thing it's going to take is telling people don't know what the fuck they're talking about to shut the fuck up it's real shit man real problems need real solutions bro yeah and the first step to solving real problems getting the people that are creating them to stop creating them yeah it's real shit yeah guys Andy our second question Andy I started my own fitness studio three years ago my question is how do you differentiate situations and opportunities as something that is either a distraction versus something that has come into my awareness to bring me closer to my goal I never wanted to distract my energy but I don't want to miss out on opportunities either so how do you differentiate distractions and opportunities I mean look you should have the ability to look at a certain situation and determine if it's a distraction or an opportunity by where this situation could potentially materialize if you were to apply effort to it so if you have a situation and you have a hard time deciding whether or not this is a distraction of your time or whether or not this is going to contribute to your business or your life then you should in your brain or on a whiteboard or on a piece of paper take both situations and project them out three years project them out five years if I put this time and energy into this what will it produce and look at it from a future perspective three years from now this situation here could produce an increase in sales five X over what we're doing now this situation here while I like it and it's cool if I put my time into it it might not make a difference it might just be more fun that's a distraction you see what I'm saying yeah and a lot of people in business right now I'm just being honest shouldn't be in business you're making decisions based on your emotions and not making decisions based on practicality and reality and that's why a lot of businesses fail they don't have the entrepreneurship game has been glorified and been made into this thing that everybody it's for everybody and everybody can just quit their job becoming entrepreneur entrepreneurship is no different than any other skill set it's no different than being a professional basketball player it's no different than becoming an architect it's no different than becoming whatever there's a skill that you have to learn that takes time to learn okay and not everybody's capable I couldn't go be a fucking architect I don't have the capacity to do the tedious shit I took engineering drawing school I earned school I fucking hated it because it was so tedious right I'm not built for it I'm not built to do 360 slam dunks on the fucking basketball court but you know what I am built for I'm built for entrepreneurship you know what I have decades of experience in entrepreneurship and people fucking think because we got these bozos on the internet telling people how easy it is and how it's this thing for everybody that you can just jump into it it's the only profession that every single human being thinks fuck I could do that really could you dunk fucking basketballs like LeBron James you could do that too you know what I'm saying could you engineer a skyscraper on a on a fucking blueprint could you do that too because when you think of entrepreneurship you should think of that level of skill in the realm of entrepreneurship and because we have this ridiculous narrative that's out here that this is for everybody and everybody should consider this as an option we have a lot of failing entrepreneurs and the reason that we fail in entrepreneurship is because you don't understand that emotions have to be removed from it you have to determine what's fact what's fiction what's reality what's gonna play out and you have to be very disciplined in that decision making process to actually make it work and because situations and opportunities are constantly presenting themselves people have a hard time steering away from the emotional opportunity which isn't really an opportunity because if you played it out for three years you would see that there's nothing there versus the actual opportunity which looks like hard work which if you put your time energy and skill set into in five years could five or ten extra business from where it is right now and they will mistake the fun thing as the opportunity and then the hard thing as the distraction you see what I'm saying backwards dude listen a lot of what you guys are hearing on the internet with the exception of maybe like fucking five people total is bullshit all right these motherfuckers telling you there's a hack bullshit these motherfuckers telling you it's easy bullshit these motherfuckers telling you it's gonna have balance bullshit these motherfuckers telling you that it's gonna be anything other than every fucking inch and every ounce of energy that you have as a human being being poured into this day after day after day after day if they tell you anything other than that they're lying to you that's reality and I'm good at this so take someone who's not good at it throw them in it and then fucking watch them waste five years of their life for something they'll never be able to do yeah and I hate to shit on people because people hear that and they're like oh well if you say that everybody can do it yeah everybody can do it everybody can go out of that basketball court and hit some fucking free throws I can go out there and shoot some free throws right now that doesn't mean I'm gonna play an NBA got it that's the difference and so like we have this these lies happening in the world like dude you're with me every day how much fucking stress do I endure it manifests itself physically it's non-stop I can't walk 30 fucking feet without a major problem hitting me and one of my companies legitimately if I walk from if I walk a hundred if I walk 90 feet I'm gonna hit three problems that's real shit okay and a lot of you guys just are not built for that you're not fucking built for it you're built to live a normal life you're built to fucking and you might be built to be a great entrepreneur a great fucking contributor maybe you could take one aspect of a business and you can grow it into this huge thing and it makes you a whole bunch of fucking money that should be most of your goals the people who have to like actually be at the front like bro you're talking about managing a thousand different little pieces at high levels all the time dude it would it's not a real thing for most people it's just not no and and the reason people have trouble succeeding in entrepreneurship right now is because they're listening to the wrong people telling them the wrong shit selling them the wrong shit about how easy it is and these people who could be great entrepreneurs who could build great careers with the right out the right organization are ended up ruining their whole lives because they're not built to handle that load and and they think they can no and the love dude it's relentless and don't say I didn't fucking tell you it was there's nothing nothing I've ever said since the beginning I started podcasting I said any of this was easy or that it was for everybody it's just not yeah I want to I want to actually this too because I think a lot of times like when I when I hear this word distractions when it's mixed in with opportunities for some reason I keep hearing the like the word like scam right have you when early on a business right because obviously you know over time you're going to develop that bullshit me dude you're gonna learn how to oh my god you're gonna develop that but when you first started out did you ever almost fall or fall for some type of business game no absolutely I went to a story on that no yeah I absolutely have when I was when I was 17 years old right before I started the company with Chris we started we were 19 when I was 17 uh the internet was pretty new okay this is like 1998 97 right the internet's still really new and year huh good year yeah Google wasn't like like when you guys think of like Google like you we have to like go back in time all right because society was so different this is actually what makes me good at business because I understand how people buy and how they bought before the internet and then you apply that to the internet but that's a whole different topic I teach that in RIT the the before the internet there was the yellow pages okay do you know what the yellow pages are phone book okay most people the most people today haven't seen yellow page book and fucking years there's yellow pages and white pages right exactly white pages were the directory for human beings yeah that's right it was it was it was truly racist all right good old days in the white pages which also contain black people okay you could look up people individuals yeah yeah and phone numbers to their home okay even that really I'm not to catch up but even that right there but like that's so like to even just think about that being a case now where like there's this book that has literally everybody in your fucking zip codes information yeah but the world wasn't like it is different like there wasn't all these scams like there was there were scams but it's not like like this digital shit it's like bro the internet fucked up humanity like I don't care what anybody says and people will say because every time I say it they're like yeah but look at you look how much money you've made I don't care I give it all back I would give it all back today to go back to how it was before the fucking internet because I know how to win before the internet too because guess what I was winning all right so the reality is this we have the white pages we had the yellow pages and the internet comes along and there's no Google there's no like nobody really knows what the fucking do with the internet except you send emails and look at naked chicks all right that's the reality of the internet at that time all right so there came this thing called the internet yellow pages all right and they they came out and then and they they said you could be the official internet yellow pages person like owner of your city all right it's $8,000 okay but you had to go sign everybody up all right and then they signed up they paid for uh preferential spots in the yellow pages because in the yellow pages if you remember you look through and some people would have a whole page some people would have half a page so you would pay the yellow pages extra money to have bigger spacing in the in the book and this was the same concept online and uh hey grand you know we'll set you up in business and fucking bro I paid it and it was a total fucking scam like they had no infrastructure it was just a fucking lie they didn't have you know like they send you very like there was no support um but yeah I got taken for $8,000 and and you know that that was a fucking scam um there's but today like the problem is is today there's so many scams that people can't differentiate between scam and real you know I'm saying like dude because some of them are really good listen dude there's very few there's very very very very very I'm talking there's maybe three people I know that I would consider good coaches that could actually coach you to success that don't actually have a company okay outside of those two or three people all right you should not learn from anybody that you can't go buy their product if you can't go to the store and buy their product if you can't go online and buy their product experience how they run their business uh you know fucking watch if it's like you have to vet what's real like there's so many people that are straight up lying I just saw today like a lot of these e-com um guru crypto guru there's been like a string of these dudes getting murdered now because people are fucking so tired of this of these scamming shit all these young kids these 20 fucking something your old kids driving around and fucking Lamborghini is talking about their funnels and shit don't buy a fucking thing from them okay they don't know what the fuck they're doing they haven't been doing it long enough yet period okay you have to understand there's a fucking level to this that if you want to learn you got to learn from real people you can't learn from people who have not done it or or pretend they've done it you have to learn from people who have done it and it's weird because like to me this is obvious because I saw it all materialized but like do when I see these young kids they haven't they have an impossible time differentiating between what is a real opportunity and what's not no like dude if you can't vet them out like if you if you can't figure out what businesses they run you were to buy their products or to their products from them if you don't know like you know like what they actually did like there's some guys who have like done shit and sold their shit and now they kind of teach people how to do shit like if they don't have that track record why the fuck would you learn from people who did who who who don't have it when there's people available they do have it it doesn't make sense yeah that's because I mean the only reason I can think of is that they're just so focused on the outcome well no because it's out look bro it's no different than anything else everything sounds good like like with the better you said hey man I could teach you how to make literally seven figures dude in the next eight months if you buy my program look what I'm doing I'm driving around for our ease Lamborghini you know easy I could sell that fucking shit to people yeah do you know how fucking much money I could make selling that like if I just said that shit like me just and I showed my real life but I drive a fucking car that most people will never even see in real life to work every single fucking day in a different one like do not easy it would be for me to do that to run my brand around and be like fucking buy my secrets blah blah blah blah blah but what do you hear me say what do I say I say it's hard as fuck ain't no secret let's go take a long time there ain't no fucking secrets it's gonna cost you everything you got you're gonna go crazy multiple times but at the end it's gonna be worth it that's what I fucking tell people and that's the reality and then within that journey there are real skill sets that you must learn how to how to sell how to lead how to manage how to market how to fucking brand how to do all these different things that are required to run an actual company not just have a click through funnel but run an actual company the skills are acquired through that hard journey you should only learn from people who have been down that road real real real shit no I love it man I love it guys Andy our third and final question I'm gonna ask the question but I actually want to ask a follow up but I guess before you answer the main one if that makes sense but the question is question number three guys Andy what are the defining factors between a business that is scalable and one that is not okay and before you even answer that I just want to ask you it like are there certain businesses that are just not scalable is that a real thing or is it your position because you've you've scaled multiple businesses right like is every single business scalable or are there some that are just not depends on the market it depends on the market depends on the sample size of the market yeah you know if you could make a small business go the chances are there's a whole bunch of other people out there that you can scale it up into but I mean just because you could scale it doesn't mean you can scale it into a billion dollar brand you might be able to scale it into a seven figure brand you know what I'm saying something scale but they scale small they scale from you doing it building popsicle houses in your in your kitchen with your kids into Etsy right where you're building popsicle skyscrapers right and and then you know you you hire your your in-laws and your cousin to come over and build popsicle skyscrapers with you and you start selling them and you sell $50,000 worth of popsicle skyscrapers that's scaling yeah so it all depends on what we're talking about when we talk about scaling so like the first thing would be if you want to scale to a large size you have to make sure that the market size is appropriate for the size of the business that you want you know what I'm saying yeah okay so it just depends on on what you want and what you want to create okay so market size that's definitely so that that's a defining factor absolutely because like you can't sell listen bro you can have the best lemonade stand in the whole fucking world sell the best lemonade it's ever fucking been invented ever and you put it in the middle of desert that's how it's a great idea bro everybody in the desert needs lemonade except there ain't nobody in the desert so you can't scale it right see what I'm saying right a lot of people do this shit they make they you know like using the popsicle analogy they learn I make the greatest popsicle skyscraper that's ever been made yeah and nobody fucking gives a shit and but people might be a few people that yeah this is basic shit that people don't think about yeah not every single business is scalable into you know this massive financial empire but maybe those people just want to scale it into 50,000 and that's okay but the problem comes when you have something that there is no market for and you think that you're going to have it and become an 8 9 10 figure type situation and then you're just spinning your wheels and you're going to always spin your wheels so so thinking through this kind of goes back to the first question where we talked about you know the distractions versus the opportunities we have to be able to look at what we have what's our idea and then project that into the future three years and then project it like another three years okay what could this become what could it look like and if you can't see that materializing into something that you would want it to be then it's probably a bad idea to spend your time doing it and this this is common sense to people who've been doing this for a long time but for people who have never done it they don't think like that this is not one of those conversations no they don't they don't think it through bro you know how many entrepreneurs come to me with a terrible product that they think like it's a good product this is it no it's actually a good like I'm not saying it's a terrible product like it's shit that their version of the product is actually pretty cool the problem is nobody's gonna buy it so that's a big problem that you cannot overcome like there's only and there is there is you know this is there's exceptions to this there's niche markets you know I like to use the example of the butterfly expert you know like let's just say you're in you're in the butterflies well there's a lot of people that are in the butterflies right and if you made some cool butterfly t-shirts and some butterfly stickers and some shit you're gonna sell some you probably be able to make a nice little business off of your butterfly you know passion but the reality is never it's never gonna be Amazon it's never gonna be it's never gonna be you know even a medium-sized business it's never gonna be an eight-figure business because that market's limited yeah right yeah exactly what what what you're taking just on a quick like following up on this I mean because you've mentioned like you've had people like come to you with business ideas what should take on people who are trying to reinvent the wheel how many of those people have you seen I think well I mean look I think most things are are you know um there's a saying and writing that all great writing is creative rewriting which means that there is nothing new right so true innovation is very rare so reinventing the wheel is what most people see as innovation true innovation is super rare most things they get credit for innovation are actually just people improving upon the current model which is reinventing the wheel a little bit right um so I think there's a place for that mentality I think most people succeed by just taking a product or an idea or a service that already exists and then improving upon it or making aspects of it better or or you know uh making it faster making it quicker making it cheaper making it more high quality like there's all these different variables that you can put on to any product that you want to improve and then create a competitive product with and that's most businesses uh we're most innovation happens in business is in the way that people do business not the product itself so how they actually uh you know interact with their customer base or how they fulfill their product those kind of things innovating there is actually a lot easier than innovating with the product because fucking there's so many products right yeah um so most products because the internet is so big and vast now have become commoditized where there's very similar things all over the place for very similar price so the question becomes how are you going to innovate your brand image and your fulfillment of that product so that it becomes an innovation in people's eyes you see what I'm saying so so so I don't think there's anything wrong with thinking about reinventing the wheel but what I will say is that most people think too hard about it they overthink it they overthink and simple wins man most people like most people are very simple and if you complicate it you'll lose sales and that's that's a lesson that i've learned by experience you know you know so um just understand that you know you're dealing with someone who's giving you a fraction of their attention for a fraction of a moment and
