Yeah, that's what what I signed up for Dude, so so you know we talk about winning Here on the show all the time. That's what all this is based off right like becoming successful right and continue on that Journey and I love seeing other people win you love seeing other people win So I thought this was interesting. I wanted to get you take on it But let's check in with with with with our boy Dion Sanders. He's hot right now. Oh, yeah He's always been hot. Yeah, let me be crazy. He's never not been hot. Yeah, okay, but this hell I reason Dion Sanders doesn't hide Take on college football's best coach. Let me see a mirror. So he did this interview Dion Sanders answer to who he thinks is the best coach in college football shouldn't surprise anyone quote Let me see a mirror so I can look at it Sanders said during an interview on CBS 60 minutes. So here's here's a clip. Okay, and I just want to get your take How you feel about it, right? Because I feel like there's a couple of things that people Misunderestimate or misunderstand when it comes to how successful people Really are right and what like what's required is the individual to be successful Mm-hmm. So I want to get your take on it and see what you think here's the clip Who's the best coach in college football today Let me see let me see a mirror so I can look at it You feel that What you think I'm gonna sit up here to tell you somebody else You think you think that's the way I've ranked that somebody else got that on me, but I tell you this I love and I adore and I respect and Every time I do a commercial with coach Sabin It's a gift just sitting in his presence and hearing him and and throwing something else out there So I could hear his viewpoint on it because he's forgotten more things than I may ever accomplish so I'm a student looking up to this wonderful teacher saying Just just throw me a crumb of what you know Now but didn't shy away from it. So I mean what should what should what should take on this boy? He said Nick Sabin We said look at me though come on man look bro. I'm I'm gonna be real about this okay first of all 99% of the people out here don't know what it takes to win They have no idea what it takes to win because they never won all right, and I'm gonna say this before I say what I'm about to say about Deon Just because he's won at things in the past or been great at things in the past doesn't mean he's gonna great be a great coach All right winning is earned every single day winning is something that you must do every single day in order to win in a long term and what you do today Will manifest itself in the next 30 60 90 days the next six months the next year these things are Going to eventually show up in your life whether that's you invested everything you could to become a winner today or whether you fucked off today Eventually that's what's going to happen whatever you did today will manifest itself as your life down the road That's reality so he has a lot of work to do okay. He's just beginning his coaching career However, I believe he's an amazing coach and I like him a lot and I'm really tired of seeing people Hate on this dude because he has some boldness and some swagger and some confidence about himself Think about where we are in society to where when someone says that they believe in themselves It's looked at as on yeah, it's looked at as arrogant or not humble or not Let me tell you guys something you're not gonna get anywhere without belief in yourself You're not gonna get anywhere. You're gonna be just like everybody else and all these people that are fucking hating on this dude You guys should look in the mirror and you guys should take notes and instead of hating you should ask yourself Why is he like this and then consider the fact that? You being like this if you just had one tenth of the confidence or one tenth of the boldness that this man has put out over the course of his life Your life would not only be more productive. It would be a lot more fun All right, but we have all these naysayers and all these people who hate on this dude because they don't have any swag inside them They don't have any confidence and this is just Reflect this is totally reflective of what all of you guys are going to deal with when you set out to do whatever it is that you want to do You're gonna have everybody else which is 99% of people look at you and judge you and they're gonna say Who do you think you are? Oh You're full you know you're full yourself you better remember where you came from and the reason that it's like this is because 99% of these people have never done anything and they're never gonna do anything So you have to ignore them if you want to become relevant and Dion's great at this Yeah, like he sets a great example for this He sets a great example for what it looks like to believe in yourself to have confidence to have fun doing it to have swagger And this is a big deal This is a big deal that people need to see because the worst thing in culture right now is this attitude of Be humble Be little be less than you are don't step out of line Don't believe in yourself otherwise you're arrogant otherwise you're not humble otherwise You were this and this and this and this and this and you know what else you're gonna be with that you're gonna be broke Okay, because there's not a regular person out here that just acts regular out there making it happen It doesn't happen go tell you okay. We brought up Nick Sabin Nick Sabin's got more swag than you guys know you guys don't get it How do you think he commands the respect from his whole team? Like dude leaders have this and he just is open about it and people don't like it nobody taught you exactly They just don't know I think he's awesome what he's doing man like he took a program last just last year They only won one game. Yeah, you know I'm saying it's like yeah already like you know He's on the like listen like you know people can kind of criticism criticize you know certain decisions he made I think what he's doing is just fucking awesome. I love to see it and like he's shaking up this like You know the the old school mentality of like you know approach to coach and you know Did you see that he brought out a little Wayne for yeah? Like dude that's fucking bad ass listen man. There's no nobility in playing small you know at all in your life The reason you're playing small right now is because the people that you've grown up with the people that you know Have made little comments to you over the course of your life which have made you play small and because you've known these people your whole life And because you're a good person and because you actually Value the opinions of the people that you grew up with you are deciding to throw your entire life All of your dreams everything that you ever wanted to be to the wayside for the opinions of people who are legitimately irrelevant In the big scheme of things. This is a big problem in society and Dion Understands this and leads in a way that shows people and gives them permission to actually stand up and be who they want to be I love what he does. I think he's amazing. I think he's an amazing example I think they're he's gonna learn lessons. He's gonna take knocks because this is new to him But I think he's gonna end up being one of the best coaches out there I think he's gonna end up being a Person who consistently wins because he has the winning magic and if he could figure out how to have the winning magic that he's always had as a person and Move that down into the culture of his team. There's there's zero chance. They're gonna lose I'll be honest. I'm not yes, they're gonna lose games But I'm saying over the course of his coaching career He will end up being one of the greatest coaches of all time. That's my opinion. Yeah, that's exciting to see I just wanted to get to take on that man. Yeah, I love it. It's been getting a lot of heat Bro, I've been seeing all these people fucking criticize him on the internet bro And it really honestly, it's a bunch of losers. Yeah, it's a bunch of people with no swag No confidence who are meat quiet humble little people who don't say shit who are criticizing this dude And it's like bro if you just have one tenth of what this dude had Do you know how much more successful you'd be like if you had the courage to step out and be who it is? You really want to be in front of the world? Do you know how much more successful you would be how much more fun you would have how much more gratifying fulfilling your life would be how much more impactful your life would be people don't understand this because They're so afraid to step out a line that they never get out a line and experience it, but I'm telling you it's true Ask me how I know Okay, I open the internet and get any given day 50% of the people think I'm shit The other 50% seem to like me a whole lot you soon I'm saying because I come on here and I do what I do and I do it the way I do it and I've always been that way And and I see it were different obviously, but I see a lot of what I believe in this man And I'm a huge fan of him dude. I love what he's doing. I was a fan of him See I grew up watching him play. I was a fan of him when he played You know what I mean a lot of these kids nowadays there. This is their first taste of Dion So they think he's just now like dude if you think that Dion is flashy now Oh, dude, you don't even understand he was like this guy was the original like Manifestor maker of swag and sports. Did he start the chains like wearing a chains? Oh, he's the first guy that wore like long earring and like like dude the guy that dude He let's say new he's a fucking legend. Yeah, period People don't understand dude like they don't understand how how legendary this man is and what I really like about him Is the example that he preaches and sets for his young men? You know what I'm saying like listen to his speeches listen to what he's teaching listen to the message that he's given Yeah, he's he's got a little flash to him and you don't like it because you don't have any this dude's like taking young men And teaching them how to have fun and have swag and win and also be a good person Why do you not like that? Why does that bother you so bad? That should be something that you ask yourself There's nothing to not like about what he's doing in my opinion. No, I agree with you man I agree with you and they got some they got a like I mean listen to three know right now. Yeah, big games coming up But you know, you know, I could tell you this you know, they they're gonna The only problem I see with them is that they need to work on their discipline a little bit. All right, but They continue to win they continue to go they continue to show up and play hard and practice hard. They're gonna do real well. Yeah Yeah, what we show we show yeah, he reminds me of a more disciplined My Amy Hurricanes team from like the 80s when Jimmy Johnson was our house. Yeah Yeah, we'll see these teams are fun to watch bro That's nobody likes watching boring shit like you guys this this in this whole conversation translates into like Some of your guy like you guys are out here trying to make a name for yourself with content and you're being like this boring little nerd Right and like you're like you're not gonna be able to do it You're gonna have to become something that people notice and this man is highly noticeable Dude I get I get I get annoyed that people hate on him. I get a noise me Like there's nothing to hate on him bro. Anybody hating on this dude is just showing their own insecurities That's my opinion I'm not saying he's gonna be the greatest coach ever I'm not saying he's gonna be a better coach to Nick Sabin. I'm saying I like what he's doing I think it's important what he's doing and I think people should celebrate what he's doing instead of like throwing shade on this dude because You know you don't like his chains you know the sand That's real man guys tell us what you guys think you guys team team sanders. Let us know drop down in the comments But it is cti So let's get to it guys remember if you want to see any of these Pictures articles links videos go to any facility comm you can find them link there You can also check down if you're watching on YouTube in the description below Find them link there as well. So that being said headline number one headline number one reach Actor Russell brand accused of rape and sexual assault. I refute these criminal allegations This is this is an interesting one. Okay. This is a very very interesting story And I my hope is sharing this headline that we can actually you know give the folks a holistic 10,000 foot view totality of circumstances Surrounding this because I actually really really like Russell brand both as like an actor comedian But also just as a person right and the things that he's been talking about here recently in the last you know four years I like him like him a lot Just because you like him over the last four years doesn't mean that this didn't happen though 100% 100% But but I think and then he that's something that he talks about like let's just let's get it like let's be okay Let's be real man. I like him a lot too. Mm-hmm a lot But before I liked him I didn't like him and he was he was he was always drugged up He was kind of a deviant like the way he handled himself was like kind of like this burnout dude And it never appealed to me. Yeah, and and uh I do that. I never really found him to be funny um But since he's taking this turn I do enjoy his content. I think he speaks a lot of truth. He's highly intelligent There's no doubt about it and I've I've learned to really appreciate what he does. Yeah So but this is not about like or dislike Oh 100% right 100% I think is uh well to your point too He's he's been completely open-knotted. He didn't like himself during those times Well, and I think that's called being a human is growth There's there's there's plenty of periods of my life where I look back and I'm cringe about like The person I was yeah, like that's called growing as a human and unfortunately we live in a society where You know when you grow as a human being and you become a better version of yourself People don't let go the past version of yourself because of the internet You know back before the internet, bro Like if you just change and became a better person people didn't throw your old self in your face your whole life Now they weaponize it every single time and anytime we need it we can pull it right back up right exactly No, I'm not a big fan of judging people on the shit they did 10 15 years ago or five years ago like that Like I'm a completely different person. I was even five years ago. Yeah, you know what I mean? And everybody should be if they're trying that's the point. Yeah, yeah, no, that's really like I mean I got his his counter video that he did yeah Now I say all of that because I haven't looked into this or really heard anything about it So I heard a little bit about it. So let's hear the details. Let's dive into it because I got his response video and everything Let's dive into this. So Russell Brand this guy everybody knows him Russell Brand Has been accused of rape and sexual assault by multiple women and a joint investigation from the publicly owned channel for news network and the Sunday times in Britain The British comedian vehemently denied any wrongdoing and preempted the publication of the allegations posting a video on Friday evening In which he said that although he has lived a promiscuous life all of his sexual interactions were consensual Brand went on to suggest that the publications Of the allegations stemming from between 2006 and 2013 May have been politically motivated Asserting that there is a quote serious and concerted agenda to control Independent media personalities in order to silence voices critical of mainstream liberal narratives The investigation in which was published on Saturday by the Sunday Times claimed that four women have come forward with complaints of rape sexual assault As well as controlling and abusive behavior from when he served as a presenter on BBC radio 2 And the left-leaning publicly owned channel 4 and then later during his time as an actor in Hollywood So one woman Toes knew the news outlets that she had been raped by brand and his then Los Angeles home and that she had sought treatment at a rape crisis Center later that day the paper claimed to have seen text messages from the hours after the alleged incident in which she relayed to the actor That she felt That she had been taken advantage of And in writing quote when a girl says no it means no to which brand is said to have replied that he was quote on quote very sorry A second woman claimed that he had sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old She claimed that during a relationship the last three months He had referred to her as quote the child and quote And had once choked her as he quote forced his penis down her throat prompting her to punch him in the stomach to stop him There was a couple of other allegations Let's see his response video Okay, and then we'll weigh the the opinion of the public here is his response video Hello there you're wakening wonders now. This isn't the usual type of video We make on this channel where we critique attack and undermine the news in all its corruption because in this story I am the news. I've received two extremely disturbing letters or a letter and an email one from a mainstream media tv company One from a newspaper listing a litany of extremely Egregious and aggressive attacks as well as some pretty stupid stuff like a my community festival should be stopped I shouldn't be able to attack mainstream media narratives on this channel But amidst this litany of astonishing rather baroque attacks are some very serious allegations that I absolutely Refute These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream when I was in the newspapers all the time when I was in the movies As I've written about extensively in my books I was very very promiscuous now during that time of promiscuity the relationships I had were absolutely always Concentral I was always transparent about that then almost too transparent and I'm being transparent about it now as well And to see that transparency Metastasized into something criminal that I absolutely deny makes me question is there another agenda at play Particularly when we've seen coordinated media attacks before like with Joe Rogan when he dared to take a medicine that the mainstream Media didn't approve of and we saw a spate of headlines from media outlets across the world using the same language I'm aware that you guys have been saying in the comments for a while watch out Russell They're coming for you. You're getting too close to the truth Russell Brand did not kill himself I know that a year ago there was a spate of articles Russell Brands a conspiracy theorist Russell Brands right wing I'm aware of news media making phone calls sending letters to people I know for ages and ages It's been clear to me or at least it feels to me like there's a serious and concerted agenda To control these kind of spaces and these kind of voices and I mean my voice along with your voice I don't mind them using my books and my stand-up to talk about my promiscuous consensual conduct in the past What I seriously refute are these very very serious criminal allegations Also, it's worth mentioning that there are witnesses whose evidence Directly contradicts the narratives that these two mainstream media outlets are trying to construct apparently in what seems to me to be a Co-ordinated attack now. I don't want to get into this any further because of the serious nature of the allegations But I feel like I'm being attacked and plainly they are working very closely together We are obviously going to look into this matter because it's very very serious in the meantime I want you to stay close Stay awake, but more important than any of that if you can please stay free So that was his response video and since then His agents dropped him His talent agency that he was under they dropped him. No way. Oh, yeah very very very quickly um And like I said, I mean, it's all over MSM. So I mean Listen I need to see evidence and I think that that's something that a lot of people and by evidence like okay I want the text message. I want whatever truth evidence that they're stayingly have I want to see it because I think too often people tend to jump on These bandwagon and then you know days later a week later the truth comes out and it's like oh Well, he didn't do that right and like we get we sell ourselves when we tie ourselves so vehemently And we're willing to just throw people under the bus without seeing any actual truth or to me's innocent so proven guilty Well look man, I mean the fact that these two stories come about at the exact same time from the actual media It's definitely coordinate. Yeah, I mean that's what it What it looks like. I mean, it's not like he's being polite. He's saying. Oh, that's I feel attacked. No, dude You're clearly being attacked Here's a guy that goes on his YouTube every single day and talks about the bullshit Just like we talk about the bullshit and we know how they attack us They attack us with other things they attack my company. They attack 75 hard. They attack me as a person Now with this level of shit yet, but I'm sure you know That's probably not off the table And they're gonna come around and they're gonna go and they go dig and they find all these people from the past Who may disagree with what you're doing or maybe they're just bitter or maybe they're just jealous or whatever and they say this shit And this has been happening you know this this me too culture where men can be just accused of some sort of sexual misconduct and be held accountable with no proof and no You know trial no no actual real evidence whatsoever other than someone's accusation is absurd And it's been happening for years and years and years and it ruins people's lives and men You know men get their lives ruined every single day by false allocations of sexual misconduct and you know People get mad when you say that well some of them are true some of them may be true But they don't have to be true and that's the culture that we live in We live in a culture where men can be accused of things and be found to be guilty and to your point where you said Oh, it comes out a few days from now It could come out three years from now that he actually didn't do this But by then his shit is all ruined and they know that and this is this happens Not just to to people like Russell brin, but this happens to actual just regular men on a daily basis a relationship went bad A bad breakup some sort of you know bitter feelings. Oh all the sudden there's these accusations And then all the sudden the man is fired from his job. He's dropped from his contracts. He's you know You know ostracized by his peers and by society as some sort of sexual predator when in reality dude They just broke up and it didn't go the way someone wanted right and then no one ever talks about what these women do during these Relationships like no one ever talks about them getting shit face wasted and beating the fuck out of the men No one ever talks about them, you know doing all kinds of crazy shit like we live in a double standard society for For men are literally at the mercy of accusations And this is why it's my opinion that if a man is accused of rape and he is found to be not guilty of rape The accuser should have to serve the sentence of the actual rape That's what should happen. That was only way to stop this It's the only way to stop and correct the culture because it's too easy for women to accuse and men not to be able to do anything about it a woman Can ruin a man's life on an accusation and that is not okay. That's not okay for me It's not okay for him and it's not okay for anybody And until we have accountability for the false accusations that are made the false accusations will continue Especially against people that are wealthy and famous and have a political opinion So my opinion is the whole rule needs to change And by the way, I believe that most people see this as bullshit I believe that most people are looking at this and be like yeah, this is bullshit. This is a political attack What well? I'm saying you know what's funny is like some of the The lives have like jumped in there's like what better way to protect yourself than build a brainwashed network of like minded people to support you When these allegations come out like they're trying to like yes, look in the mirror Look in the mirror. I'm just like what the fuck man. So you think this dude like four years ago just like He's wonder the guy's famous. He's rich. He's popular Girls are gonna want to fuck him like that's reality, okay, and all it takes is one girl saying oh he was a rapist Because she didn't give him or he didn't give her the relationships she wanted or money or whatever Didn't buy her the card didn't show her the love or didn't make her the position of the rank on the team You know because these dudes all got a team right they got their top five. That's reality like You know and dude these Like these women go crazy and they make up shit and that's what happens and it's wrong And I personally believe that if I was present in the United States today I would make the law that if you accuse someone of rape and they are found to not have done it And there is no evidence of them doing it and you That you will have to serve the sentence of that accusation Well, dude. I think on a deeper level to a woman have to understand is that like you know We're getting ourselves into a very dangerous thing This is no different than what they do with racism right like they cry racism Craz does is make it's gonna make real cases and real instances of rape mean nothing No, Deja, that's already happened. Yeah, that's already happened Like my first my first Gut reaction to this even though I said that doesn't mean it's not true. Mm-hmm My first gut reaction when I heard of it was this is an attack. Yeah, this is bullshit Because there's been so much of this that you can't Identify when the actual rapes really occur anymore And that was the danger of feminism in the Me Too movement We've accused men like and now women are complaining that no men will approach him No shit wonder why yeah men are not going to approach women anymore because you guys have villainized men And all possible ways like dude If cut the dicks off of you have to talk I saw a poll I saw a poll not too long ago that showed like 40% of women considered a man approaching her as a salt like some crazy stat like dude So we've taken these terms and we've made like Like just because someone had sex with you and You didn't like how the outcome went right for whatever reason that's that rape Rape is like forcibly Like forcing your fucking penis into the vagina and a lot of times Being the shit out of the like when I think of rape that's what I think up You know what I'm saying like the definitions have been so watered down now and the culture has been like the The acceptance and culture of those things being true has been so widened that you cannot identify when someone is actually a victim And that's to your point very unfortunate for women who actually are victims of rape and Vic and actual victims of rape should be the one standing up and saying the stuff I'm saying saying dude this is gotten out of control There's way too much accusation Until we stop accusing falsely the real ones will never be identified And still to my point do you want to know how you how you find out who the real ones are you make the you make the law the way it is like dude They knew that that was gonna be a conference. Yes, they wouldn't fucking correct There would not be false accusations There would only be real ones and on top of that that's how the law should be on every lawsuit Like every lawsuit if you sue someone for something And they find out that they're not guilty of it whatever you're requesting is damages you should have to pay them If we fix the legal system to that dude it would cut out 90% of the BS But the reason the legal system doesn't get fixed like that is because the people who make the laws are actually the lawyers And they don't want to cut off their own income stream. So It's common sense But they won't do it because it cuts money out of their pocket No, man. Now look dude. I want to say this too like real talk Like yeah, there's cases where men are out of control and beat the fuck out of women And like do those men should be putting the woodchipper. Yeah real talk like if you rape a woman This is why I'm for hard accountability for crime if you get caught raping a woman like an actual reality, bro That should be a death sentence like that's that's that is terrible shit So I want to be real clear. I'm not I'm not trying to undermine the severity of this, but let's be real We shouldn't believe all of anybody for anything. We should look at a case by case and the punishment should be harsh for the conditions that are actually true That's my take on it Yeah, but like let me put into your point though. I need to like like this is a picture of a dude that actually committed a rate There you go There you go. I saw this picture, bro. That guy's guilty. It's sent fucking that guy should down my side Guys should go into the fucking woodchipper. There should be there should be like At the trial and then the woodshipper the next day. Yeah, and if we started dealing with these actual cases like this that shit would stop Yeah This guy's gonna go to jail. He's gonna live out of here's a good thing typically these people get killed in jail Well, look this guy's gonna go to jail and he's gonna live out his hard fucking jail fantasy You know, and like look at him in his picture. He thinks he's some kind of hard-ass Like bro, these people should be eliminated from society. I'm sorry. No like they have no role There's and so like I want to be real clear I'm not undermining legitimate accusations, but there's people have weaponized Accusations whether it be racism whether it be feminism whether it be me too whether it be anything to the point where we no longer know What's actually true and what's not true and there has to be a correction in the law In order for us to figure out what's actually going on anymore. Yeah Well, yeah, and the damage from the allegation is typically 10 times worse than especially for a man Yeah, that's real shit. No, it's a valid point, bro. It's real shit. Wait hold on bro.

It's a decent sign.

Yeah, stop don't not be up. Don't be a hoe Share show. What yeah, something like that. All right. I think we got a backwards there That's not number two. Let's keep this show moving headline number two. I sued my own dad Let's get into it And Biden sues IRS alleging agency whistleblowers improperly disclosed info to congress So this is a big deal apparently And everybody's sitting on the fact that you know, he's technically suing his father Interesting how that goes like does he get brought into discovery right like I mean, I don't know So Hunter Biden launched a lawsuit against the IRS on Monday alleging IRS whistleblowers improperly disclosed information to congressional investigators about the Justice Department's tax probe Into his financial affairs So basically he's saying listen. It's not about you know Don't don't worry about the ship being true or not How we got out is the problem like like come on man. What are we doing? What are we doing? Let's ask me a straws They are reaching for any and everything Um, so Hunter Biden's lawyers claim when IRS agents informed congress and news organizations of the justice departments alleged Handling of this tax probe into the president's son the IRS whistleblowers allegedly disclosed the damning allegations and properly Among the allegations the whistleblowers alleged Assistant US attorney Leslie wolf refused to allow investigators to ask about president Joe Biden being The bit guy the DOJ twice prevented you United States attorney David Weas from bringing stronger charges against Hunter Biden Attorney general Merit Garland refused to name a special counsel in the tax investigation and the IRS recommended charges Uh against Hunter Biden that were not approved by Garland um, so there's this long sting of daddy and son You know Just saying fuck everybody else. We don't really care. Well, you know leave us alone, right? Don't charge us with anything. I get that I could spend has been proven that's probably the stuff that the whistleblowers That came came to the table with so I continue to says quote This assault on mr. Biden's rights involve the public disclosure of his confidential tax information During more than 20 nationally televised and non-congressively sanctioned interviews and numerous public statements the lawsuit ledges Against his father's government Uh, the disclosures included quote detailed allegations regarding the specific tax years under investigation The amounts of deductions the nature of those deductions the uh and allegations of liability regarding specific tax years And the amount thereof that could only be known to them based on a review of the physical tax returns themselves The lawsuit claims so the Houseways and Means Committee in June voted to public uh to make public the many instances of the alleged political interference In which the DOJ thwarted hampered or interfered with the IRS tax investigation in Hunter Biden in turn IRS commissioner Daniel Worfell confirmed in July the rights of agency whistleblowers to make protected disclosures to Congress So these two guys who work for the IRS They found this stuff about hunter. They're like, oh, this is illegal. We should bring this up They brought the stuff to the DOJ the DOJ said don't touch it Right so after this went on five separate times this DOJ do that for everybody I have to leave that for you. No, for these guys are all you guys listening not for the jail six guys I'm just saying like you know, it's interesting how Everybody else out here gets treated one way, but the DOJ is stepping and protect these people I wonder when people are gonna get fed up with this but boom And so these two guys they saw this and these are like listen like like when I was watching the testimony I think we talked about it here like these aren't like far right activists like, you know These are just regular humans like they're doing their job. I would call them not very non-biased right And but they're seeing these things happen and they're bringing them forward You know to you know as they should and they be in turn to weigh and they're like this is wrong. This is not right Um, so uh director Worfell uh, he said quote As employees you are the first line of defense to call out issues that raise concerns and I want to I want it to be clear That we will always encourage a see something say something philosophy hero Hunter Biden's lawsuit against the IRS comes as his attorneys reportedly pushed the DOJ to prosecute the whistleblowers after the committee Voted to approve the public disclosure of IRS whistleblower allegations Um, and everybody's talking about it. You got even got you know left-wing news mbc CNN they're all talking about it Um, and we also know that this is coming after the Hunter Biden was just indicted on federal gun charges. So um, Andy, what do we got on this? Well, I mean, it should infuriate people that there's a double standard that if you if you do the same things that this man does You're going to jail 100% this guy has the entire government stepping in front of him protecting him because his dad happens to be the president It's absurd. No, and it's absurd that these people the Biden family continues to Do all of these illegal things and get away with them You know who are they the king of America? Is that what we're dealing with the royal family of americans because of my opinion The Biden's have always been a fucking joke Okay, Joe Biden was a joke when he was a senator He was a joke when he was vice president and he's the biggest joke. He's ever been now And like everybody runs around protecting these people like there's somebody when in reality do these people are clowns They're traders to America and they deserve in my opinion more than jail. Who may actually is why would people protect them Because I would see a few reasons right well You know, mostly I think the main tool that the government uses to leverage protection against certain people's blackmail I think that I think it's my personal belief that every single phone conversation every single Conversation held within an electronic devices listening capacity Is recorded and kept and this is what Edward Snowden was trying to tell everybody and then they painted him to be a traitor, right In reality our own government has been spying on us They have all of our photos. They have all of our talks. They have all of our all of our conversations They have all of our texts at all times. So When they need something to leverage someone They just access the NSA data or whatever agency data is holding this They find it and they figure out a way to make it become exposed and then they use it to get what they want and so really what we're dealing with Is an entire country that is blackmailed in the compliance, you know, maybe not you maybe not me maybe not us yet But in reality I think that's what they do to these people who are the decision makers in these kind of situations And I think they have so much shit on all these people that these people are willing to comply And that's my opinion So I think the other possibility is to that they're complicit in the corruption with them right like 100% you know I'm saying so I think the blackmail is definitely a massive piece of that puzzle. Yeah, nothing also a lot of these people They're also getting the same checks from the same fucking place. Yeah That's why they bring them up on gun charges as opposed to bringing them up on you know Charges of of library extortion treason Yeah, you name it right, you know Yeah, I just thought this was interesting and everybody's talking about it And it's still weird man. I feel like we're in a very very weird place right now like specifically within the month Uh, you've seen a lot of weird stuff coming up um This Biden stuff. It's just like it's just not Not making enough sense to me. You know, I'm saying like all of the stuff that they're throwing All the polls that they're trying to put out how left media they're starting to like you know Back away from the Biden's is just a little bit It's due to it's just a very very very weird time. I think I saw a tweet on world star Which is a mainly Black mainly urban Instagram account. It's a culture account That said That Joe Biden was going to make billionaires pay 25% of their tax okay, and It was like it's time the billionaires pay their fair share all billionaires should pay 25% something like that And the cut I think I said into you maybe the comments Were like typically you know three or four years ago. They would have been like yeah make a pay their fair share Right all of them were like hold on that that's not how they sell Yeah Right while they go out and march to the To the narrative put out by the biggest companies and those richest people in the world thinking that they're fighting the man Okay, right anyway. I read the comments and in the comments section it was 95% to 5% people were fed up with this shit They're like that's not gonna work anymore bro like we all understand what you're doing And it was it was really refreshing to see Especially from the urban black community that follows world star primarily to say hey We're not falling for this bullshit And I can notice the way that the responses and the comments were written People are starting to feel insulted and embarrassed that they fell for this in the past You know people were pointing out all kinds of things Yeah, so so basically the cost of goods can go through the roof and we can afford less shit bingo Right like people are starting connect the dots and understand the trickle down from the punishment imposed by the richest people on the world To the mid-level richest people which they call quote-unquote billionaires Which is actually just the owners of most of the businesses that make the goods that we consume on a daily basis And people understand that those penalties will flow down to them and they will end up paying the difference Yeah, there was one comment dude. It was like you think so you think billionaires are gonna make less money That shit just rolls down here to us like I saw a bunch of comments like that people are starting to get it But four years ago nobody got that. Oh nobody would have said yeah, no And that was outside another comment it was like Uh Like something like you know you guys are a joke if you think or he's a joke if he thinks his donors are gonna go for that too You know i'm saying like so people are definitely well awake on that. I think that's a great temperature check for sure Yeah, but the problem is dude is that you know the media is turning on this guy And everybody's starting to like kind of celebrate the media turning on this guy And nobody's asking the real questions. Why are they turning on him and What are they going to do in place of him and what's that going to mean for us? Because just like I've been saying for years and years In my opinion this guy is the character that they installed into this position to make the most dramatic moves against the interest of the United States migration Crime in the cities inflation Cost of good supply chain problems Uh money going to Ukraine right like we could go on the shut down or domestic oil the shipping of our weapons to Europe Where we actually have a shortage of ammunition and weapons here uh the depletion of our strategic gas reserve We could go on and on and on and on about all these things this man's done And if we had a comp an a leader who appeared to be competent Right Making those decisions there would have been a revolt But because this guy appears to be seen now because he appears to not have a mindfulness about him and not be with it People give him a pass saying he's old and doesn't know what he's doing No, they know exactly what they're doing Joe Biden might not be in on the game like he he probably thinks yeah, I'm finally president Um, this is awesome, you know, I'll do whatever they tell me and he probably thinks you know I paid my dues but the jokes on him because they've ruined his legacy He's going to be remembered as literally a dictator of a president in a bad way He's going to be written into the history books as a fucking tyrant forever and and a corrupt human being and like dude I don't care who you are. You don't want your legacy to be that You see what I'm saying? So like they've pulled a joke on him that he doesn't understand yet And now they're turning on him and instead of being excited I think people should be really nervous about what comes next, you know, that's what guys tell us what you think comes next Let us know what's up in on this conversation. Well, they're gonna they're gonna put Michelle Obama in the race Yeah, okay, but that's that's not what I mean by what comes next. I don't mean what comes next I mean, what are they going to do next once this other person gets in there, right? No Is it going to be a fallback where a thousand percent more push forward Yeah, I think I think I don't know Yeah To me it feels like they're all in on the destruction that they can cause between now They are afraid of the election at least a little bit otherwise they wouldn't be persecuting Trump the way they're persecuting him So that tells me from about it. Yeah, they can't just steal the election like people say like people Said oh, they can just steal it. They can't just steal it. There's a fudge. There's a percentage in there That they're able to fudge it their way and they're afraid that Trump will overcome that ability to fudge their They're cheating right so they're afraid of it, which is why they're persecuting them which tells me that they might be realizing at this point in time that They're a little rain of terror, which is what it is and destruction is coming to an end and they What I see them doing is continuing to move us down the wrong way as quickly as possible Because Biden's up in Alaska canceling the oil production in Alaska, right? student loans start back up next month. Okay. That's a squeeze on both ends for the for people who are struggling right now and there's a lot of people struggling credit card defaults and uh credit card limit reaches are at the maximum level that they've ever been in the history of the United States All right, so we have all of these actual economic factors and I think oh between now and the election They're going to try and squeeze the American public so hard and create as much destruction as they can That way if Trump does get in or someone whoever gets in they have a hard time cleaning it up I think now they've said fuck it. Let's go all in. Let's destroy everything And we'll blame it on them right and they'll try to run that same play they ran on Trump The last time where you know, they made up stuff They made up the Trump russia collusion. They made up the steel dossier They made this stuff up and then made our lives miserable with the constant mainstream media Pots staring over this guy who's not part of their play. You see what I'm saying? So I think they might be thinking their only chance is try to run the same play again but You know, it's going to depend on who what someone does who's the next person in office You know whoever's next in office has a massive amount of Cleaning up to do that is not going to be palatable to a lot of people in this country Like a lot of people are going to scream cry and throw fits and we're going to have to ignore it Yeah, you know, they're going to have to deal with it. Yeah, because it's going to be drastic That's just a good respect to baseline Well, all of these migrants all of these migrants should be rounded up and put back in Mexico. Yeah, all of them I said let's let's actually get into that topic because that is our third and final headline Uh, headline number three our third and final headline reads Video shows train filled with migrants heading toward us southern and border from Mexico Now this video is going viral There is a shit ton of it and we got it here of course Uh, for you guys to see so let's dive into this a pharix mechs train Out of zaka teccus mexico and heading toward the us southern border was packed with migrants Who could be heard cheering while hanging off the sides of the cars video shows Now the train was captured on video on sunday despite the us sending a stern message to migrants do not come Well, they're going to come So border patrols along the southern border have been facing overwhelming numbers of illegal crossing Here is the video of the train for those of you guys who have not seen it yet That's a shit ton of people it's not people it's single men Let's be clear This isn't families this isn't destitute, you know distressed families that are oppressed seeking shelter from their oppressive government like aoc and these people try to tell you it's single military age males And if you think about What just happened up in pennsylvania that we covered on the last cti where it took what two weeks to find this single guy who was hiding in the woods And then you think about 10 million of those people being here. What do you think is going to happen People need to wake up dude We are under Attack we are being invaded. This is real. This is not you know Alarm is this is not like It's real shit. Yes, like what what is the problem here where people cannot recognize what is actually happening dude Most Americans are not equipped deal with what's happening here. Oh fuck like dude You can see it. You're not going to be equipped for it like you're not going to be able to walk down the street with your wife You're not going to be able to take your kids to places You're not going to be able to do shit because these motherfuckers are going to do what they've been doing over in Europe for the last five or six ten years Which is attacking people taking their shit living in their homes Squatting in their places like dude and you people because you haven't Educated yourself or understand what's actually going on sit there and say oh well These people are asylum seekers. No They are being sent here for a reason and the reason is not to come here and Play nice. What do you think these men are going to do When they come here. Oh, they're going to find a woman and where do you think they're going to get these women from You're fucking family, bro People don't get it dude and I'm not talking about you know falling in love I'm talking about what's happening in Europe what's happening in Europe? Why don't you go on the Google machine and start looking up at the women who are being raped all over Europe by these migrants Who have went there for the last five or six years? This is a George Soros funded invasion to destroy Western culture That's what this is that is not a conspiracy theory and something needs to be done Or we are going to lose our country forever We will lose our society forever We will lose all the values and all the things that make America great forever They will be gone forever and you will not get them back And and and do this so crazy because you know we've posted a few times we've had this story come up Where we talked about these single military age mills coming over um by the thousands right um and Just last month 20,000 migrants in border patrol custody Um, but that's just the ones that they've been able to catch and Custody and then they're playing this game of catching fucking released right Now while this is going on Another exclusive report that daily mail has dropped today Um, and again, this is a topic we brought up nobody wants to to heed the warning Um, but look at this This is uh this headline reads exclusive Chinese spies Could be using the southern border to get into the US top Republican wars Um, oh, so they're listening to the shows that we made a year and a half ago exactly um But but this was a very interesting winner you when are you guys going to start putting us out there like the way we deserve to be put out there real talk No, like I'm we are so far ahead of every single one of these news organizations is ridiculous and and what you guys are afraid to share the show because I'm so far ahead At what time are we gonna cross the chasm from being so far ahead to just being the guy who predicts what the fuck is actually happening I would appreciate some support there guys. I would appreciate the shares. I would appreciate the love I don't have to do this. This isn't what I get paid to do in fact. I pay money to do this Like this isn't my gig. I'm not I'm not sitting there running an ad at the end of all my videos saying by my shit I'm not taking ads. I'm not I'm not beholden or some sort of controlled opposition to somebody who's telling me to say stuff I'm an American regular dude trying to Care about what's going on in this country and some of you guys enjoy the content listening the content and don't share it because you're afraid of what someone might say about it Well, I don't know if you notice, but things keep getting worse and I don't know if you notice this But if you've been listening for years you would understand that we talked about this a year and a half two years ago Anyway, yeah, not frustrating dude. I get it. It's frustrating to come in here and do this and take all the heat that I take for doing it Which is a lot you know better than anybody you run the security detail But I'm gonna spend millions of dollars a year on security detail Because I do this fucking show Like We're not even talking about what it costs to do the show like the least people could do is like stand behind me and share the shit out It would help man And it's necessary But this was a very interesting take so so um Mark Mark Green okay, this guy here Okay, he sits on he's he's actually the chairman for the house homeland security committee Okay, which means he's getting intel. He's getting all the reports right like he has access to all of this stuff, right? He told Daily Mail an exclusive interview that there has been a quote massive increase of Chinese nationals tied to the people's liberation army or the PLA That have gained access to the US by crossing over the border And to date There has been over 17,000 Chinese nationals released into the United States just Yeah, almost 18,000 just this year alone. So just that's that's 23 that's not 22. That's not 21 exactly Um green they have an army here already. This is what people do not understand their army is already here That's actually exactly what he said. I don't know if you've seen this but that's exactly exactly what he says No, I haven't seen I ring but I know it's really the reason he's saying it's because we said it a year and a half ago Yeah So green called the stupidity of the Biden administration's border policies currently in place mind blowing Because now Chinese spies could act as saboteurs in the same manner Russian military men Established residency in Ukraine before the invasion Uh, he says quote look The Russians did just that they infiltrated migration middle aged military men, you know Go to Ukraine establish residency and then they were the saboteurs during the invasion He said he's not suggesting that China will invade the US But if America were to defend Taiwan against a CCP led a tech Who's to say that there isn't the saboteur in that in that line? Uh, he says continues his quote why are we just so willy nilly about this continued green Uh, who is vowing to get to the bottom of it he plans to direct his committee to hold hearings in the future Uh, on the threat of the Chinese infiltrators using the southern border They're there I know I mean look what I don't know what else to say I've said it all about this. I've been saying it for years people don't listen You know, I'm just a conspiracy theory guy. I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm just the foul mouth motivation guy I'm just the dumbass who has a podcast doesn't really know what's going on I saw comment the other day big mouth small brain really really Big mouth small brain. Okay. Well, then you could do a hell of a lot with a small brain your life because I've done a few things Yeah, I'm doing pretty good. Yeah, I'm doing all right You know what I'm saying like like Dude, I know it is what it is man People are gonna have to learn a hard way. No And like dude when these people come to your home you're gonna wish you had listened to me. I think that's that I'm prepared silver lining here. It's like I think what we're like what we've said this before man But it's like what we're going through this time right now in American history with that all of us get to witness is necessary It's necessary for us to country to have to go through some hard if we survive Yeah, I mean look dude. We're very we're very likely that America is very likely to not survive what's going on Very likely. See that it's still sounds so foreign to even think that man But I know really it's the fucking truth. Wait you sit in here every day and you still think that sounds for what I'm meaning like it's such a Like like that that phrase that statement man like you know It's it sucks to believe that that is the truth. Oh, it's definitely surreal. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, but it's it's reality It's the truth man and this has come from Pacificity amongst the Americans citizens. It's come from the shame that people have been indoctrinated with when it comes to the pride that they should have in this country and being a patriot and being a stand-up great High achieving high Worth high value high drive good American citizen like citizenship They're they're they're they're used to be like and unspoken Understanding that if you were a citizen of America You were supposed to contribute to the betterment of culture and that has long been removed and it's been replaced with I'm free. I'm a citizen. I don't give a shit and it doesn't matter what I do I can go be 400 pounds and consume chemical food and take the pharmaceuticals and sit on my ass all day And you can't say anything about it because I'm a free American Well, that free American is the American that's costing us everything right now and in reality We're a very weak country with very weak individuals and other countries are very strong with very strong individuals And they're coming for our shit and people don't get it and what do you who you think these motherfuckers going down through Wal-Mart? I'm the fucking Electric cart eating coca puffs are gonna be the ones to stop these people, bro Our true American soldiers the ones that went fought for the last 20 years are 40 years old to 55 years old right now What do you think the ages of their military? And ain't that? You understand? They they're planning to exterminate and take over this country. That's the plan and it may not happen for another three or four or five years But these people are coming and they're gonna they're coming to take something from you And that's a real thing and unless people stand the fuck up and understand that they better Start living what it means to be a high-level American right now because no one's coming to save you Like you better get in shape. You better take care of your finances You better get off of the pharmaceuticals. You better get to a point where you're eating the right foods Your freedom has to be exercise autonomously for it to matter in reality People don't get that they think the freedom is something that is granted by a leader Well, if a leader has to grant you freedom, you're never really free Freedom has to be taken on an individual basis through how we live This is why I say personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion if they want you fat You must be fit if they want you sick you must be healthy if they want you angry You can't be angry in your neighbor if they want you to hate you can't hate if they want you to be dependent You have to be independent We have to rise to the standard of what we want this country to be as individuals or it will cease to exist And this is the reality of the situation people are still not understanding that freedom is autonomous And it is only Granted to us when we actually step up as individuals and live it So shit man guys, let us know what you guys think on this conversation jumping on the comments hashtag 22 And let us know what you guys think But with that being said We have our final second of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumbest fuck that's where we bring a headline in we talk about it They get one of those two topics or one of those two options So that being said our thumbs up or dumbest fuck headline reads Good Samaritan pulls Florida man from burning car Oh, this was pretty cool. There's some good news out of Florida. I guess because they usually got some really weird shit I'm going down there.

Not everybody should be on TV. That's great I love this, you know this clearly white supremacist guy Says a black man from the you know car like you know like dude. It's just a good dude doing what you should do Yeah, you know, it's a great thing and You know this is brings into my conversation We talked about earlier about the the stringency of the law right Dude if everybody knew and by the way now I'm just saying this like I've driven drunk plenty of times back when I was a drinker I was a fucking irresponsible drinker dude, you know what I'm saying like it's I When I like when I said I look back at five years ago 10 years ago and think of how I behaved like that's part of it I'm like bro. I was a piece of shit And I did a lot of irresponsible things and luckily no one ever got hurt luckily nothing ever happened but This is why I don't judge people that have these things in their past because like I was just lucky that that never happened to me But here's the reality I grew up I changed and now I realized something that You know we could fix this problem very Simply very simply If you made the the law that said if you drive drunk you're automatically going to jail for a year no matter what no questions No matter what no matter if it's point Zero Two no matter what if you drink a beer and you get in your car you go to fucking jail for a year Do you know how many people would drive drunk? Fucking zero Period they wouldn't do it. They wouldn't do it Yeah Yeah, that's real shit man people would call a newbie or they would call cabs It would actually provide jobs But see the law never gets written into effect because The people who make the money off of these cases the multiple DWIs the accidents the lawsuits They don't want to cut their own income stream off. So for us to ever get a responsible morally correct Society that runs smooth we have to remove the influence of the people who profit from these crimes from making the laws You understand no one talks about this That's real shit thumbs up on this. Yeah, it was amazing 100% man guys Meaty that's all I got all right guys. That's the show. Don't be a hoe show Fuck a stone counting millions in the cold bad bitch. Oh, they're slow got a own bank row. Can't fold Does a note here shot case clothes
