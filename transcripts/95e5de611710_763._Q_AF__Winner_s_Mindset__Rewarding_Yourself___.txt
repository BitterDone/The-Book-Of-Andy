We're having Q and a two different kinds of shows CTI has cruised the internet that's where we put topics on the screen topics of the day We speculate on what's true on what's not true and then we talk about how we the people have to solve these problems going on in the world Other times throughout the week. We're gonna have real talk real talk is just five to 20 minutes and me giving you some real talk All right other people might call it a rant, but it's always highly useful information At least I think it is and then we have 75 hard versus that's where someone who comes on the program who has completed the 75 hard program talks about How they were before how their life is now and how they've used the 75 hard program to get their life Realigned all right if you're unfamiliar with 75 hard It is the initial phase of the live hard program which is the world's most popular mental realignment program in history and but guess what it's free all right You get that in episode 208 on the audio feed for free. It's not on YouTube only on the audio feed There is a book available at Andy for cella.com called the book on mental toughness which outlines the entire live hard program Top to bottom including 75 hard plus 10 chapters on mental toughness Why it's important and how you can build it to build your best life it also includes Case studies from some very famous people that talks about how they use mental toughness to become the very famous people that you admire Right that's Andy for cella.com the book on mental toughness. It's not required because you can get the whole program for free It episode 208 But if you're someone like me who likes the ins and outs and all the details The book is a tremendous resource. We sell it out almost all the time Now with that being said we do things a little bit differently here All right, we don't run ads on the show. You're not going to hear me talk about a bunch of shit that I don't use that Someone's paying me to say that I use We talk about things that matter here We talk about things that are important and we talk about things that the internet doesn't really like us talking about All right, and so I don't run ads on the show because I don't want to answer to these knuckleheads And you know about what I say and what I know say all right, we keep it real here That's why it's called real AF and in exchange for that I ask very simply that you support us back By my shit all right support our companies. I appreciate that but most of all help us share the show all right We get traffic throttles shadow band. We get messed with all the time with all these platforms for saying the stuff That needs to be said and so we need your help getting a show out and that means pay the fee It means share the show all right if you don't share it the message doesn't get out So if it makes you think if it makes you laugh gives you a new perspective as information that you think needs to be heard Don't be a hoe sure the show all right. What's up, dude? What's going on brother? Not much. Yeah, how's everything? Hanging it's fucking long thick baby. Oh Everything else is going good Sweet man a little Monday little Monday, Sausages. Yeah Yeah, no surprise I have some girlfriends for you. Oh you do yeah, okay guys from go once here. All right We're gonna get right into it get better this week. Yeah, let's do it man No, I was like starting a week off with some personal development how to get better stuff. You know, I like starting my week off with Some to eat probably Yeah, that's some of our days. I was gonna say racism, but yeah, that's tomorrow Yeah, man, let's make some people better today though, man All right, let's knock these out guys Andy question number one. What's up Andy? What's up? Andy I work for a small blue collar business right now And I'm learning the trade and I have some years in already. I've come a long way since the beginning I'm learning on the job reading at home and doing all the correct things to progress. I Will start my own business in less than two years the question I have is I Use One thing to put my boss out of business as fuel To push me and I want him to have to sell his beach house his boat pull his kids from private school and go to public school I want his wife to have to get a job. I want to absolutely dominate in my trade Where people in the same trade across the surrounding areas Will see me and hate me because I crushed it that hard and I fucked up for having this mindset You got to talk about mindset. Let's do it. Is that is that a productive mindset to have To get going Fuck man, I have the kids Bro listen that more fuckers trying to eat that man's dinner off of his table while it's still hot All right, I can relate to that. Yeah, all right now. Here's what I'm gonna say I wouldn't make it your boss. Okay. Your boss is doing you a service your boss is showing you the ins and outs You may not like everything that he says or doesn't say But you should value and respect the man for giving you an opportunity to learn what it is you're trying to learn With that being said having the motivation that you're talking about is called being motivated from the dark side. All right I definitely would recommend not making your boss the enemy because the truth of the matter is is this dude probably has so much more experience and so much money and So much more resources and connections that if you go out on your own you say I'm gonna put him out of business This dude's gonna step on you like a fucking cockroach bro, and you're gonna be gone now. Let's talk about this for the for the minute all right Dark energy is highly underrated. It is the most powerful the most brutal the most effective form of motivation That you could ever have it's the shit that'll get you out of bed when you don't feel like doing anything else and That's something that is never really talked about amongst you know the internet feel good gurus Or the people are here who say oh, I'm not in competition with anybody Bro, the reality is as you are you absolutely are in competition. There is a competitive nature to the reality and it's okay to be motivated by wanting to step on motherfuckers throats To win some people are just motivated that way and I know there's all these positive people out here who say well I'm not here to prove them wrong. I'm here to prove my supporters right when the beginning You don't have any supporters motherfucker You know why because you never did anything you've never shown anybody anything that you can do You've never displayed that you're capable of doing anything and so you don't have any supporters So what are you gonna do? I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna show my mom that I'm exactly who she thought I was That's is that powerful or is it more powerful? Hey fuck all these motherfuckers. I'm gonna go out now I'm gonna become the baddest mother fucking business owner that ever existed and by the way If you don't like it, I'm gonna run you the fuck over and then I'm gonna stop on your dick afterwards What's more powerful? I'm gonna prove my mind right or I'm gonna drink from the fucking skulls of my enemies What's more powerful what makes you want to go more? I can promise you 100% of you if you're being honest you're gonna say the second one You just don't want to say it because it's not Culturally approved and it sounds aggressive and it sounds toxic No toxic is losing toxic is being broke toxic is being a waste of the human being because you lack the courage or the understanding or the skill set of how to get you up Get you in motion and build the ultimate version that you were meant to be on this planet, okay? That's toxic. All right toxic is not I want to fucking score a hundred mother fucking goals And I don't want them to score any I get that bro. I am offended I am personally fucking offended that anybody wants to compete with me now in reality do I understand yeah I get it their competitors too. I'm not the only competitor I don't dislike these people that want to compete with me, but I am offended that you think you can Told the lie with me bro, and I'm gonna give you everything I got and I'm gonna fucking stop on your fucking face And after I stop on your fucking face and you realize I've stomped your face I'm gonna pick you up and I'm gonna say I respect you bro for showing the fuck up and giving me all you got You made me better because dude real competition some of the best friends that I have Are people that I've been competitive with in the past and I push them they push me and if you have a true champion mindset and you have the ability to really become a champion In the way that you think you will start to value your competition above everybody else Because they are pushing you to improve so if you have people that you know that are pushing hard to compete with you You can look at it one of two ways you could be like fuck that motherfucker. I hate him or you could say fuck dude Steve's doing a good job, man. I got a fucking get better. I got to evolve. I got to get my game better I got to do a better product. I got to push harder. I got to this and bro once you start to have the the belief and the faith in yourself That you will respond to competition positively because you're a competitor You like when other people push you because without that push you wouldn't get where you're trying to go So we have to learn how to balance all of these things because the truth of the matter is is if you run hot Because I run hot naturally bro. That's my natural setting my natural setting is all the way up bro And when I was younger that would make me angry like it would burn me it would burn me like I get pissed all the time I'd be fucking furious all the time and it's no way to go through life. Okay As I got older I started to realize that like holy shit bro These are the most valuable people in my life these people that push me these people that push me to be better because They're pushing themselves And I started to respect my competition in a better way now. Do I still want to smash their faces? Yeah, but I'm not trying to take their fucking house away and they're I want to compete at a regular level And I want to I want to see who's fucking smarter and who's more effective and who wins And that's what competitiveness is about and I I have massive amounts of love and respect for the people that compete with me. I'm friends with most of them Uh, and we're friends because of what I've been saying, you know, they they push you to be better I value that they value that and we all get better together, you know, they say a rising tide raises all ships I think there's a lot of truth to that But when you're young, it's hard to believe that because none of you have anything nobody has shit So you're looking at everybody else and you're like fuck that guy Fuck this guy. I'm gonna smash this person and dude sometimes that's the attitude that's gonna get you through So I don't think it's a bad thing to have. I think you shouldn't have it towards your boss I think your boss will step on your nuts and probably put you out of business before you even get going if you if you make it like that Um Because I've done that plenty of times. That's true Yeah, it just sounds like it like it's out. It could be pretty toxic Like you just walked through the office your boss is like hey, you know, Joe how you do it? Fuck off. Yeah, wait, wait, yeah You shouldn't if that's your attitude towards him You shouldn't be there. You should go somewhere else, but like You know, look there's a lot to be said for the dark side, bro And your your mentality should be I'm gonna take every single thing that someone says I'm gonna take every smart ass remark. I'm gonna take every iron roll. I'm gonna take every Comment of disbelief and I'm gonna remember who the fuck said it I'm gonna remember where I was when they said it and I'm gonna remember how it made me feel when they said it And I'm gonna take all of that shit and I'm gonna put it up here in a huge mother fucking chip on my shoulder And when I don't feel like going and when I'm having a hard day and when I would rather sit on my ass and do what I'm supposed to do I'm gonna think back to what those people said or what they did or them laughing or them making fun of me And I'm gonna use that to push me into action and that is where the dark side works and people who don't get it Don't get it. All right, but I can tell you this every mother fucking champion every single one Fucking Kobe Bryant Michael Jordan Tom Brady fucking all the greatest achievers fucking Steve Jobs all of them Have tremendous amounts of dark energy and that's what they operated on and they might be able to compartmentalize it and say hey I know to win I have to practice this right because a lot of people get wrapped up in this dark energy And they get so consumed with it that they forget what it is that makes them great at what they do So they forget their skill set they forget they got to put in the reps You have to delineate. I'm taking energy from here And I'm going to do this productive action over here because it's moving me forward You can't just pout and scream and kick your fists and say it's not fucking fair because guess what it isn't fucking fair It's never gonna be fair It's never been fair and you screaming and throwing a tantrum about it. Is it relevant? No one cares That the world doesn't care God doesn't care your family doesn't care It's not fucking fair mother fucker get that through your brain. Okay now take all of the negative shit All the shit your parents said all the shit your cousin said all the shit your friends and family said all the laughter All the doubts all the i-rolls all the shit your girlfriend said and start the fucking remember that shit Don't memory hole it in some place and forget about it and say oh my trauma no say hey Fuck you for not believing me now. I'm gonna go out. I'm gonna use this energy to become so big so successful So powerful so undeniable then when I walk in the room you look at the fucking floor. That's what you want to be I love it. I love it Guys and Andy question about you? Andy I know it has been asked and answered before about when you thought it was the right time to reward yourself by buying your first land But did you ever worry that the justification for buying it will lead you to a slippery slope where you would start splurging After being financial responsible for quite a while I worry about it as a cheat day On a diet that turns into a 10 month long buffet I have always been diligent with saving my money which my parents always reinforced But I've started to look at a 10 year Ford Mustang GT500s a 35 to 40 thousand dollars But I have a nagging voice in my head that tells me I'm going to start spending everything if I pull the trigger on that purchase um Totally that free you know income's fine um, and he has a nice Ford F-150 now, but did you ever hear the same voice? I guess that that same uh Like haunting voice I guess that you know Yeah, yeah, look dude. It's normal to have those reservations when you first get in a place where you could start to afford Those things okay when I when I first started being able to afford a couple things. I didn't go straight into Lamborghini I started looking at 750 BMW because I always love BMWs And I love the big body bevers and I Sal and I both and my dad we all like them and I looked at that and I remember going and looking at that And then calling my dad afterwards and I'm like dad pretty much the same thing what this person saying I'm like dad. I don't know You know if I should get this like what are people going to think what am I like? I started agonizing over this whole ordeal and his answer was simply he's like you'll know when it's right when you when it's time and And he did and he was right. I didn't pull the trigger that time But a year or two went down the road and you know It was like things kept getting better because I kept doing better and I kept doing more and And I also didn't look at it as a reward for myself so to speak you know cars to me Are a passion hobby When I was younger. I'm just being honest. I probably spent more money on cars than I should have like any true car enthusiast But I enjoyed him and it made my life It gave me something in my life that I loved and enjoyed outside of just Working all the time and I think there's a lot of things to consider about this One you have to experience these things To attract more of them If you work your whole life and save all your money and then buy you know 2014 GT 500 which by the way, those are great fucking cars a lot of car for the money Um, I could do a podcast just on cars Like every day, but anyway, uh, that's a beast of a car. I actually had one. I gave it away. That's the same with you Yeah, I had a super snake, but it was uh, I gave it to one of our guys as a as a reward And uh, I still look at it and I'm like fuck that thing is awesome. But anyway You have to touch it you have to feel it you have to experience it you have to taste it For it to become reality and at certain points in time during your life You know, you also have to ask yourself Okay, am I denying myself this because it's what the the regular people tell me to do and I really doesn't make a difference to me or Is this something that enhances the quality of my life? You know, we have a lot of guys like Dave Ramsey who gives a lot of really good advice Bro, but one of the things he talks about is you know, you should drive an old beat or car, right? Okay, well that's cool if you're not into cars dude. I get it But I am into cars and cars for me enhance my quality of life and while you may not understand that any car Enthusiasts will you know, I play with hot wheels my whole life. I had played with fucking micro machines like I am a car enthusiast Like half the time when you and I are hanging out in the garage I'm walking around looking at the cars right there my cars. I can get in a driver like said man This is cool. Yeah, like dude. How many times do I get what do I say every fucking time? I'm gonna get out of man That's fucking awesome. Yeah, it doesn't matter which car every time I pull up to the house I get out of the car. I say the same thing. I'm like fuck. I love that car or I'll say fuck I forgot how much I love this car. All right because it it It provides and like dude, I get it. You're not into cars for me. It's part of my life experience Do I want to drive a shitty little beater every day or do I want to drive something that that I fucking love that Makes me happy that makes me smile that when I get out I'm like fuck that is awesome Or do I want to just do the regular thing and like for car people The second part of it is a big part, you know, we enjoy driving we enjoy cars So my point is is it I could go on and on about this but the point to this young person here Is that and I think I know the answer because you wouldn't want that particular car if you weren't a car person I think you got to you know you got to look at it as you know It's it's a Plus to the quality of my life and what is it going to cost me to enjoy that? You know and then make sure that's reasonable within your budget and as far as like splurging and shit I don't know we'll find out bro, but like I wouldn't do that because then you won't have any cars You know what I'm saying so part of managing You know cars is managing your cash flow and making more money and fucking making sure you know That you can afford them and so sometimes For a lot of people when they have a little bit more pressure They're actually more productive on their offensive side meaning they'll make more money, right? So pressures a good thing sometimes especially when it you know drives you to work harder like for me dude like real talk man outside of cars My my tastes and hobbies are pretty normal. I mean, I don't you know, I don't really care I mean yeah, dude like nowadays like I smoke the best of cars and I but like I don't give a fuck I'd smoke fucking swiss or sweets. I can shit You know what I'm saying like cars are the only thing I truly cared about for the first You know 10 15 years of my business until I figured out that I actually Care way more about the people I do it with Um, but that was a maturity thing when I was younger it was about me and as I've gotten older I realized well fuck dude. I'm gonna be dead and this car shit won't matter I want to help build these I want to help build these families. I want to help build these these people up I want to help these people get where they need to be and that's that's a that's how I see business now Which actually made us a lot more effective in business in every business right? How do we serve the customer the benefits them the most? um But in the beginning you know whenever we were starving dude and we went years and years and years people don't realize You know the internet wasn't a thing social media wasn't a thing e-com marketing wasn't a thing So the first 10 years of business like I didn't have I wasn't able to like set uh, you know uh E-com campaigns to go in this zip code Like I had to go door-to-door bro or I had to fucking run super expensive radio ads because super expensive radio ads We're the only way to get your word out um My first 10 years I made $58,000 or $58,000 $380 for my first 10 years in business combined my first three years I made none The next seven years I made $695 a month That was my income for my first 10 years of running my business and during that time it was very difficult because I didn't have much reinforcement like imagine what it would take for you to show up for 10 years straight And Not really make any money like you would have to have some serious goals and dreams and ambitions for yourself to deal with that much Desert right where you're not drinking you're not eating you're not it's not going well and for me cars Help me get through that time, okay? So like when every time I wanted to quit or every time I felt like it was time to You know close it up and do something else You know I had goals, bro. I had I had visions. I had cars. I wanted to buy I had a lifestyle. I wanted to live and a lot of guys You know they shit on that because they've been outside of that phase of entrepreneurship for so many years that they forgotten about it But like in the beginning, bro like all you got is the shit you want for yourself You know very few people start off on day one and they say I want to build this huge movement that changes all these people's lives I didn't fucking do that now that's what I love now. I love it That's where you are now, bro. I could afford any car. I could I could fucking do anything. I fucking want to do any fucking thing I want to do that without exception both yes plain yes doesn't matter anything I love coming here because I have fallen in love with building for my people and built and us building for our customers And that goes for every business I'm involved in it's fun to be good at business by solving people's problems And then having them be appreciative for it that really matters especially when we talk about like what we do here Which is get people in shape help people make money You know and and fucking do it in a very positive, you know productive way the changes people's you know fucking family tree, dude if we're being honest There's very rewarding But in the beginning bro, you don't think like that in the beginning you're like fuck dude I don't even have fucking 250 bucks I I don't even have a fucking house. I drive this fucking old piece of shit This is embarrassing no girls like me no fucking blah blah blah. I gotta fix this right and so it becomes What can I get for myself? But what was funny for me and the way that this flipped over for me was We got to a point where we were gonna close the the stores and kind of get out of trying to do first form and uh I was gonna go clean carpets and Chris was going to join OCS school and be a pilot in the military and so we made this plan to To Close down the business and I went to carpet training and got hurt and I hurt my back and I was in bed for about 30 days And during this time we started having these discussions about you know What how we were gonna close the store and and basically like we both decided I was like dude I don't want to clean carpets That sucks like because I fucking did hate it and Even though I can make more money, you know, which I could have made more money working at McDonald's I just don't want to do that and he's like yeah I don't want to go to officer candidate school And then we started talking about like what we enjoyed about our business and like what I enjoyed and what he enjoyed was We would have someone to indicate you know remember back then we'd have many customers But we would we would have someone come in every once in a while And we would get through to them and they would come back in three months or four months bro down a hundred pounds down 70 pounds, you know six months down two hundred pounds and given you this huge hug it like fucking tears down Their face talking about how we changed their whole fucking life and they would go on and on and on about all these things And I loved that you can't get that in any other business hardly at all And that was what we settled on and we settled on we said okay, well we'll keep doing this But we're going to focus on creating that and once we did that bro We grew a hundred percent every year for the next five years and we built Fucking everything you see and it's not just exclusive to fitness business It's exclusive to any business when you go over the top to serve your customer in the right way They're going to return the loyalty by by telling all their friends and all their family and Bro, it it just becomes part of a bigger purpose and you know A lot of these guys who have been in business for a long time they don't really connect with that either You know, it's just all about the money and all about the bro I don't know how else to make money than to be the best and to over deliver on the solution I'm not that smart when it comes to how do I but you know like dude I think that's the right way and clearly you know the longevity of our brand speaks for itself so And I point in saying all of this is to say this Uh It's okay to have material goals material goals are awesome you need to touch feel taste and smell them often and Don't be afraid to stick your toe in the water and you know kind of ease your way into it And you'll get comfortable and that will become your reality and this is the most important part of it It's my reality now Okay, every single fucking day I drive a different car to work and I could do that for over a month Every single fucking day My my reality is getting in a car Every single day that I love that I fucking I mean that I paid major price for but Nothing else is accepted anymore like that's the standard and that's where you have to so So how are you gonna raise your standard if you never fucking try to live that lifestyle So there's arguments too and against it But uh, you know if if I'm talking to you I'm saying this don't be afraid to fucking To break off a little coin because if you're truly the right kind of person it'll motivate you more And uh, you know people who save and save and save and save and save and save they never end up they never end up Being happy that they saved other than in times of crisis and like bro. I believe in myself. I if times a crisis come I'm gonna be able to hack it so That's my two cents and it probably goes against a lot of other people's two cents, but you know, I I I understand the car thing and I think you should I think you should think about Touching it and tasting it and feeling it so that you get more of it. Yeah, and it becomes your standard You know, I was thinking about this actually just Friday where we got uh got it got back to the house on Friday It was like And like the the thought was this like man like you know You could have a really shit day, but fuck you It's a job when these cars home. Yeah, it's not that bad. Yeah, you know, I'm saying compared to you know If I'm being told I got to drive a fucking beater. Yeah, have a bad day on top of that. Yeah, fucking windows don't roll down You know, wait bro. How do you know? How do you know? Which by the way I've driven those cars. Is that how do you fucking know How how how do you know how bad your beater is if you never test the water something better? What makes you raise your standard right like if you're a young person You need to consistently stretch out what your standard is and not in a responsible way But in a in a responsible way, right? If you don't start stretching bro I'm sure your next goal is to have a Uh, fucking Ferrari or a Lambo or some cool shit that you want And how are you ever gonna get there if you don't start inching your way there right? You see what I'm saying right Like I didn't just go straight out the gate and buy Lamborghini either bro I had I had a seven-year-old Aston Martin with 30,000 miles on that was my first exotic car I paid 60 fucking grand for it Then I had a v8 r8 Okay, which was used I had a bunch of miles on it then I had two nine eleven turbo s's which were newer and they had less miles on it Then I got my Lambo. See what I'm saying right so I tested it up until that point. No, I love it Guys, Andy question number three Hey, Andy had a question for you about how to be more firm Um, and assertive. Um, is this something that can be learned? I'm a newer real estate agent And I've Given a few discounts to people to get deals done in the beginning of my career But I don't want to do this anymore My time is valuable and I realized by doing that It was worth getting some money, but now I'm getting Busy or realizing more of my value. I want to be firm with people that I work hard Um, and it does take a lot of time and effort to close deals. What's your suggestion? How do I say no now when someone asks to lower my commission? I find especially being a younger female that I've always had a harder time with being assertive But I know that this is something I really need Um, to succeed in my career and make way more money. How do you how do you develop Firmness and assertiveness first of all young people struggle with this okay When you first started business and I was no different by the way When I was the owner operator of my initial retail store Everybody that I knew that everybody that came in I knew Okay, what do you think they all wanted? No discount. They all wanted a discount, bro And it makes no logical sense because we were starving Right and people don't get this like people don't understand first of all never ask your friends and business For a fucking discount you have no idea how it is not Buy this product for a dollar and sell it for $80 that is not what business is like and We as supporters of our friends in business need to quit expecting to get a deal from those people And we need to start instead flip the script and say you know what? I'm going to pay for every single thing. I'm going to be proud to support my friends That's the right way for small economic growth and support and the community support to happen so Stop asking people for discounts your douchebag Secondly We all have problems with this because in the beginning they know that we're the decision maker like now If someone wants a discount on anything like I'm so far removed that I'm just like bro I don't even I wouldn't even know how to do that using my cold a I don't even know how to do that Yeah, so So but there's this middle time where like people try to get you to do that and uh, I was no different man. I had a hard time figuring out how to not give discounts and I could tell you the exact fucking moment That it that I fucking changed my mind on it. I had a lady come into our retail store This is when we only had one store. It's probably three or four years into it And we had this product Uh, that was 2980 that was the pro that's what it costs $29.80 after tax And this woman came in and she was dead serious. She's like I can get this for 2975 down the street. She's not the fuck up She was dead serious, bro. She wanted me to bend on 15 fucking cents And I I was like I don't know if I was just in a bad mood or what But like I looked at her and I said well you better go fucking get it Yeah, and she looked at me her eyes got super big. She couldn't believe I was telling her this But I was so fed up with it and so over it I'm like you need to go down there and she fucking left it went down there and I felt good. I was like Cool, fuck that lady because like bro. It's crazy. Yeah. This is what people will do If you put blood in the water, they'll fucking want to eat and they don't give a shit about you Stop thinking that these people care about you. They do not care about you They care about themselves. Otherwise, they wouldn't be asking for a fucking discount. Okay, so That was a poor way to handle it, but that for the sake of discussion that was when I figured it out You got you to get it. Yeah, after that I said no every single time But there were some tricks that I used to say no to people that I had said yes to before and I'll Use my best one. This is what I always do people will fucking come to me And they would say Andy, can I get a you know 20% off or 10% off and I'd be like look dude I said, you know businesses Tough and it's competitive and we're busy and I can't afford to give my products away I don't even give a discount to my brother and my dad or my mom not at all When I say that last part people are like oh no, dude, I totally get it And then they just they'll come in they don't get offended They will come back in and pay full price and be happy about it But and it's the truth. I didn't give a discount to those people. So it wasn't like I was lying. I just Told him who I would and once you explain it like hey You know and another another little hack you can use is when people come to your house and they say oh, dude Can I do your roof or can I do? No, man my brother does that That's what he does. That's his job. Yeah, I can't do that and then they're like oh, okay cool Yeah, the McSense. Yeah, but the point is is that how do we tactfully address this okay? You don't always have to do that by the way if you get if you realize this other part of it Which is no is a complete sentence right It makes your life a lot fucking easier shit, man. That's deep. Yeah, it's a complete sentence. No Like and it takes a long time. It took me till I was 40 to fucking be able to say no without this paragraph after after it But you know when you deal with enough shit and you have enough people asking you for discounts or this or that eventually You're like no And because it pisses you off because that's what you always deal with um But in this situation, you know, there's plenty of people that you could push this on you could push it on your broker You could push it on the fact that you know, hey look I can't do that because that means I'm taking up time from where I get paid on my full commission To do this at half commission. I can't do that. I'm too busy And people will understand that you could say um, you know, hey, I I just sold my mom's house, dude, and I didn't give her a fucking discount You know, I'm saying like yeah and kind of those kind of things Because a lot of people don't realize what they're asking they have this loose interpretation of what it means to be in business They think because you're in business you're rich. They think because you're in business You're fucking rolling in the fucking coins like Uncle Scrooge and duct tails, bro uh They don't they don't understand that it's hard and that the margins are small and that we're highly competitive And then a lot of times as the owner of a business we're not even getting paid because it goes against the social dynamic that they are presented Which is business owners are rich look at what they're saying about taxes right now They need to pay their share month fucker if you go down the line that business owners pay in taxes It's insane It's insane that we even have the economy that we have that's how overbearing it is so When we break this down into uh, you know What it's really like to be an entrepreneur for people, you know, they see it differently, but you know You're dealing with people who you know, they want to save two bucks and brag about it, you know 15 cents yeah, bro Dude for real that's a real story, bro. That's insane Yeah, she looked me straight in the fucking face, bro, and she's like I can get it 29 the guys net This guy had a store down the street is called uh, it was called Cliff Hancock it was called exercise and rehab he ended up being a good dude But we became friends with him later, but he sold he was competitive and she said I can get it for 29 75 down a cliff. I said well, you better fucking go get it then That was it came out of my mouth. It came out of my mouth so fast Yeah, like fuck man. Yeah, lady dude. I She was the way she fucking looked at me dude. Yeah Like oh, you're gonna sell me this for no I'll rather price match like where the fuck yeah Well, that's what they used to do because he did that he would price match But it created this like and finally I stopped doing it because the game was insane. Yeah, you know, yeah But look man knows a complete sense You know, I gave you some techniques on how to defer responsibility for these decisions because when you are the front-facing business owner and the decision maker It's very hard to say no and still keep the customer unless you do it a tackful way tackful ways would include You know, hey, I can't do that because my broker won't let me hey, you know, I just sold my aunt's house I didn't get hurt at this count. We're not allowed to do that Three I'm so busy if I did that it would take away from the time that I would do this and I can't do that That doesn't make sense and yeah, you might have some people walk away in the beginning But the reality is eventually in a year you want to deal with that ever again And that's where it makes sense to make the investment in and setting a boundary up front. Yeah. Yeah. I love it man I love it guys Andy happy Monday, man Yeah, let's go get it all right CTI tomorrow guys don't forget and let's go kick some asses. We Yeah, we're sleeping on the floor now my jury box froze fuck up. Oh fuck a stoke counted millions in a coke bad bitch Who did slow got a own bank row can't fold does a note here shot case closed?
