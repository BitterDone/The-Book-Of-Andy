What is up guys it's Andy for selling this is the show for the real estate about their lives the fitness and delusions about our society and welcome to motherfucking reality guys today we have Andy and DJ crews the motherfucking minute that's what CTI stands for stands for crews the internet and that's what we're going to do the way this show works is very simple we put up headlines on the screen we talk about them we speculate on what we think is true and what we think is bullshit this is a speculative show the views and beliefs of the people on the show don't necessarily well they do represent the ownership of the show because it's me all right so but what we do here is we basically talk shit on everybody and try to figure out what's actually going on because we all know we're being lied to so that's what CTI's about other times when you tune in we have shows within the show if you were to tune into our show yesterday you would have heard Q and a F that is where you submit questions and we give you the answers now you could submit your questions a few different ways the first way is guys you can email those questions into ask Andy at Andy for seller dot com or you can go on YouTube in the comments section on the Q and a F shows and we'll pick some from there as well just leave your question on there in the comments other times we have full length that's where a guest comes in pretty much like every other podcast you're ever listened to sometimes we do this thing called real talk which basically I just kind of go on a rant for five to 20 minutes about some stuff that I think needs to be heard and then other times we have 75 hard versus where we have someone who has used the 75 hard program to take their life from shit to shineola and if you don't know that reference go google it we have the live hard program and the 75 hard program available episode 208 on the audio feed it is free it is the world's most popular in history mental recalibration program and it is free so if you go to episode 208 on the audio feed you want to get your shit together especially this time of year a lot of you guys are feeling fluffy and shitty and bad about yourself this is the way to rebuild it okay so episode 208 on the audio feed not on YouTube there's also a book on my website Andy for seller dot com if you want to know the inside nuts and bolts of how the program works and what it is that's a great resource as well now I do have a new book coming out on January 1st 2024 so keep your eye out for that as well and we'll have some announcements coming up maybe uh maybe tomorrow night at 8 p.m. central when the second day in the life episode starts I'm really excited about these day in the lives the day in the life is going to be a fun project we're having a lot of fun doing it so we got that coming up tomorrow what else anything else yeah no sponsors we don't have any sponsors on the show I don't take money from people and have them tell me what what to say or do I'm you know contrary to popular belief I'm not a free mason so whatever I do with my hands you know that's pure coincidence there's a whole ridid thread on that on me yeah oh I believe it bro about free mason connection bro I believe it dude like they fucking I saw some comments on last day in the life because the last day in the life they were like somebody was like I I can't believe how uh you know like I thought you were just a normal guy and then I see you're like yeah bro I started a business 25 fucking years ago like I can't be successful I'm not allowed to be successful after 25 years of running a multiple companies like okay so you better have something to fuck dude people are just absurd yeah so uh yeah so that's that's how we do the show uh we have this thing called the fee uh the fee is not imposed by the free mason's it's actually our idea okay uh it's not going to the night's template yeah it's not going to that I'm not a thousand years old I don't drink the blood of babies like okay I didn't know Jesus like I know Jesus but I didn't know him personally yeah fucker man I promise yeah I don't know the fee I see it again I saw a fucking thread where they were telling me they were saying the reason I'm I be able to predict everything is because I fucking know what's gonna happen oh man because I'm in on it bro some of y'all are mentally fucked up that's why I mean even more than me yeah like real time anyway we have this thing called the fee and uh it means share the okay we get throttled we get shadow man we get uh mess with pretty hard in our traffic and if you guys don't share the show it doesn't get out so uh when we say pay the fee that's what that means if it gives you value if it makes you think it makes your laugh it gives you perspective help open your eyes you think this message needs to be heard this is a good skill that you learn from it please share the show uh people don't hear it if you don't so uh don't be a hoe shut the show all right so there's there's a whole fucking thread on this oh my god it's funny cuz like it's always funny like you know it's interesting like reading shit about other people right that you know but then to like actually know that person yeah bro like dude if you so the closest thing I can explain to that in my life yeah is watching the the car pages so like I was driving uh I was driving my F 40 and fucking somebody got a picture of me driving the F 40 and all the comments underneath were like oh it's a kick car it's a fake car it's like and I'm just like and then like I read the car pages like like if I follow like let's say Bugatti or fucking Ferrari whoever right and the comments underneath the car pages by people who never own these cars talking about how things actually work with the cars right there's it's so fucking off base yes and so inaccurate and it's like bro this is what people do they just they they make shit up yeah like so I can only imagine I don't know it's wild she yeah what do they say well I mean they like bro they there's a whole post I get trapped like connect the dots there's there's some picture out there you're like this or something oh yeah yeah is it like that see he's pointing up to the to the to the to the hat this is my tribute this is my tribute till the all knowing free Mason this is my fuck got the secret brother even know what the fucking free masons are giving me some of it yeah that's how I'm asking for it man you know I'm saying I'll be in on it I'm down with that your in as long as just take a little little cash I'll take a little bit man I'll take it bro I thought it was funny like reading it was one comment on the show and it was like yeah you know I you had to have sold your soul to be as successful as you are it's like yeah I did for 25 fucking years I woke up every day and got my ass beat got my balls kicked in felt like I was gonna kill myself and I kept going and guess what after 25 years I've built a pretty good life I know that's hard to comprehend for people but like that's what the American dream is about and that's why I come on here and do this because I know most people won't go out and do it but for the little guy that has that dream I want that to be preserved yeah that's why I do what I do and it's so absurd when people say ignorant stuff like that because you remember that person who did that they left like 30 comments this dude to sell out this dude's of this and that yeah the only thing I sold out was all the regular shit that you get to enjoy about your life yeah I fucking sold that to have this right a three o'clock happy hour yeah that's right yeah yeah that's real shit you couldn't fucking last one fucking day in my shoes bro I promise you that it crumbled you by fucking 11 a.m that's a fact that's a fact the Freemasons don't fucking help me at all if they do I fucking don't know where yeah I didn't get it yeah yeah I didn't see no meetings bro you know come here a little bit of fucking slack over here slide me some of that fucking gold bullion brother I do all the hand signals all right what we got yeah dude bro think of your real person at home bro and you're like you really think that like you really look at someone and you say oh my god he's holding his hand a certain way like I mean listen there maybe some troops or some of that shit out there with some people I just I can verify it's not anecdotal evidence and he's fine all right well you maybe you're just not in on it maybe yeah maybe I don't know man I mean unless you have those meetings at like three in the morning I there I don't know they're on Zoom oh yeah guys we've moved into technology now I get I put my little outfit on and we all stand in front of the camera we do our weird shit I've seen all your outfits bro yeah not all of them oh you guys don't look at that one now that one for the parties you ain't invited to you know what I had a party did you yeah what you guys hang out I didn't get invited again listen to my house I see how it is I see how it is my house know my rules whose house whose jokes house there you did you guys get invited only DJ that's why guilt where I'll tell you this though that's why guilt I'll tell you this though at least some may some chili fire you fed him that's why guilt you did something Joe you're racist bro you feel bad you have why did you make she made these honey cornbread muffins bro that sound good fire let's not talk about that fire let's not talk about that fire yeah I know we say we didn't have any sponsors but I have enjoying this amazing first form energy scream and freedom I got one too you do yeah so does Joe ice cream Joe so does me not you got one too this is a winner bro this is a winner pretty fun winner's drink this is it I mean this is the key makes sense you guys all think it's fucking free mason's bro it's fucking screaming freedom who definitely not an ad either very good fuck yeah I feel like that song has to play with it yeah I think I should just be our opening theme song for a fucking show instead of a young doll for just gonna start doing America fuck yeah all right we're gonna have to start the show or nobody's gonna listen to us anymore no dude it's funny man because it's actually transitions perfectly into our intro combo because you know you talk about the American dream right what's so funny that it's all good bro you're you're professional we're just laughing at your skill set you like it you can just take it from here right there nice little easy transition bro you know I'm saying you come a long way dude I fuck I've been doing it for three years I'm fucking better learn almost four years four years yeah almost four years now yeah fuck I gotta have something to show for yeah all right yeah king of transitions I like it you know how you learned to transition transition by deflecting DJ what do you do I wouldn't do now in fact look at this right exactly speaking to black people it's your conversation no man but real shit so so you know it's been a common theme you know these these people at the White House these uh you know they get posed on these questions about an idiots dude they get out but like it's just how they blatantly lie yeah well directly to the camera believe him in direct contradiction of what at this point most Americans are filling right I think somebody's in the free mason's just saying dude it ain't fucking it ain't me from St. Louis Missouri bro now no man it's not just one of the exposed you got a couple of videos here but uh you know this is this hell I read this is from the post millennial hell I read Biden economic advisor insist real wages have grown says economy is on the right track oh let's let's see what he has to say but you mentioned the Sprow so I want to know because we keep getting these questions about what started to fill we started to refill the Sprow one of the things that the president did was uh ensure that when we when we got to buy barrels of oil to refill the Sprow they'll cost a lot less than what we sold them for so we've started to refill with got it with oil prices around 75 a barrel remember we sold that that oil for about 95 a barrel so there's a little arbitrage there from the economic and the chief so look I think if the question needs to be not are those polls right or wrong people are telling us how they feel we have to look at two nuanced points one are we moving in a direction that will reach the American worker the American consumer are real wages rising yes is the John market tight as it's ever been yes is inflation down two thirds from its peak absolutely our prices coming down for gas for airline tickets for car rentals for eggs uh for groceries at the lowest inflation in two years all of that is a yes so we are moving in the right direction we've gotten more work to do for to reach average Americans who by the way are telling us through their consumer behavior uh that they're feeling pretty good about their own financial conditions well they don't when you ask them about the American is this the fuck selling it at bro I love it it's worry play like we always call that it's worry play they're saying no if you listen to what he's saying you know it's you know the best best best drop in the inflation in two motherfuckin y'all've been in for almost four it's still not below what the fuck y'all y'all listen most people it's worry play yeah but most people dude look man most people can't pay attention for more than two months like they forget what's happened like they forget where we were in December of 2019 yeah right yeah they forget that and they forget that like like when they I mean look dude I think the more they say this the less credible they are yeah because the average American is not feeling better about their economic situation no the average worker is being pressed really hard credit card defaults are at an all-time high mortgage defaults are near an all-time high personal debt is insane personal savings are non-existent these are statistical realities that most people even people who voted for Joe Biden are seeing now now hold on I got to say that with an asterisk most people who were providing for themselves through a career who voted for Joe Biden they understand that what's being said here is a lie okay but remember there's a whole another segment the voted for Joe Biden that doesn't have shit right they don't have jobs they don't have fucking income they don't have responsibilities those people don't have any reference point so they hear this shit and they're like oh yeah Joe Biden doing great dynamics right but the reality is is I mean all you got to do is go around ask people and look around look at their own personal as your personal financial system or situation better or worse than it was in December of 2019 for most Americans it's much worse all right this is reality and I suspect that we are going to see some artificial fuckery remember midterms when Joe Biden you remember what he did read for midterms with a strategic oil which is what this man is talking about yeah so for those of you that don't remember right before midterms happen they started supplementing our actual supply domestically for our vehicles with the strategic oil reserves that were were our reserves from for military you know defense and you know emergencies and I I suspect that over the next 12 months because people are feeling so much pain they're going to collude and try to like manipulate the economy to provide some sort of relief short term to pay short term relief right to get people off of the economy train and you shouldn't buy it because what'll happen is is that this guy remains in power the next four years you will be financially ruined you won't think of what you are right now and maybe it has gotten a little better gas prices have come down a little bit etc etc I don't go to the grocery store so I don't know what the fucking prices are like you guys go the price come down no okay I don't know I haven't been in the grocery store in 10 years no so when we like look at what's actually going on and we see how hard it is now for people what's going to happen in the next four years if they man came control is total financial destruction and what I can see from me being a operator of multiple businesses for those of you that don't know I own a number of companies I started an entrepreneurship when I was 19 years old um by anybody's standard I'm very successful I can tell you that the cost of goods to make products is at an all-time high okay so like it doesn't it doesn't matter what industry I'm in I'm in a bunch of different lanes the cost of goods and all those lanes is at an all-time high and when we break down what that does to pricing and when we think about like how much money they printed and we think about like you know like for example a house in 1970 the average house fucking what was the average house price in 1970 that imagine it'd be like 80 grand hold on between 23 and 55 between 23 grand and 55 grand okay what's the average house price in 2023 and Missouri is 239 239 and Missouri okay Missouri is probably one of the lowest states because we're I've cost of living is pretty decent it's great here don't come here yeah okay you bring your stupid shit here we'll fuck you one California for a sticker it's a fucking problem in the United States is 412 okay and then you know you asked it's 412 so we went from 55 to 412 what's the average salary in 1970 9000 9000 to what 59 59000 so the disparity in cost of goods has disproportionately risen and has not come back and so what's happened here in my opinion and I'm not a financial expert okay but I have friends who are I talked to them they've printed trillions and trillions of dollars that remain into the economy okay and those prices that you think are just artificially high right now they're not coming back down like they're not and we and we see the government continuing like these talking heads they like they like to say oh the companies are price gouging that's not fucking true that's them deflecting responsibility from them onto the companies which goes along with their communist agenda the Marxist agenda which is to to create disruption and angst and frustration and bitterness and hate from the worker class to the owner class and so we have a lot of lies happening right now that aren't necessarily true and and the biggest one is is that you guys think prices are gonna come down they're not coming down they're not coming out wages are gonna have to go up but they're not gonna go up in proportion to what the prices have gone up which creates a situation where people feel poorer on the same amount of money and creates a whole new class of correct bro in 30 years bro the average cost of the house is going to be four million down here's what they're trying to do okay what they're trying to do is they're trying to force enough people into poverty so that they are dependent on the government and they're trying to force companies because the costs of goods are up which means you can't pay your employees as much and if your employees don't have a living wage what happens is is you have a non productive company because people don't give a fuck okay so what they're trying to do is to get the companies to adopt AI and other technologies to automate as fast as possible push out the lowest earning employees into the fucking dependency class that's dependent on the government and basically make it so if a company is to survive they're gonna be able to pay less employees more money but they won't be able to have as many employees because they can't do it the old school way does this make sense so they're forcing implementation of technology for survival at companies and then making the low the low pay lower lower skill employees that have the potential to become higher skilled into a dependency class that keeps them in power you know 100% I think I think that too like when I look at you know the lies like you know there's a video that just came out about KGB fucking responding to what's a buddy's name who always calls her out my wife house Peter yeah you know I think of it like this man like I think of the average American citizen right now who will watch one of these videos and listen to their response and they're telling you that everything is fine and everything's better and you're sitting there and you're looking at your fucking budget and you so it's so like it's almost like the guru effect right like they think it's them now I think I'm just personally fucked up in finances and I'm new shitty bro yeah imagine like it's fucked like dude the fucking the the the blue guys that meant how I play on no it's gaslighting it's total lying gaslighting to people it's these people who are struggling right now are being like exactly what you said they're like looking at the sky and they're like fuck bros everybody else doing better is just me is it just me there yeah but this is the same thing they did with the mass they wanted it they wanted to create a situation where everybody fucking went along with it and the and then you know you had to and the people who who second guessed it were like we're fuck everybody else is going on I'm gonna go along with it too right right so like and the hopes is that they say it enough yeah it's the truth well that's how it works people believe that yeah but I'm gonna tell you right now like from somebody who's operating many different companies in different areas and then who also like I coach entrepreneurs to the number of thousands of them I talk to those people they're all indifferent the cost of goods are high bro unless you're selling information which is fucking high profit I mean bro it's it's a situation where companies are gonna be forced to adapt become more automated used AI technology reduce the amount of employees the amount of employees the employees that they keep will earn more money but the employees that you know let's say like for us like our entire company is built on uh you know people who come here they might come in and they start at a low level but they work up and they become people who build legitimate careers that's going to be impossible yeah that's going to be impossible that's the American dream and the American dream is disappearing because of what they're trying to force the Melbourne club to yeah it's executive yeah it's fading it's fading it's not possible right now it's not possible unless you have a company that is 100% dedicated to that path like we are and then the customers get smart enough to actually direct their money into companies that employ real people in real life yeah consumer behavior is going to have to like get much more intelligent like the idea of shopping at these big global corpse while it may be more convenient if you really care about your kids and your kids future in the future of this country you're gonna have to selectively be inconvenience to buy directly from the companies like this is a real thing because otherwise you what's going to happen is by you not doing that the company that you work for will do the same thing I'm describing that that they're trying to create they'll eliminate the lower the lower side jobs you understand yeah so like dude this is a team effort here and everybody has to fucking be smart with how they behave financially absolutely man well guys let's get into some of our other headlines man uh remember guys if you want to see any of these articles links videos pictures go to antificella.com you can find them there or if you're watching on youtube check in the description below you can find them linked there as well so yeah I would like to know like like in the comments like you guys feel do you guys think they're telling the truth like real shit like nobody like like brutally honest yeah do you and your friends feel like the economy is better or as good like dude you listen I already know the answer and anybody who's like it's like we bro it's absurd that they can go on TV and save a shit you know like oh yeah the the most job creation yeah will you killed all the jobs well that was Trump you eliminate no that yourself a 60% head start listen bro that was Trump okay all right technically who fucking close the country now Trump okay but why did he close the country now because the media and every other politician and every person that's in put so much hype and pressure into this movement which was a global conspiracy okay to transfer wealth from the middle class to the upper class to create this dependency class there's not a single bro if he had said we're keeping it open the story would have been he killed millions of people he didn't like you guys forget that like people forget how this went down like it went it went down because of incredible the biggest propaganda movement that ever existed in humankind they were showing videos of people in China falling down in the streets like we all saw them like Romani bags bro can cadaver dude remember how okay containers and bro they it's told there he had no choice but to do that now how do he how do you stood up and said no we're not closing the country he would have had no chance at winning that election they knew that they had him pigeonhole yeah they knew that like if he stood up and said no we're not doing that yeah that he would for sure lose the election he also knew they also knew that if he did it what would happen and now they could blame it on on him now this one yeah but like to say old job creations at an all-time high when you guys killed all these fucking companies and all these jobs and removed all these people for not taking the vaccine and then pretend like you're growing the economy that dude only a stupid low IQ mother fucker would understand that and believe that to be true like you know it's the same thing with all this shit you know yeah gas prices are down there's still like two dollars higher than they were in fucking 2019 right uh yeah uh interest rates are back are coming down a little bit well yeah but interest rates back then were two fucking percent exactly right right you're trying to take credit for yeah it's fucking bullshit for polish and you the truth of the matter is while cleaned up a little bit of the shit yeah you do the fucking you put the pile there bro it's your shit bro yes and they're like oh look we clean up half the shit yeah I can't clean up all of it it's yours no the other guy did that no yeah like the other ones I like I'm gonna take him like a little fucking puppy and put the nose in the fucking shit you know I'm saying fucked up man bro I'll be real I hate these people I'm gonna point now where I fucking hate them I fucking hate them you want to talk about hate speech I'm saying it right now I fucking hate them the government fucks and media fucks that have done this shit to us they deserve no mercy from us at all like the fact that they go up there and lie when people are having it you know they're saying they're saying shit like this job creation at an all-time high okay well they're also not talking about the single mom or the or the dad who has to go take a fucking second job just to make their fucking ends me that's a whole another yes they're not talking about any of this shit dude a bunch of liars for people working more hours to have to for these people are gonna burn and hell bro they're all fucking liars and you know what they don't feel any of the pain because for the last two years they've sent all your tax dollars do you crane and they've gotten kicked these people are richer than ever they are richer than they've ever been they have no concept of what it's like for any of you guys or us out here in the real world at all okay I mean it's just total fucking gaslighting and out of touch marketing nonsense it's it's disturbing that anybody would believe it yeah but the fact of the matter is bro some people are so fucking plugged into their identity with Democrat or Republican that they they'll go along with their own demise we see in history over and over and over again bro people the right shit into the dirt even if it means the own destruction of their own personal life to be right yeah quote unquote remember remember all that shit people were saying back in 2020 well you want to be on the right side of history who's on the right side of history now motherfucker yeah how's that feel yeah what the fuck do you think how's that man count yeah no shit that only that bro look at all the lies that have been exposed and that people those same a lot of those same people have converted over and realized fuck I got lied to I have respect for those people because at least they have the enough like where with all to admit that they got played and that's okay with me I understand that they everybody should have a reasonable expectation that the government and the media and and the CDC and these agencies are telling you the truth we should all believe that we should believe that these people would tell us the truth and have our well-being in mind but they don't and it's very apparent that they don't and a lot of these people out here doing this shit are continuing to press these same messages and more and more people are waking up but dude like there there's a lot of people who see all the evidence and they're just like yeah no we're still right yeah you know what I'm saying like bro and you're not how many how many vaccine deaths are happening that no one's talking about you know what I mean anyway you know we gotta start the show yeah let's get into it man guys and your first headline headline number one headline number one reads Irish politician boast hate speech bill will restrict freedom to protect trans people from discomfort now look at what we got here okay so so there's this video that's been circulating around okay of a Irish green party senator Paulino Riley this lady here it's been circulating it's been gaining a lot of traction we should note that it's actually about six months old okay but it's recirculating right now it's gaining a lot more traction again because of what's going on over in Ireland so I got the video we'll watch it but just a little backstory on it so Irish Green Party Senator Paulino Riley defended a controversial bill that could jail citizens from really possessing material that criticizes gender identity the Irish crime justice bill purportedly targets quote unquote hate speech but some critics have compared it to the concept of punishing people for thought crime a term popularized by George Orwell's dystopia novel 1984 here's a video and just listen to what she has to say when you think about it all law all legislation is about the restriction of freedom that's exactly what we're doing here is we are restricting freedom but we're doing it for the common good you will see throughout our constitution yes you have rights what they are restricted for the common good everything needs to be balanced and if your views on other people's identities go to make their lives unsafe insecure and cause them such deep discomfort that they cannot live in peace then I believe that it is our job as legislatures to restrict those freedoms for the common good I just want to know who the common good is if they're not that common like how well is that the common good I don't know how about this perspective what about all the women who are uncomfortable insecure and unable to live a comfortable existence because they got a dude in the fucking bathroom with them how about that what about their common how about all the people that are that are made to feel a certain way because they have to pretend that that dude wearing a wig and a dress is a woman and it falls under this yeah and if they don't they go to fucking jail it's insane okay this is a small minority of the population cross dressing has been around for fucking ever in human history and if you guys want to cross dress I don't give a fuck yeah you want to live as a woman I don't care and by the way it should be noted that in the trans community most of the trans individuals are men being women not women being men yeah by like it's it's like 90 something percent unless it's like almost 80 it's crazy if you look that up yeah um it's a high percent much disproportionately high higher percentage of men being women the women being men and these men like I saw a video this weekend of a fucking actual man you being dressed up as a woman complaining that he had to get I did to go in the women's bathroom at a bar and then saying that it's unconstitutional and it's wrong no bro it's wrong for you to go into a women's bathroom that makes women uncomfortable that makes it's wrong for a man to compete in women's sports it's wrong for a man to win a women's beauty pageant we are erasing women and the feminists who created this shit aren't saying a motherfucking thing okay so women are women who are when are we gonna embrace true feminism and actually protect women's identity from being erased from literally everything by men yes the patriarchy is winning like I don't know if you noticed like if you're a feminist and you want to talk about the patriarchy and you don't say shit about men and women's spaces or men and women's sports you're a fucking liar you don't give a shit about women's fucking rights the patriarchy is kicking your ass being the fuck physically yes and and dude like I'm sick of pretending like these people's feelings are more important than actual reality the reality is that you are biologically a fucking dude if we took your genetics and we analyze them it would say man dude a hundred years from now if we dig up those bodies it's gonna say man it's gonna say man it's not gonna say uh she heard right it's not gonna say please do me the respect of of of of a she no it's it's he we can all see it yeah there's a famous meme going around that shows the outside of a fucking pizza hut bro and it's like the pizza hut is like the pizza hut is like decrepit and there's no sign it's been closed for a long time but no matter what and the meme says something like no matter what they make this building to be everybody who drives by is it is going to know it's a pizza hut or they used to be a pizza hut right right and then at the bottom it says this is what the trans community fails to understand no they understand it they just want to impose their fucking way on the rest of us yeah and by the way just so you know I don't give a fuck if you're trans when I give a fuck is everybody demanding that we bend reality to accommodate you when most of reality does not believe any of the shit that you're saying in the way that you were trying to force us to say it we're perfectly okay existing with trans people if you're a dude and you dress up as a woman and I see in the bathroom taking a piss I don't give a shit I'm probably I'm probably gonna think it's a little weird but that's what it is I'm not gonna I'm not gonna sit here and we're not gonna beat you up like it we're not gonna harass you and like it's fucking take a dick out like every other dude put piss in a fucking urinal you know I'm saying like I'm so sick of this shit and like these women these women having to like protect their girls and it be from grown men dressed up in the sh that's fucking absurd since the fact that we are even here in society at this point in time arguing over this is fucking absurd bro we're arguing over the fundamental basic reality that everybody understands from the time that they are consciously able to remember their life man woman boy girl and they have deluded truth and fact so much that we are actually arguing over this right now in reality in real time it's it's total insanity yeah but here's the good thing though so it's possible it's possible that the you know humanity's revolution is gonna get started in an Ireland bro highly possible highly possible so they're trying to imagine going to jail for saying a man's a woman that's a fucking dude in the pool check with a duke that's that's a dude like imagine you see uh leotamas or whatever to do's name is yeah in a fucking pool listen bro I'm not playing with this I'm not playing yeah I'm fucking that's real shit be you be leotamas all day long bro totally cool with it but here's what I'm not doing I'm not gonna pretend you're an actual woman not gonna do it okay so but they're making laws now where if you don't pretend that that's an actual man they threaten you with fucking jail if you don't think this time to stand up to this nonsense is now you're you're you're fucking dumb as fuck yeah yeah man yeah I'm I'm listen yeah so I'm so so that video's right so they're getting pissed huh it's trending right that video recirculated everything's trending well she's right what's that all laws are restrictive of freedom yeah and some laws are some ways some laws are for restriction of freedom for the common good yeah some some laws are actually to protect certain freedoms like I don't know the freedom of fucking speech the freedom of to own a firearm here in this country like so it's not just to laws don't exist just to restrict freedom sometimes they exist to guarantee freedom too like you don't go to jail for saying that's a fucking dude in a swimming pool with a bunch of girls right right now I'm yeah exactly yes right now Twitter the Irish is trending right now and of course you know we covered last week the Conor McGregor thing his tweet talking about the stabbing that happened in Ireland and Dublin where there's more stuff that's coming out Conor McGregor is now going hard and it appears he may be leading a revolution in fucking Ireland so the president is a perfect guy to do it always perfect absolutely perfect like bro that's some brave heart shit I can see him right now in brave heart here 100% but yes also the the president Leo Varrett Carr I tweeted this out so this is a day of enormous joy and relief for Emily hand and her family and innocent child who was lost has now been found in return and we breathe a massive sigh of relief our prayers have been answered now they got a uh uh context uh linked to it on Twitter I'm saying Emily wasn't lost she was abducted by terrorists from Hamas that's what he was referring to Conor McGregor jumped in on the conversation um and tweeted this out in response saying uh quote she was abducted by an evil terrorist organization what is with you in your government and you're paid for media affiliates constantly downplaying or attempting to repress horrific acts that happen to children you are disgrace the day after a stabbing of children in Ireland not one paper had it on their front cover we will not forget um so you got that circulating and then this this image right now is going around says take it back lads with some guys with baseball bats I hope they do bro I mean I'm just saying like listen one like I got you know I used to work in the bars right I hope I hope we see Irish men in the streets with baseball bats cracking mother fucking skulls listen that's what I hope I start working on their list too bro I started working on bars at 17 yeah and one of the things you learn very very quickly you don't fuck with people who drink jaymusin or Guinness you learn that very very quick bro I was in fucking I was in Europe one time I went on this uh backpacking trip yeah when I was 18 and uh it was cool like I did a lot of cool shit I went to I went fucking well through Europe I I was in Paris when they won the World Cup there uh um but one of the coolest things I did was I we we stayed in hostels yeah so I've met up one me and my buddy we were over there and we met up with these dudes from Ireland and what they say is true about their drinking ability now you've been around me drinking and smoking and I have a pretty ridiculous tolerance impressive okay like there's there's a pretty good chance and you can ask the black rifle guys you can ask all the guests on the show if you come to my house you're gonna need help walking away from the house sure like I'm gonna smoke you under the fucking table these mother fuckers are different these are different people the Irish really can drink and fight bro yeah like and they drink they by the time we we were like pregame by the time pregame was done to go out I was fucking done and these mother fuckers are laughing at me like call me a bitch and you know try to keep me and then you know they come back and you know what they get what do you think they did after they went out drink some more no no after the drinking what do you think they did what they fucking beat the shit out of people okay like every we were there for like four days yes they're and they come back and they're talking about how each other beat the fuck out of the other guys like I hope that they find this again I really do I hope they start beating the fuck out of these people I hope they force their government to fucking get back in line our government will not get back in line until people force them to get back in line the people correct the people it always comes down yeah and if it starts there maybe people here will start realizing that like for us to like we have to demand it it's not gonna happen they're continuing to encroach on us over and over and take more and more and more and make our lives harder and harder and harder and we just sit here and fucking take it okay eventually we're gonna have to let them know that they're not gonna do that we just saw all these tapes on J6 come out that show that it was fucking bullshit and makes you wonder like okay so we have these videos of these people giving fist bumps with J6 and you know pushing ladies down the stairs and shooting fucking paintballs in the crowd and it matches out of the bro dressed up we have a guy on camera saying I dressed up as Antifa and the crowd to instigate the crowd like he's saying this on camera bro and these are these are people who are affiliated with our law enforcement community and now they're prosecuting so get this people thought the election was fucked up um January 6th happens they have people that are legitimately in jail for 18 years for what happened on January 6th they're also prosecuting who Donald Trump for saying that he fucking caused an insurrection that they are clearly part of what at first it wasn't an insurrection because we want to all have guns okay secondly so so do they create this thing to deflect the attention from what they just did with the election and now they're prosecuting people who were there who who have been proven to not like do anything out of normal except a fucking protest there was ten times more docile than the protests we saw in 2020 for George Floyd exactly and they're prosecuting a present like if you can't connect these dots the deflection of what they did during the election the the like bro this this bad it's real bad it's real bad and then you throw in like all the money this motherfucker's taken from other countries that was on that laptop and we're talking about that no more bro we're we got a bit much bigger problem than most people have come to realize yet but I do hope I see people in Ireland cracking mother fucking skulls dude it'd be nice that shit would be awesome put that shit on pay-per-view bro I'll fucking subscribe you guys can raise a shit ton of money bro I mean kind of regular knows all about pay-per-view man no shit on saying the pay-per-view king you said it up man yeah listen maybe I like to see it I'd like to see it guys tell us what you guys think about this topic jumping on the conversation hashtag look of the Irish let's know what you guys think all right I got something else to say but I mean I've already been talking for fucking seven hours on this one show so like but it's just like also like what I think about two is like I was thinking about this over the weekend so it's interesting that I saw a guy it was the prime minister or the president whatever they call them of the Netherlands okay saying that Islam was the problem okay like saying like like if you pay attention to the language it's being put out right now by all the leaders who are on the side of Israel what they're saying is Islam is the problem Islam is the problem Islam is the problem how many people do you know they're Islamic because I know a bunch are they fucking are they different than you I don't think so either they've all been fucking super fast as I would even say better I'm more peaceful more peaceful discipline I listen I I'm right there with you okay I'm a Christian but I know plenty of Islamic people that have millions of fucking miles of respect for so they're saying Islam is the problem Islam has no place in Europe Islam has no place in Ireland Islam has no place in America Islam it's and do they're like you've pointed out earlier the language it's not about Islam it's about these fucking millions of fucking illegal migrants that you've it that you the same people saying it's Islam have imported into these countries so why would they do that now hold on think about this I'm going why would they start saying right now after three 10 years in Europe years and years here they've imported millions tens of millions of Islamic Muslim people okay because that's what they are but these people also happen to be the criminal criminal elements in a lot of cases military age males the lowest denominators military age males at a minimum disproportionately to all these countries and now that they're all in there now you want to call them out pull on now you're going to say that problem is Islam okay so what does that that actually creates a scenario where we have so many like it's like importing the soldiers and then creating the war exactly okay so like they're looking to create a war between Islam and everything else in the world that's the world war that they want this is what's going on with Israel and Gaza Strip right now the Palestinians so the world war they want is not a country versus country it is Islam versus everything else that's what they're trying to create and if you pay attention to the language they're using now now now they're starting they're trying to stir it up you see what I'm saying so it's very important that people have clarity of mind here and understand that we're being manipulated intentionally with language to think that people who are of Islamic faith are the actual problem when the problem is the millions and millions and millions of military age men that you've imported into these countries that shouldn't be there it's a fucking invasion of people that shouldn't be there doesn't matter if they're fucking Buddhist or Islamic or fucking anything but they're trying to create this war right because like I said a million times and like a lot of you guys are starting to understand is that that's part of what they want to create for the next distraction for the election coming up you know what I mean if that's so long the rest between those two groups bro did you have you noticed what I'm talking about I've been seeing it yeah I've absolutely been starting to say Islam is the problem yeah it's not fucking Islam now it's criminals doing fucked up shit that shouldn't be in the country exactly it's people who it's what they use is that blanket generalization yeah it's that broad brush you know I'm saying all that does is create more division a more more unease some of the people bro it's intentional shit yeah guys let's keep this movie and I got a comment for you okay that's cruiser comment now this one listen I'm gonna be honest I don't really know what it means so okay we'll have fun figuring it out here we go let's go comment comes from Paul Fuller 741 he says uh I disagree with AF on the topic of 1% of the police force abusing their powers it's more like 99 percent of police officers abusing their powers 1% of the time which still makes 99% of them abusive of their power even if it's one I know what he's saying so what he's saying is what he what that person here she is saying is that there is a code amongst police officers that you could kind of do the thing when nobody's looking at nobody I'll tell which is fucking real that's that's honest okay I I but say it's 99% hold on even if you don't tell on the ones that do the fucked up shit you're part of that 99% you know the the police code yeah the police code is why no police stood up during covid anyway that's the police code so like there is a police code in blue line listen this this person's not wrong that's not wrong I'm not saying it's just a different perspective that could be also accurate yeah no I like it but the truth of the matter is if we're all cops in this room and you know they they have cracked down so hard on cop's ability to do their jobs like if we got to do what we got to do so we don't get fucking shot then that's what the fuck you do and you don't tell on each other and that's that's what we would all of us in this room oh there's six of us in here if we have some other fucker come out of the parking lot and let's say he was one of these crazy people that we've had to address or arrest and this dude comes into our parking lot and we talk to him and talk to him and talk to him he starts fighting and he pulls out a gun and I fucking take the gun from and I shoot him three times okay and then I walk away and then I'm like fuck and I go back and I shoot him right in the fucking head because I'm like okay one story is better than two stories sure all right or any of you telling on me no fucking way not a million gazillion years and that's what this person's talking about so it's it's not that you're it's not this person is wrong you're indirectly complicit yeah but like but it's also a necessity at some in some cases to like not to be safe and like to you know what I'm saying like bro there's okay I could tell you this time like there was this time when I was working in the bars and there was a big fucking fight like a big fight like it was about twice a year we had we have like like a fight with like 50 people involved in it right like a big fucking group fight yeah like do is 3000 person bar so you'd have these big fucking fights so we have this big fight and uh it spilled out into the streets okay and we got into the streets and the cops show up and they can't tell who the fuck's doing what right like we're like dude I'm talking like a fight like our shirts were ripped off and shit like we're it was a fucking fight yeah so this cop fucking sprays everybody with this fucking pepper spray and then he and then he beats a shit out of me I get my ass beat all right yeah like he's and then he ends up with his knee on my ear on the pavement like fucking in my head smat I feel like I'm gonna die and you know was he abusing his power probably but did I care not really because I realized I was in the middle of a fucking massive ordeal and he's trying to do what's right to get it sorted out so like there has to be some understanding on what these police officers do at certain times you know what I've say you're asking them to do a very hard unsafe job so like I can't say that this person's wrong but I think it's a I think it's a I think it's a valuable alternate perspective I'll say that yeah man what do you think yeah I'm gonna cop I mean I think I think it's probably gonna buy by the cop code not say the truth yeah I mean I don't know I still believe like I can understand that perspective I now understand what he's saying I still just don't think that's the truth man because I've also seen cops definitely tell on other cops that do shitty shit you know I'm saying like I mean now maybe some of the minor stuff yeah but I think it's also that's what this person's talking about yeah I mean but like we're gonna talk about major events but here's a thing too though I mean what is abuse you know what I'm saying well here's the other side of that coin how many times do a cop catch how I would argue that a cop catches people more times and lets them go breaking the law than they do abuse it the other way yeah more than percent bro I've broken a law four million times and fucking like they've let me go yeah like speeding and well well that's because I'm white yeah you say so it's white privilege yeah hey you know what no but that's real shit no that that's real that's true I'm just saying I I've been let go speeding a bunch of times where I you know I'm saying and you want to if you want to say that's white privilege that's fine too I'll give a fuck I'm just telling the truth yeah you know no it's real man yeah yeah I see it agreed to disagree that might that I mean look I'm just saying like there's a lot of perspectives to look at this from not for sure I don't I just I don't know I just think it's dangerous to generalize either way or I think it's like 99% I think big percentage I think cops should be paid more money it should be a valuable career like a very valuable career I think that should make like 250 grand a year and I think they should be able to enforce the law the way that needs to be enforced and if they go above it if they go above that they lose a career they value yeah okay so this is how we protect ourselves from the situation that this person thinks there is and that we all fucking inherently know there is okay let's be real let them make bacon man make fucking big money recruit high quality individuals then if they go above and beyond and they do some fucked up shit they're at risk losing something they wouldn't otherwise have yeah that's how you protect from you know I'm saying yeah instead of this like defund and no and then the other thing with their hands they're doing this shit now where they're making these guys personally liable for any kind of extra you know something happen like bro that's insane for 40 fucking grand 60 grand a year for some of these guys I mean New York maybe it's a hundred but my point is like you're you're gonna hold them per like what what incentive do they have to enforce the law then exactly or that's the point yeah I know that's the point yeah we appreciate you guys man thank you guys for being a real last fan how many times when you were a cop did you let people go who you could have fucking who you could have written a ticket or arrested versus how many times you actually wrote the ticket arrested I mean it's 90 to one you could have let you let them go 100 yes I think most police discretion like that's every single day the most police do that so if we're gonna make the argument of this what this person saying the count and not taking the other side into account that's that's not a accurate way of observing I'm saying yeah 100% okay yeah we appreciate you guys for being a realist fan I appreciate the extra I appreciate the thoughtful comments great great dialogue yeah great dialogue and you know if you guys don't want to miss any of our information make sure you guys are like I'm commenting and subscribing I don't necessarily agree with what he what he's saying but I could see how you could I see it that's I see it I see it yeah let's keep this cruise move man we got headline number two this is an interesting one headline number two reads Strieker arrested after parading around Disney's lands it's a small world ride naked now this was good shocking this one well I mean shock there's a naked person at Disneyland around a bunch of little kids oh he got hammered bro they they they they they arrested him I mean all the right they they really drew it in on

up. This was at 130 in the afternoon. All right, you got so we got locked up got carried out But here's the thing I Feel like I know where he fucked up it No, we fucked up it all right and that'll make sense here shortly Because here's the thing is this is this story comes out. There's another story about Disney Disneyland that comes out at the same time And this is a line reads Disney employee blows 24,000 dollars on drugs with corporate card is somehow not fired So you got this guy how do you how do you spend? How do you buy drugs on a credit card Vemmo bro? Okay, you connect do you know, I don't know this shit. Yeah, Vemmo.

Yeah, is that how what key key Look man 24 gram bro, and he doesn't get five drugs were still cash only man Hey, there's other ways you pay Grass cash, you're ass Yeah, man, so so this Disney employee so a Disney Lansing place Employee who spent 24,000 dollars on his corporate credit card to buy illegal drugs at the mouse house gave him a second chance after he came clean about his addiction Terran Sargotsie and who left the who has since left the company penned an essay for business insider detailing his personal struggles when he started an internship with Disney in the summer 2014 And so I was like okay, well, so this guy's the victim now. How do you fucked up so the so the guy that's streaked all he had to do Andy Was put pronouncing his bio Well, that's a fact and Disney would have like you would have been hired Yeah, that's probably if he was like hold up guys some trends, you know, it would have been yeah, but I'm fine You know I'm sending because like that's the it's the same reason the white people get away with speeding. That's what I'm saying Look here pal, you don't let me go DJ he's told it tells the cop you gotta let me off 50% of the time Only right half the ticket, all right, you know, I'm saying cut that speed down a half Yeah, man, I just I thought this was interesting man like you know, they got one guy that's no like That's not really off base for Disney. I mean they go that everything else right let the guy streak if he wants to bro There's more video than that heat. There's a video of him but naked. Oh, yeah, I just didn't know if we could play that because yeah I mean this guy got butt naked about around a bunch of kids. No, swing his dick around the shit Bro, listen now question what What bro?

I wrestle bro I don't give a fuck so dick just yes, I don't care Don't bother me. I put in my mouth or my ass Like I'm beating his ass. It's gonna be worth it. What are you doing? It's cuz you do you do you do you don't give a fuck like shit. That's yeah, bro. It's look I'm having I'm beating your ass. I'm probably gonna smash your head in with a rock Like it's gonna be the end of you. Yeah, anybody pulls that pervert shit around me bro. It's over. I'm fucking ending them Yeah, it's really and that's how all grown men should be every grown man listening to this show We should stop tolerating this shit like this this these dudes haven't have their dicks around little kids It's time to fucking do what's necessary to stop it That's just my career man Well, that's because it doesn't seem to be working if we're just saying stop it. Yeah No Yeah, guys, so is what you think on this on this topic. I'm not that is not me calling you to some sort of I'm just saying the happens around you and your vicinity You do what you gotta do. That's my opinion Bro, think of your daughters and hold on listen to this. Let's just be real about this You and me and Adam and Sarah's kids and my brother's kids, okay, and it's fucking what is that? nine little kids around, right? And some dude fucking starts taking his dick out and like where it sticks flags and a dude fucking takes his dick out Right in front of bro. It's the end of his life going down. Yes. It's the end of your life, dude It's the end. I'll go to jail for that for as long as you fucking takes. I don't care. What's the info? You shouldn't go to jail for that like dude we're allowing Our tolerance level has gotten so warped that we're allowing little kids lives And their childhood to be legitimately stolen from them for the once and wills of a very very very small And in my opinion mentally ill minority And that so that's the whole month. That's not them. Yeah, that's not them. That's us tolerating exactly That's the thing because like this dude, you know, they arrest that thing and further down in the article It says somewhere like oh, he has you know mental health issues. Yes That is a mental health problem So how when he went went when another when another grown man decides to strip and dance in front of kids at a fucking gay bar How is that not mental illness? Well because he's not completely pulling his dick out. It's insane Like bro, listen we legitimately. This is legitimate legit. We have given mentally ill people All pass the yes the power to dictate reality in our society and culture It's insane. It's our fault. It is our fault It's my fault. It's all of your guys's fault listening and dude. This is not some anti gay Anti- any this is anti fucking pervert shit that has to stop It has to stop there should be no tolerance for it Yeah, that's something you guys think on this topic jumping down in the conversation down in the comments I don't give a fuck mental illness is not an excuse no mental illness and mental health has become a fucking excuse For everything in society If you you know, you take your pants off and bunch in front of a bunch of kid. Oh, he's got mental health issues You you spend 24,000 dollars on the company credit card on drugs. Oh, he's got mental health issues You know the fucking dude that does a show up to football practice at fucking all miss for two weeks when the coach says show the fuck up Mental health issues like bro. Fuck your mental health issues, bro That's this using this victim culture and this attachment of mental health issues as a pass for all bad behavior Needs to fucking end in society. It's costing us way too much and it's absurd and it works in every scenario Like people can do whatever they want and they can say Oh, man, I'm having real bad mental health issues right now mental health. Yeah, and like bro mental health is a real thing There's a like it's a thing that you should fucking work on that it's called like taking care of yourself and doing good shit and put good Good-should-doctor thing. Yes, like exactly have meaning correct And then mental health is a real thing that but like it's not an excuse for behavior that causes harm or Disruption society. No Or a workplace or fucking anything like I'm sorry those We should legitimately open up again mental health institutions It should be a real thing And uh, you know people like well, that's inhumane. No, it's inhumane to let these people ruin everybody else's life experience That's fucking inhumane that isn't human Yeah Now guys jump down to the conversation. Let us know what you guys think down in the comments hashtag magic magic kingdom Let us know what you guys think That being said, man, let's get to our third and final headline now. This is this is an interesting development man because some things come out I know we've all been seeing this stuff in the headlines all the way around social media everywhere We've all been seeing the stories of all of these famous celebrities coming down with these rape cases and lawsuits and all these things right Well, there's an interesting development. We now know why right And the reason why is because of this uh or who it comes out it says headline reads New York's me to law and snaring Hollywood celebrities was originally created to hurt Donald Trump So so this was a law that was just passed in New York by governor Right That she when she what she did what she passed this law to remove the statute of limitations and she did that Let's just read the article so New York's me to law 30 years me to law is Also known as the adult survivors act has instead a number of Hollywood celebrities and prominent Democrats who are facing accusations of sexual misconduct assault and rape Uh and rape dating as far back is the 1980s. Why is that Because the law which governor Kathy how Sign last year lifts the statute of limitations on such complaints with no time limit on when the alleged actions took place the Ironic kicker is that Holtz's law was intended to hurt former president Donald Trump as he aims for re-election in 2024 Uh, e-john carol filed her lawsuit against Trump uh on November 24th 2022 the first day the law took effect Carol sued Trump for battery and defamation with a federal judge scheduling the trial for January Just days before the Republican primary votes begin in the presidential nomination project Should be pointed out before you continue reading that for them to file a lawsuit on the exact day the law to the fact There had to be coordination between that person and the people passing the law because it takes time to draft a lawsuit 100% just so respect you don't you don't just oh, I'm suing Andy today here. It takes a while month. Yes month Um in the truth social post Trump vehemently denied the accusations quote It's a hoax and a lie just like all the other hoaxes that have been played on me for the past seven years And while I'm not supposed to say it I will this woman is not my type The post said uh now the suit is one of several that Trump's political opponents have thrown in this path and their bit to harm his effort to Inback the White House under the adult survivor act plaintiffs have had a one-year time period that stated in November 24th 2022 in which to file their complaints the past few weeks We have seen a flurry of suits against prominent celebrities including Jamie Foxx Sean Diddy-Kombs Cuba getting junior Bill Cosby. Well Bill Cosby. Yeah, Bill Cosby It is what it is And punk rocker Justin Sainte and musical musician Axel Rose Actress Julia or Monde sued both Disney and CAA under the law claiming she was sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein in New York in 1995 when Disney owned Miramax Um, but here's the thing so in just one year Andy there's been more than 2500 lawsuits that were filed during this window and probably more coming soon both lawmakers who sponsored the adult survivors act have reportedly stated that they support Extending the window by another year Senator Brad Holyman sigle and a similar woman Linda Rosenthal both Manhattan Democrats say they'll also explore permanent change to New York Statue of limitations for sexual assault And where we got on this? I mean dude, I think it's case by case. I think some of these people probably did some fucked up shit in the past And I think some of these people probably didn't do shit And the only reason that they're being accused is because they're famous and wealthy. Mm-hmm And so I think there's probably a little of both um And I think if you do fucked up shit like if you like do rape for real like if you really rape someone like you're a fucking piece of shit like but there's so much great area and You know acceptance as to what is rape or what constitutes rape at this point in time Where you know these women could have went out 30 years ago and gotten shit-faced and had sex with whoever right and then say 30 years later Oh, well, this was a thing, but this guy's worth a hundred million dollars now. Exactly. You know what I'm saying? So like there's a lot of great area and nuance in this situation and um my thing is I feel like the problem that I have is that is typically you see it as a civil issue right like Okay, well if that really happened why were the criminal charge of that? You know, I'm saying like shouldn't that be a criminal thing to you know, I'm saying like why is it? Why do you just want like the money's gonna make it better? You know, I just thought this was interesting because you're seeing this like you know these yeah, but the amount of frivolous like Dude people don't understand this like because most people aren't at a level to where that would happen to them but the amount of Like straight up frivolous lawsuits that are filed against wealthy people is insane It's insane. Yeah, okay, like there are so many people out there that look at someone who's They have some sort of connection to as their ticket They find reasons to like go after them. You know what I'm saying? So like dude if you're let's just say you're Cuba-good in junior right like I don't know Cuba-good in junior. He might be a total dirt bag I don't I'm just using that as examples. I like his movies too, but like he could be a dirt bag. I don't know possible so You know, it is what it is, but what I'm gonna use him as an example like let's say Cuba-good in junior When he was in high school and when he was in college Had a lot of girlfriends, okay or boyfriends or maybe he liked both who knows But then he becomes Cuba-good in junior a pretty successful actor for a pretty long fucking time Okay, and any of these people see this law and they maybe they're down on their times maybe Maybe they have no options. Maybe they're just a greedy Jealous person. Maybe they're one of these people who you have to cut along the way who you you know Because dude what happens is is everybody starts looking at you as a and you know this because you've been around me Everybody starts looking at you as to answer to your financial problems and when you don't accommodate that They they will fucking make you the enemy of their story And this is a real thing that happens to literally every wealthy successful person And so to you're basically giving unlimited leverage to anybody this person's ever had a person relationship with Over the course of their life Like at some point We have we have to like draw the lines it's some you know what I'm saying or We make it so if it's proven to be untrue Like let's say this woman sues or a dude sues Cuba-good in junior for 10 million dollars and damages All right, cool But if the evidence shows and the court finds them not guilty you owe him 10 million Yeah, like if you so here. Yeah, that is fair. It's about to fair. Okay, so don't bring it if you ain't got it Yeah, cuz guess what his reputation is ruined, but at least he's got 10 million dollars Well, I mean if you won the case his reputation would be yeah, I beat that case You know, there's no pro there's no prize right now for being innocent. Yeah, like at all You know, even when you're when you know like People see you as that forever. Yeah, especially as a man. That's what I'm saying Yeah, yeah, the damage is done. I don't know. I just thought this was interesting because like I said I mean this is you know, this is the only reason we've been seeing all of these cases was originally to get Trump out Yeah, and now it's all their people that are going down. Yeah, you know, I mean bro And there's definitely cases there's definitely cases of people who are Uber wealthy who treat people like dog shit too So like all I'm saying is there has to be Some it can't be the way it is because it's too open uh People like the wealthier century. It's a super easy. Bro You could fucking fuck with anybody. Yeah, and there's no repercussions if you're lying. Yeah Zero. Yeah, zero Yeah, that's a big problem with our legal system. Yeah, our legal system needs reform in a way to where There is legitimate punishment if you are bringing frivolous suits or lying Yeah, you know, I'll say this to the on that point the counter to that though the only the only positive that I have seen I think was would be that Jesse Smolay Incident you know, I'm saying he went to jail. He went to jail for that You know, I'm saying and it's like I mean you see it Yeah, but radically, but that's not the that that is not the common how many times that happened in false rape case That's what I'm saying. You know, you know, it's not it's not does it happen What I mean has it ever happened? I don't even know that's what I'm saying like It's just you know like the so for a dude to be totally uh immune To accusations he would have to be a virgin. He's he's not immune because he can get sued by a dude So like the thing is is like for for a successful man To not be held liable for his past. He has to have literally zero past At all right, and that's not that's how fair in the law Now it's real shit man guys tell us what you guys think on this man. What'd you guys think about this topic? Let us know down in the comments Hashtag and be your own people Let's know what you guys think. I mean bro, do you agree that like the Like what should happen to these people that make these false cases? They should get whatever the person would get if they were proven guilty I feel that way too and 100% yeah Because that's the only way you're gonna stop all the frivolous stuff Yeah, you know, I'm saying people knew that that was gonna if people knew That if they brought up a bullshit case Let's say rape whatever you want to whatever that punishment that's gonna be 30 years of life or the death sentence and whatever it is If people knew that they brought up a bullshit case that they would be getting that same punishment If it comes out that that was bullshit, nobody would be doing me ask you this So what's the big initiative? What do you think the biggest revenue driver is for legal system? What frivolous cases? No, no, no What specific Breaking of the law do you think it is what laws broken the most that provides the most income? I would probably reach a contract maybe no, no, no, no, what do people do after they drink? They drive yeah, okay? So I would bet that DWI and DUI is probably one of the highest revenue generators for the legal system And if they made the law so that if you got caught drunk driving or driving under the influence It was automatic year in prison no matter what If you blow a fucking over to any alcohol And it's a year in prison mandatory how many people are doing it? Okay, so they can fix the problem really easy, but they don't And the reason they don't is because of the money generated to the people who actually make the laws Okay, yeah, so When we look at the legal system we say well, why aren't they why is it not this way? The answer is is because those lawyers make less money and the lawyers are the people that make the laws in Washington DC So they're looking out for their own So when you say it be your own people you're actually correct in a bunch of different ways See what I'm saying be your own people. Yeah, that's crazy Yeah, they are not interested in fixing the legal system They want everybody to be violated and oppressed and hurt by the legal system because ultimately it makes people easier to control This fact it's a fucking it's a financial fucking milking For the most part Well guys, it is time for our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck This is where we bring a headline in and talk about it to get one of those two options and so That with that being said we got we got to pay some some some pay some tribute in some honor man.
