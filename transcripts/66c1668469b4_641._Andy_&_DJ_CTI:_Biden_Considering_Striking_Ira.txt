What is up guys it's Andy Priscilla and this is the show for the realest thing about Andy at Andy for Sola.com. The second way is you can go down there in a comment section on YouTube and ask your questions in the comment section. We'll pick some from there as well. Other times we have real talk, real talk is just five to 20 minutes of me giving you guys some real talk. Then we have 75 hard versus 75 hard versus where someone comes in who has completed the 75 hard program. Talk about how their life was before, how their life is now and how you can make a transformation by getting your shit together using the live hard program and the 75 hard program. If you're unfamiliar with live hard and 75 hard, you can get that program for free at episode 208 on the audio feed. It's not on video. We just started YouTube about a year ago. So now there were some videos that were up before that, but we just started posting the show on YouTube about a year ago. So that episode didn't make the cut. So go to episode 208 on audio feed, you get the program for free. There's also a book on my website called the book on mental toughness, which includes the full live hard program. Plus a whole bunch of other chapters on mental toughness. Why it's important, why you need it and how it will change your life. The book is unnecessary. You don't have to buy it. I think you'll get tremendous value out of it. And if you want the program for no cost, you can get it for free at episode 208. We do have a fee for the show. The fee is very simple. You're going to notice that I don't run ads on the show and I'll stop the show to talk about things that I don't actually use just come getting paid. Sometimes I think I should do that because I could get a whole bunch of money or a little bit of work. But I think that's annoying. And so I don't do it. And so in exchange, I just ask very simply that you guys share the show. Now, you know, we get traffic throttled and banned and messed with, especially on the video platform that we post on. And I need your help in sharing the show. So if you think the show is good, if it intertangent, it makes you laugh, it makes you think. If it gives you a new perspective, if you learn some skills, which you're definitely will on Q and A apps, share the show. Don't be a hoe. Share the show. All right. What's up, man? I'm doing listen, feeling a little oppressed. Oh, yeah, I'm hoping that shit didn't like leap frog. What do you mean over the illness that's been floating around? What are you sick? I do. I've been having like this constant migraine. Yeah. This morning. And then like, like my body just feels a little weak, man. Really? That's weird. That's weird, man. It's like, you know, usually I don't really get sick that often because like it's like genetically bred to be strong. Okay. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Like 400 years of oppression. Yeah, man. Well, look, you know, there's pluses of mine to come with that. I guess we'll see what happens, man. This shit. Yeah, we'll see. I don't know much about that. You're only been here 200 years. Yeah. Well, fuck, I didn't come here until after all that shit. All right. I'm just gonna say that. Well, my family didn't come here until like 100 years ago. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. I've got to be able to act my dad. So what the family history is. Guys, let's get in with the show. Yeah. Let's do that. That sounds like a great idea. Let's move on. Let's move on. Oh, man. Guys, I do want to answer a question. I've been getting a bunch of questions. People keep asking me what's going on with me because I've been a little absent on social media. Guys, I was very sick for 10 days. As you can see, I'm looking pretty spelt. I'm at 238 pounds right now, which is the lightest I've been in probably 20 years. And what's going on with me is I got the flu. I worked through it. I stayed on 75 hard. I kept my rucks going. I got through it. And then I got hit with this intestinal situation. And we're not sure exactly what it is. But I was having a whole bunch of blood in my stool. All right. And we're going in for a procedure on Thursday to find out what exactly is going on. But it's apparently it's no big deal. But that's what's been going on. So my ruck street has ended. I'm very disappointed about that. I went 348 days, which is very close to the year that I set out. And when I figure out what's going on and I get back in the game, I'll decide if I'm going to attack that again or not. But that's what's going on with me. I feel pretty good. They said I think it's an ulcer or some sort of polyps or something. I did have a cancer screening because I know a lot of you guys are going to say, oh, fucking, I had a cancer screening like four or five months ago that came back negative. So I don't think it's anything too serious. And they don't either. But I do have to have a procedure on Thursday to figure out what's going on. I'll let you guys know. So for those of you asking about the ruck street, the ruck street has ended. But you know, there was nothing I could do about it. It is what it is. I couldn't. I could not do it. So that's where we're at. Yeah. I'm going to live the fight another day. I just want to look. I just want to I've been getting asked nonstop on the internet. You know, I'm spending less and less time on on social media guys pouring myself into my businesses and my day job and what I do. The internet's becoming so negative that it's hard for me to even spend time on it at all. So I'm just popping on here and there and dropping some gems for you guys. But outside of that, you know, I'm just doing what I do. So I'll keep you guys in the loop. Sweet. You know, we don't really do or cover celebrity gossip much. But I want to bring this up because it's actually a very interesting video. It doesn't end completely different how I thought how I thought it was going to go. But you see this with the newest newest thing with Kanye West. So he held on with Kanye West, grabs TMZ photographer's phone and goes off on her. And it's a great video. We got to watch it because I want you to see the end of it. And he really brings out a lot of the, you know, some of the shit we talk about on the show, just like, you know, people's this entitled belief people have with their opinions, you know, and it's a cool video. Let's check it out. Yeah. She's TMZ. She's TMZ. What do you feel like? It's okay. I'm a human being. All of these TMZ, this 30 miles on your sets and like, we're all this bullshit. I don't feel like we're talking about the same. I'm probably looking at shit asking that. You think the walkable like that? Would you think that you will bike them and you go walkable like that? And as she says, no, man, she hit like that. Ask me, you are my wife. Tell me, I do she get free will. Are you crazy? You ain't saying this is marital. You got free will or you work for the guy. You got free will, you work for TMZ coming. I'm a legend. You understand that? I'm here. This is a poor Charlie Wilson. You probably asked me some from that shit about my wife. That's about wife. You know what I'm saying? You wasn't asked me, she couldn't see my kids. When I could, do you have questions? You have questions when I was able to see my kids and that I only get visitation and don't have right to where they go to school. You got questions for that or you part of the system. You understand what I'm saying? Do you understand what I'm saying? You understand what I'm saying? What are you here? What are you here about that? If I just got to go up to every celebrity asking some dumb ass shit about their wife. No, tell me. Was it wrong for you to ask me about my wife? Some dumb ass disrespecting shit like that. Was that wrong or right? I'm sorry, I just need my phone. No, no, answer the question. I'm supposed to answer your question. Answer my question. I got your phone now. They're going to arrest me for taking your phone or arrest me for taking your phone. You answered a question. You asked me, did my wife have free will? Was that a dumb ass disrespecting question to come ask a grown ass superhero? Answer the question. What's your name? What is your first and last name I address? What are we doing? I just need my phone. Where is your phone? No, she came to me and said, just your wife have free will to speak she worked for TMZ. They've been by their own other. Yeah, how do you know I'm a miss? I don't know. What is her name? What is this lady's name? No, you're not just the reporter. What's your first and last name? They don't like it when it's her regular name. I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what they're paying you. Woo! That you snouted. Get a contract. Yes, I will. I will. I will. Appreciate it, Melanie. Thank you. Thank you, Guy. And he goes back. Goes on to do and you ain't shit. I mean bro, first of all, how famous are you? You can like wear a full fucking mask like that and people still know you. Yeah. And like you can do a full interview without your face showing and then just walk the fuck off and like look at the picture that guys taken. Like you guys can't see this on audio but these guys are like taking fan pictures and you can't even see the dude's face. Nope. Like. But you know the tune. Yeah, that's crazy. That's crazy. That's crazy. That's crazy. That's crazy. That's crazy. That's crazy. That's crazy. That's crazy. What do you got on this? Bro, I don't know. I think the culture of society and the internet is way out of hand. I mean, I think people feel entitled to details and whole people responsible for things they're not responsible for. I think people are scrutinizing and I would hate to be someone. I mean, bro, I've gotten a little bit of a taste of being a known person. Nothing to the level of what this man is. Right? Like he literally is a fucking icon. Super hero. Yeah. Yeah. This is where it's here. Which one is he? Yeah. Right. So, but you know, like dude, I feel that dude's frustration, man. You know, I've had people fuck with me. You know, I've had people show up at my house. I've had lots of people so much so that I got to spend seven figures a year on fucking security, bro. Like because people will just they don't have any boundaries. They don't have any respect. You know, the minute you don't serve them, you're a piece of shit. The minute you do something, they don't like your piece of shit. And this is why I do the only people that can do anything in real life are people that are like, well, fuck you. I don't give a shit because you can't care. You can't care what people think. You can't care what they say. And if you do, bro, they'll fucking burn you down. It's like a bunch of fucking like it's a bunch of irrelevant people that try to attack dudes like this for gossip and like, dude, imagine walking around being this famous and getting scrutinized to the point where like you're being asked if your wife is a fucking slave. Yeah. Like she have free what the fuck are you talking about? Like so like dude, people are probably going to yell at him and and make and say he's crazy for him reacting that way. But the truth is bro, how the fuck would you react? You guys can't. That's what I'm saying. Like there's no there's no filter. There's no borders. Bro, people don't take it into into account that this happens all the time. You know what I'm saying? Like bro, and like you have one rude interaction with someone like, you know, you don't give someone the time of day. You know, you don't like give them the time they expect. You could be nice as fuck, bro. You could be eating dinner. You could be at a public place and someone wants to come up to you and you give them, you know, you give them fucking one minute less than what they expect, bro. And then they go on the internet and talk all this shit about you. He's big shit. Yeah, he's not who he says he is. Bro, I'm a fucking dude trying to live my fucking life trying to eat. Yeah. Like holy shit, man. And like there's zero awareness with the internet or with people anymore because of social media. They think they can run up and stick a camera and somebody's fucking face and they got some power over them and they never had that power before. And like bro, ultimately at the end of the day, we have to have some awareness as people for this kind of shit because dude, if if the society continues to just because like dude 20 years ago before social media and wasn't like how it is now. Okay. Like yeah, you saw a famous person and like you might see you might be out to dinner one time in your life and see somebody who's truly famous and you're like holy fuck. There's fucking Sebastian Stallone, right? Like nowadays people see you everywhere you go. Like everywhere you go in public, bro, they see you. This is why I don't fucking go anywhere. Because like bro, I don't like that shit. I do like doing this part of it. I do like helping people. I do like sharing information and seeing people succeed. But the way that people react is it's so off putting that it like it makes you not want to do it. And the problem that we're going to have as a society if we keep this shit up and we don't call out when it gets ridiculous is that there's going to be nobody doing anything. Nobody's going to share anything with you. Nobody's going to be cool. Like you're not going to have anybody to look up to you. Just kind of a bunch of shit. Well that's the thing. It fucks it up for the people who are cool. Yeah. Yeah. Just want to, hey, it gets finally meet you in person. Yeah. And then it keeps the mood. Yeah, fuck it up for them. But like look dude, I get like one millionth of a percent of what's somebody like he gets. Yeah. And it's just like dude, I get it. Like I I'm surprised this dude hasn't like choked people. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like imagine walking down the street, bro. And someone walks up to you and just shoves a camera in your fucking face. As if you're wife a fucking slave. It's weird too because they know everything about you. You have no idea who they are. That's a whole another thing. I mean, fuck it. That's a whole another thing. Yeah. That's a whole another thing. You'll be sitting at dinner. How's the kids? Bro. Yeah. You've never seen this person before in their life ever. Yeah. And they know everything about you because they've seen you on the internet. Yeah. Like bro, there needs to be some awareness. And people will, the people will say, well that's what you get for putting yourself out there. Well, that shouldn't be that way. Yeah. Like we should have some respect. We should also have some grace. We should also realize that nobody out here is fucking perfect. And that there are people every single person, every single one of you and every me included in Kanye and fucking his wife and all these people, they all have other parts of their lives, right? And like the internet's become this thing where they try to expose people's fucking shit. It's got your moment. It's like bro. Yeah. Like if if you were the person being exposed, you wouldn't like that. You know what I'm saying? Like you have a clean closet really? Like you're all perfect. You have a clean fucking closet. Like you don't, you don't have anything. You don't want people to know. And bro, I'm a big believer in karma. I think that people that that have no line in the sit now do look, there's there's there's things that do need to be called out. There's things that are bullshit. There's things that are wrong. But like the way the internet behaves, it's going to it's going to it's going to eat everybody up and nobody's going to share shit. You know what I mean? Because dude, I'm telling you the juices and work the squeeze. It's not cool. So I feel for this dude. You know, I'm a Kanye fan, dude. People like Kanye. I have always like Kanye. I don't agree with everything he says or how he says it. I think some of the shit he says is insane. But I also think that he's a fucking genius in a lot of ways. And so like, like yeah, dude, just look at him. Like this dude, this dude, he gets, I don't know. I just wouldn't want to be him, dude. I feel bad for the dude. I think he's probably an awesome dude that is so sick of people that they're he's just like fuck you. You know what I mean? Like bro, I like watching that video, bro, he was two inches away from smashing that lady's face. I thought it was. Bro, for real, like they wouldn't end it though. It's like what's a salary I double it. Get their contact. Yeah, but in that, but that's just more of the thing. You know, like the reason that people I behave this way is so that they can get some money or they can get some cloud or they can say, look what I did. I got that guy. And bro, that's just not it's just not good. Now guys, jump in on this conversation. Let us know down in the comments, what you guys think on yay. And let us know man, what that being said. I mean, ultimately, there's some truth to the fact that if you're going to put yourself out there, you can't give a fuck. All right. And like you should anyway, because some fine print, the truth of the matter is most of the people that criticize you when you put yourself out there are people that you would see at a gas station and save yourself. Like what I always do is imagine myself in public and people set because people say a lot of fucked up shit to me. You know what I'm saying? Like I've done a lot of really good shit. And then like they don't like one thing or they don't like the delivery or they see a clip that's out of context or I curse too much or something, right? Or whatever. And they say, you know, that guy's this or he's a fucking piece of shit or he's this or he's that you guys don't fucking know me. You don't know how I live my mother fucking life. You don't know fucking idea. Actually, you have you see what the fuck I do when I share with you the things I share because I'm being I don't have to do this. Okay. I charge very little for what I do. You know what I'm saying? Like I've got one paid thing with RIT where I charge people monthly to learn 25 years of business experience. I think that's fucking fair. I'm not going to give it all to you for free. And by the way, I've got 300 episodes of the best entrepreneur podcast of all time that will always be free, which will set a base for anybody to win in business. I mean, we could go on and on. But like the point is you do one thing that people don't like and they're like, well, he's a fucking, he's taking advantage of people or he's the fuck are you talking about? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like you could do so much good and people will pick it apart and you have to you I just imagine people in the gas station. Like when I go to pay the gas station, I imagine like when I see the mean things that people say about me, which is every single fucking day of my life, I imagine the person I see that's in front of me on a Sunday morning, buying a lot of tickets in a 12 pack of bull wiser with their shitty ass fucking shoes rolled in and and looks like they just got up out of bed and they're buying a pack of marble lights and they turn around and me and say that. And that's how I that because dude, that's usually what it is. It's usually people who have nothing better to do. They just think they're going to get a bite of you. And when you're mega famous like fucking Kanye is bro, it's a gazillion times worse. And so like dude, you know, this is a lesson for anybody out there trying to really do something in today's day and age. Like you have to be willing to not take that shit to heart man. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Like there's things that you gotta there's things that will come along that you have to address. There's things that come along that you have to make changes and say, okay, well I can't do that. That's wrong. But you know, just the chirping, the bullshit chirping, you have to be willing to fucking look away. Yeah. Some of what you guys think. Jump down in the comments below. Let us know your thoughts on Kanye and with that being said, man, let's get into the show. Yeah. Guys, remember if you want to see any of these headlines, pictures, articles, links, videos, go to 80 for sell out.com. You guys can find them like there. That being said, let's get into our first headline. I got to talk about it. Head on to more and reads. Joe Biden is considering striking Iranian naval assets in the Persian Gulf in response to deadly drone attacks as Trump and GOP slam president for failure to deter Iran despite multiple warnings. This is a daily male article reading. Joe Biden is weighing up launching strikes on Iranian military assets in the Persian Gulf after three Americans were killed and Jordan by a Tehran backed drone. The president has demanded advisors present him with options on how to respond to the attack without dragging the US into battle in the Middle East political reports. Insiders reveal any revenge bombings will take taking place in the coming day. Days as the commander-in-chief and military brass study a range of targets. Fears of war were sparked over the weekend when an Iran-backed suicide drone killed three American soldiers at a remote base in their Jordan's border with Syria. The victims were named on Monday as a specialist Kennedy, Leyton, Sanders, 24-year-old, a specialist Brianna Maffet, 23, and Sergeant William Rivers, who is 46. Iran-backed militias calling themselves the axis of resistance has also launched more than 160 strikes on US targets since October 7th terror attack by Hamas. It comes as a delicate time for the White House with Biden not seen out and about on Monday after sparking health fears due to a bumbling speech in South Carolina. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has only recently returned to the office after going AWOL to have prostate cancer surgery. At least that's what they told us. Now here is spokesperson Kirby on his response at the White House. The president and the first lady as well as everyone in the administration send their condolences to the family of those who were killed. No blue star family ever wants to become a gold star family. And sadly, there are now three more families on that roster. It's hard to imagine the greets that they're feeling right now and that they will feel for the rest of their lives. These troops were conducting a vital mission in the region aimed at helping us work with partners to counter ISIS. And even as the Defense Department gathers more information about the attack, that mission must and will continue. The counter-ISIS mission is separate and distinct, indeed it has been long standing and unrelated to our efforts to support Israel and to prevent a wider conflict in the region. We do not seek another war. We do not seek to escalate. But we will absolutely do what is required to protect ourselves, to continue that mission and to respond appropriately to these attacks. Now it's interesting because we like receipts on this show. We all like receipt receipts. We got four plus years of receipts on this show. And I got some receipts of Joe Biden also. This is a tweet from the official Joe Biden account back in 2020. Let's be clear. Donald Trump does not have the authority to take us into war with Iran without congressional approval. A president should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people. That's interesting because that's exactly what the fuck he's about to do. It's exactly what he's about to do. So much so that you got people coming out of the woodworks who you would not expect. Did you see Joy Reads response on this? No. Oh you haven't seen this? So even MSNBC's Joy Re drops F-Bomb and hop mic moments seemingly blasting Biden starting another fucking war. Here's the clip. Over weekend president Biden said he's ready to take action if Congress is serious about solving the border issue. If that bill were the law today, I'd shut down the border right now and fix it quickly. And Congress needs to get it done. Another fucking war. Still trying to kill but deal. You see see that's the problem. That's how you know they're fucking shit. That's the problem. You got people on TV who are hiding their own personal views and their own personal opinions to deliver a message because they're being paid to deliver a fucking message. She is the fucking problem. And I could go on and on and on especially around the racist shit that she says. She's one of the most racist human beings on the fucking media of any like if any person of any other race talked about other races the way that that woman talks about them. They would be fucking black ball from everything. If you took a white person up there and said that shit about any other race, bro. That person would lose their job. They lose their bank account. They'd be docs. They oh dude. I mean dude. But see this is the problem. She can go on there with a blonde to pay and get away with it. Yeah but dude that's the problem. The problem is we live in the land of fucking propaganda. These people have no soul. They have no. Go ahead. No, I was about to you know what's interesting. This clip actually makes me loath her even more because that because she stands on there talking about how bro. Yeah. What she's saying and then what she's able to say off camera or where she thinks is not being picked up on my it makes me hate her even more. Yeah. Yeah. It shows it exposes her for the fucking vile piece of shit that she is. Fucking yeah. Fucking man coward. Bro, she's a piece of shit like bro. She says so much incredibly racist shit like dude. Listen, we as Americans have to get past this race bullshit. Okay. Nobody really gives a fuck what color your skin is real talk only fucking insane people that are on the far progressive left that are part of the programming even give a fuck about race or the NPCs that fucking are too dumb to think for themselves. You walk down the street. You see a black guy. You see an Asian guy. You see a white guy. They're all fucking cool man like this race baiting bullshit. They do this shit so that we all fight each other and we never get together and say dude they're fucking us all. She doesn't even believe that no she don't you know what I'm saying like but they'll go on there happily and fucking prop that bro. She's a piece of shit. Absolutely. Okay. And like I will I reserve that title for for I'm responsible my use of that title. Okay. She's passed that out like maybe that's right. She wins the fucking five star piece of shit award period. What are her trophy? Listen to yeah five stars of a big old fucking steaming pile of shit. That's what she is bro. She's she's a race baiter divider. She's the reason that we can all get together in the community and what's so fucked up bro is that it fucking ruins her family too. You know what I'm saying like she thinks she's insulated though. That's the problem. They think their part. She's been promised insulation and a few extra crumbs of the pie. She thinks she's insulated bro and when she doesn't understand bro listen history repeats itself. It's all I'm gonna say. History repeats itself. Yeah. But you know I do I believe that I believe that I believe that they continue down this path of division. There will eventually be a revolution in this country where the media is held accountable for what they're doing. It happens. I throw their manipula yeah and those in every other time in history of earth those people were killed. I'm gonna go first. And they're go dude the media in this country if they continue down that road they're going to and I think they're trying to inspire or incite violence because they want I think if I were them how I would think about it is okay we have the power now if we can get them to react violently now then we can squash it with our military and kill their main their main leaders or arrest their main leaders now and remove the resistance from our path. And by all accounts I think that's I think that's something that they talk about and think about in the backside. You know they want us to start fighting each other they want us to like bro you go back to George Floyd bro they tried so hard and they succeed in a lot of ways to get black people and white people to fucking dislike each other and bro we're still suffering from all of that. The good thing is I think a lot of people are waking up it's really cool to see people waking up but dude we have to get smarter in this we have to stop letting turds like this fucking divide us you know when we're all regular people man that would just want to be left to fuck alone. The psychological manipulation that's been happening on society from the last number of years is abuse it's fucking abuse we're not even allowed to peacefully exist we're not even allowed to like just live our lives at all we're constantly fucking propagated with division and hate and and stress and anxiety and dude it all plays into their narrative of keeping you on edge and keeping you stressed and sick and incapable of like doing anything it's just dude it's so frustrating dude and she bro this woman is fucking poison yeah yeah but you know I mean but but I mean here's the thing we we have three American soldiers that are dead Biden has yet to at the time of this recording he has yet to call those call the families of those fallen soldiers and said he just put out a tweet saying last night three US servicemembers were killed many one wounded during an unmanned aerial drone attack on our forces stationed in northeast Jordan near the Syria border Jill and I joined the families and friends of our fallen and grieving the loss of these warriors in this despicable and holy unjust attack have no doubt we will hold all those responsible to account at a time and a man and in a manner of our choosing well didn't I did I see this or not see this but didn't I see that the story was that the reason the drone was able to get through was because they thought it was a united is I might miss redness but they thought it was a united states drone returning yep so you're telling me with all this fucking radar technology and all this identification that we have and all this intelligence and all this surveillance we just accidentally thought that was one of our drones and we just led it in our space you see what I'm saying here like remember doesn't this kind of sound just like the intelligence reports that happened on October 7th where Israel was warned for literally type they believe 10 days from different fucking countries and intelligence when in Israel has the best intelligence of anyone that these attacks were coming and they ignored it and allegedly allowed it to happen doesn't this feel like that I'm just saying you know listen I do you really believe like honestly do you really believe with all like bro I've seen a fucking airplane radar screen right like everything on the radar has an identification number it's very clear we know our ship yes so we know what is what so you're telling me that the radar malfunction and it said that that was a US fucking drone coming back because the story they're telling does not add up to the technology that we have and anybody who's ever paid attention to any of the technology the only people that would believe this are people that are just like out there like not knowing shit you know what I'm saying so like people who still believe we went to the moon yeah it's a whole not people get pissed off by that one bro look people feel strongly about the moon not made it done baby you know I was gonna go to do you it's a little tin foil though but it is tin foil but look but here this though so I think it's interesting because I agree with you right I'm like saying like dude doesn't make sense doesn't make sense maybe they should explain how it happened a little bit more if that's how it happened a little bit more transparency right but I just thought this was interesting because you know right now the the the left they're losing the black vote right it's undeniable it's gone right um and just the day before this happened Biden was in South Carolina and visiting a black barbershops and visiting all these black people right went to one kid's house yeah right and he like I read this political article the hell I was you know Biden tells black yeah blacks that they're the reason he won the election you know I'm saying all of this stuff goes down and then the three service members read that the die they're all black I didn't realize that we need the he they need the justification for war they need the people's consent they need the people the I mean dude I don't know that that might begin a little this a little tin foil I mean how the fuck do they do that it's a little tin foil well I don't know man I mean I've seen videos on the internet we've all seen them where they like legit see a guy they're like there's the gap there's the guy there's Steve we're heads on for his yeah right and they fucking like dude just just like this thing I'm just saying no no no it's exactly like what Biden saying about what Trump did because what he's talking about is when he drone strike that guy from Iran you know and he came out in the middle of the night and he's like he died like a dog yeah we got him Abu Benchar Harari he died like a dog he died like a dog yeah which was fucking hilarious like the guy was a fucking piece of shit yeah I mean it is okay wait wait wait but but like dude if they could identify a single human like you're I mean it's possible I'm just saying my doesn't here's what doesn't okay it is a little tin foil but it's a little out there but it doesn't make sense to me that with our technology and our data and our information that a mistake like that happens no not in 2024 no not with our capabilities yeah like yeah dude right in fucking 1991 desert storm friendly fire made I don't even think then yeah it doesn't smell right bro no it doesn't man it doesn't it doesn't you know and here and but and here's the interesting thing too that people got to remember okay if we go into a war with with with Iran okay it is almost a 100% fact China will be get pulled into that as well right because China and Iran they're good friends they're good buddies they're in bricks I mean like that you gain breaking that up and so the problem that people we have to understand is that this is not just Iran hates us and they just know like we are funding all of these proxies attacks the United States our tax for dollars are funding these attacks right we're giving them the money to do this shit and then when they throw the stick at us we try to go attack them say look what they're doing we got to go to war with them right like we're doing this shit and they make all kinds of money well they give those guys make all kinds of money and all the peasant class which is us we send our sons and daughters to die for their fucking financial affairs no oh dude they got all the all the way and then by the way we remove our most resistant class which is our military class of men from society again like look at this dude why do you think we have general why do you think we have wars every generation the wars are not because we need to have wars the wars are so that these fuckers and government can take of the money make all the money and then also at the same time remove the most resistant class of citizen to their bullshit from society by sending them the reward of fucking die this would be going on for hundreds of years either a brawl or back at home when they get back here and we don't give them the support that they need here you know but like look at look at this fucking guy yeah we're in this picture on the screen of him with some these are just you guys yeah and they're drinking beers this fucking idiot it's got his hard head on backwards fucking moron and then you got clobachar whatever the fucker name is looking like she these people are so fucking fake it's disgusting like there's and those working class do you working class guys that fall for this shit you're dumb as fuck I'm sorry bro I don't even think those guys are real I'm just saying they don't do they like these people are not for you they're fucking canceling your fucking your whole entire industries yeah man yeah man bro the idea that Democrats in general are for the working class that's 30 years ago it's 30 years Jimmy Hoffa baby yeah that's yes that's fucking 50 years ago these people are I don't know that the Republicans are that much for it either but like bro the bottom line is it's not Republican or Democrat bro we need some youthful leadership we need some unity on the ground we need our men in America to stand the fuck up and say we're not letting a bunch of elderly senile corrupt pieces of shit ruin our lives anymore and that's only gonna come from us becoming formidable opponents meaning we take care of ourselves we get ourselves ready we fucking aren't afraid of them we speak up we stand up we don't cower and that's got to happen that's got to start with the American men right now you know there's still all these American men that say all this shit like fuck around and find out bro they've been fucking around and they ain't finding out you see what I'm saying yeah we got to fuck our men have to grow up and realize that dude it's time to add a bare minimum stand up and speak up and get together regardless of race regardless of social class regardless of where you come from or what your political views have been regardless of anything and realize that if we don't come together as men and stand up against what's happening in this country we are going to fucking lose our country your kids are gonna grow up in a communist slave system that is real shit and that's not Democrat or Republican this is a communist insurgency that has infiltrated our government mostly on the Democrat side with uniparty people on the Republican side as well it's not just left or right it's not just Democrat Republican there are people who are with the system and who aren't with the system and that's fucking it that's all there is it's it's not we have to stop being tricked to think that it's one side or the other it's not bro there's people on both sides that are part of this what's going on it's a big fucking problem dude and we we we the we the men of America need to get our shit together like immediately no yeah jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think uh speaking of comments let's head to them let's go cruise um uh this comment comes from at Kara LTO LTO L2 IO yeah let's check it out uh leave a comment for the algorithm and sharing it on WhatsApp if I knew about your content a little bit earlier I would have stopped being a bitch and been the man my family needed before they left thank you so much bro where did they go no no no no well listen man this is goes with the message I was saying a minute I appreciate the comment but like look guys like and this is not about just you know talking tough and this is about like becoming a grown man this is about taking responsibility for your life this is about realizing that your voice and your actions matter this is about realizing that you're setting an example and your life tells a story and that everybody around you regardless of who they are is observing that story happening in real time and whatever people have seen and observed they will they will mimic and dude the problem in this country is that everybody thinks it's everybody else it's not everybody else it's you and if you don't take care of yourself how can you expect the country to change so that everybody bitches about society and talks about how shitty society is and how society needs to change but nobody realizes that they are society nobody realizes that it starts with them and our actions and how we live as human beings that's where the revolution of culture starts and until people grow the fuck up and stop thinking that being a man is just having some tattoos or fucking you know whatever the fuck you think it is it's about being a good human being bro it's about standing up when you're scared it's about saying things that you think are gonna get you you know backlash it's about it's about being a fucking man dude you know what I'm saying and like dude we have a more than a big problem in this country with men it's a big fucking problem you guys have let everybody convince you that you're useless and that your shit doesn't matter and dude men really do have the short end of the stick and but it's because you let it happen okay you let it happen because you don't stand up for yourself and you don't become what it is you know you need to become if you how can you want the country to be better and how can you expect the country to get better if the country is made up of individuals and you're an individual that is refusing to get better if you're not going to do it then who the fuck is going to do it it's you every single one of you listening it's fucking you the reason this country sucks is you because you're not the example that you could be and that goes for me too I lived a big part of my life as way less than what I could have been now and dude am I perfect absolutely not I'm not gonna stand up here on some pulpit and talk about how I'm the perfect fucking example I'm not I try really fucking hard though and I think all of you know that and we have to all try really hard we have to stop looking around and saying it's somebody else's fucking responsibility or some ballot box is gonna fix the problem the reason America's week is because the fucking men are weak in this country that's real shit and if you don't like it fuck you because it's the truth you got to do better I got to do better we all got to do better that's and that has to happen fast so like I appreciate the comment but you guys got to understand bro we can't fix society when society is made up of individuals if we're not going to start fixing the individual which is you we have an obligation to be the best that we can be you have an obligation to set that standard there is a responsibility as a citizen of the United States whether you believe it or not to be the best version of yourself people have died for that people have died for your right to fucking do that they didn't die for you to sit around on a fucking couch consuming people shit on YouTube fucking being a piece of shit waste in your whole life it's a real obligation dude and there was a time and place in this country where men fucking knew that and that's something that has to get back and it starts with the men now you guys have been fucking off you've been fucking allowing yourself to fucking get distracted you've been believing that someone else was gonna come fix your shit and I think it's becoming very clear that no one's coming so until all of you men start standing the fuck up and setting an example and speaking your mind and getting engaged we're gonna fucking continue to lose that's the bottom line and you're you're not just gonna lose you're fucking the country like you don't even understand how bad shit's gonna get you're gonna lose everything because this shit is gonna fall apart you're not your kids are gonna have no chance I can't imagine if you're a grown man right now sitting around not saying shit about what's going on not standing up being way less than what they can be physically being a fucking NPC dumbass why their kids sit there and play with their Legos or play with their video games and like how do you not connect the dots that if you don't become what the fuck you're supposed to become that kid's gonna fucking suffer from it I don't understand how the fuck people aren't connecting those dots how that doesn't compete yeah they say I can't speak up I have kids no that's the reason you should I can't do this because I have kids I have shit no that's the reason you should and that's a fucking real responsibility of the men in this country dude I'm not talking to the women I'm talking to the fucking man all the women want to say well the women too fine you could join in but right now we have a problem with the fucking man and you women if you really want to fix it start encouraging your men to fucking be man and that doesn't mean going to some man camp it doesn't mean getting a fucking bunch of tattoos it means being a good motherfucker bro it means being personally excellent it means trying to do the right thing when you can do it it means setting a good example for people around to see it means treating people right it means earning income it means setting a fucking standard for what success in this country should and could look like if you just applied yourself a little bit that's what I'm talking about here I'm not talking about perfection I'm not talking about some pastor on a stage talking about how you need to fucking I'm not talking about that I'm not telling you you should that you have to do this or go to church every fucking Sunday or are fucking you know like like bro you're free but you gotta try you know what I'm saying like this isn't some conservative right wing message this is this is a message to the fucking you and here's the thing you get rewarded for that your life gets better you make more money you become more fit you feel better about yourself now you're setting a good example for everybody around you everybody around you sees that and they say well what did he do to do that and then they do it and if we got everybody in society to fucking get along with that and to get on that shit bro what the fuck would this look like what would the country look like bro if we could get every single American man to buy into that mentality for real and stop this idea that Donald Trump or Joe Biden or fucking whoever we vote for is sewing to somehow a safe they're not going to save us man these people are not saving us they're not going to save you even if the best president which I think I'd be the best all right let's be real but that's just me I'd vote for you okay but even if we have the very best president that made all the right fucking moves bro you're still going to be fat you're still going to be suffering you're still going to be drinking and fucking watching all kinds of porn and smoking all kinds of weed every fucking day and by the way I'm not saying you can't drink and I'm not saying you can't smoke a little weed but what I am saying is you should have your shit together and you don't and the reason that we suffer in this country is because too many fucking men put the responsibility of everything in society on to other men. Shit man. It's real shit bro. I don't want to see it bro listen I'm not talking about perfection bro I am the least perfect human being on the fucking planet okay but I do try hardest fuck to the point of where it drives me mentally insane and causes me physical problems okay but I try and dude what if we just all tried what if we just fucking tried we wouldn't have the problems we have here man you guys won't even talk up because you don't want somebody to criticize your political fucking opinion this is America motherfucker people can disagree with you you can't you don't feel strongly enough about your opinion that you can defend it or are you just so weak and so pussy that you you want you want to just pass it along and say I don't want to fuck with that now I let I let Andy and DJ talk about it yeah right exactly man I'll let you a rogue and talk about him I let fucking I let fucking whoever talk about it I let the guy those people handle it bro the reason your life sucks the reason it's so hard the reason that you can't make your fucking bills connect from fucking dude it's because you keep passing the responsibility on other people you know what I'm saying like we're we're run by a bunch of criminals dude we're run by people that are not of the people for the people or by the people if we're being honest that's who we're run by and they're making it impossible for the average American to fucking thrive which is supposed to be what this country is about freedom doesn't mean sitting on your ass and being a fucking loser freedom means the ability to go after something create something build something becomes something and that used to be well known in this country until that's well known again by the men especially we will continue to flounder we will continue to suffer and eventually we're gonna reach that critical point where there's no turning back and I think our generation is I'm talking about the men from 20 to fucking 50 right now it is our time to grow the fuck up and become leaders and become fearless fucking examples of what it looks like to be an American man well guys let's uh let's keep this cruise moving let's head over to headline number two headline number two reads my orcas slashes out at baseless GOP allegations ahead of key impeachment votes this guy uh this guy's about to get kicked out it is what it is this is a five piece of shit as he should get him and joy reader they are equal I would say may work is even worse yeah let's say he has power what's in a metrophy yeah anyway let's hear it I won't interrupt I'm still wound up bro I

serious be a good example in your household that shit matters bro and I'm you don't have to be perfect nobody's perfect with fuck we got a fucking try man just aggravating anyway sorry nah I get it man so yeah this is a Fox News article reading Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro my orcas on Tuesday took aim at what he called quote-unquote baseless and false allegations leveled against him by House Republicans ahead of a key vote on impeachment articles in the house Homeland Security Committee quote I assure you that your false accusations do not rattle me and do not divert me from the law enforcement and broader public service mission to which I have devoted most of my career into which I remain devoted my orcas said in a lengthy letter to House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green the committee is meeting to advance two articles of impeachment against my orcas accusing him of refusing to allow to follow immigration law and of breaching public trust a vote is expected later today likely along party lines moving the articles to a House vote at a future date my orcas's letter comes after Republicans have traded barb with Democrats and the administration over the impeachment push against the Biden cabinet secretary who Republicans have accused of a quote dereliction of duty in his handling of the ongoing and historic crisis at the southern border migrant numbers officially hit 300 2000 in December a new record after 2.4 million encounters in fiscal year 23 Republicans have said that large releases into the interior in a rolling back of Trump era policies have fueled the crisis Greens majority began investigating my orcas's handling of the border crisis last year and this month have held hearings on the impeachment articles that were sent by the House last year those articles accused my orcas of having quote repeatedly violated laws enacted by Congress regarding immigration and border security and of having quote made false statements to Congress that the border is secure and closed and that DHS is an operational control of the border literally every time he got up there to talk he lied everything that came out of his mouth has been a lie like I mean just bold face fucking mind that's what these people do so yeah man so the vote should be done here probably within the next hour or so and remove to a vote but this border thing going down down in Texas right now it's all crazy but here here's an interesting thing so our buddy KJP I call a KGB it's appropriate it's appropriate um they got they stumped her why isn't it racist for Biden to threaten to close border so you guys remember like you know when Trump is like I'm gonna shut the border down right and how everybody called him xenophobia and yeah that's racist yeah which was bullshit well Biden said the exact same thing and he's a hero so of course a reporter in the newsroom asked her and let's hear her response get Michael back in the winter of 2018 and the spring of 2019 president Trump out to shut down the border with Mexico using almost the identical language that the president used on Friday uh many many it's not most about practically all Democrats called that xenophobic and either racist why shouldn't people make the same conclusion about this president's threat to shut down the entire border with Mexico so we believe the new enforcement tools uh that currently don't exist that will be uh we believe that will be part of this bipartisan agreement uh will be fair we believe it'll yes it'll be tough but it will be fair but he didn't say he wanted to use excuse me sorry he didn't say I would on day one I will use enhanced enforcement to improve the processing of people at the border he said I will shut the border down which which suggests a total rejection of all people attempting to cross the border without without a visa or without without proper authorization which you know stands in contravention to decades of international and u.s law um that that governs the movement of people around the globe and the refugees and asylum system yeah no I am thing that Trump can understand your question what I'm saying to you the new enforcement tools right that we believe that do not currently exist that will be part of this bipartisan agreement there's there are different there are different definition right of what that looks like of what actually shutting down the border looks like right so we're going to let them work through it we don't know what that looks like exactly right what we are asking for with the president wants to see is that we deal with the challenges at the border right that we have an opportunity to deal with what's going on the security and make sure that we have the funding and the resources to deal with what we're seeing at the border they're going to see a piece of shit she also gets the trophy um but here's the thing so this is all hinging on this this this bipartisan quote unquote bipartisan border bill here's the issue with this guys and this is why everything is getting held up it's because Biden is mandating that they include money and aid that goes to Ukraine in some of talking another one hundred and ten billion dollars that's what's holding this all up and and dude why they they and while they don't say any of this to the American people like these all of these people are criminals bro they are criminal fucks because what's happened they're stealing our fucking money and sending it overseas while you fucking starve and you won't say anything about it and they fucking smirk they sit up there and smirk look at this fucking guy bro listen this is fucking treason what they're doing okay they are intention I watched a little documentary on on these two kids I can't figure their names I watched it though um they I didn't watch the actual documentary I watched them be interviewed about their documentary they went down to the beginning of like uh central america somewhere and then they they migrated the whole entire route up to the border with the migrants and along the way they asked and it bro it's crazy because like all the this is all funded by money that comes from our country and they expose this okay all these NGOs that's the biggest question they're feeding fuck to these people go they walking here but they're along the way there's like pit stops yeah or I didn't know this I was fucking watching this and I was like shocked there's pit stops along the way where these people are fed and like treated and like yes and it's funded by American fucking dollars bro okay and and there's there's a whole thing all right and along the way they ask the groups of people they say who's for president trump or Biden every single one of them Biden Biden is the best why not trump because trump doesn't want us in america trump's anti-immigration so these people are legitimately holding the border open because they understand that the american people are done with their shit they do not want them in power anymore and so their solution that is not to say hey we need better policy we need better solutions for the american people their solution is say fuck the american people we'll just bring in more people so they're bringing in millions upon millions upon millions of people that they plan on making citizens or allowing to vote to make up the difference between the people who used to vote for them that no longer believe in their policies how is that not fucking treasonous behavior how is that not against the interests of the american people how is that they are destroying our cities they are they're taking our tax dollars that we all work very hard to fucking earn and they are feeding these people while we have millions of americans that are fucking struggling and our homeless and fucking all over the country because they want to maintain power instead of saying hey our policies are bullshit we need to fix that so that we can get back in power it's the most anti-american shit ever the people don't like it let's get new people yes that's exactly correct how is that not fucking treasonous behavior bro look at what's happening look at the crime look at the foot listen to the black communities bro if you're in a black community or you're black american how does this not infuriate you like they've used you for 60 fucking years for votes they've convinced you that the other side is the source of all the problems and they're going to fix it and they come to you every two years every four years every six years and say we're gonna fix it because they're fucking it up and then when you finally realize that they're fucking it up they say we're gonna bring in some new people of color from other places to replace you how does that not infuriate the black american communities i think it is i mean they're definitely up bro like listen bro i see it i do see it but they what they say they'll say shit like this well yeah but fucking Trump's worse know the fuck he isn't and by the way i don't think listen we need new leadership we need youth we need new ideas we need unity this this fucking this or that the shit has to stop so i'm gonna say that but in today's choices of what's likely going to happen we cannot say that Biden is a better choice these people are fucking criminals bro and they're pushing the most disadvantaged people which they created the disadvantages for those people out of the fucking way to maintain power so they continue to fucking steal our fucking money bro to be a whole brand new welfare state they're stealing our money bro they're these people are getting rich you should not be allowed to get rich when you're in the fucking government that's service bro it's insane wow people need to wake the fuck up and this guy should go to fucking prison for his entire life and that's being very nice because if it were me it'd be worse way worse than that yeah way fucking worse than that but i'm gonna say it prison because you guys don't fucking get it whatever the consequences are for that that's what stepping i've already said what i would do in that i put these motherfuckers heads on stakes for a hundred years so that everybody remember what it looks like to fuck that people over you're gonna come to government and you fuck people over you don't act in their interests your head ends up on a motherfucking stake i'm not saying you can't have different ideas i'm not saying you can but when you start doing corrupt shit and you start acting in your interests and you start fucking impoverishing your people that you're supposed to represent the head goes on the stake and it stays there forever so everybody knows what the fuck is allowed and what's not allowed well 100% man guys jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know what you guys think let us know that being said let's move to our next segment brought it back just for some that'll move me up on this time oh you definitely bump up a little cool for sure all right gotta improve my rankings just bring him back a little segment uh just leaving this here uh this is where i put something up in the 80 can't say shit about it uh just leaving this here uh this was in august of 2023 UPSS drivers to make a hundred and seventy thousand dollars in paying benefits following union deal and today UPSS last 12,000 jobs and cost saving move as workers ordered to be in office five days a week i'm gonna say something so i'm gonna fail this segment this is what you guys don't understand they trick the the the people who are working class into believing that they're going to earn all this extra money they say we're gonna pay a twenty dollar minimum wage we're gonna pay this all started with fifteen dollar minimum wage right now it's twenty dollars now it's now it's a hundred seventy thousand dollars a year drive goddamn truck okay fucking let's be real all right they promise them all this shit to get them to go along with it to vote they say hey look dude you vote for for us this is the kind of stuff we do and these people don't understand economics and they don't understand how companies are running they don't understand that you cannot actually do that because companies don't have the ability to just print fucking money out of their assholes okay so then what happens is they get all these people to vote for this shit and then that's what happens you lose your job or they automate the shit and then you have no job and then they say oh well you i'm getting universal basic income yeah you're getting three grand a month bro you're fucking broke you're starving you can't feed your family how's that utopia mm-hmm like we have to get smarter so sorry i failed the second that's i just leaving that there you got fucking fifteen dollar minimum wage dumb fucks for the last and by the way it's it's here's my biggest issue bro McDonald's is making restaurants with no people in them that's my thing bro my good McDonald's is in a real job the fuck it is in bro like bro you you got to do what you got to do when you're getting started it's not meant to be a mother fucking career that's my thing like that McDonald's is not meant to support a family of four that's not meant for that no it's meant for the high school dude on fucking summer break working his way through shit you know or the party the old lady that retired already this is the act of the almost shit I had to do that I didn't want to do for money you know let's add like 20 bucks 20 bucks when I was coming up okay like I do a lot of shit I didn't want to fucking do yeah and then you increase your skills set you become more valuable in the workplace yeah it's turned into 40 bucks yeah that's right which is now like 10 bucks because of Biden's inflation that's right guys just keep this cruise move think I have line number three let's bring it back home and saying Lewis baby saying Lewis make us noise yeah it always sounds like gunshots and Cory Bush just as department investigating Democratic representative Cory Bush for misuse of funds I think we didn't we cover this before yeah this is a new thing no so like before it was like yes she's doing this shit now that she's hired like her boyfriend yeah yeah yeah her boyfriend was like a security guy yeah yeah what okay yeah yeah but I want you I want to walk through this so this is a CNN article and I was shocked to see they even covered it but it's everywhere so the Department of Justice has launched a full blown investigation on Cory Bush this is awesome it's good to hear what she did was fucked up I will say this it's low-hanging fruit compared to what the people like Nancy Pelosi and shit have done right nonetheless wrong is wrong this she deserves to go to prison right okay but look how CNN covers it CNN first of all they don't list a dollar amount at all anywhere in the entire fucking article right so was it ten bucks she misused or was it ten billion dollars she misused they didn't list a dollar amount anywhere in the entire article bro all right they're covering for it it was a soft pitch article the Justice Department is investigating Democratic representative Cory Bush of Missouri for misuse of funds a senior congressional source with knowledge and a source familiar with the probe told CNN after the DOJ subpoenaed the House Sergeant at Arms Monday for documents related to the matter separately two law enforcement sources told CNN the investigation is targeting Bush who is the subject of a corruption probe according to the source familiar with the probe the subpoena involves the misuse of funds surrounding security Bush confirmed in a statement that the Justice Department is reviewing her campaign spending on security services and says she is fully cooperating with the investigation quote first and foremost I hold myself my campaign in my position to the highest levels of integrity Bush said in the statement quote I also believe in transparency which is why I can confirm that the Department of Justice is reviewing my campaign spending on security services we are fully cooperating in this investigation and I would like to take this opportunity to outline the facts and the truth Bush maintained she has not used any federal tax dollars for personal security services and that she complied with House rules Bush further explained she retained her husband's security services quote because he has had extensive experience in this area and is able to provide the necessary services at or below a fair market price the Justice Department declined to comment and the House clerk on Monday read a letter on the floor from the Sergeant of Arms informing the chamber of the subpoena quote the office of the Sergeant of Arms for the House of Representatives has been served with a grand jury subpoena for documents issued by the U.S. Department of Justice the clerk said reading from the letter quote after consulting with the Office of General Counsel I have determined that compliance with a subpoena is consistent with the rights and privileges of the House what what she really do we're talking three quarters of a million dollars of taxpayer dollars in winter husband got to call it what it is all right and this is for her security protection while she was going around Missouri I thought we covered this we did again I just got worse no it's out there but now they're officially launching the investigation so she's going to go to jail has she made a statement yeah that was her statement that she she confirmed the investigation is real the probes real she said has she made a defense yet uh yeah well that the only defense is that she said uh she said uh she's maintained that she did not use any federal tax dollars for personal security services even though not only is that a lie she admitted that she did yeah way back in 21 when we covered it on the show um and that uh she says that her husband security services she yet she retained them because uh quote because he had had extensive experience in this area which is a lie uh the dude never owned a security comes right we check that on the show yeah yeah yeah um and is able to provide the necessary services at or below a fair market rate now again I mean like I said dude it's low hanging fruit man but um I'm glad it's finally coming it took a long enough you know um what do you think so let me ask you a question so if you were to guess what her defense will be that's wrong photo oops and you guys are missing out if you don't watch this shit on YouTube it's crazy that most people still listen to audio yeah like you know what I'm saying like it's so like dude like 90% I'm gonna say it's like 95 yeah yeah you guys are missing out on YouTube man all right but anyhow that's cool um doesn't it right it does it does it does very similar I can't even tell the difference that's the fact the poster I think there's rules against alien serving in our congress um so let me ask you this what when this comes down and if she gets indicted which she should what do you think her defense will be at that point oh oh you guys can't do this to me I'm black I'm a black woman I was the first black woman to be black and a woman that's and I'm innocent that's that's racist DJ you know that though there's no to be our defense man of 1000% no it's like that Claudine Gay lady that got caught lying about her whole fucking academic history and then it's racism fannie willis who's fucking the prosecutor this you can't you can't you can't have black women like bro you know what's cool it's a fucking shit man yeah you know what's cool though it's people ain't buying it no more now nobody gives a fuck I told you this would happen remember back in 2020 when we were talking about all this shit and I don't know if it was on the show or off the show but I remember talk I think it was on the show where like when when I said I said they're overusing the defense of I'm a minority and I'm black and eventually it's gonna stop working no matter what you're overusing calling people racist and eventually it's gonna stop working like dude rate and that's a problem bro because dude if there is a real situation of racism how are we going to identify it now can't solve the problem bro you can't solve it hold on if you can't talk about it well I'm just saying like it's all yeah but I'm just saying now cases of real racism are going to go unchecked yeah because of the year huh the three that happened a year well that mean that's that's that's up for argument I think there's I think there's real racism but I think racism goes both ways you know the idea that racism only goes towards black people is a lie that's what that's what I was talking about okay well that's a lie that's a flat out lie okay because there's tons of examples that you can point to in society and if you point them out you know you're a racist right but the reality is is like racism is any sort of discrimination whatsoever towards anybody for their race and it doesn't just apply to certain races it applies to everybody and so racism is everywhere but how are we going to and it's almost and it's almost it's almost good that this has happened because now you can't identify it so if you can't identify it then is it a real thing does it even exist or are we just looking at people and say you do a fucked up shit because that's cool with that that's where we need to be cool with that dude the race should not play a part in someone's judgment yeah you didn't get this probe Corey Bush because you're you're a black woman you got this probe because you're a piece of shit now in all fairness we're speculating but I will make you a wager which you're you're gonna play the card yeah oh he's going to play that card yeah no that's not she's playing this is discrimination against me because I'm black and I'm from I'm from I'm from and I've done so much from my city yeah you haven't got shit you ruined our city you just took the dollars to pay your husband yes three quarters of a million dollars she's a terrible human being a piece of shit man yeah she gets a trophy this this show was full of trophies bro passing this shit out yeah yeah what was that thing she got caught talking about she got caught talking about something on camera recently which was hilarious like they were asking her questions she knew nothing about she knew nothing yeah yeah I was a good one and then the reporter like fucking spanker and she was like well you know that's not exactly what I meant I meant it like like bro she's so fucking off base and unqualified to be representing anyone like this woman was a street organizer for black lives matter the only reason she's up there is because in 2020 people were hysterical that was about race that was a hot topic she was the person who was out in the street with the megaphone saying crazy ass shit that was her and she's a fucking member of congress now that's insane that makes sense but that's not what we're talking about from the people that ain't that ain't it that's not it man guys tell us what you guys think jumping on this conversation down in the comments let us know that being said let's get to our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up we're dumb as fuck this is what we bring a headline up we talk about it and we get one of those two options and I gotta go for you all right you like I know you like animals you like dogs Keith like cats this headline reads a woman in china has decided to leave her 2.8 million dollar fortune to her dogs and cats and nothing to her children this is interesting so a wealthy woman in china has decided to leave her 2.8 million dollar fortune to her pets and her three children will get nothing say say reports the woman from Shanghai with the surname Lou decided to cut her children out of her will because she felt they neglected her in her old age and did not visit when she was ill the South China Morning Post reported citing song long news meanwhile her beloved pets cats and dogs remained by her side she said her dramatic decision was greeted positively by some Chinese people online quote well done if my daughter treats me poorly in the future I will also leave my house to others once it does unclear how old the woman is but the report describes her as elderly her will now dictates that the money must be spent on her pets in their offspring after she dies per the report as it is not legal in china to leave the money directly to the animals a local veterinary clinic will be responsible for the pets and be the administrator of the inheritance an official from the eastern china branch of the china will registration center said they told Lou there were risk in putting the pet clinic in charge of all her money according to the South China Morning Post quote we told auntie Lou that if her children change their attitude toward her she could always alter her will again the official said now this is not the first case so there's apparently a German shepherd named gum through the third who inherited 65 million dollars from his German countess owner making him the richest dog in history um yeah so they'll load it man I'm happy to see that you know because like dude I know when people pass and they got pets and shit like this could have turned way south for those those uh they're gonna end it up as that stir fry turbo huh yeah what the fuck are they eating that what is that meow meow is that is that hard to tell they're gonna win way south for them but um they probably will anyway they're not they're not gonna let these animals reproduce if the offspring continue to get the money yeah yeah no the make them sterile they're gonna make the vaccine or something no bro they're gonna make them the barbecue that is what it is bro yeah meow it's you know like bro there's in other countries man it's normally cats and dogs it's normal shit yeah yeah what's the way to shit you've ever eaten like you ever eaten like cune or no I ate horse one time okay and it where you yeah i mean you're up yeah yeah that's a doubt look us you over there i mean it was it was it was just fucking yeah yeah yeah i mean it wasn't nothing brag about i ate pigeon one time too pigeon back yeah pigeon over over in Europe uh they do like like a little habachi thing like at the dinner table sometimes like i guess they do that here too there we got habachi sure but at home do you have 21 have you ever seen it someone's home uh botchi in their house yeah like like dude have you ever been to a dinner at someone's house where they have like a table top habachi like like like like a black stone like eight like 18 inches long by like 12 inches wide right and you all have like raw meat grill it and sit there and talk and eat yeah so that's what the that's what it was like and pigeon was one of the things and i ate some it wasn't terrible taste like checking yeah and one bad so i like listen i'm not a post of trying anything i'll try anything once yeah i'm not doing crickets no i won't no no no no no no fucking bugs and shit bro like that's come on yeah no bugs all right what we give them link link i mean uh shit that was i'm sorry what we getting loose you get into the dog man don't be an asshole yeah you know if your kids are an asshole don't give them shit take care of your people i think i think i think i think there should be no such thing as a heritance at all hmm i think there should be no such thing so when does it go i don't have to think about that i think there's gotta go somewhere yeah but i think that like i think a lot of people waste their whole lives waiting for an inheritance like they count on it yeah so they live like shitty you know if you knew that you weren't getting shit no matter what you live a different way see i feel like i wouldn't tell like if i had a big fucking inheritance i'm not gonna tell my daughter that i have it you know what i'm saying like she'll just like she'll learn like the contact when she's like 18 by the way you know that's too young bro think of all the shit you're gonna learn well she'll know about it but she can't access it yeah but i don't think that's even the act knowing you have access to it bro i've known too many people who have who are inheritance people like trust fund kids yeah who are exceptionally wealthy like they were left a lot of money i know a lot of people like this and they didn't do shit up until like like they were 50 like when they got it they were 50 or something they didn't just shit until they were 50 years old then they got the money and then they just started buying shit that's wild yeah but bro that's not a life like you waste a lot of your life like well they lose all that i'm sure huh i mean depends on what you get yeah you know that's not sustainable bro no i just i don't know i don't you know i don't have that all worked out of how it worked but i mean the idea that you're going to get to a certain age and receive something i think stifles people's journey of life that's the point i'm making i like that though yeah that's real shit man you know a lot of people sit around they're like i don't have rich parents fuck you're lucky dude because now you get to go out and learn some shit and go on a journey you know what i'm saying that's real shit man yeah and in a normal country like a normal america that when it's not the way it is right now and even if it is the way it is right now it's still hot like there's people every day on the internet like out there in the real world building amazing companies and amazing businesses every single day like it's still it's still an awesome place to succeed yeah there's still you know i do want to say that like i talk about how fucking shitty it is but the reason i'm what i mean in context of that is like it could be so much better so much better it's yeah so much better bro and it's still pretty good it's just these people are fucking it they're squeezing too much juice out of the people you know what i mean people should be able to keep most of the money that they you know i believe that taxes should be 10% if everybody paid 10% there was no bullshit every company every individual paid that there would be no fucking poverty bro like there is now no there wouldn't be yeah people wouldn't have to kill themselves you know to fucking survive you know that that dude it's really hard for people in the in the beginning of the journey right now it doesn't have to be that hard and the reason it's real hard is because people keep believing these idealistic liars who paint this picture that they're going to somehow make them rich for voting for the you know the democrats to quite honestly do know um but even if even if you vote for them forever your whole life and we can see this in multiple different areas of the demographic what have they actually done for people nothing they made it worse and and this is not a republican democrat thing it just so happens that right now that's the message of those people so well guys Andy that's all i got yeah don't be a whole truth or the show
